broad blunt featured face long arm large hand foot clumsiness in movement be to of nature of constant nightmare be only with francis ease that solitary presence gave when be occupied with music that wholly lost self consciousness in respect seemed to that must be a repulsive to others a be to be distorted view of case plain without doubt be of heavy ungainly build belief in finality of

if not like one of like exceedingly well dressed young man who demanded of tailor utmost of art with prospect owing to michael generosity of being paid to morrow michael when cousin have left did not at once proceed to evening by with piano though hour before have longed to be alone with pianoforte arrangement of meistersingers of have promised complete perusal that evening francis visit have already distracted found now that francis departure took even farther away from designed evening francis with good look gay spirit easy friendship perfect content except when small matter of deficit

longer except for momentary twinge have bitterness for afternoon be true there have be one such when francis gleeful with cheque have gone out to dinner theatre dance inviting cheerfully to of in just have be bitterness namely that francis have so overflowing well spring of content that must be cordial in bidding cast certain gloom over entertainment michael knew quite unerringly that francis friend must not enjoy quite so much if be with there must be restraint of polite conversation at dinner instead of completely idle babble there must be le outspoken normality at gaiety little more decorum about whole of boyish proceeding knew so well so terribly well servant have come in with evening paper implied suggestion of propriety of going to dress before roused decided not to dress a be

undoubtedly have extended right to stopping of train for wife son wisely reserved for lest must lose prestige there be sufficient glory already to probe mind to bottom for lady ashbridge in being wife be sufficient also for michael that be son may be inferred that there be touch of pomposity about admirable gentleman who be so excellent landlord so hard working member of british aristocracy pomposity must be far too superficial word to apply to must not adequately connote deep abiding essential conviction that on one of day of creation probably on decree be made that there must be light there leaped into being great landowner of england lord ashbridge though peer by mean accepted peerage en bloc a representing english aristocracy to be in phrase one of implied that belonged to

seemed scarcely possible to consider accidental be closely connected with for one be sister other only son ground of potentiality in respect can be easily stated barbara comber sister so one of have married extremely wealthy american who in lord ashbridge view must not be considered one of anybody at in other word imagination failed to picture whole class of people who resembled anthony jerome have hoped when sister announced intention of taking deplorable step that future brother in law must at rate prove to be snob have vague notion that american be snob thus mr jerome must have saving grace to admire toady mr jerome showed sign of doing anything of sort treated with austere distant politeness that lord ashbridge must not construe a being founded on admiration sense of own inferiority for be so clearly founded on dislike that however did not annoy lord ashbridge for be easy to suppose that poor mr jerome knew better barbara annoyed for not only have shown renegade in marrying man who be not one of with advantage have enjoyed since birth of knowing what be gloried in new relation saying without proper reticence about matter that be real people whose character wit vastly transcended anything that comber have to show michael be even more vexatious case in moment of depression father thought that must really turn in grave at dismal idea of michael having stepped into honourable shoe physically be utterly unlike comber mind general attitude towards life seemed to have diverged even farther from healthy unreflective pattern only morning father have received letter from that summed michael up fulfilled doubt fear have hung about for after three year in guard have without consultation with anybody resigned commission on inexplicable ground that wanted to do something with life to begin with be rankly heretical if be comber there be need to do anything with life life did everything for what un comberish young man wanted to do with life be to be musician that musician artist actor have right to exist lord ashbridge did not question be doubt might be very excellent people in way a matter of fact often recognised existence by going to opera to

of tea on long south terrace overlooking estuary to convey not very successfully to wife something of feeling on subject according to custom be drinking little hot water providing chinese pug with mixture of cream crumbled rusk though dog be of undoubtedly high lineage lord ashbridge rather detested musical career exclaimed referring to michael letter what sort of career for comber be musical career will tell michael pretty roundly when arrives evening what think of will have francis next saying that want to resign too become dentist lady ashbridge considered for moment in stunned mind

laughter wish marion said that must manage to take mind off dog for moment attend to must really ask not to give petsy more cream will certainly be sick lady ashbridge gave little sigh gone petsy said be glad have gone said will hope wo return about michael now lady ashbridge pulled together yes poor michael said be coming to night be not just now be speaking of francis fear of wanting to be dentist well be now speaking of michael wanting to be musician of course be utterly out of question if a say have sent in resignation will just have to beg to cancel michael seems not to have slightest idea of duty birth position entail on unfitted for life now lead waste of time instead proposes to go to baireuth in august then to settle down in london to study lady ashbridge recollected almanac will be in september then said think be ever in london in september did not know that anybody be point dear be not how where have be accustomed to spend september said husband what be talking

monstrous suggestion be talking very wildly robert said in pained voice dear get on with sacred carpet said be talking to barbara have already ascertained lack of view on subject be saying barbara mere originality be not merit never said that remarked lady ashbridge must have if have allowed to a for saying that have done barbara be very wide of mark intend will continue to be so dear great bashaw be just what said to when told be going to marry excellency did think be glorious move on michael part requires brain to find out what like character to go do comber have got brain a rule see if ever have have degenerated into conservative instinct again refreshed with landscape roof of ashbridge be visible in clear sunset ashbridge paid rent with remarkable regularity may may not be so said forgetting for moment danger of being dignified comber have position barbara controlled admirably slight tremor shook did not notice yes dear said allow that comber have have for many generation

having very much to say be sticky attract wealth have force called vi inertiae mean that invest money prudently must hear tony well perhaps have better not hear tony now here be michael showing that have got taste can wonder that be delighted not only have got taste have strength of character to back michael in guard too be perfect farce be have sense to see hated duty hated diversion now francis be afraid michael have always be little jealous of francis remarked father roused barbara spoke quite seriously if really think that dear said have distinction of being worst possible judge of character that world have ever known michael might be jealous of anybody else for poor boy feel physical awkwardness most sensitively francis be just one person really worship must do anything in world for discussion with barbara be being even more fruitless than with wife lord ashbridge rose can do then be to ask not to back michael up said dear wo need backing up be match for by if michael after thoroughly worsting asks opinion will certainly give wo ask opinion first will strew limb robert over delightful terrace michael train be late said lady ashbridge hearing stable clock strike must have be here before barbara have still word to say disregarded quencher think robert said that because michael resists wish authority will be enjoying will hate doing will not stop lord ashbridge be not bully have merely profound sense of own importance will see about resistance said barbara be not so successful on occasion exploded loudly will dear indeed said michael meantime have be travelling down from london without perturbing over scene with father knew lay before be quite characteristic of have singular command over imagination when have made up mind to anything never indulged in gratuitous pain of anticipation today have additional bulwark against such self inflicted worry for have spent last two hour in town at vocal recital of singer who month before have stirred critic into rhapsody over gift of lyric song up till now have have opportunity of hearing with panegyric have be showered on in mind have gone with expectation of disappointment now hour afterwards wheel of train sang song in inward ear must recapture with vividness of hallucination timbre of wonderful voice also sweet harmony of pianist who accompanied hall have be packed from end to end have barely got to seat only one vacant in whole room when miss sylvia falbe appeared followed at once by accompanist whose name occurred nowhere on programme two neighbour however who chatted shrilly during applause greeted informed that be hermann dear hermann there be one like occurred to michael that singer be like though be fair dark perception of of visually be vague have come to hear not to see hermann have music with hermann just glanced at programme put down on top of piano again unusually be open then without pause began set of german song brahms schubert schumann with recital opened for one moment before lost in ecstasy of hearing michael found registering fact that sylvia falbe have one of most charming face have ever seen next be swallowed up in melody have ease of consummate artist note like gate of new jerusalem be pearl round smooth luminous almost so that be a if many coloured light came from lip be that seemed a if accompaniment be made by song coming into life with freshness of dawn of creation be impossible to believe that one mind directed singer pianist if voice be example of art in excelsis not le exalted be perfection of player not for moment through song did take eye off looked at with intensity of gaze seemed to be reading emotion with lovely melody filled for looked straight out over hall with grey eye half closed mouth that in pause of song be large full lipped generously curving face seemed lit with light of morning sang of be song michael thought of a just pianist who watched understood so unerringly be song too have for identity of own be a remote from everyday life a mind of schumann made so vivid be then that existed last song of group sang in english for be who be sylvia there be buzz of smile whisper among front row in pause before regaining own identity for moment smiled at group of friend among whom clearly be cliche specie of joke that must ask who sylvia be enumerate merit when time be sylvia michael felt rather impatient at be not anybody just now singer then came divine inevitable simplicity of perfect word melody preordained for singer a knew be german have trace of foreign accent seemed to that be just one miracle more have become english because be singing what shakespeare wrote next group consisting of modern french song appeared to michael utterly unworthy of singer echoing piano if have in to give reality to great simple thing be surely waste to concern with little morbid melancholy manikin marionette emotion being unoccupied attended more to manner of performance in especial to marvellous technique not so much of singer of pianist who caused rain to fall water reflect toneless grey sky have never even when listening to great master heard so flawless comprehension a anonymous player incidentally known a hermann exhibited a far a mere manipulation went be a might perhaps be expected entirely effortless effortless le be understanding of music happened be like of so filled michael mind a travelled down that evening to ashbridge that scarcely remembered errand on went when occurred to instantly sank out of sight again lost in recollection of music have heard to day belonged to art claimed allegiance of soul rattle of wheel be alchemised into song a with half closed eye listened to there swam across now full face of singer now profile of pianist have stood out white intent against dark panelling behind head have gleaned one fact at box office a hurried out to catch train hermann be singer brother teacher of piano in london apparently highly thought of chapter iii michael train a mother have so infallibly pronounced be late have arrived only just in time to hurry to room dress quickly in order not to add to crime additional one of unpunctuality for unpunctuality so lord ashbridge held be politeness not only of king of who have pretence to decent breeding father gave carefully iced welcome mother tip of long camel like lip waited solemnly for appearance of aunt barbara who must seem have forfeited claim to family by marriage man servant half looked after of at dinner twelve lord ashbridges in uniform looked down from illuminated frame on degenerate descendant only bright spot in portentous banquet be aunt barbara who have chosen that evening with what intention may possibly be guessed to put on immense diamond tiara breastplate of ruby while og after one futile attempt to play with footman yielded up to chilling atmosphere of good breeding ate mutton chop with great composure aunt barbara fortified by gem ate excellent dinner talked time with occasional burst of unexplained laughter afterwards when michael be left alone with father found that best effort at conversation elicited only monosyllabic reply at last in despairing desire to bring thing to head asked if have received letter affirmative monosyllable followed by hissing of lord ashbridge cigarette end a dropped into coffee cup answered perceived that approaching storm be to be rendered duly impressive by thundery stillness preceded then father rose a passed michael who held door open for said if can spare time michael must like to have talk with when mother aunt have gone to bed be not very long delayed michael imagined that aunt barbara must have have hint for before half past ten announced with skilfully suppressed laugh that be about to retire kissed michael affectionately laugh salute be encouraging felt that be being backed up then procession of footman came into room bearing lemonade soda water whiskey plate of plain biscuit moment after be alone with father lord ashbridge rose walked very tall majestic to fireplace where stood for moment with back to son then turned round now about nonsense of resigning commission michael said propose to argue about be just going to tell if a have informed have actually sent in will write to morrow with due apology ask that may be withdrawn will see letter before send have intended to be a quiet respectful a possible consistent with firmness sentence here gave spasm of anger know what mean sir said by saying 'if have sent in ' have received letter in tell have done so already even at first word there be bad blood between michael face have clouded with gloom father must certainly call sulky for resented tone of michael reply to make matter worse gave little falsetto cackle doubt be intended to convey impression of confident good humour there be must be confessed very little good humour about though still felt serious doubt about result of interview be afraid perhaps then that did not take letter quite seriously dear michael said in bantering tone froze be cordiality completely up glanced through saw lot of nonsense so struck about resigning commission studying music think mentioned baireuth settling down in london afterwards yes said said michael make mistake if see that be written seriously father glanced across at where sat with heavy plain face long arm short leg sight merely irritated with passion for convention one of most important convention be that comber must be fine strapping normal people hated thought that be son who presented appearance son mind seemed to at moment a ungainly a person again very unwisely laughed still thinking to carry off by high hand yes ca take rubbish seriously said be asking permission now to inquire without nonsense into what mean michael frowned felt insincerity of father laugh rebelled against unfairness of question knew well be sarcastically asked flavour of irony in permission to inquire be not there by accident to speak like implied contempt of opposition felt that be being treated like child over nursery rebellion in subsequently there be real possibility of disobedience felt anger rising in spite of if refer to a rubbish sir there be end of matter ah thought must soon agree said lord ashbridge chuckling mistake said michael there be end of matter because wo discus more if treat like will say good night if intend to persist in idea that can just brush resolve away like that clearly took father aback be perfectly dignified proper attitude to take in face of ridicule lord ashbridge though somewhat adept at art of self deception a for instance when habitually beat golf professional must not disguise from that policy have be to laugh blow away michael absurd idea be abundantly clear at moment that apparently easy operation be out of reach got up with more amenity in manner than have yet shown laid hand on michael shoulder a stood in front of evidently quite prepared to go away come dear michael wo do said thought best to treat absurd scheme with certain lightness have only succeeded in irritating michael be perfectly aware that have scored a object be to score made criticism when say 'absurd scheme sir said with quiet respect be not still laughing at lord ashbridge again retreated strategically very well withdraw absurd said now sit down again will talk tell what be in mind michael made great effort with desired in secret real michael to be reasonable cordial to behave filially while time nerve be on edge with father ridicule with instinctive knowledge of father distaste for well be like father said be doing good a be went into guard a know because be right thing to do business man son be put into business for same reason be not good at michael paused moment heart be in said dislike seems to useless be for show heart be quite entirely in music be thing care for more than anything else again paused came so easily to tongue when be speaking to francis be congealed now when felt contempt with though unexpressed knew inspired father lord ashbridge waited with careful politeness eye fixed on ceiling large person completely filling chair just a atmosphere filled room said nothing at until silence rang in michael ear be can tell said at length lord ashbridge carefully conveyed ash from cigarette to fireplace before spoke felt that time have come for most impressive effort very well then listen to said what suffer from michael be mere want of self confidence from modesty seem to grasp have often noticed who be what importance be importance everybody be willing to recognise if will only assume have privilege of position sufficiently value have also responsibility of be afraid be inclined to shirk have got large view have sense of patriotism there be great many thing in position position into will step must much sooner be without have received tradition be bound to hand on intact may think that have nothing to do with being in guard have seemed to swell little be bound in honour to take lead in service of country must do whether like not have to till with own effort goodly heritage ' have to learn meaning of such word a patriotism caste duty lord ashbridge thought that be really putting very well indeed have sustaining consciousness of sincerity entirely believed what said felt that must carry conviction to anyone who listened to with anything like open mind only thing that did not allow for be that personally immensely enjoyed social dominant position thinking indeed only position be really worth having naturally gave aid to comprehension did not take into account that michael be not so blessed a indeed lacked very superior individual enlightenment own word kindled flame of illumination without noticing blank stolidity of michael face went on with gathering confidence be sure be high minded dear michael said be to high mindedness that yes mind saying appeal in moment of unreflectiveness have thrown overboard what be sure be real to sense broadly speaking that be english of highest english class have intended to devote to more selfish pleasure loving aim to dwell in tinkle of pleasant sound that please ear be sure wonder because a mother know play charmingly feel confident that better mind doe not really confuse mere diversion of life with serious issue michael suddenly rose to foot father be afraid be use at said feel ca say know be unintelligible to have called rubbish once think be rubbish still lord ashbridge eloquence be suddenly arrested have be cantering gleefully along have very distinct impression of having run up against stone wall dismounted hurt in way broken be anxious to understand michael said yes father said have be explaining wrong for instance regard music a diversion be only explanation there be of a regard wish authority asked father michael squared shoulder mind be exceedingly sorry to disappoint in matter of wish said in matter of authority ca recognise when question of whole life be at stake know that be son want to be dutiful have own individuality a well that only recognises authority of own conscience seemed to lord ashbridge tragic ludicrous completely subservient to convention so much enjoyed be like defiance of child to say such thing only just checked from laughing again refuse to take answer from said have other to give said michael must like to say once more that be sorry to disobey wish repetition took away desire to laugh in fact must not have laughed want to threaten michael said may know have very free hand in disposal of property be that threat asked michael be hint then father can only say must be perfectly satisfied with anything may do said michael wish must leave everything have to francis tell in sincerity that wish have be elder brother must have be far better pleased with lord ashbridge anger rose be naturally so self complacent a to be seldom disposed to anger rarity be not due to kindliness of nature have before now noticed jealousy of cousin observed be face went white be infamous untrue father said lord ashbridge turned on apologise for said michael looked up at high towering without tremor wait for withdrawal of accusation that be jealous of francis replied there be dead silence lord ashbridge stood there in swollen speechless indignation michael faced undismayed then suddenly to boy there came impulse of pure pity for father disappointment in having son like saw with candour be so real part of how hopeless must be to man of father mind to have millstone like unalterably bound round neck fit to choke drown indeed be not jealous of francis father said speak quite truthfully when say how sympathise with in having son like want to vex want to make best of lord ashbridge stood looking exactly like statue in market place at ashbridge if be case michael said be within power will write letter spoke about michael paused moment a if waiting for more did not seem to possible that appeal must bear further fruit than be soon clear that there be more to come will wish good night father said sunday be day on lord ashbridge be almost more than during week so shining public example did become of british nobleman instead of having breakfast according to middle class custom rather later than usual that solid sausagy meal be hour earlier so that servant except whose presence in house be imperatively necessary for purpose of lunch must go to church thus old george lord ashbridge private boat be exceedingly busy for half hour preceding church time last boat load holding family whose arrival be signal for service to begin lady ashbridge however always went on earlier for presided at organ with long camel like back turned towards congregation started playing slow melancholy voluntary when boy who blew bellow said to in ecclesiastical whisper lordship have arrived lady of household who must sing singing being construed in sense of making loud cheerful noise in throat clustered in choir pew near organ while family sat in large square box with stove in centre amply supplied with prayer book of time when even protestant might pray for queen caroline behind separated from rest of church by ornamental ironwork grille be comber chapel in antiquarian took nearly a much pleasure a lord ashbridge here reclined glorious company of sixteenth century knight with honourable lady at side unyielding marble bolster at head grotesque dog at foot later when peerage be conferred lost little of yeoman simplicity became peruked robed breeched one indeed in age of george iii who be blessed with poetical aspiration appeared in bare foot roman toga with scroll of manuscript in hand while later again mere tablet on wall commemorated almost uncanny virtue just on other side of grille step away sat present day representative of line while lady ashbridge finished last bar of voluntary lord ashbridge sister large smart comely michael beside short heavy with soul full of aspiration father neither must cared to understand according to invariable custom lord ashbridge read lesson in loud sonorous voice large white hand grasping wing feather of brass eagle great carnation in buttonhole when time came for offertory put sovereign in open plate proceeded with minuet like step to go round church collect gift of encouraged congregation followed prayer in book made response in voice nearly a loud a in read lesson sang hymn with curious buzzing sound never for moment did lose sight of fact that be head of comber family doing duty a custom of comber be setting example of godly piety afterwards a usual must change black coat eat good lunch stroll round garden for have nothing to say to golf on sunday in evening clergyman must dine with must be requested to say grace before after meal knew exactly proper mode of passing sunday for landlord on country estate when lord ashbridge knew that thing be proper did with invariable precision michael of course be in disgrace father pending further course of action spoke to looked at indeed seemed doubtful whether must hand offertory plate be perhaps pity that unbent even to extent for michael happened to have none of symbol of thankfulness about person saw slight quiver pas through aunt barbara hymn book after rather portentous lunch however there came relief for father did not ask company on usual sunday afternoon stroll aunt barbara never walked at unless be obliged in consequence when thunderstorm have stepped airily away across park michael joined on terrace with intention of talking situation over with aunt barbara be perfectly willing to do opened discussion very pleasantly with peal of laughter dear delight in said altogether be most entertaining day have ever spent here comber be supposed to be very serious solid people for unconscious humour there be family in england even in state to compare with lunch just now if must put into satirical comedy called aristocracy must make fortune of theatre dawning smile began to break through michael tragedy face suppose be rather funny said really be wretched about aunt barbara dear what be there to be wretched about might have be wretched if have found must stand up to father though know nothing directly that did at least mother have said to three time twice on way to church once coming back beichael have vexed father very much ' offertory plate dear a be saying lunch be in disgrace too because said perfectly plainly yesterday be on side there be at lunch with father apparently unable to see either unconscious of presence fancy pretending not to see ca help seeing large bright object like what will happen next be what tickle to death a say on side of atlantic will gradually begin to perceive again like object looming through fog will come into view suddenly a if going round corner be just a funny dear with long face air of depressed determination why be heavy michael so many people be heavy none of can tell why be impossible not to feel unfreezing effect of michael thawed to a must have thawed to francis perhaps ca help aunt barbara said at least know ca really wish must learn how to see funny side of thing till be pointed out thought lunch sort of hell know of course be funny appearing not to see of stand for more than that stand for complete misunderstanding of aunt barbara have sense to see that real michael be speaking when people be being unreal when be pompous adopting attitude must attend to nothing absurdity engrossed altogether never laughed at real thing real thing be not funny be fact quite misunderstands went on michael with eagerness with shy welcome comprehension think can make mind like if choose if choose rather ca choose think that wish authority must be sufficient to make act a if be well wo do that may go on that pleasant smile lit up michael plain face may go on being unaware of presence a long a plea be very sorry must be so ca help worst of be that opposition of sort sort make more determined than ever aunt barbara nodded friend asked what will think michael looked at quite simply directly friend said have got ah dear be nonsense said wish be oh francis be friend know think odd old thing like other people ca see why must be sure be fault be because be heavy said be then be great as remarked aunt barbara must be heavy with people who understood be heavy with for instance dear lead be in when be with father what be to do if be like asked boy held up large fat hand marked point off on finger three thing said firstly get away from people who understand whom incidentally understand secondly try to see how ridiculous everybody else always be thirdly be much most important think about if thought about must consider how old fat ugly be be not ugly really need be foolish tell so must spoil life by trying to be young only eating devilled codfish drinking hot plum juice be accepted remedy for what call obesity be odd old thing a say can only get away from that depressing fact by doing something not thinking about can try not to be egoist egoism be really heavy quality in world paused moment in inspired discourse whistled to og who have stretched weary limb across bed of particularly fine geranium there said pointing if dog have done that must be submerged in depression at thought of how vexed father must be must be because be thinking of effect on a be dog have done dear do look squashed now have got up really mind about father vexation because wo have to think about be wise of if be little wiser still must picture to yourself how ridiculous will look apologising for og kindly kick michael will understand naughty a for not having friend must be exceedingly sad if have gone right way to get failed have have even gone among people who must be friend friend broadly speaking must like same sort of thing a there must be common basis ca even argue with somebody disagree with somebody unless have common ground to start from if say that black be white think be blue ca get on lead nowhere finally turned round faced directly finally be so cross dear said be asked yes know else probably since be very decent fellow must be expect not to be liked be cross of good humoured person expects to be liked almost always be expect not to be understood be dreadfully cross think father doe understand more doe go on thinking about think be great bore to be father only son wish francis be instead be cross may think be fine be be also ungrateful can have great fun if will only be good tempered how did know about francis mean asked michael doe happen to be true of course doe cross young man wish be somebody else not quite that began interrupt be sufficiently accurate think about appearance dear will do quite well might have have two nose only one eye whereas have two rather jolly one do try to see joke in other people michael did see joke in interview last night with father must have be excruciatingly funny say be sad serious a well be funny too there be point michael shook head did see said must have must have be right dignity be funny simply because be sham when dignity be real know be dignity father knew be being dignified knew be being dignified dear what pair of michael frowned be nothing serious then asked surely be serious enough last night there be in rank rebellion to father vexed horribly did more grieved laid hand on michael knee a if did know that said be sorry for though must have be much sorrier if have given in ceased to vex there be accept that then dear swiftly apply to perceive humour of now about plan will go to baireuth on wednesday then on to munich began michael that of course perhaps may find humour of channel crossing look for in vain yet know man who put on yachting cap asks if there be bit of sea on prof to be case be excessively unwell must look out for next time cross then then will settle in town study oh here father coming home lord ashbridge approached down terrace stopped for moment at desecrated geranium bed saw two sitting together turned at right angle went into house almost immediately footman came out with long dog lead advanced hesitatingly to og og be convinced that have come to play with crouched growled retreated advanced with engaging affability out of window of library looked lord ashbridge baleful face aunt barbara swayed out of chair laid trembling hand on michael shoulder will go apologise for og said will do quite sincerely dear there be point chapter iv michael practised certain mature rather elderly precision in ordinary affair of daily life habit be almost unduly tidy punctual answered letter by return of post never mislaid thing tore up document particularly desired must be preserved kept gold in purse change in trouser pocket in matter of travelling always arrived at station with plenty of time to spare have such creature comfort a desired for journey in neat gladstone bag above head never

compartment of dover ostend express on wednesday morning following be only occupant of probably have never felt so fully at liberty enjoyed keener zest for life future for first time have asserted own indisputable right to stand on own foot though be genuinely sorry for father chagrin at not being able to tuck up in family coach own sense of independence must not wave banner there have be second interview le fruitless than first lord ashbridge have told that when next presence be desired at home must be informed of fact mother have cried in mild trickling fashion be quite obvious that in heart of heart be more concerned with bilious attack of peculiar intensity have assailed petsy wished michael must not be so disobedient vex father be quite sure that before long formula in diplomatic phrase must be found on reconciliation must be based whereas be highly uncertain whether formula must be found must produce desired effect on petsy whose illness attributed to shock of og sudden disconcerting appearance on saturday when petsy nervous force be required to digest copious cream consequently though threw reproachful glance at michael directed at barbara who be cause of acuter tragedy be pointed with more penetrating blame indeed be questionable whether lady ashbridge must have cried at over michael affair have not petsy be also be in so lamentable critical state just a train began to move out of station young man rushed across platform eluded embrace of guard who attempted to stop with amazing agility jumped into michael compartment slammed door after leaned out apparently looking for someone whom soon saw just caught sylvia shouted send on luggage will be in taxi still think have paid man good bye darling waved to till curving line took platform out of sight

london where have suddenly leaped into eminence to support contributed to expense of common home there be still so michael gathered great superabundance of money guessed that falbe inability to go to munich be due to question of expense came out by inference allusion rather than by direct information while michael naturally reticent feeling that own uneventful affair must have interest for anybody be le communicative indeed while shunning appearance of inquisitiveness be far too eager to get hold of new acquaintance to think of volunteering much here to be citizen of new country who life have lived in palace of art that in dilettante fashion with set aim serious purpose falbe abounded in such topic knew singer musician of world be much more than that be of humble doubt in circumstance achievement a yet clearly to michael of blood royal of artistry be essential thing about a regard relation with fellow traveller though when next morning spire of cologne swift river of fatherland

pervade be worthy do think youthful unrestrained enthusiasm be revelation to michael intentionally absurd a falbe rhapsody on fatherland have be michael knew that sprang from solid sincerity be not ashamed of expressing living a have always done in rather formal reticent atmosphere of class environment must have thought fervour of patriotism in english mouth ridiculous if persevered in merely bad form yet when falbe hailed rhine spire of cologne be clear that there be bad form about at felt like indeed a michael be beginning to perceive felt with similar intensity on subject about felt at there be something of same vivid quality about aunt barbara aunt barbara vividness be chiefly devoted to hunt of absurdity of friend be always concretely ridiculous that pursued handsome vital young man with eagerness welcome for world who have fallen with so delightful cordiality into michael company have already attraction for of sort have never felt before dimly a day went by began to

michael who have leaned out of window to remind of hour of train departure next morning turned back into room to begin packing be not affair must take much time since on sweltering august night must certainly be process involved production of much heat made ready for bed first went about preparation in pyjama work of dropping thing into bag be soon over finding impossible to entertain idea of sleep drew one of stiff plush covered arm chair to window slipped rein from thought letting gallop where pleased in life have never experienced so much sheer emotion a last week have held for have enjoyed first taste of liberty have stripped naked to music have found friend one of must have be sufficient to saturate have in decree of fate come together life hitherto have be like dry sponge dusty crackling now be plunged in water of three sea incomparably sweet have gained liberty in process have forgotten about self up till now have be so intolerable burden at school even before when first age of self consciousness dawned upon have seen a believed others saw queer awkward ill made boy slow at work shy with fellow incapable at game walled up in fortress of gloomy forbidding fastness have altogether failed to find mean of access to others to normal english boy among whom path lay also to teacher who not unnaturally found sullen unresponsive there be key among rather limited bunch at command unlocked at home have anything be found must fit ward have be business of school to turn out boy of certain received type there be clever boy athletic boy merely pleasant boy combination arrived at from type be output there be use for others then have succeeded three nightmare year in guard where with more mature power of observation have become more actively conscious of inability to take place on of recognised platform time like owl on solitary perch have gazed out lonelily while other bird of day too polite to mock have merely passed by one such be true cousin have sat by poor owl heart have gone out to even francis so saw now have not understood have accepted fact of without repugnance have be fond of a queer sort of kind elder cousin then there be aunt barbara aunt barbara michael allowed have understood good deal have pointed out with unerringly humourous finger obstacle have made for must aunt barbara understand rapture of living one week of liberty have given that michael doubted have only pointed out disability made for did not know what be capable of in way of happiness thought though without consciousness how delightful must be to show new unshelled self to aunt barbara again laughing couple went tapping down street below window boy girl with arm waist interlaced be laughing at nothing at except that be boy girl together be glorious fun sight of gave sudden spasm of envy with enlightenment have come to during last week there have come gleam of what that simplest commonest aspect of human nature meant have never felt towards girl what that round faced german boy felt be not sure thought disliked girl meant nothing to anyhow mere thought of arm round girl waist only suggested very embarrassing attitude have nothing to say to knowledge of inability filled with uncomfortable sense of want of normality just a did consciousness of long arm stumpy leg there be night remembered when francis have insisted that must go with to discreet little supper party after evening at music hall there be just four of francis two companion played role of sour gooseberry to cousin who with utmost gaiety have proved completely equal to inauspicious occasion have drank indiscriminately out of girl glass lit cigarette for after seeing home have looked in on michael gone into fit of laughter at general incompatibility step conversation passed round corner michael stretching bare toe on to cool balcony resumed research joyful unegoistic research into liberty be bound up with music first gave key to second often a have rested so to speak in oasis of music in london be pause from desert of uncongenial life into desert again now desert be vanished oasis stretched illimitable to horizon in front of be where for future life be to be passed not idly sitting under tree in eager pursuit of unnumbered path be that aspect of a knew so well father for instance must never be able to understand to lord ashbridge mind music be vaguely connected with white waistcoat opera glass large pink carnation be congenitally incapable of viewing in other light than diversion something took place between nine eleven o'clock in evening in smaller quantity at church on sunday morning must undoubtedly have said that handel messiah be noblest example of music in world because of subject music did not exist for a separate definite infinite factor of life since did not so exist for must not imagine existing for anybody else that michael correctly knew to be father general demeanour towards life wanted everybody in respective sphere to be like what be in must take part a undoubtedly did in creation scheme when british aristocracy came into being fresh factor have come into michael conception of music during last seven day have become aware that germany be music have naturally known before that vast proportion of music came from germany almost of meant music to be of german origin be very different affair from conviction now borne in on mind that there be not only no music apart from germany that there be germany apart from music moment spent in wayside puddle of town for so baireuth seemed to unbiased view became more more aware that music beat in german blood even a sport beat in blood of own people during festival week baireuth existed only because of at other time baireuth be probably a non existent a dull minor town in english midland owing to fact of music being for week resident in baireuth sordid little townlet became capital of huge patient empire existed just now simply for reason to night with curtain of last act of parsifal have ceased to exist again be not that patriotic desire to honour one of national hero in home where have be established by mad genius of bavarian king moved be because for moment baireuth to german meant germany from berlin from dresden from frankfurt from luxemburg from hundred town who be most typically german whether high low rich poor made joyous pilgrimage joy solemnity exultation yearning must never be satisfied drew here even a music be in michael heart so germany be there also be people who understood did not go to opera a be diamonded interlude between dinner dance came to dreadful little town discomfort of utter provinciality of be transformed into air of heavenly jerusalem a hermann falbe have said because soul be fed here with wine manna must find same thing at munich so falbe have told next week love tragedy of great titanic force saw making of world dream deed of master of nuremberg above sacrifice enlightenment redemption of soul how except by music must be made manifest be first only final alchemy must by magic transformation give answer to tremendous riddle of consciousness must lift though tearing making mincemeat of to serenity of pisgah top whence be seen promised land in be reality door keeper who admitted into enchanted realm be spirit of germany not france with little morbid shivering meat market called love not italy with melodious declamation tawdry tune not russia even with wind of impenetrable winter sense of joy snatched from eternal frost gave admittance there germany deep patient germany sprang from upland hamlet flowed down with ever broadening stream into illimitable ocean here then be two of initiation have come with swiftness of spate in alpine valley at melting of snow upon michael own liberty namely new sense of music have groped felt now like blind man in direction guided only by instinct on sudden scale have fallen from eye knew that instinct have guided right not le epoch making have be dawn of friendship throughout week intimacy with hermann falbe have developed shooting up like aloe flower rising into sunlight above mist of own self occupied shyness have so darkly beset life long have given best that knew of to cousin time there have never quite be absent from mind sense of inferiority sort of aching wonder why must not be more like francis more careless more capable of enjoyment more of normal type with falbe be able for first time to forget altogether have met man who did not recall to took clean out of tedious dwelling knew so well indeed disliked so much be rid for first time of morbid consciousness anchor have be taken up from dragging in sand rode free buoyed on water taken by tide did not occur to to wonder whether falbe thought uncouth awkward did not occur to to try to be pleasant job over poor michael have so often found dishearteningly incapable let be in consciousness that be sufficient have spent morning together before second performance of parsifal closed series in wood above theatre michael no longer blurting out speech speaking in quiet orderly manner in thought discussed plan will come back to london with after munich said settle down to

be to play asked michael anything like sat down at far end of room put long leg up on to chair waited michael sent despairing glance at gay face suddenly grown grim took seat felt paralysing conviction that falbe judgment whatever might turn out to be must be right knowledge turned finger stiff from few note that falbe have struck guessed on what sort of instrument ordeal be to take place yet knew that falbe must have be able to convey to sense that must play though piano be out of tune there might be dumb disconcerting note in there be justice in falbe dictum about temperament lay behind player must assert through faultiness of instrument through so suspected faultiness of execution struck chord heard dissonantly oh be not fair said get on said falbe in spite of germany there occurred to michael chopin prelude at have worked little during last two month in london note knew perfectly have believed also that have found certain conception of a whole so that must make something coherent out of not merely adding bar to correct bar began soft repetition of chord quaver with opened then after stumbling wretchedly through two line of suddenly forgot falbe squealing

of paused moment again striking dumb note a if to make sure that be soundless yes will teach said technique have got know be wrong from beginning to end must mind unlearning have got thing that matter stewed seethed in michael mind a sat that night by window looking out on to silent empty street thought flowed without check guide from will wandering wherever course happened to take now lingering like water of river in deep still pool when thought of friendship have come into life now excitedly plunging down foam of swift flowing rapid in exhilaration of newly found liberty now proceeding with steady current at thought of week of unremitting industry at beloved task lay in front of must form definite image out of must represent ordinary day be lost in bright haze through shape be faintly discernible life lay in front of with promise thing to be embraced greeted with welcome eager hand instead of being mere marsh through have to plod with labouring step business to be gone about without joy without conviction in being worth while wondered for moment a rose to go to bed what feeling must have be if at end of performance on sore throated voiceless piano falbe have said be sorry ca do anything with a knew falbe intended for future only to take few pupil chiefly devote to own practice with view to emerging a concert giver next winter a michael have sat down remembered telling that there be really not slightest chance of friend accepting a pupil did not intend that rejection must make smallest difference to aim knew that must start work under tremendous handicap of falbe not believing that have in to play under disappointment of not enjoying added intimacy work with for falbe must give then have engaged in tussle with refractory note till quite lost in what be playing thought more either of falbe piano only of what melody meant to at end when came to again sat with dropped hand waiting for falbe verdict remembered how heart seemed to hang poised until came have rehearsed again to fixed determination that must play must play friend might think about there be doubt that waited with greater suspense than have ever known in life before for verdict to be made known to next day came journey to munich installation in best hotel in europe here michael be host economy practised when have only to provide for made go second class when travelling be a usual

two three occasion chance spark have lit up teutonic beacon to michael mixture of nationality seemed to be wonderful gift implied widening of one sympathy outlook larger comprehension of life than be possible to of undiluted blood for like most young englishman of day be not conscious of tremendous sense of patriotism like somewhere deep down in supposed there might be source well of english water explosion in nature might cause to flood entirely such idea be purely hypothetical did not in fact look forward to such bouleversement a being possible contingency with falbe be different quite small cause like sight of rhine at cologne bavarian village at sunset fact of friend having talked with emperor be sufficient to make innate patriotism find outlet in impassioned speech wondered vaguely

at fiasco always attended introduction of amiable young lady to ashbridge have warned sister in law that michael when chose girl wanted must certainly do on own initiative now felt sure that michael though might not be aware of be even if have not chosen beginning to choose there be that in eye none of importation to ashbridge have ever seen there that eager deferential attention show that young man be interested because be girl be talking to knew have never be characteristic of michael indeed must not have be far from truth to say that fact that be talking to girl be sufficient to make countenance wear expression of polite boredom then for while a dinner progressed doubted validity of conclusion for michael who be entertaining to night be wholly different from michael have known liked pitied felt that did not know new one yet be certain that liked equally sure that did not pity at have found place have found work evidently fitted into life after be surest ground of happiness might be that be only general joy so to speak kindled pleasant fire in face then once more went back to first conclusion for talking to michael saw a woman so infallibly see that gave most superficial attention sufficient indeed to allow to answer intelligently laugh at proper place mind be not in least occupied with if sylvia moved glance flickered across in direction be who gave alertness aunt barbara felt that must have told truthfully that be in love with rather thought that must be news to probably did not know yet wondered what father must say when knew then munich said violently recalling michael attention towards munich must have borne better than baireuth when mr falbe asks there will probably go uncle tony be in germany then by way went over at invitation of emperor to manoeuvre did emperor came to munich for day during be at opera said michael did speak to suppose asked yes sent for talked lot in fact talked too much because did hear note of second act aunt barbara

naturalised english asked be german slid swiftly off topic do wonder ask with talking english so perfectly said must hear talking french when be entertaining ambassador sort of person talk so fast that nobody can understand word say be defensive measure must observe because even if talked quite slowly must understand just a little think be pace stupefies leave in curious dazed condition now miss falbe be going to leave two be rather long time dear michael so mr falbe can tell what think of sister will tell what think of afterwards will tell other if be not too fearful did not express quite accurately lady barbara intention for chiefly wanted to find out what thought of sylvia be great friend three said a settled for prolonged absence of two men sylvia smiled smiled aunt barbara noticed almost entirely with eye using mouth only when came to laughing eye smiled quite charmingly be always rather rash thing to pronounce on said can tell for certain that hermann be very fond of be presumptuous for to say that be equally devoted to dear there be call for modesty about said barbara between for imagine be who have done between have made perfectly different creature of boy have made flower sylvia became quite grave oh do hope like said be so likable barbara nodded have have good sense to find out said be astonishing how few people knew then a said michael have flowered one understood be interested then suddenly made up mind last summer what wanted to do be immediately did be think told hermann said father did approve did approve dear if knew brother must know that only thing approves of be michael be sylvia spread fine hand out to blaze warming shading face michael always seems to began ah called michael by mistake then do on purpose next time remarked barbara what

always seems oh yes always seems to to have be part of of hermann for year be there if know what mean so few people be there walk about life go in out so to speak michael stop suppose be because be so natural aunt barbara have be diplomatist long before husband fearful of appearing inquisitive about sylvia impression of michael really wanted to inquire into instantly changed subject ah everybody who have got definite thing to do be natural said be only idle people who have leisure to look at in glass pose feel sure that have definite thing to do plenty of dear what be oh sing little said

laughed do know be afraid must be said be dreadful to have to say that after description aunt barbara sat down again in sort of calm despair if there be more shock coming for to night said think have better go home have encountered perfectly new nephew michael have dressed like suburban housekeeper to meet poiret so deny having humourously told michael wished to see prima donna pianist take at word produce miss falbe be glad knew that in time must infallibly have asked to sing if have done so be probably good natured enough to have done even must have given drawing room gasp at end told brother that thought sang very prettily sylvia laughed really be fault lady barbara said when met must have said 'beware be miss falbe ' dear think ought somehow to have conveyed impression that be tremendous swell did have be thinking of a charming girl nothing more be quite good enough for said two young men joined after hermann speedily became engrossed in reading finished variation of pleased mightily one altogether demurred to be just crib mike said critic must say have forgotten put in instead what must remember of variation out of handel theme that next one oh great fun wish must remember that have got great orang outang paw like aunt barbara stopped in middle of sentence knew michael old sensitiveness about physical disability have moment cold horror at thought of falbe having said so miserably tactless thing to horror be of infinitesimal duration for heard michael laugh a leaned over top of piano together wish have hermann said know will bungle tenth falbe moved to piano seat oh let have shot at said if lady barbara wo mind play one through to first mike oh presently hermann said make infernal row that ca hear anything else afterwards do sing miss sylvia aunt wo

enjoyed master accompaniment be perfectly sure that preferred if possible to play for sylvia than have pleasure of listening to anybody else may play for miss sylvia asked yes will thanks lord comber hermann moved away so mr hermann sits down by lady barbara while lord comber play for miss sylvia observed with emphasis on title sudden amazing boldness seized michael sylvia then said all right michael answered girl laughing came stood on left of piano slightly behind what be going to have asked michael must be something know for have brought music said michael began playing introduction to hugo wolff song have accompanied for one sunday night at house knew perfectly by heart stumbled little over difficult syncopated time be not done without purpose for next moment felt hand on shoulder marking for yes be right said now have got michael smiled sweetly at own amazing ingenuity hermann put down variation still have in hand when sylvia voice began unaccustomed a be to accompanist trained ear told that be singing perfectly at ease be completely at home with player occasionally gave little indication a have done before for most part finger rested immobile on shoulder seemed to understand perfectly somehow be surprise to have not known that michael possessed that sort of second sight unerringly feel translates into key singer mood for always have to attend most closely when be playing for sister familiar a be with singing felt that michael divined certainly a well a listened to piano more than to voice extraordinary creature said when song be over where did learn to accompany suddenly michael felt access of shyness a if have be surprised when thought private oh have played before for miss mean for sylvia said then turned to girl thanks awfully said be greedy may have one more slid into opening bar of who be sylvia that song since have heard sing at recital in summer have grown in significance to even a have have seemed part of then then be stranger to night

piano will take sylvia home at once now may all talk a much a like wo interrupt one atom will have to talk loud in certain part then feat of marvellous execution began michael have taken evil pleasure in giving master for whom slaved with so unwearied diligence something must tax power gave great crash of laughter when for moment hermann be brought to complete standstill in octave passage of triplet against quaver performer exultantly joined in a pushed hair back from forehead made second attempt be decent to ask fellow to read that shouted be crime be scandal dear nobody asked to read said sylvia silence chit mike come here minute sit down one second play promise to get up again though immediately just three bar yes see orang outang apparently can do so why not be not much better than go away please rather stop there turn over why must have finished page with last act started one fresh instead of making godforsaken arrangement now very simple little minuet measure followed outrageous passage hermann exquisite lightness of touch made sound strangely remote a if from mile away hundred year ago graceful echo be evoked again then little dirge wept for memory of something have never happened leaving out number disapproved of a reminiscent of handel theme hermann gathered up again for assertion of original tune with bar of scale octave contagious jollity of seized others sylvia with full voice aunt barbara in strange hooting sang to then hermann banged out last chord jumped up from seat rolling up music go straight home said have peaceful hour with michael old

with sylvia on platform did much notice sylvia then inference naturally followed be a much a must be expected aunt barbara did not appear to wait for anything more on subject of sylvia have seen sufficient of situation to know where michael be most certainly bound for yet very fact of sylvia outspoken friendliness with made wonder little a to what reception must be must hardly have said so plainly that brother be devoted to if have be devoted to with secret tenderness in essential be reticent about half hour conversation with girl have given certain insight into still more have attitude when stood by michael a played for put hand on shoulder precisely a must have done if have be girl who be seated at piano without doubt michael have real existence for there be sign that hailed a girl so unmistakably doe when see a part of more about said what be who be outlined for giving half english half german parentage shadow like bavarian father sylvia sudden comet like rising in musical heaven while brother seven year senior have spent time in earning in order to give chance have so brilliantly taken now be to be turn shackle of drudgery no longer impeded so michael radiantly prophesied be to have rocket like leap to zenith also be german asked yes be rude about being toy soldier be natural german point of view suppose michael strolled to fireplace hermann so funny said for day week together must think be entirely english then word slip from like show be entirely german be like in munich when emperor appeared sent for aunt barbara drew chair little nearer fire sat up

diplomatist anyhow be studying irish question very closely german gold without doubt at be helping home rule party a nation be fast asleep wonder what will be like when wake will find already fettered when wake will there be one moment just one moment in can spring up at rate hitherto english have always be at best not worst in desperate position hate exciting refuse to do until crisis be actually on then become disconcertingly serious cool headed think emperor began michael think emperor be hardest worker in germany said barbara believe be trying admirably succeeding to make trust profession of friendship have great eye for detail too seemed to worth while to assure even dear michael of regard affection for england be always impressing on tony same thing though to of course said that if there be country nearer to heart than england be america stuff nonsense dear though struck in more serious key than be usual with aunt barbara be quite characteristic of have quality of mind when occupied with one idea be occupied with to exclusion of others worked at full power over anything took up now dismissed altogether see what diplomatist have become said be fascinating business one life in atmosphere be charged with secret affair infects one like influenza catch somehow have feverish cold of own be quite useful to see be chatterbox people think let out thing by accident never do

purpose event of evening have undoubtedly be be performance of wenceslas variation have now learned a have promised michael be going to play at concert in steinway hall in january to night good many musician friend have attended sunday evening gathering there have be no two opinion about success of be talking to arthur lagden about said falbe naming prominent critic of day must hardly believe that be opus that michael have not be studying music technically for year instead of six month be odd thing about mike be so mature be not unusual for brother sister to sit up like till hour after guest have gone sylvia collected bundle of cushion lay full length on floor with foot towards fire for of week be too busy on six day for to indulge companionship sometimes full of talk sometimes consisting of dropped word long silence on intimacy life enjoyed above hour in week time lay between friendly riot of sunday evening starting of work again on monday there be between that bond can scarcely exist between husband wife since almost necessarily implies close consanguinity of brother sister postulate certain sort of essential community of nature founded not on taste even on affection on fact that same blood beat in two here intense affection too strong to be ever demonstrative fortified brother sister talked to other a if be speaking to physically independent piece of sylvia have nothing apparently to add on subject of michael maturity instead just raised head be not quite high enough stuff cushion under head hermann said thanks now be completely comfortable will be relieved to hear hermann gazed at fire in silence be weight off mind said about michael now be be suppressed life know instead of being dwarfed have just gone on growing inside good lord wish somebody must suppress for year two what lot there must be when took cork out again dissipate too much sylvia gave little grunt from knowledge of inarticulate expression took to mean dissent suppose mean remarked yes how much one dissipates be determined for one just a be shape of nose colour of eye by way fell madly in love with cousin of michael who came with to night be most attractive creature ever saw in life of course be too beautiful boy ought to be a beautiful a that flirted with remarked hermann mike will probably murder on way home sylvia moved foot little farther from blaze funny asked instantly falbe knew that mind be occupied with exactly same question a not funny at said quite serious do want to talk about not gave little groan want to have got to said aunt barbara became sylvia aunt barbara hour two ago be dear aunt barbara have be talking to about already what did aunt barbara say just what be going to said sylvia namely that have better make up mind what mean

how much like michael believe like a much a possibly can know if be enough hermann be enough ought to know there be use in unless know about put out arm clasped two leg in crook of elbow that expressed attitude what be to other a absolutely a physical demonstration allowed have there not be difference of sex severed must never have got sense of support that physical contact gave have there not be sisterhood to chaperon so to speak must never have be so at ease with man two be lover like without physical apex limitation physical love must always bring with complement of sex brought so close annihilated very existence of sex loved a only brother sister can love without trouble closer contact of fire warmed trouser to calf of leg made hermann step out of encircling arm without question of hurting feeling wo be burned said sorry wo be burned seems to sylvia that ought to like michael little more little le be use saying what ought to do said idea of what 'ought ' doe come in like just a much a like neither more le clawed more cushion together sat down on floor by raised little rested body against folded knee what be trouble sylvia said just what have be trying to tell be more concrete then be definite enough when sing sighed gave little melancholy laugh be just said people like michael too for matter be most entirely when be at music when michael play for can sing soul at while be in music if understand of course do belong to other do know hermann find when be singing without slightest effort even a have so often told have to search be on lookout then song be

ca matter hermann if only michael be rather like like michael must love exactly a much a ever must love michael too be leaning forward with hand be very carefully tying untying one of hermann shoelace oh thank goodness there be somebody in world to whom can say just feel know understands said know too follow here hermann know that doe really matter be sure doe like michael far too well to let matter there be other thing see way through be much more real be silent again so long that hermann reached out for cigarette lit threw away match before spoke there be michael position said when michael asks if will have a know be going to do will have to make condition wo give up career must go on working in other word singing whether marry not call singing in sense of word to sing 'the bank of allan water ' to michael father mother at ashbridge more than be being politician to read morning paper argue about irish question with to have career in politics mean that must be member of parliament daresay house of lord must do make speech stand racket in same way to be singer doe mean to sing after dinner to go squawking anyhow in workhouse mean to get up on platform before critical people if do very best be damned by if marry michael must go on singing a professional singer not become amateur viscountess comber who sings so charmingly refuse to sing charmingly will either sing properly not at must not sing will have to continue being miss falbe so to speak say insist on said hermann whether did not there be nothing more certain than michael must be sure must by so doing must certainly quarrel irrevocably with people even aunt barbara who after be very liberally minded see that can none of not even who be born to certain tradition imagine that there be other tradition quite a stiff necked michael be true be born to one tradition have got other a have shown very clearly by refusing to disobey will certainly a say insist on endorsing resolution have made for what come to be ca marry without father complete consent to have told ca have career disregarded covered up with awkward silence alluded to a painful subject a say even aunt barbara seemed to take for granted that if became lady comber must cease to be miss falbe well there be wrong dear will continue to be miss falbe whether be lady comber lady ashbridge duchess of anything please here difficulty really come in must see how right be difficulty did say be more like impossibility hermann threw end of cigarette into ash of dying fire be clear then said have made up mind not to marry shook head oh hermann fail said if have made up mind not to must have kept up hour talking about stretched hand out towards ember already coated with grey ash then be like with said pointing if there be fire in be covered up with ash did not reply for moment think have hit there said believe there be fire when a said play for know there be ash be who will disperse for stood up swiftly drawing to full height stretching arm out there be something bigger than know coming said whether be storm sunshine have idea there will be something that will utterly sever michael utterly unite do care be asked care said held out hand to pulled up to foot what be going to say then when asks said tell must wait went round room putting out electric lamp opening big skylight in roof there be curtain in front of pulled aside from frosty cloudless heaven starshine of thousand constellation filtered down be lot to ask of man said if care care if be girl must know exactly what mean said may know care unless be marrying for perfectly different reason have to feel to end of finger that care before can say 'yes opened door for to pas out walked up passage together arm in arm well perhaps michael wo ask said in case bother will be saved will have sat up talking till sylvia did know be nearly three sat up talking for nothing sylvia considered fiddlestick said hermann be inclined to agree with view of case found confirmation next day for michael after music lesson lingered so firmly determinedly when three chatted together over fire that in end hermann found nothing to do to leave together sylvia have given sign a to whether wished to absent not concluded since did not put end to thing by going away that intended michael to have say latter rose a door closed behind hermann came stood in front of at moment sylvia must notice nothing of except heaviness plainness thing that have told before did not really matter now sensation contradicted that be conscious that ash somehow have vastly accumulated over fire that affection regard for be suddenly eclipsed be complete surprise to for moment found be presence proximity to simply distasteful thought hermann be never going said for second two did not reply be clearly no use to continue ordinary banter of conversation to suggest that a room be hermann might conceivably be conceded right to stop there if chose there be transition possible between affair of day affair for michael have stopped to speak gave up attempt to make one instead just helped what be michael asked then to at rate michael face completely changed there burned in of sudden full glow of of have only seen glimpse know said shyness awkwardness have vanished time have come for to offer to that have to offer did with charm of perfect manliness simplicity whether can accept not said have just to tell that be entirely be there chance for sylvia stood quite still making movement towards on side found distaste of suddenly vanished in mere solemnity of occasion very quietness told better than protestation must have done of quality of what offered that quality vastly transcended that have known guessed of know michael said at length came step forward without sense of embarrassment found that without conscious intention have put hand on shoulder moment be done be conscious of impulse made do expressed what felt yes feel like to said be dear expect know how fond be of if assure of now have got to give more than that michael looked up at yes sylvia said much more than that few minute ago only have not liked at now liked immensely how michael asked how can find oh be who have got to find for said be to say if want to be found do looked at gravely without tremor of smile in eye what doe mean exactly said be very simple do want to love did not move hand still rested on shoulder like thing at ease like thing at home yes suppose want to said be that most can do for at present asked that reached again time plain word plain face quiet of stabbed with dagger of have idea be dismayed at recollection of talk with brother evening before of ease certitude with have laid down condition of not giving up career of remaining famous miss falbe of refusing to take dishonoured place in sacred circle of comber now when be face to face with love so ineloquently expressed so radically part of knew that there be nothing in world external to must enter into reckoning into reckoning there have not entered one thing essential gave sympathy liking friendliness did not want with blood though be not humanly possible that must want with more than that be not possible that must take with le yes be most can do for at present said still quite quietly moved away from so that stood free of hand have be constantly here last month said now that know what have told do want not to see that stabbed again have implied that asked not directly can easily understand being bore to want to bore must be very stupid way of trying to make care for a said that be job have accomplished a yet mean to only ask for hint understood own feeling better than understood at least that be dealing with thing be necessarily incalculable ca give hint said ca make plan about if be woman perhaps must understand love be be be know about michael persisted only know what have taught said must know that in flash became aware that must be impossible for to behave to michael a have behaved to for several month past must not longer put hand on shoulder beat time with finger on arm knowing that physical contact meant nothing to to rejection of a lover rendered sisterly attitude impossible not only must revise conduct must revise mental attitude of be physical counterpart up till moment have looked at situation from own side only have felt that plan must be made that natural thing be to go on a before with intimacy that liked familiarity be obvious expression of now began to see question from side must not go on doing that meant nothing particular to if insouciance meant something so very particular to realised that if have loved touch of hand proximity of face must have have significance for significance must have be intolerable unless there be something mutual secret between have seemed so easy in anticipation to tell that must wait so simple for just well just to wait until must make up mind believed a have told brother that cared for michael a have told that wanted to two be to girl mind identical though expressed to in only term be possible until came face to face with picture of future to wore same outline colour a past have not known impossibility of such presentment desire of lover on michael part rendered unthinkable sisterly attitude on hers that instinct told reason revolted against ca go on a be michael said looked at incredulously oh of course not that said moved step towards ca think of in other way said a if making appeal stood absolutely unresponsive something within longed that must advance step more that must again have touch of hand on shoulder instinct stronger than made revoke desire if have moved again must certainly have fallen back before may seem ridiculous to said since care ca do doe that seem absurd to be afraid doe be because understand by mean let be what call excellent friend there be certain little thing seem nothing to mean so much to ca explain be just brotherly relation ca stand be use suggesting that must be a be before understood well enough for purpose see said michael paused for moment think will be going now said be off to ashbridge in two day give hermann love jolly christmas to will let know when be back in town have reply to saw justice acquiesced good bye then said michael walked home from chelsea in utterly blank unfeeling consciousness almost invariably be sequel of event brings with change of attitude towards life generally not for moment did tell that have be awakened from dream abandon conviction that dream be to be made real rare quiet determination have made give up stereotyped mode of life in summer take to music be still completely if anything have be reinforced by sylvia emphatic statement that wanted to care only imagining that old relation must go on showed how far be from knowing what to care meant at first without knowing with gradually increasing keenness of consciousness have become aware that sisterly attitude of hers towards have meant so infinitely much because have taken to be prelude to something more now saw that be so to speak piece complete in bore relation to what have imagined must lead into curtain went up when prelude be over curtain remained inexorably hanging there not acknowledging prelude at not for moment did accuse of encouraging to have thought so have given frankness of comradeship meant to exactly what expressed have thought otherwise have imagined that must grow towards culmination here be change that made mind blank unfeeling have to be cut away with budding branch that imagination have pictured a springing from must not be comrade to a be to brother inexorable demand of sex forbade went briskly enough through clean dry street frost of last night have held throughout morning sunlight sparkled with rare seasonable brightness of traditional christmas weather hecatomb of turkey hung in poulterer window among sprig of holly shop be bright with child toy briskness of day have flushed colour into face of passenger in street festive air of imminent holiday be abroad michael noticed with sense of detachment what have happened have caused veil to fall between external thing be a if be sealed into glass cage have contact with what passed round lasted throughout walk when let into flat be with same sense of alienation that found cousin francis gracefully reclining on sofa that have pulled up in front of fire francis be inclined to be querulous be just wondering whether must give up said hour that named for lunch be half past one have almost forgotten what clock sounded like when struck two also seemed to matter very little did ask to lunch said really quite forgot ca even remember doing now there will be lunch asked francis rather anxiously of course will be ready in ten minute michael came

tear two over petsy ii in memory of petsy did not seem to account for wakening up of mind emotion into state of depression anxiety be a if life have be quietly dozing in sun that place where sat have passed into shade have awoke cold shivering from bitter wind have become far more talkative though have by mean abandoned habit of upsetting conversation by extreme obviousness of remark asked many more question a michael noticed often repeated question to have received answer only few minute before during dinner michael constantly found looking at in shy eager manner removing gaze when found be observed when later after silent cigarette with father in smoking room during lord ashbridge with ostentation studied army list michael went to bedroom be utterly astonished when gave come in to tapping at door to see mother enter maid be standing behind holding inevitable petsy hovered hesitatingly in doorway heard come up michael said wondered if must annoy if came in to have little talk

being poor michael now that be living life chose vexes father be better with shyness have gone from gaze that have seen direct at at dinner fugitively fluttered away when saw that be observed now that be bent so unwaveringly on saw shining through what have never seen before namely mother love have missed life now for first time saw recognising a by divination when with ray serene untroubled burst through mist seemed to hang about mother mind before noticing change of manner restless question have be vaguely alarmed a went on alarm have become more pronounced at moment when there shone forth mother instinct have never come out blossomed in life have be overlaid completely with routine conventionality rendering too indolent to put forth petal michael have thought for have never given yet now began to expand before knew have missed life took up big hand lay on knee began timidly stroking since have be away said since father have be vexed with have begun to see how lonely must have be what taught that be be only that have begun to feel lonely too nobody want even petsy when died did want to be near then began to strike that perhaps might want there be one else who must want if son

childish effort easily repulsed have not troubled about if be to blame blame be also have be slow to show mother instinct have be just a wanting in tenderness of son be profoundly touched by humble timidity by sincerity vague unquestionable that lay behind be never too late be said bending down kissing thin white hand held be in time after be gave little shiver oh kiss hand michael said hurt that must do be sweet of to say that be not too late after michael may just take in arm may half rose oh mother how can ask said then let do darling move just sit still a be let just get arm about put

with then morning have not be really aware that have mother to tell now be not unthinkable inevitable yes there be girl whom ca do without said lady ashbridge face lit up ah tell about tell about said want ca do without be right wife for michael caught at mother hand a stroked sleeve be not sure that can do with said face be not dimmed at oh may be sure doe know own mind said girl so often must not be down hearted about who be tell about be sister of great friend hermann falbe said who teach music time gladness faded from oh dear will vex father again said that must want to marry sister of music teacher will never do to vex again be not lady michael laughed certainly be said father be german mother be tracy just a well born a how odd then that brother must have taken to giving music lesson doe not sound good perhaps be poor certainly there be disgrace in being poor what be name sylvia said michael have probably heard of be miss falbe who made sensation in london last season by singing old outlook old tradition be beginning to come to surface again in poor lady ashbridge mind oh dear said singer must vex father terribly fancy daughter of miss tracy becoming singer yet want seems to to matter most of then came step at door opened inch two michael heard father voice be mother with michael asked at lady ashbridge got up for one second clung to son then disengaging froze up like sudden congealment of spring yes robert said be having little talk to michael may come in be secret whispered to michael yes come in father said lord ashbridge stood towering in doorway come dear said not unkindly be time for to go to bed have become mask of herself again yes robert said suppose must be late will come oh there be petsy will ring michael then fedden will come take to bed sleep with fedden chapter ix michael in desperate conversational effort next morning at breakfast mentioned fact that german emperor have engaged in substantial talk at munich have recommended to pas winter at berlin be immediately obvious that rose in father estimation for though doubt primarily fact that michael be son be cause of interest gave sort of testimonial also to respectability if emperor have thought that taking up musical career be indelibly disgraceful a lord ashbridge have done must certainly not have made so agreeable on anyone of lord ashbridge essential deep rooted snobbishness must not fail to make certain effect chilly politeness to michael sensibly thawed might almost have detected certain cordiality in desire to learn a much a possible of gratifying occurrence mean to go to berlin asked be afraid sha be able to said michael master be in london must be inclined to reconsider that michael said father emperor know what be talking about on subject of music lady ashbridge looked up from breakfast be giving petsy ii dietary be rather le rich than of defunct be afraid sometimes that food be not nourishing enough remember concert have here said have beong to aegir ' twice lord ashbridge gave quick glance michael felt must not have noticed evening before memory be very good dear said with encouragement then have torchlight procession remarked quite so remember perfectly about visit here michael did talk about yes very warmly also about international relation lord ashbridge gave little giggle must tell barbara that said have become sort of cassandra since became diplomatist sits on tripod prophesies woe asked about said michael think belief in sincerity giggled again be because did ask down for visit said rose what be going to do dear said to wife looked across to michael perhaps michael will come for stroll with said doubt will will have round of golf think on fine morning must like to have word with michael when have finished breakfast moment have gone whole manner changed be suffused with glow have lit last night will have talk dear said be tiresome being interrupted last night father be better pleased with morning michael understanding of situation grew clearer be change in mother perhaps portended be certainly accompanied by two symptom one late dawning of mother love for other certain fear of husband for married life have be completely dominated by have lived in twilight of own now into twilight be beginning to steal dread of pleasure vexation have begun to affect emotionally instead of being a before merely recorded in mind a might have recorded object quite exterior to herself seen out of window now be in room with even a michael left to speak with consciousness of rose again in making face anxious will try not to vex wo said father be in smoking room standing enormously in front of fire for first time sense of colossal fatuity struck michael there be several thing want to tell about said career first of take that have intention of deferring to wish on subject father be afraid not said michael want to understand then that though will not speak to again about wish be le strong than be be something to to know that man whom respect so much a emperor doe feel a do about doe alter view understand said next be about mother said do notice change in yes said michael can describe at michael hesitated show quite new affection for myself said came talked to last night in way have never done before irritation michael mere presence produced on father be beginning to make felt fact that michael be squat long armed ugly have always side blow to deal at lord ashbridge in reminder that be father tried to disregard tried to bring mind into impartial attitude without seeing for moment bitter irony of considering impartiality ideal quality when dealing with son tried to be fair michael be perfectly conscious of effort cost have noticed something of sort said mother be always asking after have not be writing very regularly michael know little about life have written to mother week said magical effect of emperor interest be dying out lord ashbridge became more keenly aware of disappointment that michael be to have not be so fortunate then said michael remembered mother anxious face must not let pas sir said never answered of letter thought quite probable that displeased to hear from must have expressed displeasure if have felt said father with pomposity be natural to have not occurred to said michael be afraid took silence to mean that letter did interest paused moment rebellion against whole of father attitude flared up besides have nothing particular to say said life be passed in pursuit of entirely disapprove felt back in boyhood again with stifling leaden atmosphere of authority disapproval to breathe knew that francis in place must have done somehow differently must almost hear aunt barbara laughing at pomposity of situation have suddenly erected monstrously in front of fact that be michael comber vexed father there be statement of case so succinctly true lord ashbridge moved away towards window turning back on michael even back homespun norfolk jacket loose knickerbockers stalwart calf expressed disapproval when father spoke again realised that have moved away like obscured face for different reason have noticed anything else about mother asked that made michael understand yes father said daresay be wrong about naturally may not agree with must like to know what be be afraid of said michael lord ashbridge continued looking out of window little longer letting eye dwell on own garden own field where towered leafless elm red roof of little town have given own name continued to give so satisfactory income there presented to mind own picture painted framed glazed hung up by beneficent nobleman conscientious landlord essential vertebra of england backbone be really impossible to impute blame to fine fellow turned round into room again braced refreshed saw michael thus be quite true what say said with certain pride in own impartiality have developed extraordinary timidity towards have continually noticed that be nervous agitated in presence be quite unable to account for in fact there be accounting for be thinking of going up to london before long making see good doctor little tonic daresay though suppose have taken dozen dos of medicine in a many year expect will be glad to go up for will be near one delusion for be le than be a strange a other drew up to full magnificent height mean that be not very natural must be devoted to son said with tremendous air what did mean be therefore uncertain again changed subject there be third thing said concern be of age when comber usually marry must wish to marry michael during last year mother have asked dozen girl down here of whom consider perfectly suitable doubt have met more in london must like to know definitely if have considered question if have not ask to set about at once michael be suddenly aware that never for moment have sylvia be away from mind even when mother be talking to last night sylvia have sat at back in inmost place throned secure now stepped forward apart from impossibility of not acknowledging wished to do wanted to wear publicly though be not wanted to take allegiance oath though sovereign heeded not have considered question said have quite made up mind whom want to marry be miss falbe miss sylvia falbe of whom may have heard a singer be sister of music master can certainly marry nobody else be not merely defiance of dreadful old tradition lord ashbridge have announced in manner of moses stepping down from sinai prompted appalling statement of case be joy in profession of love have to be flung out like lord ashbridge looked at moment in dead silence have not honour of knowing miss miss falbe be said will have honour michael got up there be that in father tone stung to fury be very likely that will not said since when proposed to yesterday did not accept somehow lord ashbridge felt that a insult to indeed be double insult michael have proposed to singer singer have not instantly clutched gave dreadful little treble giggle be to bind up broken heart asked michael drew up to full height be indiscretion for made father recognise how short be brought farce into tragic situation oh by mean said heart be not going to break yet give up hope then in flash thought of mother pale anxious face desire that must not vex father be sorry said be case wish wish must try to understand find incomprehensible said lord ashbridge left room with high walk swinging elbow well be done now michael felt that there be new vexation to be sprung on father be bound to happen supposed sooner later be not sorry that have happened sooner than expected intended sylvia so held sway in that must not help acknowledging announcement have broken from irresistibly in spite of mother whispered word to last night be secret must not be secret when father spoke like then with flare of illumination perceived how intensely father disliked nothing sheer basic antipathy must have be responsible for miserable retort be to bind up broken heart anger doubt be immediate cause so utterly ungenerous rejoinder to michael announcement must not have be conceived except in heart thoroughly rootedly disliked that be continual monument of disappointment to father knew well never before have be quite plainly shown how essential object of dislike be ground of dislike be now equally plain father disliked exactly because be father on other hand last twenty four hour have shown that mother loved exactly because be son when two new undeniable fact be put side by side michael felt that be infinite gainer went rather drearily to window far off across field below garden must see lord ashbridge walking airily along on way to link with head held high stick swinging in hand two retriever at heel doubt already soothing influence of nature be at work nature of course standing for portion of tree earth house belonged to be expunging depressing reflection that wife only son inspired in indeed such be actually case lord ashbridge in amazing fatuity must not long continue being without being cheered invigorated by fact though when set out big white hand be positively trembling with passion carried balsam always with have registered to even a michael have registered fact that found son most intolerable person what vexed most of what made clang gate at end of field so violently that hit one of retriever shrewdly on nose be sense of own impotence knew perfectly well that in point of view of determination that quality in be firmness in who opposed obstinacy michael be match annoying thing be that a wife have once told michael undoubtedly inherited that quality from be a inalienable a estate of have threatened to deprive son a knew quite well be absolutely entailed michael in regard seemed better than common successful thief have annexed father firmness at death must certainly annex picture tree acre red roof of ashbridge michael saw gate so imperially slammed heard despairing howl of robin though be sorry for robin must not help laughing remembered also ludicrous sight have seen at zoological garden few day ago two seal sitting bolt upright quarrelling with other making most absurd grimace noise of quite dared to attack other so sat with face close together saying rudest thing aunt barbara must certainly have seen how inimitably father have in interview just now resembled two seal then became aware that time au fond have thought about nothing sylvia of sylvia not a subject of quarrel a just sylvia singing sylvia with hand on shoulder winter sun be warm on south terrace of house when hour later strolled out according to arrangement with mother have melted rime of night before lay now on grass in thread of minute diamond though below terrace wall on sunk rim of empty garden bed still persisted in outline of white heraldry few monthly rose weak pink blossom weary with toil of keeping hope alive till coming of spring hung dejected head in sunk garden where hornbeam hedge carried russet leaf unfallen shaded from wind here too few bulb have pricked way above ground stood with stout erect horn daintily capped with rime thing for year have be presented to lady ashbridge notice without attracting attention now filled with minute childlike pleasure be discovery a entrancing a magical a first finding of oval piece of blue sky that child see one morning in hedge sparrow nest now that be alone with son secret restlessness anxiety have vanished remarked almost with glee that husband have telephoned from golf link to say that must not be back for lunch then remembering that michael have gone to talk to father after breakfast asked about interview michael have already made up mind a to what to say here knowing that father be anxious about felt highly unlikely that must tell anything to distress so represented interview a having gone off in perfect amity later in day on father return have made up mind to propose truce between a far a mother be concerned whether must be accepted not must not certainly tell in interval there be nothing to be gained by grieving great weight be lifted off mind ah dear be good said be anxious so now perhaps will have peaceful christmas be glad aunt barbara francis be coming for though aunt always laugh at father doe kindly doe not a for francis dear if god have given two son must have liked other to be like francis will walk little farther way see poor petsy grave petsy grave proved rather agitating there be doleful little story of last day to be related petsy ii be tiresome insisted on defying world generally with shrill barkings from top of small mound conscious perhaps that helpless predecessor slept below then walk brought to band of tree separated link from house from lady ashbridge retreated fearful a vaguely phrased of being seen by whom there be need for to explain then across field came group of child scampering home from school ceased shouting game a others came near demurely curtsied took off cap to lady ashbridge nice well behaved child said merry christmas to hope be good child to mother a son be to pressed arm nodded smiled at child walked on with michael felt lump in throat arrival of aunt barbara francis afternoon did something by mere addition of number to party to relieve tension of situation lord ashbridge said little ate largely during interval of empty plate directed impartial gaze at portrait of ancestor while wholly ignoring descendant michael be too wise to put into place where must be pointedly ignored resplendent dinner with six footman silver service be not really more joyless than usual father majestic displeasure be more apparent when three men sat alone afterwards be in dead silence that port be pushed round cigarette handed francis be true made couple of effort to enliven thing remark produced response whatever from uncle subsided into thinking with regret of what amusing evening must have have if have only stopped in town when rose michael signed to cousin to go on planted firmly in path to door be evident that father did not mean to speak to must not push by walk over there be one thing want to say to father said have told mother that interview morning be quite amicable see why must be distressed by knowing that be not father face softened moment yes agree to that said a far a went compact be observed whenever lady ashbridge be present husband made point of addressing few remark to michael there intercourse ended michael found opportunity to explain to aunt barbara what have happened suggesting a consolatory simile domestic difficulty of seal at zoological garden be pleased to find recognise aptness of description heaviest of on spirit of whole party sat anxiety about lady ashbridge there must be doubt that cerebral degeneration be occurring lady barbara urgent representation to brother have effect of making promise to take up to london without delay after christmas let specialist see for present pious fraud practised on that michael father have have good talk together be excellent friend sufficed to render happy cheerful have long dim talk full of repetition with michael whose presence appeared to make completely content when be out away from must sit eagerly waiting for return petsy to great benefit of health got somewhat neglected by whole nature instinct be alight with mother love have burnt so late into flame with tragic accompaniment of derangement seemed to be groping way back to day when michael be little boy be young woman often must seat at piano if michael be not there to play to in thin quavering voice sing song of twenty year ago must listen to playing beating time to music most of loved hour when day be drawing in first shadow flame of dusk firelight then with hand in sitting in room where must not be interrupted must whisper fresh inquiry about sylvia offering to go to girl tell how lovable suitor be lived in dim subaqueous sort of consciousness physically quite well mentally serene in knowledge that michael be in house must presently come talk to for others be dismal enough shadow be to watery sunlight lay over further quarrel unknown to between michael father when met a at meal time there be miserable pretence of friendliness comfortable ease kept up for fear of distressing lady ashbridge be dreary work for concerned luckily not difficult of accomplishment little chatter about weather merest small change of conversation especially if conversation be held between michael father be sufficient to wreathe in smile must according to habit break in with wrecking remark entailed starting talk afresh when left room glowering silence must fall lord ashbridge must pick up book leave room with high stepping walk erect head picture of insulted dignity of three be far most to be pitied although situation be direct result of own arrogance self importance arrogance self importance be a essential ingredient of character a be humour of aunt barbara be very awkward tiresome quality particular lord ashbridge must have existence without be deeply mortally offended with michael that alone be sufficient to make sultry stifling atmosphere in addition to that have burden of anxiety about wife here came extra sting for in common humanity have by appearing to be friend with michael to secure serenity must only be done by continued profanation of own highly proper necessary attitude towards son have to address friendly word to michael really almost choked have to practise cordiality with wretch who wanted to marry sister of music master michael have pulled up old tradition carefully tended pompous flower garden a if have be weed thrown in father face be indeed wonder that in wife absence almost burst with indignation over desecrated bed more than that own self esteem be hurt by wife fear of just a if have be hard unkind husband to have not be merely very self absorbed dominant one while one person who must make quite happy be despised son michael person michael taste michael whole presence character be repugnant to yet michael have power to do lord ashbridge justice must have given much to be possessed of of bringing comfort serenity to wife on afternoon of day following christmas two cousin have be across estuary to ashbridge together francis who in spite of habitual easiness of disposition general good temper have found condition of anger anxiety quite intolerable have settled to leave next day instead of stopping till end of week michael acquiesced in without sense of desertion have really only wondered why francis have stopped three night instead of finding urgent private business in town after one realised also somewhat with surprise that francis be good when there be trouble about there be one so delightful when there be so to speak contest of who must enjoy most francis invariably won if subject of contest be changed prize given for individual who under depressing circumstance must contrive to show greatest serenity of aspect francis must have lost with even greater margin michael in fact be rather relieved than otherwise at cousin immediate departure for helped nobody to see martyred st sebastian be merely odious for st sebastian in fact at moment when michael be rowing back across full flooded estuary francis be explaining with customary lucidity do good here mike said uncle robert doe speak to more than doe to except when aunt marion be there there be nothing going on be there practically asked if might go duck shooting to day uncle robert merely looked out of window if anybody specially wanted to stop why of course must said michael thanks awfully gosh look at duck be just wanting to be shot there be then certainly uncle robert doe want aunt marion say do think be matter with michael looked round then took rather too late pull on oar boat gently grated on pebbly mud at side of landing place francis question good humoured insouciance of grated on mind in rather similar fashion know yet said expect will go back to town in couple of day so that may see somebody francis jumped out briskly gracefully stood with hand in pocket while michael pushed off again brought boat into shed do hope be nothing serious said look quite well doe daresay be nothing be be alone have with uncle robert week must give hump too michael felt sudden spasm of impatience at elegant consoling reflection now in light of own increasing maturity saw how hopeless be to feel francis deficiency entire lack of deep feeling be made like if be fond of anybody only possible way of living up to affection be to attach to quality strolled little way in silence why did tell uncle robert about sylvia falbe asked francis ca understand for present anyhow have refused there be nothing to tell about if be fond of girl like must say nothing about if knew people must disapprove until have got michael laughed oh yes must said if be to use own word fond of 'like that ' must help at least must be be such glory to be fond like that stopped wo talk about said rather ca talk about if understand have refused said sensible francis make difference shine through everything through infernal awfulness of day through father anger mother illness whatever prof to be think about really with might at end find have be thinking about sylvia everything be wood tide oh ca explain have walked across marshy land at edge of estuary now in front of be steep direct path up to house longer way through wood at point estuary made sudden turn to left sweeping directly seaward round corner immediately in front of be long reach of deep water up even when tide be at lowest ocean going steamer must penetrate if knew winding of channel to day in windless cold calm of mid winter though sun be brilliant in blue sky overhead opaque mist thick a cotton wool lay over surface of water taking winding road through wood following estuary turned point presently found a mounted quite clear of mist that lay below on river step be noiseless on mossy path almost immediately after have turned corner a francis paused to light cigarette heard from just below creaking of oar in rowlock caught ear of without conscious curiosity listened on moment sound of rowing ceased from dense mist just below there came sound be quite unmistakable namely plop of something heavy dropped into water sound by remote form of association suddenly recalled to michael mind certain question aunt barbara have asked about emperor stay at ashbridge own recollection of having gone up down river in launch there be something further did not immediately recollect yes be request that if when be here at christmas found stranger hanging about deep water reach of chart be known only to admiralty must let know here at moment be overlooking mist swathed water here at moment unseen be boat rowing stealthily stopping perhaps making sounding laid hand on francis arm with gesture for silence then invisible below someone said fifteen fathom again oar creaked audibly in rowlock michael took step towards cousin so that must whisper to come back to boat said want to row round see who be wait moment though oar below made half dozen stroke then be still again once more there came sound of something heavy dropped into water someone be making sounding in channel there said come went very quietly till be round point then quickened step spoke be uncharted channel said at least only admiralty have sounding water deep enough right across for ship of moderate draught to come up there be channel up man of war can pas of course may be admiralty boat making fresh sounding not likely on boxing day what be going to do asked francis striding easily along by michael short step just see if can find out who be aunt barbara asked about will tell afterwards now tide going out can drop down with sha be heard will row just enough to keep head straight sit in bow francis keep sharp look out foot by foot dropped down river soon came into thick mist that lay beyond point be impossible to see more than yard two ahead same dense obscurity must prevent further range of vision from other boat if be still at work sound of oar of voice michael reflected might guide to from lisp of little wavelet lapping on shore below wood knew be quite close in to bank close also to place where invisible boat have be ten minute before then in bewildering unlocalised manner in sound without corrective guidance of sight come to ear heard a before creaking of invisible oar somewhere quite close at hand next moment dark prow of rowing boat suddenly loomed into sight on starboard took rapid stroke with right hand scull to bring up to at same moment while yet occupant of other boat be shadow in mist saw quick word of command rang out row row hard cried with frenzied churning of oar in water other boat shot by making down estuary next moment have quite vanished in mist leaving behind knot of swirling water from oar blade michael started in vain pursuit craft be heavy clumsy from retreating faint growing sound of other be clear that must get pace to match still le to overtake soon pantingly desisted admiralty boat must have run away said 'd have asked who devil be who else be asked francis michael mopped forehead aunt barbara must tell said must tell that be german spy francis laughed timbuctoo nigger remarked must be odd thing too said michael at moment felt first chill of shadow menaced if by chance aunt barbara be right if already clear tranquillity of sky be growing dim a with mist lay afternoon on water of deep reach covered mysterious movement be going on below england germany there be so much of life heart there music song sylvia chapter x michael have heard verdict of brain specialist who yesterday have seen mother be sitting in room beside unopened piano quietly assimilating without making plan of own initiative contemplating form into future be beginning to fall mapping out below outlining a when object in room a light of morning steal in take shape again even a take familiar shape so already felt that have guessed in week down at ashbridge from have returned with father mother couple of day before be suffering without doubt from softening of brain nothing of remedial nature must possibly be done to arrest cure progress of disease lay in human power be to secure for a much content serenity a possible in present condition there be question of putting under restraint indeed must be certified by doctor a insane must have to have trained attendant must live secluded life from must be kept a far a possible anything must agitate distress after there be nothing more must be done except to wait for inevitable development of malady might come quickly slowly there be mean of forecasting that though rapid deterioration of brain have taken place during last two month made on whole likely that progress of disease must be swift be quite possible on other hand that might remain stationary for month in answer to question of michael sir james have looked at moment in silence then answered for sake for sake of of have said one hope that will be swift lord ashbridge have just telephoned that be coming round to see michael message considerably astonished since must have be more in manner in unlikely event of wishing to see son to have summoned to house in curzon street however have announced advent thus waiting for not much concerning about michael let future map already be sharply defined boundary limit be clear though be yet untravelled presented to familiar aspect felt that must find allotted road without fail though have never yet traversed be strongly marked there must be difficulty question about indeed week ago when first recognition of mother condition with symptom attached to be known to have seen signpost directed into future lord ashbridge made usual flamboyant entry prancing swinging elbow happened must still be lord ashbridge with grey top hat large carnation enviable position will have heard what sir james opinion be about poor mother said be in consequence of what recommended when talked over future with came to see michael guessed very well what recommendation be with certain stubbornness sense of what be due to let father proceed with not very welcome task of telling in fact michael said have favour to ask of fact of being lord ashbridge fact of michael being unsatisfactory son stiffened have to qualify favour perhaps must not say be about to ask favour corrected rather to point out to what be obvious duty suddenly struck michael that father be not thinking about lady ashbridge at about in main about have to be done from dominant standpoint owed to to alleviate condition under wife must live owed to

scheme repair of round of golf afternoon of reading lesson handing offertory box on sunday that at least be sum total a presented to on framed conclusion left out altogether moral effect of big landlord living on own land being surrounded by own dependent father on other hand so vastly over estimated be clear that there be not likely to be much accord between on subject must not go down there perhaps once twice week get bailey to come consult here asked lord ashbridge held head very high must be completely out of question said michael felt have nothing to do with problem of mother be outside altogether concerned only father convenience be willing to press point a far a possible have imagined must stop in london said supposing under circumstance refuse to live with must draw own conclusion a to sincerity of profession of duty towards mother practically what must do asked michael mother must go to ashbridge tomorrow same alternative suddenly suggested to michael be almost ashamed of proposing for implied that father put own convenience a outweighing other consideration saw that if only lord ashbridge be selfish enough to consent to have manifest merit mother must be alone with free of presence so disconcerted propose then said that must remain in town a want to be at ashbridge have be almost ashamed of suggesting such shame be reflected in father mind must relieve of perpetual embarrassment of wife presence perpetual irritation of michael have persuaded that be making tremendous personal sacrifice in proposing that michael must live with relieved of necessity upon word michael said with first hint of cordiality that have displayed that be very well thought of let consider be certainly case that derangement in poor mother mind have caused to take

be lonely doubt at ashbridge own personal feeling must not be taken into account yes seems to very sensible notion will have to see what mother say to might not like to be away from in spite of apparent er dislike of must depend on attitude for part think very well of scheme thank michael for suggesting left immediately after to ascertain lady ashbridge feeling about walked home with complete resumption of usual exuberance indeed seemed admirable plan relieved from nightmare of wife continual presence expressed to by thinking that relieved from be not that be deficient in sympathy for for in self centred way be fond of must sympathise with just a well at ashbridge must do good to have not for instinct of love must make impossible for to leave must also be spared constant irritation of having michael in house expressed to by saying that michael disliked must be far more at ease without furthermore michael must be able to continue study of too in spite of fact that have always done best to discourage made self laudatory translation by telling that be very glad not to have to cause michael to discontinue in fine persuaded without difficulty that be very fine fellow in consenting to plan suited so admirably only wondered that have not thought of there be nothing after wife have expressed joyful acceptance of to detain in town left for ashbridge afternoon while michael moved into house in curzon street michael entered upon new life without smallest sense of having done anything exceptional even creditable be so perfectly obvious to that have to be with mother that have inclination to regard at in matter thing be a simple a have be to to help francis out of financial difficulty with gift of money there be effort of will sense of sacrifice about be

doorway come on mike said laughing thank pretty lady gentleman lord be lark michael advanced with stared hoped smiled properly though felt that be nailing hideous grimace to face then just below saw mother eagerly pointing out to total stranger with gesticulation just behind sylvia looking at not at with such tenderness such kindly pity there be two most intimately bound into life mother who wanted girl whom wanted by side be hermann who a michael always knew have thrown open gate of life to rest even including aunt barbara seemed of significance in moment afterwards doubt must be glad be pleased be proud of having pleased just now even when for first time in life that intoxicating wine of appreciation be given stood with bubbling yellow in hand not drinking of michael have prepared way of sylvia coming by telling mother identity of nice young lady at concert have also impressed on paramount importance of not saying anything with regard to must possibly embarrass nice young lady when sylvia came to tea few day later be quite without uneasiness while for be only conscious of thirst for physical presence desire a have said to aunt barbara just to see be there slightest embarrassment in meeting be clear that there be not least difficulty for in being natural a usually happens be complete solution be good of to come said meeting almost at door mother have be looking

usually take hat off for on word sylvia hand be busy with hatpin be so glad suggested that said always want to take hat off know who invented hat wish have lady ashbridge looked at mass of bright hair

faint treble sound knew to be soldier farewell then presently nurse came for to lie down before dinner be inclined to be tearful refuse to go till michael made clear that be express sovereign will that must do so then very audibly whispered to may ask to give kiss said look so kind michael think must mind sylvia went back home with little heartache for michael wondering if be in place if mother instead of being absorbed in novel demanded such incessant attention whether have sufficient love in heart to render with exquisite simplicity tender patience that michael showed well a knew greatly a liked have not imagined that indeed man must have behaved quite like there seemed effort at about be not trying to be patient have sense of patience perfect work natural to did not seem to have to remind that mother be ill thus must be gentle with be gentle with because be in gentle yet though behaviour be effort to guessed how wearying must be continual strain of situation felt that must get cross from mere fatigue however excellent intention might be however willing spirit one so have understood from barbara must take michael place in occasional absence mother be fretful miserable day by day michael left le must sit close to when be practising thing to to hermann must have rendered practice impossible if wrestled with one hand over difficult bar must take other into hers must ask if be not getting tired must recommend to rest for little yet michael who last summer have so stubbornly insisted on leading own life have put determination into effect in teeth of domestic opposition now with more than cheerfulness laid own life aside in order to look after mother sylvia felt that real heroism of life be not so much fine heady deed be so obviously admirable a such serene steadfastness such unvarying patience a have just seen whole soul applauded michael yet below applause be heartache for desire to be able to help to bear burden must be so heavy though bore so blithely in very nature of thing there be one way in must help in be powerless must not give what wanted longed to be able to chapter xi be morning of early march michael looking out from dining room window at house in curzon street where have just breakfasted alone be smitten with wonder secret ecstasy for suddenly saw felt that be winter no longer that spring have come for last week sky have screamed with outrageous wind have be populous with flock of sullen cloud discharged in sleet snowy rain half last night for have slept very badly have heard dashing of shower a of wind driven spray against window pane have listened to fierce rattling of frame towards morning have slept during hour seemed that new heaven new earth have come into being vitally essentially world be different affair altogether at back of house on to window looked be garden of half acre square of somewhat sooty grass bounded by high wall with few tree at further end into too have message thrilled through bone penetrated little oasis of doubtful grass blackened shrub have totally different aspect to day from have worn week sparrow have sat with fluffed up feather in corner sheltered from gale be suddenly busy shrilly vocal chirruping dragging about straw flying from limb to limb of tree with twig in beak for first time noticed that little verdant cabochon of folded leaf have globed on lilac bush below window crocus have budded in garden bed have shot up pushing spike of bulb while in sooty grass must see speck patch of vivid green first growth of year opened window strolled out whole taste savour of air be changed borne on primrose coloured sunshine came smell of damp earth no longer dead reeking of decay of autumn redolent with new element something fertile fecund something daintily indefinably laden with secret of life restoration grey lumpy cloud be gone instead chariot of dazzling white bowled along infinite blue expanse harnessed to southwest wind above sparrow dragged straw to fro loudly chirruping spring be indexed there for moment michael be entranced with exquisite moment stood sunning soul in spring then felt fetter of own individual winter heavy on again must only see what be happening without feeling for moment have felt leap in blood next be conscious again of immense fatigue that for week have be growing on task have voluntarily taken on have become no lighter with incessant attendance on mother strain of got heavier day by day for time now childlike content in presence have be clouded instead be constantly depressed constantly querulous with finding fault with word silence in confused muffled manner blaming affixing sinister motif to most innocent action be still entirely dependent on if left for hour two must wait in agony of anxiety for return when came back overwhelmed with tearful caress exaction of promise not to go away again then feeling certain of once more must start again on complaint reproach doctor have warned that looked a if new phase of illness be approaching might necessitate complete curtailment of liberty day have succeeded to day still remained in same condition better worse making moment burden to michael have be necessary that sylvia must discontinue visit for week ago lady ashbridge have suddenly taken dislike to when came must sit in silent lofty displeasure speaking to a little a possible treating with chilling awful politeness michael have enough influence with mother to prevent telling girl what crime have be be refusal to marry when be alone with mother have to listen to torrent of complaint lady ashbridge with wealth of language have lain dormant in life sarcastically supposed that miss falbe be princess in disguise very impenetrable disguise for be sure reminds of barmaid more than princess thought that marriage must be beneath time hinted that miss falbe might be already married indeed seemed very plausible explanation of attitude desired in fact that sylvia must not come to see more now when did not there be scarcely day in lady ashbridge must not talk in pointed manner about pretended friend who leave alone wo even take trouble to take two penny 'bus if be so poor a that to come from chelsea to curzon street michael knew that mother step be getting nearer nearer to border line separate sane from insane with wearing strain of day a passed have one desire in heart namely to keep on right side for a long a be humanly possible something might happen new symptom develop must make impossible for to go on living with a did now dread of moment haunted waking hour dream two month ago doctor have told that for sake of everyone concerned be to be hoped that progress of disease must be swift for part michael passionately disclaimed such wish in spite of constant complaint stricture be still possessed of love for wearing though day be grudged passing of hour brought nearer to awful boundary line have deed be presented to for signature bound indefinitely to mother service on condition that got worse pen must have spluttered with eagerness to sign in consequence of mother dislike to sylvia michael have hardly seen during last month once when owing to small physical disturbance lady ashbridge have gone to bed early on sunday evening have gone to one of falbes weekly party have tried to fling with enjoyment into friendly welcoming atmosphere for present felt detached from for life with mother be close round with sort of nightmare obsession through outside influence desire must only faintly trickle knew that other life be there knew that in heart longed for sylvia a much a ever in present detachment desire for be drowsy ache remote emptiness veil lay over mother seemed to lie over also once indeed during evening when have played for veil have lifted for drowsy ache have sunlit stabbing pang a left veil dropped again let into big mute house sorry that have left in same way too music be in abeyance must not concentrate find worth while to make effort to absorb in knew that short of there be profit pleasure for in piano everything seemed remote compared with immediate foreground there be gap gulf between rest of world father wrote to from time to time laying stress on extreme importance of be doing in country giving hint of coming up to town at present faintly adumbrated time when in natural course of event must have to attend to national duty in house of lord wondered whether must not about then be good for wife to have change enjoy country when weather became more propitious michael with excusable unfilialness did not answer amazing epistle having basked in unconscious humour sent on to aunt barbara weekly report be sent by lady ashbridge nurse to father michael have nothing whatever to add to fear of have given place to quiet contempt did not care to think about certainly did not care to express now then lady ashbridge have what michael thought of a good hour two when went back to content childlike joy in presence be clear when presently came downstairs a still lingered in garden reading daily paper in sun that one of better interval have visited too appeared felt waving of magic wand of spring noted sign of with joy be infinitely pathetic dear said what beautiful morning be wise to sit out of door without hat michael will not go fetch for then let sit here talk be spring be not look how bird be collecting twig for nest wonder how know that time have come round again sweet little bird how bold merry be edged way little nearer so that shoulder leaned on arm dear wish be going to nest too said wonder do think have be ill natured unkind to sylvia that make not come to see now do remember being vexed at for not wanting to marry perhaps talked unkindly about be sorry for being cross to will do good will only make more unwilling than ever to marry man who have unpleasant mamma will come to see again do think if ask good hour be too rare in appearance swift in vanishing to warrant certainty that must feel same afternoon michael tried to turn subject ah will have to think about mother said look there be quarrel going on between two sparrow want same straw followed pointing finger easily diverted oh wish must not quarrel said be so sad stupid to quarrel instead of being agreeable pleasant like to do that there one have flown away see crocus be coming up indeed be spring must like to see country to day if be not busy michael must take out into country might go to richmond park perhaps for be in opposite direction from ashbridge look at deer budding tree oh michael might take lunch with eat out of door want to enjoy a much a can of spring day clung closer to michael everything seems so fragile dear whispered everything may break sometimes be frightened little expedition be soon moving after slight altercation between lady ashbridge nurse whom wished to leave behind in order to enjoy michael undiluted society miss baker who have already spoken to michael telling be not quite happy in mind about patient be firm about accompanying though obligingly effaced a far a possible by taking box seat by chauffeur a drove down when arrived michael mother strolled about in warm sunshine before lunch keeping carefully in background just ready to come if be wanted indeed seemed a if such precaution be necessary for never have lady ashbridge be more amenable more blissfully content in son companionship vernal hour that first smell of rejuvenated earth a stirred awoke from winter sleep have reached le than have reached springing grass heart of buried bulb never perhaps in life have be happier than on balmy morning of early march here stir of spring have crept across mile of smoky house to garden behind curzon street be more actively effervescent bare leafless choir of tree have be empty of song winter be once more resonant with feathered worshipper through tussock of grey grass of last year be pricking vivid shoot of green over grove of young birch hazel dim purple veil of spring hung mistlike down by water edge of penn pond strayed where moor hen scuttled out of rhododendron bush overhung lake hurried across surface of water half swimming half flying for shelter of securer retreat there too found plantation of willow already in bud with soft moleskin button tortoiseshell butterfly evoked by sun from hibernation settled on one of twig opening shutting diapered wing spreading to warmth to thaw out stiffness inaction of winter blackbird fluted in busy thicket lark shot up near soaring singing till became invisible in luminous air suspended carol in blue bold male chaffinch seeking mate with twittered song fluttered with burr of throbbing wing promise of spring be there dim fragile sure on day of day pearl emerged from darkness stress of winter iridescent with tender colour of dawning year lunched in open motor miss baker again obligingly removing to box seat spreading rug on grass sat in sunshine while lady ashbridge talked silently watched michael a smoked always with smile one little note of sadness have sounded when said be frightened lest everything must break have not rung again yet day michael heard echoing somewhere dimly behind song of wind bird shoot of growing tree lurked in thicket just eluding not presenting to direct gaze felt that saw out of corner of eye only to lose when looked at yet for week mother have never seemed so well cloud have lifted off morning for vague presage of trouble somehow haunted mind refusing to be disentangled must have believed that after medical opinion might be at fault that instead of passing more deeply into shadow a have be warned be inevitable might at least maintain level to have returned to day day have be a be before darkness discontent of last week have come upon who knew now so well must certainly have affirmed that have recovered serenity of month ago be so much so tremendously much that must do if only must remain a have be day must at rate be happy happier perhaps than have consciously be in stifled year have preceded nothing else at moment seemed to matter except preservation to of such content how eagerly must have given service that young manhood have to offer if by that must keep from going further into bewildering darkness that have be told awaited there be little trouble though more than shadow of passing cloud when at last said that must be getting back to town for afternoon be beginning to wane besought for five minute more of sitting here in sunshine be still warm when minute be over begged for yet postponement then quiet imposition of will suddenly conquered got up dear will do what like with said for have given such happy day will remember that michael have be nice day might do think ask miss falbe to come to tea with when get back can say 'no if come will be very good not vex a got back into motor stood up for moment vague blue eye scanning sky tree stretch of sunlit park good bye lake happy lake moor hen said good bye tree grass be growing green again good bye pretty peaceful thing michael have hesitation in telephoning to sylvia when got back to town asking if must come have tea with mother for gentle affectionate mood of morning still lasted eagerness to see sylvia be only equalled by eagerness to be agreeable to be greedy whenever must be done to secure pleasure for mother one seemed in present mood perfectly safe one added to impulse in sufficient there be own longing to see again that thirst never left soon after have got back to curzon street sylvia be with a before in preparation for long visit have taken off hat to day divested of without suggestion on lady ashbridge part immensely pleased look michael said miss falbe mean to stop long time be sweet of be not be not in such hurry to get away today sugar miss falbe yes remember take sugar milk cream well do think be nice sylvia have seen neither mother son for couple of week eye coming fresh to noticed much change in in lady ashbridge change though marked be indefinable enough seemed to girl to have somehow gone much further off than have be before have faded become indistinct be evident that found except when be talking to michael far greater difficulty in expressing channel of communication a be be getting choked with michael change be easily stated looked terribly tired be evident that strain of week be telling heavily on yet a sylvia noticed with sudden sense of personal pride in not one jot of patient tenderness for mother be abated tired a be nervous on edge whenever dealt with talking to watching for little attention might need face be alert with love noticed that when footman brought in tea in arranging cup let spoon slip jangling from saucer michael jumped a if bomb have gone off under breath said to man clumsy fool little a incident be knowing michael courtesy politeness found significant a bearing on evidence of tired face then next moment mother said something to instantly love transformed irradiated to day more than ever before lady ashbridge seemed to exist only through a sylvia knew have be for last few week constantly disagreeable to wondered whether exacting meticulous affection be not harder to bear yet michael in spite of nervous strain now showed so clearly seemed to find difficulty at in responding to might have worn nerve to tatter tenderness love of passed unhampered through frayed communication for be who be brought into play be of that michael now more more triumphantly revealed that sylvia felt so proud a if have be possession achievement wholly personal to be michael be just that be becoming evident since nothing else must account for claim of unconsciously whispered by to herself be not long before lady ashbridge nurse appeared to take upstairs to rest at patient became suddenly unaccountably agitated happy content of day be wiped off mind clung to michael michael said must take away know be going to take away from altogether must leave nurse baker came towards now lady must behave like said know be only going upstairs to rest a usual before dinner will see lord comber again then shrank from shielding behind michael shoulder michael repeated be going to be taken away from look miss ah dear have forgotten name look have got hat on be going to stop with long time michael must go michael saw nurse looking at watching with quiet eye of trained attendant then spoke to michael well if lord comber will just step outside with said will see if can arrange for to stop little longer will come back michael said michael saw that nurse wanted to say something to with infinite gentleness disentangled clinging of lady ashbridge hand why of course will said wo give miss falbe cup of tea lady ashbridge hesitated moment yes will do that said by time have done that will be back again wo michael followed nurse from room who closed door without shutting there be something like about evening said day have be rather anxious must be watched very carefully now want to get to come upstairs will try to make go to bed michael felt mouth go suddenly dry what do expect said expect anything must be prepared change come very quickly michael nodded went back together now mother darling said up go with nurse baker have be out day must have good rest before dinner will come up see soon curious sly look came into lady ashbridge face yes where be going to said how do know nurse baker will take to own room because promise will said michael instantly reassured mood after mood a michael saw be passing like shadow over mind ah be enough said good bye miss there name gone

about while be resting said keep nurse baker waiting longer mother nodded smiled must keep anybody waiting said father taught to be punctual when have left room together sylvia turned to michael michael dear said think be well think be michael saw that at moment be not thinking of at heart honoured for be anxious about mother to night said have be so suppose must call well day nurse be easy about suddenly fear fatigue trouble looked out of eye be frightened said be so unutterably feeble of be tired know how tired try a may feel that time be use mother be slipping slipping away dear wonder be tired said michael ca anybody help be right must do everything shook head smiling ca help said be only person who can help stood up bracing mind body be so brutally proud of said want well be lot for son to be able to say sylvia must give anything to keep still be not thinking of knowing that came close to put arm in longed to give feeling of comradeship must be sisterly to over without suggesting to what must not be to instinct have divined right felt answering pressure of elbow that acknowledged sympathy welcomed thought more about be giving everything to keep said be giving what further gift be there michael kept arm close pressed by knew by frankness of holding caress be thinking of still not at hoped a comrade who must perhaps be of assistance to courage clear sightedness in difficult hour wanted to be no more than to just now be most must do for with desire most acute have ever felt for wanted to accept to take comradeship a must have surely taken brother once in last intimate moment have have together have refused to accept attitude from have felt relationship altogether impossible have seen point of view recognised justice of embarrassment now very simply very eagerly hoped a with tugging strain that must not reject knew have missed brother who have refused to be brother to have be about own business have be doing own business with quiet splendour drew eye to a stood there thus linked wondered if heart be following have seen last december how reasonable be of to refuse domestic sort of intimacy with now found intensely longing that must not persist in refusal suddenly michael awoke to fact of presence abruptly moved away from thanks sylvia said know have good wish well be sure understand understood perfectly well understanding of cut to quick have got right to behave like to michael asked what have done that must treat quite like that looked at completely recalled in mind to alone hope desire of autumn smote with encompassing blow yes right

when be unclouded self want be a if a if have be raining day just on sunset there come gleam in west so soon after be night made gleam said sylvia so late so awfully late suddenly stood stiff listening to sound at present did not hear sounded little louder ear caught running of footstep on stair outside next moment door opened lady ashbridge maid put in pale face will go to ladyship lord said nurse want told to telephone to sir james sylvia moved with not disengaging arm towards door michael may wait said might want know please let wait lady ashbridge room be on floor above michael ran up intervening stair three at time knocked entered wondered why have be sent for for be sitting quietly on sofa near window noticed that nurse baker stood very close to otherwise there be nothing be in way out of ordinary here be said nurse reassuringly a entered lady ashbridge turned towards door a michael came in when met eye knew why have be sent for why at moment sir james be being summoned for looked at not with clouded eye of affection not with mother spirit striving to break through shrouding trouble of brain with eye of blank non recognition saw with bodily organ of vision picture of be conveyed further there be blank wall behind eye michael did not hesitate be possible that still might be something to that presence might penetrate be not resting mother said why be sitting up came to talk to a said must while rested suddenly into blank irresponsive eye there leaped recognition saw pupil contract a focused on hand in hand with recognition there leaped into hate instantly be veiled again have be there now be not banished lurked behind in shadow crouching waiting answered at once in voice be quite toneless seemed like of child repeating lesson have learned by heart must be pronounced while be thinking of something quite different be waiting till came dear said now will lie down come sit by michael watched narrowly while spoke then gave quick glance at nurse a if to see that be not making signal to other there be easy chair just behind head a michael wheeled up near sofa looked at nurse moved hand slightly towards left interpreting moved chair little to left so that must not sit a have intended quite close to sofa enjoyed day in country mother asked michael looked at sideways slowly then again a if recollecting task have committed to memory answered yes so much said tree bird sunshine enjoyed so much paused moment bring chair little closer darling said be so far off why do wait nurse will call if want michael felt one moment of sickening spiritual terror understood quite plainly why nurse baker did not want to go near to mother reason of gave pang not of nervousness of black horror that sane sensitive must always feel when be brought intimately in contact with blind derangement of instinct in most nearly allied to physically on material plane have fear at made movement grasping arm of chair a if to wheel closer came actually nearer why go away nurse said lady ashbridge leave son to talk about nice day in country nurse baker answered quite naturally want to talk too lady said went with lord comber enjoyed together seemed to michael that mother made violent effort towards control saw one of hand be lying on knee clench so that knuckle stood out white yes will talk together then said er will have little doze first be rather sleepy with so much pleasant air be sleepy too be not michael yes see look sleepy will have little nap a often do after tea then when be fresh again will come back nurse will talk over pleasant day when entered room michael have not quite closed door now a hour before heard step on stair moment afterwards mother heard too what be that said who be coming now to disturb just when wanted to have nap there came knock at door nurse baker did not move head continued watching patient with hand ready to act come in said not looking round lady ashbridge face be towards door a sir james entered suddenly sprang up in right hand lay beside be knife have doubt taken from tea table when came upstairs turned swiftly towards michael stabbed at with be trap cried have led into trap be going to take away michael have thrown up arm to shield head blow fell between shoulder elbow felt edge of knife grate on bone from deep in heart sprang leaping fountain of compassion love yearning pity chapter xii michael be sitting in big studio at falbes house late one afternoon at end of june warmth murmur of full blown summer filled air day have so far declined that ray of sun level in setting poured slantingly in through big window to north shining through foliage of plane tree outside made diaper of rosy illuminated spot angled shadow on whitewashed wall a leaf stirred in evening breeze pattern shifted twinkled now a wind blew aside bunch of foliage lake of rosy gold must spring up on wall then a breath of movement died green shadow grew thicker again faintly stirring through window to south hermann have caused to be cut there since studio be not used for painting purpose michael must see into patch of high walled garden where mr falbe be sitting in low basket chair completely absorbed in book of high born ludicrous adventure have made mild attempt when found that michael intended to wait for sylvia return to entertain till came with little oblique encouragement remarking on beauty warmth of evening pleasure of sitting out of door michael have induced to go out again leave alone in studio free to live over again that twenty four hour ago have changed life for reconstructed a sat on sofa dwelt on pearl moment of just time yesterday have come in found sylvia alone have got up remembered to give greeting just opposite fireplace have come face to face held in hand small white rose have plucked in tiny garden here in middle of london be not very fine specimen be rose have said in answer to depreciatory glance must see when have washed have to wash london flower then miracle happened michael with hand have just taken hers stroked petal of prized vegetable with thought in mind stronger than thought have be indigenous there since christmas a finger first touched rim of town bred petal undersized yet not quite lacking in rose quality have intended nothing more than to salute flower a sylvia made apology for one have to wash london flower a touched looked up at quiet usual song of thought towards grew suddenly loud stupefyingly sweet be a if from vacant hive door bee swarmed in eye a met thought saw expectancy welcome hand instead of stroking rose petal closed on rose on hand held kept close imprisoned strongly gripped must not remember if have spoken word have seen that in face rendered speech unnecessary knowing in bone blood of that be right kissed then have said yes michael hand still be tight on hers held crumpled rose when opened lover like to stroke kiss there be spot of blood in palm of where rose thorn have pricked just one drop of sylvia blood a kissed have wiped away with tip of tongue between lip smiling have said oh michael how silly have sat together on sofa where afternoon sat alone waiting for moment of half hour be a distinct a outline of tree hill just before storm yet be still entirely dream like knew have happened for nothing happening of must account now for fact of though there be nothing in world so true there be nothing so incredible be a clean cut in mind a etched line round line sprang flower singing bird for long space there be silence after have sat down then said think always loved michael only did know thereafter foolish love talk have claimed superiority there for have always loved have always known much time have be wasted owing to ignorance ought to have known time existed be theirs now in world there be more time than what have crumpled rose have petal rehabilitated thorn have pricked be peeled off wondered if hermann have come in yet then by vague process of locomotion found at piano with arm around neck sylvia have whispered verse of song of herself became little more definite over lover confession michael have so to speak nothing to confess have loved all along have wanted along there never have be least pretence nonsense about path be little more difficult to trace once have be traversed be clear enough have liked always have felt sister like from moment when hermann brought to house sister like have continued to feel even when michael have definitely declared there be thoroughfare there have missed that relationship when stopped did not mind telling now since be abandoned by not for world must have confessed before have missed have loved being asked to come see mother be during visit that have helped to pile barricade across sister thoroughfare with own hand began to share michael sense of impossibility of road must not walk down together for have to be either more le to other than during visit have begun to understand face little hid what michael love meant saw manifested towards mother be taught by learned supposed loved anyhow having seen must not want michael a brother longer if still wanted anything else supposed so supposed that time must mention that fact yes began to hope that must not be very long about michael went over very deliberately a sat waiting for twenty four hour later rehearsed moment that over over again in mind followed sylvia across to piano not hurrying step going through verse of song sang at pace at actually sang a dreamed recollected heard little stir in quiet house sylvia came met just a met yesterday in front of fireplace oh michael have be waiting long said yes hour perhaps couple of minute know ah if hour will apologise then excuse by saying that must have come earlier than intended if minute will praise for being so exceedingly punctual minute then said will praise instead praise be more convincing if somebody else doe yes be somebody else now be sensible have done thing told be going to do yes sylvia released hand from tell then said have seen father there be cloud on michael face there be such sunlight where soul sat that shadow must fall across oh yes saw said captured sylvia hand again what be more saw so to speak said realised that have existence independent of used to be sort of clock to must put hand to point to hour chose well have realised have really be ticking along on own account be quite respectful not only to doe matter to doe michael laughed a plaited finger in with hers father be so comic said unlike most great humourist humour be absolutely unconscious be perfectly well aware that meant to marry for told that last christmas adding that did not mean to marry so since then think be got used to used to fancy getting used to especially since have never seen said girl make le odd getting used to after seeing must be much more incredible be saying that in way have got used to just a be got used to being person not clock on chimney piece what seems to have made so much difference be what aunt barbara told last night namely that mother be tracy sylvia let be too much for in certain far away manner realises that be 'one of ' be comic be going to make best of appears to make best of ca beat that know in fact told to ask if might come pay respect to mother to morrow what about singing career asked michael laughed again be funny about also said father took absolutely for granted that having made tremendous social advance must bury past tracy part of a if have be something disgraceful exalted comber family agreed to overlook what did say oh told that of course must do a pleased about that for part must urge most strongly to hing of kind got four inch taller what be so odd be that a long a never opposed father wish a long a be clock on chimney piece be terrified at thought of opposing to made knee quake moment began doing so found there be nothing to be frightened at sylvia got up began walking up down long room what be to do about michael asked oh blush when think of conversation have with hermann about just before christmas when knew be going to propose to said must never give up singing can picture self importance of why doe seem to to matter two straw whether do not naturally want to earn living by more whether sing not doe matter even a word be in mouth try to imagine not singing more ca be become part of while blush to think of what said to hermann wonder whether be not true came sat down by again believe have got enough artistic instinct to understand that michael said to know what tremendous help be to one art to be professional to be judged seriously suppose that ideally if one love music a do one ought to be able to do one very best whether one be singing professionally not be hardly possible why whole difference between amateur professional be that amateur sing charmingly professional just sing only sing a well a possibly can not only because love because if will be dropped on to if continue not singing best will lose place have so hardly won can see perhaps not singing at literally never opening lip in song again ca see coming down to drill hall at brixton extremely beautifully dressed with row of pearl arriving rather late just singing charmingly be such spur to know serious musician judge one performance by highest possible standard be so relaxing to think that one can easily sing well enough that one can delight ninety nine hundredth of audience without real effort must sing lost chord ' move whole drill hall at brixton to tear there might be one man there who knew hermann other at end must just shrug shoulder ever so slightly must wish have never be born paused moment will not sing more at ever said must sing to who will take seriously judge ruthlessly to sing just well enough to please be possible will do either like mr falbe strayed in at moment with finger in book otherwise a purposeless a wandering mist be afraid might be going to get chilly remarked after hot day there be often cool evening will stop dine lord mean michael please certainly said michael then hope there will be something for to eat sylvia be there something to eat doubt will see to darling will just rest upstairs for little before dinner perhaps finish book so pleased be stopping drifted towards studio door in thistledown fashion catching at corner little then moving smoothly on again talking gently half to herself half to others hermann be not in yet if lord mean michael be going to stop here till dinnertime wo matter whether hermann come in in time to dress not a michael be not dressed either oh there be postman knock what noise be not expecting letter knock in question however proved to be hermann who a be generally case have forgotten latchkey ran into mother at studio door came sat down regardless of whether be wanted not between two on sofa took arm of probably intrude said such be intention have just seen lady barbara who say that shock have not be too much for mike father be good thing say be taking nourishment much a usual suppose ought to jest on so serious subject took cue from lady barbara appears that have blue blood too sylvia must behave more like aristocrat tracy in time of king john flirted if more with comber what about career sylvia be going to continue to urge wild career not ask with purpose a blackiston proposes must give concert together in third week in july queen hall be vacant one afternoon think might sing play to be on if be will be about last concert of season too so will have to do best otherwise anyhow will start again in autumn with black mark by way be going to start again in autumn must surprise one bit to hear that mike have be talking about just that be too clever to live hermann said sylvia propose to die if mean that oh blackiston have suggestion also wanted to know if must consider making short tour in germany in autumn say that beloved fatherland be rather disposed to be interested in think must have good audience at leipzig so on there be tendency say to recognise poor england cordial intention anyhow said that in case there might be domestic consideration think will go in case lord fancy playing in germany to german again fancy being listened to by german audience fancy if approved michael leaned forward putting elbow into hermann chest early december have already be mentioned a date for marriage a pre nuptial journey seemed to plan ecstatically ideal yes sylvia said answer be yes will come with know can see triumphal procession two making noise listening month tour hermann middle of october till middle of november yes tremendous pride in singing dormant for moment under wonder of love rose to surface knew what singing meant to from conversation together just now how keen be eagerness for strict judgment of who knew how loved that austere pinnacle of daylight here be ideal opportunity never yet since have won her place a singer have sung in germany that mecca of musical artist in case land from sprung have scheme implied postponement of marriage must still have declared for for unerringly felt for in knew intuitively what delicious beckoning held for yes yes repeated must have do sylvia care what hermann want what want want yes who be to do playing singing asked hermann be question perhaps for michael felt quite secure about feeling of other two rudely interrupted said be question for when fatherland hears that be there will no doubt ask to play sing instead of two lord fancy marrying into distinguished family burst with pride required then little debate since three be agreed before hermann be empowered with authority to make arrangement remained simultaneously talking till mr falbe again drifting in announced that bell for dinner have sounded minute before have finger in last chapter of lady ursula ordeal laid face downwards on table to resume again at earliest possible moment opportunity be granted when at close of dinner coffee evening paper came in together hermann opened at middle page hallo said that be horrible heir apparent of austrian emperor have be murdered at serajevo servian plot apparently oh what dreadful thing said mr falbe opening book poor man what have done hermann took cigarette frowning may be match began mr falbe diverted attention from lady ursula for moment be on chimney piece dear said thinking spoke of material match michael felt that hermann saw something conjectured something ominous in news for sat with knitted brow reading letting match burn down yes seems that servian officer be implicated said there be material enough already for row between austria servia without tiresome balkan state said mr falbe slowly immersing like diving submarine in book be always quarrelling why doe austria conquer have done with simple striking solution of whole balkan question be final contribution to topic for at moment became completely submerged cut off so to speak from outer world in lucent depth of lady ursula hermann glanced through other page let paper slide to floor what will austria do said supposing threatens servia in outrageous way russia say wo stand what then michael looked across to sylvia be much more interested in way dabbled tip of hand in cool water of finger bowl than in what hermann be saying finger have extraordinary life of own just now be like group of maiden by fountain hermann repeated question to personally oh suppose there will be lot of telegraphing said perhaps board of arbitration after one expected european conflagration over war in balkan state again over row with turkey believe in european conflagration be too much afraid of other walk round other like collie dog on tip of toe gently growling then quietly get back to own territory lie down again hermann laughed thank god there be wonderful fire engine in germany ready to turn hose on conflagration what fire engine asked michael emperor of course must have be at war ten time over for sylvia dried finger tip one by one lady barbara doe quite take view of doe mike asked michael suddenly remembered how one night in flat aunt barbara have suddenly turned conversation from discussion of cognate topic on hearing that falbes be german only to resume again when have gone fancy doe said then a know aunt barbara have original view on subject hermann did not take possible hint here conveyed to drop matter well then what do think about asked michael laughed dear hermann said how often have told that english pay smallest attention to international politics be aware that know nothing about hermann shook off cloud of preoccupation so unaccountably to michael thinking have descended on walked across to window well long may ignorance be bliss said lord what divine evening 'uber allen gipfeln ist ruhe ' at least there be peace on only summit visible be house roof there be not breath of wind in tree chimney pot be hot be really hot be afraid there be going to be chill at sunset remarked mr falbe subaqueously then be afraid even where fear be mother darling said if must like to sit out in garden will take chair out for table candle let sit out be divine hour hour after sunset there be score of day in whole year when hour after sunset be warm like be such pity to waste one indoors young people pointed to sylvia michael will gaze into other heart mamma will beat in unison with lady ursula will sit look at sky become profoundly sentimental like good german hermann michael bestirred presently whole little party have encamped on chair placed in oasis of rug be done at special request of mr falbe since lady ursula have caught chill developed into consumption in small high walled garden beyond at bottom lay road along embankment grey blue thames dim wood of battersea park across river when came out sparrow be still chirping in ivy on studio wall in tall angle leaved plane at bottom of little plot discussing doubt domestic arrangement for comfort during night presently sudden hush fell upon shrillness be sharp more against drowsy hum of city sky overhead be of veiled blue growing gradually more toneless a light faded be unflecked by cloud except where high in zenith fleece of rosy vapour still caught light of sunken sun flamed with soft radiance of snow summit near there burned molten planet growing momentarily brighter a night gathered presently beginning to be dimmed again a tawny moon three day past full rose in east above low river horizon occasionally steamer hooted from thames noise of churned water sounded crunch of motor wheel tapping of heel of foot passenger on pavement below garden wall such evidence of outside seemed to accentuate perfect peace of secluded little garden where four sat hour place be cut off from turmoil activity for moment stream of life have flowed into backwater where rested immobile before travel be yet to come so seemed to michael then so year afterwards seemed to a vividly a on evening when tawny moon grew golden a climbed empty heaven dimming star around what talked of even though be sylvia who spoke seemed external to spirit of hour seemed to have reached point momentary halting place where speech thought even lay outside need of spirit be merely to exist be conscious of existence sometimes for moment past life with self repression mute yearning chrysalis stirring formed mist dispersed again sometimes for moment in wonder at what future held what joy trouble what aching perhaps anguish unknown knocked stealthily at door of mind then stole away unanswered unwelcome for hour while mr falbe finished with lady ursula while hermann smoked sighed like sentimental german while sylvia sat speaking occasionally more often silent be in kind of nirvana for own existence be everything movement have ceased held breath while divine pause lasted when be broken there be shattering of simply died away like long drawn chord a mr falbe closed book died said knew must hermann gave great shout of laughter darling mother be ever so much obliged said have to return to earth somehow where have everybody else be michael stirred in chair have be here said how dull oh suppose be not polite to sylvia have be in leipzig in frankfort in munich sylvia have be there too may tell have also be here be jolly here sentimentalism have apparently not quite passed from ah have stolen hour said have taken out of hurly burly have to ourselves be be ripping be back from rim of world oh have be there too looked out over immortal sea lieber gott what sea where come from where go to be just playing on sand where wave have cast up for one little hour oh pleasant warm sand play how love got out of chair stretching a mr falbe passed into house gave hand on side to michael sylvia ah be good thing just caught that train at victoria nearly year ago said if have be five second later must have missed so must have missed friend sylvia must have missed hers mike must have missed a be here be behold last remnant of german sentimentality evaporates be filled with german desire for beer let come into studio liebe kinder have beer music laughter can not recapture hour prolong be good oh so good thank god for hour sylvia put hand on brother arm looking at with just shade of anxiety nothing wrong hermann asked wrong there be nothing wrong unless be wrong to be happy have to go forward only quarrel with life be must stop now if must so that time must not run on must stay just a be ah what doe future hold be glad know sylvia laughed immediate future hold beer apparently said also hold great deal of work for if be to hold leipzig frankfort munich oh hermann what glorious day walked together into studio a entered hermann looked back over into dim garden then pulled down blind with rattle on there ' said policeman remarked so moved on news about murder of austrian grand duke for moment at dinner have caused hermann to peer with apprehension into veil of future be taken quietly enough by public in general in england be nasty incident doubt murder having be committed on servian soil pundit of press gave opportunity for subsequently saying that be right by conjecturing austria might insist on strict inquiry into circumstance due punishment of not only actual culprit of also who perhaps be privy to plot three day afterwards there be little uneasiness stock exchange of european capital highly sensitive barometer of coming storm be slightly affected for moment within week have steadied again from austria there came sign of unreasonable demand might lead to trouble with servia so with slavonic feeling generally by degree that threatening of storm sudden lightning on horizon passed out of mind of public there have be that one flash more even have not be answered by growl of thunder storm did not at once move up heaven above be still clear sunny by day starry kirtled at night here there be who like hermann on first announcement of catastrophe scented trouble michael going to see aunt barbara one afternoon early in second week of july found that be one of distrust dear said to be full of uneasiness what make more uneasy be that be taking so quietly at austrian embassy at german dined at one embassy last night at other only few night ago ca get anybody not even most indiscreet of secretary to say word about perhaps there be word to be said suggested michael ca believe that austria can not possibly let incident of sort pas there be mischief brewing if be merely intending to insist a have right to do on inquiry being held must satisfy reasonable demand for justice must have insisted on long ago fortnight have passed now still make sign feel sure that something be being arranged dear quite forgot tony asked not to talk about doe matter with what do mean by something being arranged asked michael looked round a if to assure that michael be alone mean austria be being persuaded to make outrageous demand demand that independent country must possibly grant who be persuading asked michael dear like rest of england be fast asleep who germany that dangerous monomaniac who rule germany have long be wanting war have only be delaying dawning of der tag till preparation be complete be ready to hurl army fleet too east west north mark word be about ready now believe be going to take advantage of opportunity leaned forward in chair be such opportunity a have never occurred before said in hundred year none so fit may occur again here be england on brink of civil war with ireland home ruler hand be tied rather be occupied with own trouble anyhow germany think so know for fact among so much that be only conjecture perhaps be right who know whether may not be right that if force on war whether will range with ally michael laughed be piling up european conflagration rather in hurry aunt barbara asked there will be hurry enough for for france russia perhaps england not for germany be never in hurry wait till be ready servant brought in tea lady barbara waited till have left room again be a simple a addition sum said if grant first step that austria be going to make outrageous demand of servia what follows servia refuse that demand austria begin mobilisation in order to enforce servia appeal to russia invokes bond of blood russia remonstrates with austria representation will be of use may stake have on eventually since will be unable to draw back too will begin in slow cumbrous manner hampered by immense distance imperfect railway system to mobilise also then will germany already quite prepared show hand will demand that russia will cease mobilisation again will russia refuse will set military machinery of france going time government of europe will be working for peace be except one be situated at berlin michael felt inclined to laugh at rapid disastrous sequence of ominous foreboding be so completely characteristic of aunt barbara to take most violent possible view of situation doubt have danger what michael felt be felt by enormous majority of english people dear aunt barbara do get on quick said will happen quickly said there be little cloud in east like man hand today rather like mailed fist sweet peaceful friend in germany be so fond of talking about will spread over sky tell like tropical storm france be unready russia be unready only germany marionette austria string of pull be ready go on prophesying said michael wish must ever since sarajevo murder have thought of nothing else day night how event will develop then ca imagine what will england do who know only know what germany think will do be stand aside because ca stir with irish mill stone round neck if germany thought otherwise be perfectly capable of sending dozen submarine over to naval manoeuvre torpedoing battleship right left michael laughed outright at while fleet of zeppelin hovers over london drop bomb on war office admiralty suggested aunt barbara be not in least diverted by if england stand aside said der tag will only dawn little later when germany have settled with france russia will live to see der tag michael unless be run over by motor bus pray god will see soon for sooner better adorable falbes now sylvia hermann what do think of hermann be certainly rather rather upset when read of sarajevo murder said pin faith on german emperor whom alluded to a fire engine must put out conflagration aunt barbara rose in violent incredulity pish bosh remarked if have alluded to a incendiary bomb there must have be more sense in simile anyhow sylvia be planning musical tour in germany in autumn said michael 'it long long way to tipperary ' remarked aunt barbara enigmatically why tipperary asked michael oh be just song heard at music hall other night there be jolly catchy tune to have rung in head ever since be sort of music like something can carry away with music michael rather in abeyance there be other thing to think about aunt barbara got up ah tell more about said want to get nightmare out of head sylvia now sylvia be good cure for nightmare be kind a be fair michael michael be silent for moment then turned quiet radiant face to ca talk about said ca get accustomed to wonder of will do be completely satisfactory account go on michael laughed how can asked there be end beginning ca 'go on a order about thing like there be sylvia there be must be content with then said smiling be said michael lady barbara waited moment without speaking mother asked shook head still refuse to see said still think be who made plot to take away shut up be often angry with poor darling see be who be angry be just malady yes dear said lady barbara be so glad see like how else must see be real mother whom began to know last christmas whom be with in town for three month followed be how think of ca think of a anything else how be otherwise again shook head be wretched though say that feel be dim veiled that must think of a actually unhappy sometimes there be good day when take certain pleasure in walk in looking after little plot of ground where garden thank god sudden outburst when tried to kill seems to have entirely passed from mind think remembers at then good day be rare be growing rarer often now sits doing nothing at cry aunt barbara laid hand on oh dear said michael paused for moment brown eye shining if only must come back just for little to what be in january said be happier then think than ever be before ca help wondering if anyhow must have prolonged day by giving up to more completely dear need wonder about said aunt barbara sir james told that be love nothing else at gave day michael lip quivered ca tell what be to said for found other then felt have missed other so much so long be happy then too now everything have be taken from still in spite of cup be full to overflowing be how must have michael said barbara yes know that remind of again paused think will live very long said be getting physically much weaker during last week two have be le unhappy think say new change may come time may be only great change mean death be possible before that mind will clear again sir james told that occasionally happened like like ray of sunlight after stormy day must be good if happened must give almost anything to feel that be together again a be barbara childless felt something of motherhood michael simplicity sincerity be already known to have never yet known strength of must lean on michael in quiet undemonstrative way supported completely a son must there be possibility of insecurity god bless dear said chapter xiii one close thundery morning about week later michael be sitting at piano in shirtsleeve busy practising be aware that at other end of room telephone be calling for seemed to be of far greater importance at minute to finish last page of one of bach fugue than to attend to what anybody else might have to say to then suddenly flashed across that might be sylvia who wanted to speak to that there might be news about mother finger leaped from piano in middle of bar ran slid across parquet floor be neither of compared to be case of only hermann who wanted to see hermann appeared wanted to see urgently if be in be must be with in ten minute bach thread be broken michael since be not worth while trying to mend for sake of few minute sat down by open window idly took up morning paper a yet have not opened since have hurried over breakfast in order to get to piano music announcement on outside page first detained seeing that concert by falbes be to take place in five six day be advertised wondered vaguely whether be about that hermann wanted to see if so why must not have said whatever have to say on telephone instead of cutting thing short with curt statement that wished to see urgently must come round at once then remembering that francis have be playing cricket for guard yesterday turned briskly over to last page of sporting news found that cousin have distinguished by making run at by missing two expensive catch in deep field from there after slight inspection of couple of advertisement column worked back to middle leaf where be leader news of nation movement of king last week have scanned such item with growing sense of amusement in recollection of hermann disquiet over sarajevo murder aunt barbara more detailed vivid prognostication of coming danger for nothing more have happened supposed vaguely only since affair have begun to fade from mind that austria have made inquiry since be satisfied there be public pronouncement to be made hot breeze from window made paper little unmanageable for moment presently got satisfactorily folded big black headline met eye half column below contained demand austria have made in note addressed to servian government glance be sufficient to show that be framed in most truculent threatening manner possible to imagine be not reasonable proposal one state have perfect right to make of on whose soil with connivance of whose subject murder have be committed be piece of arbitrary dictation threat levelled against dependent inferior michael have read through twice with growing sense of uneasiness at thought of how lady barbara first anticipation have be fulfilled when hermann came in pointed to paper michael held ah have seen said perhaps can guess what wanted to see about connected with austrian note asked michael yes have not vaguest idea hermann sat down on arm of chair mike be going back to germany to day said now do understand be german mean that germany be at back of be obvious be demand must have be made without consent of austria ally wo be granted servia will appeal to russia then god know what may happen in event of happening must be in fatherland ready to serve if necessary mean think possible will go to war with russia asked michael yes think possible if be right if there be that possibility ca be away from country emperor fire engine whom said must quench conflagration be away yachting went off after visit of british fleet to kiel who know whether before get back thing may have gone too far ca see must go must go if be suppose be in germany now must hurry home michael be silent hermann spoke again if there be trouble with russia france take be bound to join if france join what will england do great shadow of approaching storm fell over michael even a outside sultry stillness of morning grew darker ah think that asked michael hermann put hand on michael shoulder mike be best friend have said soon please god be going to marry girl who be everything else in world to two make up world really two mother anyhow other individual count be in same class know that expect there be one other thing be nationality count first nothing nobody not even sylvia mother can stand between that expect know that also for saw nearly year ago what germany be to perhaps may be quite wrong about about gravity mean of situation perhaps in few day may come racing home again yes said 'home did well that show just how be torn in two ca help going hand remained on shoulder gently patting to michael world life whole spirit of thing have suddenly grown sinister of quality of nightmare be true that ground of ominous depression have darkened round be conjectural speculative that diplomacy backed by horror of war surely civilised nation responsible govermnents must share have so far from saying last not yet said first word that wit of cabinet of europe be at moment only just beginning to stir so a to secure peaceful solution in spite of darkness nightmare grew in intensity a to hermann determination to go to germany made so terribly real since be beginning to enter into practical everyday life have mean indeed desire to combat saw perfectly clearly that hermann must go want to dissuade said not only because must be useless because be with must do otherwise hermann see must sylvia agrees too terrible conjecture flashed through michael mind asked ca leave mother of course said hermann after may be on wild goose chase ca risk being unable to get to germany if if worst happens ghost of smile played round mouth for moment be not sure that must leave mike added somehow

calling be something fresh do think moment listening attention be sufficient to make known that news shouted outside be concerned only with result of county cricket match michael a well a sylvia be conscious of certain relief to know at immediate present there be fresh clang of bell be beating out second of peace still remained just for now for hour on saturday afternoon there be respite new link be forged in intolerable sequence of event even a drew breath in knowledge there came counter stroke in sense that whose business be to disseminate news must cause paper to sell have just cricket match to advertise ware now when country when europe be on brink of bloodier war than annals of history contained who presumably knew what public desired to be informed on thought that news must sell best be concerned with wooden bat leather ball strong young men in flannel michael have heard with sort of tender incredulity mr falbe optimistic reflection have be more than content to let rest secure in be country heart of england like did care more for cricket match a for book than for maintenance of nation honour whatever championship might cost cry went on past garden walk fine inning by horsfield result of oval match yet have just have tea a usual eaten slice of cake be now smoking cigarette be natural to do not to make fuss refuse food drink be natural that people must still be interested in cricket at moment attitude towards mr falbe changed instead of pity irritation at normality be suddenly taken with sense of gratitude to be restful to suspense jangled nerve to see someone who went on a usual sun shone leaf of plane tree did not wither mr falbe read book evening paper be full of cricket news then reaction from seized again supposing nation be like supposing nobody cared tension of suspense strained more tightly than ever for next forty eight hour while day night telegraph wire of europe tingled with momentous question grave reply while minister ambassador met parted met again rumour flew way that like flock of wild fowl driven backwards forward settling for moment with stir splash then with rush of wing speeding back on again huge coal strike in northern county fostered financed by german gold be supposed to be imminent must put out of country power ability to interfere irish home rule party under same suasion be said to have refused to call truce letter have be received in high quarter from german emperor avowing fixed determination to preserve peace be honey to lord ashbridge then in turn of be contradicted thought of coal strike in crisis of national affair be abandoned irish party a well a conservative be of one mind in backing up government matter what postponement of question be vital month ago cohesion entailed emperor have written no letter at through nebulous mist of hearsay there fell solid first drop of imminent storm even before michael have left sylvia afternoon germany have declared war on russia on sunday belgium received note from berlin definitely stating must government not grant passage to german battalion way must be forced for on monday finally germany declared war on france also country held breath in suspense at what decision of government must be announced that afternoon must be one fact only be publicly known be that english fleet only lately dismissed from manoeuvre naval review have vanished there be guard ship old cruiser what not at certain port torpedo boat roamed horizon of deal portsmouth great fleet swift fort of sea power have gone disappearing one knew where into fine weather haze brooded over midsummer sea there perhaps be indication of what decision must be yet there be certainty at home there be official silence from abroad apart from three vital fact came quacking of rumour report after report contradicting other then suddenly came certainty rainbow set in intolerable cloud on monday afternoon when house of common met party be known to have sunk private difference to be agreed on one point must take precedence of other question germany must not with england consent violate neutrality of belgium a far a england be concerned negotiation be at end diplomacy have said last word germany be given twenty four hour in to reply must satisfactory answer not be forthcoming england must uphold neutrality with others have sworn to respect by force of arm at one immense sigh of relief went up from whole country now might happen in horror of long drawn bloody war nation might be involved nightmare of possible neutrality of england repudiating debt of honour be removed one thing worse than war need longer be dreaded for moment future hideous heart rending though must surely be smiled like land of promise michael woke on morning of tuesday fourth of august with feeling of something having suddenly roused in few second knew that be so for telephone bell in room next door sent out summons got straight out of bed went to with hundred vague shadow of expectation crossing mind then learned that mother be gravely ill that be wanted at once in le than hour be on way driving swiftly through serene warmth of early morning to private asylum where have be removed after sudden homicidal outburst in march chapter xiv michael be sitting that same afternoon by mother bedside have learned little there be to be told on arrival in morning how hour before have be summoned have have attack of heart failure since then after recovering from acute immediate danger have lain there day with closed eye in state of semi conscious exhaustion once twice only for moment have shown sign of increasing vitality then sank back into stupor again in rare short interval have opened eye have seemed to see recognise michael thought once have smiled at at present have spoken no word morning lord ashbridge have waited there too since there be change have gone away saying that must return again later asking to be telephoned for if wife regained consciousness so for nurse occasional visit of doctor michael be alone with mother in long period of inactive waiting when there be nothing to be done michael did not seem to to be feeling very vividly for one desire namely that before end mother must come back to even if only for moment mind felt drugged stupefied sometimes for little must sluggishly turn over thought about father wondering with sort of blunt remote contempt how be possible for not to be here too except for one great longing that mother must cleave to once more in conscious mind observed rather than felt thought of sylvia even be dim knew that be somewhere in world have become for present like picture painted in mind without reality dim too be tension of last day somewhere in europe be country called germany where be best friend drilling in rank to have returned perhaps already on way to bloodier battlefield than world have ever dreamed of somewhere set in sea be germany arch foe who already stood in path with open cannon mouth pointing have real connection with from moment when have come into quiet orderly room saw mother lying on bed nothing beyond four wall really concerned though emotional side of mind lay drugged insensitive to anything outside found observing detail of room where waited with curious vividness there be big window opening down to ground in manner of door on to garden outside where smooth lawn set with croquet hoop edged with bright flower bed dozed in haze of august heat beyond be row of tall elm against copper beech glowed metallically somewhere out of sight mowing machine be being used for michael heard click of cropping journey growing fainter a receded followed by pause a turned gradual crescendo a approached again otherwise everything outside be strangely silent a hot hour of midday early afternoon went by there be note of bird music sound of wind in elm top just little breeze stirred from time to time enough to make slat of half drawn venetian blind rattle faintly earlier in day there have come in from window smell of dew damp earth now have be sucked up by sun close beside window with back to light facing bed projected from one of side wall out into room sat lady ashbridge nurse be reading rustle of turned page be regular regular constant also be glance towards bed where patient lay at interval put down book marking place with slip of paper came to watch by bed for moment looking at lady ashbridge face listening to breathing eye met michael always a did in answer to mute question time gave little head shake perhaps whispered word two told there be change opposite bed be empty fireplace at foot of table on stood vase of rose michael be conscious of scent of now then at interval of faint rather sickly smell of japan screen ornamented with stork in gold thread stood near door half concealed washing stand there be chest of drawer on one side of fireplace wardrobe with looking glass door on other dressing table to one side of window few print on plain blue wall dark blue drugget carpet on floor ordinary appurtenance of bedroom etched into michael mind biting way into by acid of own suspense finally there be bed where mother lay coverlet of blue silk upon knew be somehow familiar to after fitful gropings in mind to establish association remembered that have be on bed in room in curzon street supposed that have be brought here with others of personal belonging little core of light focused on one of brass ball at head of bed caught eye saw that sun beginning to decline came in under venetian blind nurse sitting in window noticed also lowered thought of sylvia crossed brain for moment then thought of father train of reflection dissolved almost a soon a be formed came back again again to mother face be perfectly peaceful strangely young looking a if cool soothing hand of death presently must quiet trouble for have be already at work there erasing mark that year have graven upon yet be not so much young a ageless seemed to have passed beyond register limitation of time sometimes for moment be like face of stranger then suddenly must become beloved familiar again be just so have looked when came so timidly into room one night at ashbridge asking if must be troublesome to if sat talked with for little mouth be little parted for slow even breathing corner of smiled yet be not sure if smiled be hard to tell for lay there quite flat without pillow looked at from unusual angle sometimes felt a if have be sitting there watching for uncounted year then again hour that have be here appeared to have lasted for moment a if have looked once at a day declined breeze of evening awoke rattling blind by now sun have swung farther west nurse pulled blind up outside in bush in garden call of bird to other have begun thrush came close to window sang liquid phrase then repeated michael glanced there saw bird speckle breasted with throat throbbed with note then looking back to bed saw that mother eye be open looked vaguely about room for moment a if have awoke from deep sleep found in unfamiliar place then turning head slightly saw there be longer question a to whether mouth smiled for face be flooded with deep serene joy bent towards lip parted michael dear said gently michael heard rustle of nurse dress a got up came to bedside slipped from chair on to knee so that face be near mother felt in heart that moment have so longed for be to be granted that have come back to not only a have known during week that have lived alone together when presence made so content in manner infinitely more real more embracing have be sitting here time while slept dear asked have be waiting for to come back to yes have come said looked at mother love before have be veiled clouded came out with tender radiance of evening sun with clear shining after rain knew must fail darling said be so patient with in trouble have be through be nightmare have gone michael bent forward kissed yes mother said have gone be silent moment be father here said will come at once if must like to see yes send for dear if must not vex to come said get somebody else to send want to leave be not going to said nurse went to door gave message presently returned to other side of bed then lady ashbridge spoke again be death asked michael raised eye to figure standing by bed nodded to bent forward again yes dear mother said for moment eye dilated then grew quiet again smile returned to mouth be not frightened michael said with there be lonely terrible raised head son said in voice loud triumphant then head fell back again lay with face close to eyelid quivered shut breath came slow regular a if slept then heard that missed breath soon after then without struggle at breathing ceased outside on lawn close by open window thrush still sang be hour later when michael left having waited for father arrival drove to town through clear falling dusk be conscious of feeling of grief at only of complete pervading happiness must not have imagined so perfect close must have desired anything different from imperishable moment when mother trouble past have come back to in serene calm of love a entered saw newsboards placarded with one fact england have declared war on germany went not to own flat straight to maidstone crescent with few minute in mother have known stupor have beset emotion day passed off felt longing a have never longed before for sylvia presence long ago have given that knew of a now there be fresh gift have to give that moment have taught even a already be knitted into made part of so must be to when have shared that when like water gushing from spring flooded there be that other news have seen on newsboards that have to share together sylvia have be alone day with mother before michael arrived mr falbe after few more encouraging remark about war in general to effect that germany must soon beat france what blessing be that england be island have taken book up to room sylvia be sitting alone in deep dusk of evening did not even trouble to turn on light for felt unable to apply to practical task must think take hold of better in dark day have longed for michael to come to though have not cared to see anybody else several time have rung up only to find that be still out supposedly with mother for have be summoned to early that morning since then news have come of just before dinner have arrived announcement of declaration of war sylvia sat now trying to find escape from encompassing nightmare felt confused distracted with must not think consecutively only contemplate shudderingly series of picture presented to mind somewhere now in host of fatherland be hers also be hermann brother who be part of herself when thought of seemed to be with to see glint of rifle to feel heart on heart big with passionate patriotism have doubt that patriotism formed essence of consciousness yet by now probably knew that land beloved by where have made home be at war with own must not know how often thought dwelled here in dark quiet studio where sat where so many day of happiness have be passed knew what be to mother michael host of friend in land have become foe must have gone asked if have guessed that there must be war between two thought must though knew that for must have made a hard a possible for to do so must have used argument must think of to dissuade yet felt that entreaty must have beaten in vain against granite of nationality dimly have foreseen contingency when few day ago have asked michael what must do if england went to war now that contingency be realised hermann be even now perhaps on way to violate neutrality of country for sake of england have gone to war on other side be michael into whose keeping have given love on side be be then that nightmare came close to must not tell be utterly unable to decide heart be michael heart be brother also one personified germany for other england be a if saw hermann michael with bayonet rifle stalking other across land of sand dune hollow creeping closer to other always closer felt a if must have gladly given over to eternity of torment if only must have have one hour more three of together here a on night of star peace when first there came news for moment have disquieted hermann longed a with thirst for michael to come a solitude became more more intolerable hundred hideous fancy obsessed what if accident have happened to michael what if in tremendous breaking of tie that war entailed felt that must not see knew be impossibility whole world have become impossible there be escape somehow have to adjust to unthinkable somehow relation with hermann michael have to remain absolutely unshaken even be not enough have to be strengthened made impregnable then came knock on side door of studio led into street michael often came way without passing through house with sense of relief ran to unlocked even a stepped in before word of greeting have be exchanged flung on with finger eager for touch of solidity oh dear said have longed for just longed for never wanted so much have be sitting in dark desolate desolate oh darling what beast be to think of nothing be ashamed what of mother michael turned on light a walked back across studio michael saw that eye be little dazzled by change from dark into light be dim with unshed tear hand clung to a never before have clung needed now with imperative need in trouble can only turn to love for comfort wanted that only fact of with in land in have suddenly become alien enemy though friend except hermann be here instantaneously a baby at breast found that strength serenity be hers sat down on sofa by piano side by side with hand intertwined before michael answered looked up at a spoke in eye be quiet of love death mother died hour ago said be with a have longed might happen came back to before died for two three minute be then said to bey son soon ceased breathing oh michael said for little while there be silence in turn be presence that clung to presently spoke again sylvia be so frightfully hungry said think have eaten anything since breakfast may go forage oh poor thing cried yes let go see what there be instantly busied hermann left cellar key on chimney piece michael said get wine out dear mother drink there be ham know while be getting wine will broil there be strawberry will have supper with what good thought must be famished a ate talked perfectly simply naturally of hundred association studio meal at end of evening called up concerning sunday night party there be occasion on hermann tried to recollect how to mull beer with result smelled like brickfield there be when poached egg have fallen exploding softly a fell into piano there be occasion first on michael have be present when two eminent actor imitated other when francis came made so immensely agreeable be after one sylvia hermann have sat talked in front of stove discussing a sylvia laughed to remember what must say when michael proposed to then have come break in michael attendance a sylvia allowed certain falling off in gaiety be really hermann who made gay originally said take wonderful deal of credit for be a completely natural for a be impromptu meal soon without effort michael spoke of mother again presently afterwards of news of war with by side sylvia found courage come back to news that certainly implied horror that held no longer filled with sense that be impossibly terrible michael did not diminish awfulness of gave power of looking out bravely at did shrink from speaking of have be to so grim nightmare have heard from hermann asked suppose ca hear now be with regiment be will hear of till there be peace again came little closer to michael have to face may never see hermann again said mother doe fear know darling life in sort of dream want to wake from how can get accustomed to thought perhaps sha see hermann again must get accustomed to have got to live with not quarrel with took up hand enclosing in one doe quarrel with big thing of life said be so have quarrel with thing like death duty dear be afraid be preaching preach then said well be just that quarrel with

yet what war office will do about army suppose be possible that will send troop to france concern be that will rejoin again if call up reserve will yes must think be inevitable know there be something big about be not warlike know must not fail to be soldier under new condition more than must continue being soldier when meant be to be ornamental hermann in burst of pride patriotism used to call toy soldier be wrong now be not going to be toy soldier more did not answer felt hand press close in palm of ca tell how dreaded must go to war said that have be nightmare if like must have be end of if have stood aside seen germany violate solemn treaty even with michael close to call of blood made audible to sylvia instinctively withdrew hand from ah understand germany at said hermann always felt that too told felt be talking gibberish to when spoke of be clearly life death to germany to move against france a quickly a possible there be direct frontier between two said doubt impossible one michael frowned drawing big eyebrow together nothing can justify violation of national oath said that be basis of civilisation thing like if be necessity if nation existence depends on asked oh michael know know for little be entirely english then something call to from beyond rhine there be hopelessness of for such a be english there be question about for for love england need tell that can

must make best of a be do be sorry for never never forget that love entirely be root fact between ca go deeper than because reach to very bottom of soul will leave so michael not ever talk of again must that be best there be question of choice for michael in accepting appeal knew with inmost fibre of being that sylvia being sylvia nothing that must say do feel must possibly part from when looked at directly simply like there be nothing must blur verity of truth of what said reality of call of blood seemed to cast shadow over knew beyond other knowledge that be there only looked out at with shadow faint unmistakable fallen across sense of made more eagerly accept suggestion yes darling will never speak of again said must be much wisest lady ashbridge funeral took place three day afterwards down in suffolk hour detached in michael mind from have gone before might follow like little piece of blue sky in midst of storm cloud limitation of man consciousness forbid to think poignantly about two thing at once hedged day in with impenetrable barrier so while lasted afterwards for ever in memory be unflecked by trouble anxiety hung between heaven earth in serenity of own coffin lay night in mother bedroom be next to michael when went up to bed found listening for sound came from there seemed yesterday when have gone rather early upstairs after sitting minute two in front of fire have heard that timid knock on door have meant opening of mother heart to felt must scarcely be strange if knock came again if entered once more to be with from moment came upstairs rest of world be shut down to entered bedroom a if entered sanctuary be scented with incense of love knew exactly how knock have sounded when came in here night when first burned for ear be alert for to come again once blind tapped against frame of open window though knowing be that heard whisper for must hear whisper come in mother sat up in deep chair looking towards door only blind tapped again

to sleep michael went to bed also lay awake about couple of minute not thinking only being while owl hooted outside awoke into complete consciousness knowing that something have aroused even a three day ago when telephone rang to summon to mother deathbed then did not know what have awakened now be sure that there have be tapping on door after have sat up in bed completely awake heard petsy give little welcoming bark then came noise of small soft tail beating against cushion in chair michael have feeling of fright at only of longing for something physically must not be longing only longing once more said come in mother believed heard door whisper on carpet saw nothing only room be full of mother presence seemed to that in obedience to lay down completely satisfied felt curiosity to see hear more be there be enough woke again little after dawn petsy between window door have jumped on to bed to get out of draught of morning wind for door be opened that morning coffin be carried down long winding path above deep water reach where michael francis at christmas have heard sound of stealthy rowing on to boat awaited to ferry across to church there be high tide a passed over estuary stillness of supreme noon bore to tolling of bell mourner from house followed just three of lord ashbridge michael aunt barbara for rest be to assemble at church of one moment stood out for michael above others when a entered graveyard someone whom must not see said be resurrection life heard that father by whom walked suddenly caught breath in sob day there persisted that sense of complete

news to sylvia already story of german barbarity be rife of woman violated of defenceless civilian being shot down for object except to terrorise to bring home to belgian unwisdom of presuming to cross will of sovereign people to night in evening paper there have be fresh batch of revolting story when michael entered studio where sylvia mother be sitting saw girl let drop behind sofa paper have be reading guessed what must have found there for have already seen paper silence distraction misery of face confirmed conjecture have brought little news to night said first draft from regiment went off to day mr falbe put down book marking place well that doe look like business then said though must say must feel safer if did send soldier away where have gone to destination unknown said michael be france cousin have gone francis asked sylvia oh how wicked to send boy like michael saw that nerve be sharply on edge have given greeting now a sat down moved little away from seemed utterly unlike mother have be told that englishman be a brave a two german said like that yes dear observed mr falbe placidly make one feel safer saw in paper though read sylvia turned on michael have seen evening paper asked michael knew what be in mind just looked at said there did seem to be much news no only report rumour lie said sylvia mr falbe got up be habit to leave two alone together since be sure preferred that incidentally also got on better with book for found conversation rather distracting to night sylvia stopped oh go yet mother said be very early be clear that for reason did not want to be left alone with michael for never have done before did avail anything now for mr falbe who be quite determined to pursue reading without delay moved towards door be sure michael want to talk to dear said have not seen day think will go up to bed sylvia made further effort to detain when have gone silence in have so often sat together have taken on perfectly different quality what have be doing said tell about day know have be concerned with war want to hear about dined with aunt barbara said michael sent love also wondered why have be to see for so long sylvia gave short laugh have touch of merriment in did really asked must have thought must have guessed set nerve in body jangling last time saw by way talked about german then suddenly pulled up apologised saying have forgotten that made worse michael when be unhappy kindness be even more intolerable than unkindness must sooner have lady barbara abusing people than saying how sorry be for let talk about let do something will play will sing let employ michael followed lead ah do sing said be week since have heard sing went quickly over to bookcase of music by piano come then let sing forget said hermann always said artist be of nationality let begin quick be german song let have ah too what be to be done song seem to be german michael laughed have just settled that artist have nationality so suppose art have said sylvia pulled together conscious of want of control laid hand on michael shoulder oh michael what must do without said yet well let sing have placed volume of schubert on music stand opening at random found du bist die ruhe sang first verse in middle of second stopped ca said be use turned round to oh be so sorry said know that moved away from walked down to empty fireplace ca keep silence said though know settled not to talk of thing when necessarily can not feel absolutely at one just before came in be reading evening paper michael how can english be so wicked a to print suppose to believe awful thing find there told have glanced at well did glance at lie tell about german atrocity yes saw said michael be use talking about be indignant said doe blood boil to read of such infamous falsehood know german do be impossible that such thing can have happened michael felt profoundly uncomfortable of story sylvia called lie be vouched for apparently by respectable testimony why talk about said be sure be wise when settled not to shook head well ca live up to wisdom said when think of war day night night day how can prevent talking to about lie german must do such thing be campaign of hate against set up by english press daresay german press be better said michael if be so must be just a indignant about german press said be only guess that be so suddenly stopped came couple of step nearer michael be possible that believe thing of said got up ah do leave alone sylvia said know more of truth falsity of than have seen just what have seen in paper feel impossibility of then asked there seems to have be sworn testimony war be cruel thing hate a much a when men be maddened with war ca tell what must do be not german know german know who did such thing not people saw when be with hermann in baireuth munich year ago be more same than drunken man be same a man when be sober be two different people drink have made different war have done same for germany held out hand to moved step back from then think suppose that hermann may be concerned in atrocity said michael looked at in amazement be talking sheer nonsense sylvia said not at be logical inference just application of principle have stated michael instinct be just to take in arm make final appeal saying love other be reason prevented sylvia have said monstrous thing in cold blood when suggested that thought hermann might be concerned in deed in cold blood not by appealing to emotion must withdraw be not going to argue about said want to tell at once that be right that be sheer nonsense to put other name to when suggested that thought that of hermann oh pray put name to said very well be wanton falsehood said michael know truly hellish nightmare of war hate have arisen brought with brood not le terrible day ago hour ago must have merely laughed at possibility of such situation between sylvia yet here be be in middle of now looked up at flashing with indignation retort a stinging a rose to lip then quite suddenly anger went from a heart told in voice must not be silenced complete justice of what have said appeal that michael refrained from making be made by to herself remorse held on spike for abominable suggestion with came sense of utter desolation misery of hatred for herself in having thus quietly deliberately said what have said must not account for excuse on plea that have spoken in passion for have spoken a felt in cold blood hence came misery in knowledge that must have wounded michael intolerably lip so quivered that when first tried to speak word must come that be truly ashamed brought relief ease to surrender for knew that be real self who have spoken thus incredibly must at least disown part of beg pardon michael said be atrocious will forgive because be so miserable have nothing love for love kinsman pity oh dear fancy asking that said just for moment of reconciliation seemed to that came closer to other than have ever be before chance of need of such reconciliation be impossible to verge of laughableness so before five minute be past must make smile break through tear at absurdity of moment now seemed quite unreal yet that be at root of temporary antagonism be not removed by reconciliation at most have succeeded in cutting off poisonous shoot have suddenly sprouted from truth of in day followed be horribly demonstrated be not that ever again came to spoken bitterness of word for sharpness of once experienced be shunned by of time without number have to sheer off not approach ground where poisoned tendril trailed in sense of having to take care to be watchful lest chance word must bring peril close to atmosphere of complete ease confidence in alone love can flourish be tainted love be there flower must not expand must not grow in midst of bitter air what made situation more increasingly difficult be fact that next to love for other emotion that most filled mind of be sense of race antagonism be impossible that news of war must not be mentioned for must have created intolerable unreality be in power be to avoid discussion to suppress from speech feeling with news filled day too there came fresh story of german abomination committed on belgian knew that other have seen yet must mention for while sylvia must not believe michael must not help doing so thus there be common ground on must speak of often mr falbe in whose blood must seem sense of race beat at must add to embarrassment by childlike comment saying at one time in reference to such thing that made point of not believing saw in newspaper at ejaculating well german do seem to have behaved very cruelly again emotion appeared to colour speech while emotion of world surged bubbled behind silence of other two then followed darkest day england perhaps have ever known when german army having overcome resistance of belgium suddenly swept forward again across france pushing before like jetsam flotsam on rim of advancing tide allied army often in appalling week michael must hesitate a to whether must go to see sylvia not so unbearable seemed fact that did not must not feel understand what england be going through so far from blaming for knew that must not be otherwise for blood called to even a to while somewhere in onrush of advancing devouring wave be brother with whom so have often seemed to be one soul thus while in whole sympathy whole comprehension of love be with there be a well deep silent english patriotism of till now have scarcely be conscious praying with mute entreaty that disaster destruction defeat might overwhelm advancing horde once when anxiety peril be at height made up mind not to see day spent evening by later when be actually on way to bed knew must not keep away from though be already midnight drove down to chelsea found sitting up waiting for chance of coming for moment a greeted kissed silently escaped from encompassing horror ah have come said thought perhaps might have wanted dreadfully roar of artillery internecine strife be still just for few second there be nothing in world for for anything must go to bed without just seeing said wo keep up stood with hand clasped if have come michael said must have understood then roar horror began again word be simplest most directly spoken to yet must not evoke spectre for moment have vanished have meant to let love for speak have spoken instantly through momentary sunlight of there loomed fierce enormous shadow must not be banished from most secret heart even when door be shut be alone together thus made entrance ghost like terrible love bolt bar must not keep out here be tragedy of that must not stand embraced with clasped hand look at together so rob of terror for at sight of hand be loosened from other in presence be forced to stand apart in heart a surely a knew love michael knew that great shadow under england lay be shot with sunlight for sylvia that anxiety awful suspense made finger cold a opened daily paper brought into to echo of victorious music beat to tramp of advancing foot that marched ever forward leaving glittering rhine league upon league in rear bavarian corp in hermann served be known to be somewhere on western front for emperor have addressed ten day before on departure from munich sylvia michael be aware of who loved hermann best must not speak of to other knowledge of have to be hidden in silence a if have be guilty secret in be terrified accomplice instead of being bond of love bound to hermann in addition to national anxiety there be suspense of whose son husband father be in fighting line column of casualty list be published name appearing there be sword pierced home one such list published early in september be seen by michael a drove down on sunday morning to spend rest of day with sylvia first name that read there be that of francis for moment a remembered afterwards print have danced before eye a if seen through quiver of hot air then settled down saw clearly turned drove back to room in moon street feeling strange craving for loneliness shuns companionship must for little sit alone with fact face adjust to till moment when dancing print grew still again have not in anxiety suspense of day thought of francis death a possibility even have heard from only two morning before in letter thoroughly characteristic saw a francis always saw pleasant agreeable side of thing washing have announced be delusion after week without began to wonder why have ever made habit of have have lot of marching always in wrong direction everyone knew must soon be over be london very beastly in august must michael see if must get proper cigarette out to here there be nothing little black french affair not many of tied knot in throat of smoker now francis with gaiety affection light pleasant dealing with life lay dead somewhere on sunny plain of france killed in action by shell bullet in midst of youth strength joy in life to gratify damned dream of man who have be honoured guest at ashbridge who have advised flattered at end perhaps just used a dupe to insensate greed swollen headed lust for world power be hecatomb of sweet pleasant life offered in onward course through vine corn of france waded through blood of slain whose only crime be that have dared to oppose will of germany a voiced by war lord a milestone along way have come be set record of infamy in rapine ruthless slaughter of innocent just at first a sat alone in room michael contemplated image seemed to form in mind without volition emotion numb from shock seemed external to sometimes have vision of francis lying without mark wound violence on in vineyard on hill side with face a quiet a in sleep turned towards moonlit sky then came picture francis be walking across terrace at ashbridge with gun over shoulder towards lord ashbridge emperor who stood together just a michael have seen three of when came in from shooting party a francis came near emperor put cartridge into gun shot yes be be what have happened marvellous peacemaker of europe fire engine who a hermann have said be ready to put out conflagration fatuous mountebank who pretended to be friend to england who conducted own balderdash called music have changed role shown black heart be out to kill wild panorama like streamed through michael head a if projected there by magic lantern while lasted be conscious of grief at only of devouring hate for mad lawless butcher who have caused francis death willingly at moment if must have gone out into night killed german met death in doing of must have gone to doom a to bridal bed by degree a stress of unsought imaginings abated thought turned to francis again who through boyhood early manhood have be to sort of ideal inspiration how have loved admired yet never with touch of jealousy francis whose letter lay open by on table lay dead on battlefield of france there be envelope with red square mark of censor upon sheet with gay scrawl in pencil asking for proper cigarette with pang of remorse more vivid because concerned so trivial thing michael recollected that have not sent have meant to do so yesterday afternoon something have put out of head never again must francis ask to send out cigarette michael laid head on arm so that face be close to pencilled note relief of tear came to soon raised again not ashamed of sorrow somehow ashamed of black hate that before have filled be gone for present anyhow michael be glad to find vanished instead there be aching pity not for francis alone for for concerned in hideous business hundred thousand home thrown suddenly to day into mourning be there no doubt there be house in bavarian village in pine wood above hermann have spent day when there be opera at baireuth where son brother father be mourned in kinship of sorrow found at peace with who have suffered loss with who be living through day of deadly suspense there be nothing effeminate sentimental about have never be manlier than in moment when claimed right to be one with be right to pause like with hand clasped in hand of friend foe alike without disowning that knew that francis death have brought that home to have made eager also for own turn to come when must go out to help in grim work lay in front of be perfectly ready to die if necessary if not to kill a many german a possible somehow two aspect of pity desire to kill existed side by side overlapping contradicting one servant came into room with pencilled note opened be from sylvia oh michael have just called be waiting to know if will see have seen news want to tell how sorry be if care to see know will say so wo though hour before have turned back on way to go to sylvia did not hesitate now yes ask miss falbe to come up said came up immediately once again a met world war stood apart from did not expect to come michael said when saw news did not mean to come here have to have just to find out whether must see let tell how sorry be smiled at a stood facing other thank for coming said be so glad came have to be alone just little did do wrong asked indeed did did wrong not to come to loved francis see already shadow threatened again be just fact that loved francis have made impossible for to go to must not explain a shadow began to fall gave little shudder oh michael know did said be just concern that sympathy for be such dear only saw know once twice from can guess what be to be brother to hermann michael felt with sylvia hand in be running desperately away from shadow pursued desperately tried with to evade word spoken between seemed to bring nearer to only came to say that said have to tell to see a told so that must know how sincere how heartfelt stopped suddenly that be dearest added will go away again now across shadow have again fallen between looked yearned for other go go said want more than ever be here here now what else matter in comparison of loved francis a know love hermann there be love greatest thing of have got be here oh sylvia must be wise simple must separate thing sort out not let get mixed with one can do know can there be nothing outside nothing matter nothing matter there be just that ray of sun peering over black cloud illumined face to other while already sharp peaked shadow of have come between for second while spoke seemed possible that in middle of welter chaos death enmity two soul must stand apart in passionate serene of love moment lasted for just a long a flung into arm then even while face be pressed to while riotous blood of pressed lip sang to shadow fell across even a asserted inviolability of sanctuary in stood knew to be impossible utopia that must find with peace must secure from raging storm cold shadow loosening of arm about neck endorsed message of own heart for such heavenly security can not come except to who have be through ultimate bitterness that world can bring be not arrived at through complete surrender to trial of fire a yet in spite of opposed patriotism in spite of sincerest sympathy with michael loss assault on most intimate line of fortress have not yet be delivered before must reach peace passed understanding fiercer attack have to be repulsed have to stand look at other unembittered across wave billow of salter marah than still clung while in eye there passed backwards forward message said be not yet be not thus have be like two child springing together at report of thunder clap not knowing in presence of what elemental outpouring of force hid face together a yet boomed on horizon though message of havoc reached test must come when roared lightened overhead already tension of approaching tempest have so wrought on that for month past have be unreal to other wanting ease wanting confidence now when first real shock have come though for moment threw into other arm be not a knew real final reconciliation touchstone proved gold francis death cousin whom michael loved at hand of one of nation to whom sylvia belonged have momentarily made feel that else love be external circumstance even in moment of feeling shadow fell again left chilly shivering for moment still held other round neck shoulder then hold slipped to elbow soon hand parted a yet word have be said since michael asserted that nothing else mattered in silence of gradual estrangement sanguine falsity of grew grew grew know what feel said at length feel also voice broke hand felt for again michael where be cried touch did mean let face for know hermann might have killed francis whether did not doe matter might have be be like minute before michael in soul blood mind bone have said that nothing sylvia have real existence have clung to even a to hoping that individual love must prove capable of overriding else that existed have not needed that must speak to show how pathetically have erred before have made concrete instance knew how hopeless wish have be silence loosening of hand have told that when spoke there be brutality in what said worse than brutality there be plain unvarnished truth there be question now of going away at once a have proposed more than boat in rapid roared round by breaker can propose to start again be in middle of so short way ahead be cataract that ran with blood on side at present be fine green landing place at oar at tiller must if be of one mind still put ashore must run boat in declining passage of cataract with risk river of blood there be stroke of oar to be made pull on rope of rudder step ashore here be way out of storm rapid moment before when by physical parting have realised strength of bond held apart solution have not occurred to sylvia now critically forlornly hopeful flashed on felt almost felt for ultimate decision rested with that with must throw everything else aside escape just escape if so willed into haven of neutrality where must be together leaving rest of world country to fight over irreconcilable quarrel did not seem to matter what happened to anybody else provided only michael be together out of risk out of harm other life might be precious other ideal patriotism might be at stake wanted to be with nothing else at tie counted compared to that there be one life given to man woman now that individual happiness individual joy of love be at stake felt even a michael have said that nothing else mattered that must be right to realise at cost took hand again listen to michael said ca bear longer that horror must keep rising up between while be here in middle of ca be otherwise ask then to come away with to leave behind be not quarrel already hermann have gone ca lose too looked up at for moment then quickly away again for felt case seemed to just now so imperative slipping away from in glance got of eye that for love burned there be blank with astonishment must convince own conviction be weak when looked at answer yet said hear have to say see that while be like be lost to other a said just now nothing matter in comparison to love want to take away out of so that can find other again horror thwart warp spoil best thing that world hold for patriotism be just a sound a yours throw away to get do same then can get out of service somehow then voice began to falter if loved must do said if then suddenly found must say no more at have hoped that when stated thing must convince behold have done be to shake own conviction so that fell clattering round like unstable card house desperately looked again at wondering if have convinced at then again looked wondering if must see contempt in eye after stood still silent face flamed do despise michael said gave little sigh of utter content oh dear how love for suggesting sweet impossibility said how must despise if consented did not answer must repeated gave sorrowful semblance of laugh suppose must said know must must contrast in mind whether wished to not with hermann with poor francis sorely to disadvantage sat silent little there be question sylvia have to ask for have to collect courage at last came have told yet when be going said not for certain will be before many day be passed question arises will marry before go hid face on shoulder will do what wish said want to know wish clung closer to michael think must bear to part with if be married said must be worse think than be going to be intend to do exactly what wish must tell be going to obey before be wife a well a after michael have long debated in mind seemed to that if came back a might easily happen hopelessly crippled incurably invalid must be placing sylvia in unfairly difficult position if be already wife might be hideously disfigured must be bound to wreck of man might be utterly unfit to be husband yet must be tied to have already talked question over with father who with curious posthumous anxiety to have further direct heir have urged that marriage must take place at once with own feeling on subject a well a sylvia at once made up mind agree with said will settle so then smiled at how dreadfully business like said with attempt at lightness know be rather good thing one have got to be business like when failed also drew to kissed chapter xvi michael be sitting in kitchen of french farm house just outside village of laires three mile behind english front kitchen door be open on flagged floor be cast oblong of primrose coloured november sunshine warm pleasant so that bluebottle fly buzzed hopefully about settling occasionally on cracked green door where cleaned wing generally furbished up a if warmth be that of spring day promised summer to follow be there in considerable number for just outside in cobbled yard be heap of manure where hungrily congregated against white washed wall of house there lay fat sow basking contentedly snorting in dream yard bounded on two side by house wall be shut in on third by row of farm shed fourth be open just outside stood small copse half flooded with brimming water of sluggish stream meandered by side of farm road leading out of yard turned to left soon joined highway farm road be partly under water though not deeply so that by skirting along raised bank be possible to go dry shod to highway underneath stream passed in brick culvert through kitchen window set opposite door must be seen broad stretch of country of fenland type flat bare intersected with dyke where sedge stirred slightly in southerly breeze here there be pool of overflowed rivulet here there be plantation of stunted hornbeam russet leaf of still clung thickly to in main be bare empty land featureless stolid just below kitchen window there be plot of cultivated ground thriftily economically used for growing of vegetable concession however be made to sense of brightness beauty for on side of path leading up to door ran row of michaelmas daisy rather battered by fortnight of rain have preceded day of still warm sun struggling bravely to shake off effect of adverse condition under have laboured kitchen be extremely clean orderly flagged floor be still damp brown in patch from washing have received two hour before draught between open window open door be fast drying down centre of room be deal table without cloth on be laid half dozen place marked with knife fork spoon thick glass ready for serving of midday meal on white washed wall hung two photograph of family group in one of appeared father mother three little child in other same personage ten year later lithograph of blessed virgin on side of table be deal bench at head foot two wooden armchair dresser stood against wall on floor by oven be frayed rug most important of to michael mind be big stewpot stood on top of oven from time to time fat comfortable frenchwoman bustled in took off lid of to stir placed on dresser plate of cheese loaf of freshly cooked brown bread two three of michael brother officer be there one sitting in patch of sunlight with back against green door on step outside post have come in not long before of michael included be occupied with letter paper to day there happened to be letter for michael paper glanced at seemed very feeble effort in way of entertainment there be news in except news about war here out at front did not interest in least perhaps in england people liked to know that hundred yard of trench have be taken at one place three german attack have failed at when be actually engaged have be must soon again be in taking part in thing seemed waste of paper compositor time to record there be column of letter also from indignant briton using violent language about crime treachery of germany that also be uninteresting far fetched nothing that germany have done mattered least there be use in arguing slinging wild expression about be stale subject altogether when be within earshot of incessant booming of gun morning have gone on without break doubt must get news of what have happened before set out again that evening for spell in trench in probability nothing particular have happened probably london paper must record next day further tediousness on part must be much more interesting to hear what be going on there whether there be new play whether there have be fresh concert what weather be like even who have be lunching at prince dining at carlton put down uninteresting paper strolled out into farmyard stepping over leg of junior officer who blocked doorway did not attempt to move on doorstep be sitting major of regiment who more politely shifted place little so that michael must pas outside smell of manure be acrid not unpleasant old sow grunted in sleep one of green shutter outside upper window slowly blew to there be someone inside room apparently for moment after hand arm bare to elbow be protruded fastened latch of shutter so that must not move again little further on be rail separated copse from roadway here out of wind michael sat down lit cigarette to stop yearning for bubbling stewpot must not be broached for hour yet day believed be wednesday whole quiet of place apart from drowsy booming on eastern horizon made feel like sunday nobody fat frenchwoman who bustled about have anything to do there be sabbath leisure about everything about dozing sow buzzing fly lounging figure read letter paper when last be here be true there be rather more of eight officer have be billeted here last week before have be in trench now there be six evening must set out again for forty eight hour in hellish inferno to morrow fresh draft be arriving so that when next foregathered here have happened in interval there must probably be at least six of did not seem to matter much what six there must be whether there must be more than six le mattered at moment a inhaled first incense of cigarette be that rain be over for present that sun shone from blue sky that felt extraordinarily well tranquil dinner must soon be ready of agreeable thing what pleased most be tranquillity to be alive here with manure heap steaming in sun sow asleep by house wall swallow settling on eaves be paradise enow somewhere deep down in be stream of yearning of horror flowing like underground river in dark yearned for sylvia thought with horror of two day in trench have preceded rest in white washed farm house with horror thought of day night must succeed horror yearning be stupefied by content flooded present moment doubt be reaction from what have gone before reaction be complete just now asked for nothing to sit in sun smoke cigarette wait for dinner a far a knew did not think of anything particular just existed in sun wind must have shifted little for before long came round corner of house slightly spoiled mellow warmth of sunshine must never do epicurean in revolted at idea of losing moment of complete well being arguing that if wind blew here must be dead calm below kitchen window on other side of house got off rail walked along slippery bank at edge of flooded road in order to go there be hard to keep footing here progress be slow felt must take amount of trouble to avoid getting foot wet in flooded road then there be patch of kitchen garden to cross where mud clung rather annoyingly to instep having gained garden path very carefully wiped boot with fallen twig dug away clot of soil stuck to instep found that have be quite right in supposing that air must be windless here full of great content sat down with back to house wall tortoise shell butterfly encouraged by warmth be flitting about among michaelmas daisy that bordered path settling on opening wing to genial sun two three bee buzzed there also summer like tranquillity inserted into middle of november squall rain deluded a well a michael into living completely in present hour gnat hovered about one settled on michael hand where instantly killed be sorry have done so for time booming of gun have sounded incessantly morning to east stopped altogether absolute quiet reigned have not be so hungry so unable to get idea of stewpot out of head michael must have be content to sit with back to sun warmed wall for ever high road raised embanked above low lying field ran eastward in undeviating straight line just opposite farm be last outlying hut of village from there onwards lay untenanted before many minute be passed quiet of autumn noon began to be overscored by distant humming faint at first then quickly growing louder saw far away little brown speck coming swiftly towards turned out to be dispatch rider mounted on motor bicycle who with hoot of horn roared westward through village immediately afterwards humming steadier more sonorous grew louder michael recognising looked up instinctively into blue sky overhead a english aeroplane flying low came from somewhere behind passed directly over going eastward before long stopped direct course began to mount in spiral when at sufficient height resumed onward journey towards german line then three four private billeted in village now resting after duty in trench strolled along road laughing talking sat down not hundred yard from michael one began to whistle tipperary took up until four be engaged on be not precisely in tune be performer in unison produced vaguely pleasant effect if not in tune with note a composer wrote sight sound of four whistling idle soldier be in tune with air of security of sunday morning something far down road caught michael eye moving line of brown wagon a came nearer saw that be motor ambulance of red cross moving slowly along rut hole traffic have worn so that occupant must suffer a little jolting a be possible carried doubt wounded who have be taken from trench last night now after calling for at first dressing station in rear of line be removing to hospital a passed four men sitting by roadside one of shouted cheer oh mate then fell to whistling tipperary again then oh blessed moment fat frenchwoman looked out of kitchen window just above head diner mbeieu said michael without thought of ambulance aeroplane scrambled to foot somewhere in middle distance of mind be sorry that tranquil morning be over just a below in darkness of there ran stream of yearning of horror ordinary work day self be occupied with immediate prospect of stewpot be sort of ragout knew lusted for red wine of country must be there cheese new brown bread surprised to find how completely bodily need pleasure of gratification have possession of be under order to go back to trench shortly after sunset when meal be over there remained hour two before have to start warmth glory of day be already gone streamer of cloud be beginning to form over open sky afternoon thickened till dull layer of grey have thickly overspread heaven below arch of vapour that cut off sun wind be blowing chilly with change in weather michael mood changed also horror of return to trench began to come to surface be not a yet aware of physical fear of death of wound rather feeling be one of mental spiritual shrinking from whole of vast business of murder where hundred thousand of men along battle front stretched way across europe be employed day night without having quarrel with other in unsleeping vigilant work of killing most of in probability be quite decent fellow like four who have whistled tipperary together yet be spending month of young sweet life up to knee in water in foul ill smelling trench in order to kill others whom have never seen except a speck on sight of rifle somewhere behind gruesome business a knew there stood cause calm serene like great statue made insensate murdering necessary just for hour to day a waited till have to be on move again found unable to make real to own mind existence of cause must not see beyond bloody hideous thing resulted from then in inaction of waiting attack of mere physical cowardice seized found imagining mutilation torture perhaps awaited personally in deathly ditch tried to busy with preparation of few thing that must take with tried to encourage by remembering that in previous experience there have not be conscious of fear by telling that be only unreal anticipation be always ready to pounce on one even before such mildly alarming affair a visit to dentist in spite of effort found hand growing clammy cold at thought beset brain what if there happened to what have happened to junior officer who be close to at moment when fragment of shell turned from big gay boy into writhing bundle at bottom of trench have lived for couple of hour like moaning cry out for god sake kill what if more mercifully be killed outright so that must lie there in peace till next night removed body perhaps have to bury in trench with dozen handful of soil cast over at that suddenly realised how passionately wanted to live to escape from infernal butchery to be safe again gloriously ingloriously mattered not to be with sylvia once more told that have be utter fool ever to re enter army again like must certainly have got appointment a dispatch carrier have attached to headquarters staff even have shuffled out of altogether above all wanted sylvia wanted to be allowed to lead ordinary human life safely securely with girl loved with musical pursuit be passion have hated soldiering in time of peace found now that be terrified of in time of war felt physically sick a with cold hand trembling knee stood waited lighting cigarette throwing away in front of kitchen fire where stewpot be already bubbling again for lucky devil who must return here to night major of company be sitting in window watching though michael be unaware of suddenly got up came across to fire put hand on shoulder mind comber said quietly get touch of sometimes will find will pas right be waiting doing nothing doe that touched michael absolutely in right place thanks awfully sir said not bit be damned beastly while last will be all right when move forget to take fur coat up if have got one will have cold night just after sunset set out marching in gathering dusk down road eastward where in mile two must strike huge rabbit warren of trench joined french line to north south once twice have to open out go by margin of road to let ambulance commissariat wagon go by there be little traffic here a main line of communication lay on other road high above scarcely visible in dusk english aeroplane droned back from reconnaissance once there be order given to scatter over field a german taube passed across caused much laughter chaff among men michael heard one say dove call do 'd like to make pigeon pie of dove soon scrambled back on to road again interminable tipperary be resumed in whistle song michael remembered how aunt barbara have heard at music hall have spoken of a new catchy tune must carry away with nowadays carried away have become audible soul of british army trench michael company be to occupy for next forty eight hour be in first firing line to reach have to pas in single file up mile of communication trench from on side like vast rabbit warren there opened out other gallery passage led to different part of net work of line ran not in straight line in short section with angle intervening so under circumstance must considerable length of be enfiladed be lit here there by little oil lamp placed in embrasure in one other wall of for distance at time be dark except for vague twilight of cloudy sky overhead then again a approached firing line must suddenly become intensely bright when from english line from of german lay not more than two hundred yard in front of fireball star shell be sent up caused everything shone upon to leap into vivid illumination usually when happened there came from one side other volley of rifle shot sounded like crack of stock whip once twice bullet passed over head with buzz a of vicious stinging insect here there where bottom lay in soft clayey soil walked through mud came way up to knee foot have to be lifted with effort be set free with smacking suck elsewhere if ground be gravelly rain for two day previously have be incessant have drained off going be easy whether path lay over dry soft place air be sick with stale odour breeze swept across line from south east must not carry away there be perpetual pervading reek flowed along from entrance of trench to right left reminded michael of smell of football scrimmage on wet day laden with odour of sweat dripping clothes something deadlier more acrid sometimes passed under section covered in with board over earth clod of turf have be replaced so that reconnoitring aeroplane must not so easily spy out here from dark excavation smell hung overpoweringly now then ground over passed yielded uneasily to foot where lay only lightly covered over corpse have be impossible to remove from time to time passed huddled bundle of khaki not yet taken away except for artillery duel day have heard going on morning last day two have be quiet wounded have be got out for most part dead also after long tramp in communication trench made sharp turn to right entered that be going to hold for next forty eight hour here relieved regiment have occupied till now who filed out a came in along at interval be excavation dug out in side propped up with board post others where ground be of sufficiently holding character just scooped out in front towards german line ran parapet of excavated earth with occasional peep hole bored in so that sentry going round must look out see if there be sign of movement from opposite without showing head above entrenchment even be matter of risk since enemy have located peep hole from time to time fired shot from fixed rifle came straight through buried bullet in hinder wall of trench other spy hole be therefore being made be not yet finished for present till be dug be necessary to use old one trench like others be excavated in short zigzag length so that point either to right left commanded more than score of yard of in front from just outside parapet to depth of twenty yard stretched spider web of wire entanglement little farther down on right there have be copse of horn beam sapling attempt have be made by enemy during morning to capture entrench thus advancing line movement have be seen artillery fire have be so incessant morning denoted searching of rendering of untenable how thorough searching have be be clear for have be acre of wood be now heap of timber fit only for faggot scarcely tree be left standing michael looking out of one of peep hole by light of star shell saw that wire entanglement be thick with leaf that wind firing have detached from broken branch in turn wire entanglement have come in for shelling by enemy squad of men be out now under cover of darkness repairing there be slight dip in ground here by crouching lying be out of sight of trench opposite there be sniper in have be wood from whom there came occasional shot then from lower down to right there came fusillade from english line suddenly breaking out after few minute a suddenly stopping again sniping from wood have ceased michael did not come on duty till six in morning for present have nothing to do except eat ration sleep a well a must in dug out have plenty of room to stretch leg if sat half upright having taken major advice in matter of bringing fur coat with found warm enough in spite of rather bitter wind that striking angle in trench wall eddied sharply into retreat to sleep not le justified than advice to bring fur coat be major assurance that attack of horror have seized after dinner that day must pas off when waiting be over throughout evening nerve have be perfectly steady when in progress up communication trench have passed man half disembowelled by fragment of shell screaming when a trod on one of uneasy place arm have stirred jerked up suddenly through handful of earth covered have first hand sense of horror felt rather a if thing be happening not to to someone else at most be strange odd longer horrible now when reinforced by food again comfortable beneath fur cloak let mind do what must not checking allowing natural internal activity found that mood transcending have known yet be so far from experience being terrifying so far from being strange unreal suddenly became intensely real shone with splendour that have never suspected originally have be pitchforked by father into army have left to seek music sense of duty have made easy for to return to at time of national peril during bitter anxiety of that have never a in light of perception came to now a wind whistled round in dim lit darkness have glimpse of glory of service to country here out in small evil smelling cavern with whole grim business of war going on round for first time fully realised reality of have be in trench before until now have seemed vague evil dream of be incredulous now in darkness darkness cleared knowledge that be very thing that couple of hundred yard away be line of enemy whose power for honour of england for freedom of europe have to be broken utterly filled with sense of firm indescribable joy minor problem have worried fact of million of treasure might have fed poor needy over britain for score of year being outpoured in fire steel fact of thousand of useful happy life being sacrificed of widow orphan childless mother growing ever greater company thing terrible to look at if looked at alone sank quietly into sad appointed place when looked at thing entire own case sank there too music life love for must so rapturously have lived be covered up now at moment must a rapturously have died if by death must have served in own infinitesimal degree cause fought for hour went on whether swiftly slowly did not consider wind fell for minute heavy shower of rain plumped vertically into trench once during sudden illumination blazed in sky saw pebble in wall opposite shining with fresh falling drop there be dozen rifle shot saw sentry who have just passed brushing edge of coat against michael hand pause look out through spy hole close by say something to occasionally dozed for little woke again from dreaming of sylvia into complete consciousness of where be of superb joy pervaded by by dozings grew longer interval of wakefulness le for couple of hour before be roused slept solidly dreamlessly spell of duty began before dawn got up to go round rather stiff numb sleep seemed to have wearied rather than refreshed in hour of early morning when vitality burn lowest dying part hold on life thrill have possessed during earlier hour of night have died down knew having once felt that be there believed that must come when called upon have drowsed a slept be overlaid by sense of grim inexorable side of whole business disconcerting bullet be plugged through spy hole second after have passed sounded not angry merely business like michael found thinking that shot fired in anger a phrase went be much more likely to go wide than shot fired calmly that in sleepy brain did not sound nonsense seemed to contain great truth if must bother to think out for be quiet again have returned to dug out just noticing that dawn be beginning to break for cloud overhead be becoming visible in outline with light filtered through on thinner margin turning rose grey when alarm of attack came down line instantly huddled sleeping body lay at side of trench started into being in moment pause followed michael found fumbling at butt of revolver have drawn out of case for one moment heard heart thumping in throat felt mouth grow dry with sudden panic fear came from knew not where invaded qualm of sickness took something gurgled in throat spat on floor of trench passed in one second for at once be master of again though not master of savage joy thrilled joy of chance of killing who fought against peace prosperity of world there be attack coming out of dark thank god be among who have to meet gave order have be passed to on word section of trench be lined with men ready to pour volley over low parapet be there too wildly excited close to spy hole now showed a luminous disc against blackness of trench looked out of in breaking dawn saw nothing dark ground of dip in front level line of german trench opposite then suddenly grey emptiness be peopled there sprang from earth advance line of surprise who began hewing way through entanglement while behind silhouette of trench be broken into huddled heaving line of men then came order to fire saw men dropping falling out of sight others coming on yet again others again fell others now must see gleam of bayonet came nearer bursting cutting way through wire then from opposite to right left sounded crack of rifle man next to michael gave one grunt fell back into trench moving more just immediately opposite be few dozen men whose part be to cut through entanglement kept falling passing out of sight while others took place then for reason michael found singling out just one of much in advance of others who be now close to parapet be coming straight on with leap cleared last line of wire towered above michael shot with revolver a stood three yard from fell right across parapet with head shoulder inside trench a dropped michael shouted got then looked be hermann next moment have scaled side of trench exerting strength be dragging over into safety advance of section who be to rush trench have be stopped again from right left rifle fire poured out on head appeared above parapet did not seem to concern all have to do moment be to get hermann out of fire just a dragged leg over parapet so that weight fell firm solid on to felt what seemed sharp tap on right arm must not understand why have become suddenly powerless dangled loosely from somewhere above elbow when tried to move hand found must not then came stab of hideous pain be over almost a soon a have felt heard man close to say be hit sir be evident that surprise attack have failed for five minute afterwards be quiet again out of grey of dawn have come before dawn be rosy be over michael with right arm numb for occasional twinge of violent agony seemed to more like scream colour than pain be leaning over hermann who lay on back quite still while on tunic splash of blood slowly grew larger dawn be already rosy when moved slightly opened eye lieber gott michael whispered breath whistling in throat good morning old boy chapter xvii three week later michael be sitting in room in moon street where have arrived last night expecting sylvia since attack at dawn in trench have be in hospital in france while arm be mending bone have not be broken muscle have be so badly torn that be doubtful whether must ever recover more than very feeble power in again in case must take many month before recovered even most elementary use of week have be long drawn continuous nightmare not from effect of injury have undergone from nervous breakdown from sense of inevitably hung over for knew by inward compulsion of mind that admitted of argument that have to tell sylvia have happened in ten minute while grey morning grew rosy sense of compulsion be deaf to reasoning however plausible knew perfectly well that unless told sylvia who be whom have shot at point blank range a leaped last wire entanglement one else ever must hermann be buried now in same grave a others who have fallen that morning name must be given out a missing from bavarian corp to belonged in time after war be over must grow to believe that must never see again sheer impossibility of letting happen though entailed nothing on except mere abstention from speech took away slightest temptation that silence offered knew that again again sylvia must refer to hermann wondering where be praying for safety hoping perhaps even that like michael must be wounded thus escape from inferno at front be so absolutely out of question that must listen to try to offer little encouragement wonder with whether be not safe that even in most depressed shrinking hour never for moment contemplated silence certainly have to tell hermann be dead to account for fact that knew to be dead in long watch of wakeful night when mind moved in twilight of drowsiness fever pain be here that certain temptation entered for be easy to say one must ever contradict that man near that one perhaps who have fallen back with grunt have killed hermann on edge of trench humanly speaking there be chance at of innocent falsehood being disproved in scurry wild confusion of attack none must remember exactly what have happened a thought of tossing turning seemed to one part of mind that innocence of falsehood must even be laudable be heroic must save sylvia horrible shock of knowing that lover have killed brother must save that piercing of iron into soul must inevitably be suffered by if knew truth who must tell effect knowledge of truth must have on michael felt that be at least possible that must never bear to see again still le sleep in arm of one who have killed brother that knowledge even if must put out of mind in pity sorrow for michael must surely return return again tear from sobbing trembling there be to risk in telling truth sorrow bitterness for for separation lifelong regret be piled up in balance against unknown weight of love indeed there be love on side of balance who must tell how gold weighed against gold yet after drowsy pain streaked night when sober light of dawn crept in at window then morning after morning michael knew that inward compulsion be in way weakened by reason that have urged remained ruthless tender still small voice be heard after whirlwind fire for very reason why longed to spare knowledge namely that loved other be precisely reason why must not spare seemed so wanton so useless so unreasonable to tell so laden with risk for that standard must measure no more contemplated except in vain imagination making up ingenious story of kind must account for knowledge of hermann death than contemplated keeping silence altogether be not possible for not to tell everything though when pictured doing so found faced by what seemed inevitable impossibility though did not see how lip must frame word knew have to yet must not remember how mere report in paper story of german cruelty what not have overclouded serenity of love what must happen when news report hearsay came to have not heard foot on stair did wait for servant to announce little before appointed time burst in upon midway between smile tear tenderness michael dear dear cried what morning for for first time to day when woke forgot about war poor arm how go oh will take care must will have in arm have risen to greet softly gently put arm round neck drawing head to oh michael whispered have come back to lieber gott how have longed for lieber gott when last have heard word have to tell must tell in minute two perhaps must never hold like again must not part with at very moment have got look ever so well michael said in spite of wound be so brown lean strong oh how have wanted never knew how much till went away looking at feeling arm round michael felt that what have to say be beyond power of lip to utter yet here in presence absolute necessity of telling climbed like peak into ample sunrise far above darkness mist that hung low about what lot must have to tell said want to hear suddenly michael put up left hand took away from neck arm encircled did not let go of held in hand have to tell one thing at once said looked at smile burned in eye be extinguished from gesture from tone knew that spoke of something a serious a love what be said tell then did not falter looked full in face there be breaking to letting go through gathering suspense of guessing concern hermann said concern hermann last morning be in trench there be attack at dawn from german line tried to rush trench in dark hermann led got right up to trench shot did not know thank god suddenly michael must not bear to look at more put arm on table by leaning head on covering eye went on voice up till now quite steady faltered failed a sob gathered in throat fell across parapet close to said lifted somehow into trench be wounded then lay at bottom of trench sylvia must to god have be who lay there because loved just at end opened eye saw knew said oh sylvia sylvia said 'lieber gott michael good morning old boy then died have told at michael broke down utterly completely for first time since morning of spoke sobbed heart out while unseen to sylvia sat with hand clasped together stretched towards just for little let weep fill yearning for must not be withstood knew why have told whole heart spoke of hugeness of then once more laid arm on neck michael heart said
