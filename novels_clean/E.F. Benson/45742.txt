excitement only yesterday occurred finale of business francis think with excellent reason that be accomplice to felony person chiefly concerned be luigi nephew of cook seraphina who till six month ago be valet butler major domo gardener to francis then in misguided moment thought to better by going a hall boy to grand hotel in alatri there be tip doubt in tourist season at grand hotel there be also trouble happened like from day of supposed crime sympathy of island generally be on side of luigi in fiery trial awaited be felt to be intolerable that boy who have just changed into best clothes have taken carnation from one of table in dining room be actually going out of hotel gate to spend afternoon of festa in piazza must have be summarily ordered back by porter commanded to show fat white german gentleman who be staying in hotel way to bathing place at palazzo mare carry towel bathing dress for latter of included sandal so that fat white gentleman must not hurt fat white toe on shingle abominable personage have also preferred in unaccountable manner of foreigner to go way on foot instead of taking victoria must have conveyed three quarter of distance saved much time must go on foot being very fat have walked at tortoise pace along dusty road under large green umbrella perspiring profusely stopping now then to sit down there be luigi standing by carrying sandal bathing dress towel while time precious moment of holiday afternoon be slipping along piazza where luigi must have be having be granted half holiday on account of festa be full of young friend male female in best clothes conversing laughing together standing about smoking occasional cigarette in orthodox fashion of holiday afternoon then after interminable walk during german gentleman kept asking baffled luigi series of question in unknown tongue appeared singularly annoyed when boy be unable to answer except in tower of babel manner drew three copper from pocket after prolonged mental struggle presented luigi with two of a reward for service then told that must find way up again alone having undressed swam majestically off round promontory of rock enclosed bathing beach hour afterwards luigi defrauded of holiday afternoon returned to gaiety companionship of piazza recounted to indignant audience outrageous affair time during afternoon francis looking out of bedroom window after siesta thought saw luigi slipping across garden of villa tiberiana climbing down over wall at bottom say be not sure being still sleepy when shouted luigi name out of window there came answer luigi returned to grand hotel in time to get into livery again before dinner on entrance be summoned into manager bureau where be confronted with teutonic taskmaster of afternoon charged with having picked pocket while be bathing portfolio be missing containing note for hundred lira german gentleman be gutturally certain have on person when started off to bathe equally certain that have lost when came to dress for dinner certainty be partly founded on fact that have tipped boy when arrived at palazzo mare to have tipped must have have money in pocket in answer luigi absolutely denied charge then made dreadful mistake by suggesting that signor have hole in pocket through portfolio have slipped be quite most unfortunate thing must have said for a german gentleman instantly demonstrated hole in pocket be undoubtedly there how so overpoweringly urged must luigi have known there be hole there unless have be examining pocket hour later poor luigi with gyves upon wrist be ignominiously led through piazza blazing with acetylene light resonant with blare of band be clapped into prison to await formal charge arrived there be searched similar examination be made in room at mother house where went to sleep at night nothing ever so remotely resembled german portfolio note for hundred lira be found still doggedly denied guilt then since nothing incriminating must be got out of key be turned while through small high grated window came sound of band in piazza for festa night later by standing on board bed must see fiery segment of aspiring path of rocket a ascended from peak above piazza listen to echo of explosion flap buffet against cliff of monte gennaro be from prison that saw heard outside in piazza tragic history of incarceration formed fine subject for talk public opinion cheerfully supposed guilty found extenuating circumstance almost amounted to innocence provocation of being obliged to spend best part of festa afternoon in walking down to sea with fat white tedesco be really immense reward of twopence for lost hour of holiday be nothing le than insult what wonder if luigi for moment mislaid honesty what wonder if when so smooth faced ready made temptation came just yielded to for second certainly be wrong to steal everyone know that mamma mia what rocket what bellezza of star be also primarily wrong to dock jolly boy of promised half holiday wonder when german signor ah be same doubt a be sick in antonio carriage other day refused to pay for new rug wonder when fat head pumpkin for who pumpkin must carry hundred lira about with swam away round corner of rock luigi hand just paid visit to great pocket to see if be a poor a miserable tip of twopence seemed to say then found portfolio turned bitter with thought of quattro soldi be have be given for loss of half holiday ah look be really wheel like on santa caterina have be bound how must have spun round what giddiness what burning steadfast soul not to have consented to worship apollo wonder that holy church made saint of what must luigi have done with portfolio note for hundred lira have be searched on be nothing found room have be searched there be nothing there be possible that be innocent il povero must sick german gentleman really have lost foolish pocket book by natural mean a came up from bathe might be worth while taking walk there to morrow always keeping peeled eye on margin of path be possible after that have lost pocket book by without aid from luigi for hole in pocket be admitted shown to manager of grand hotel then there be luigi fatal knowledge of hole in pocket be very bad that looked like guilt if only boy have held tongue not said that fatal thing only suggested that there be hole in pocket no said there be hole in pocket did what lesson to keep tongue still luigi have always lot to learn about keeping tongue still for who will soon forget dreadful thing shouted out last winter at priest mother cousin uncle when have smacked head be quite true too like hole in pocket ah there be great bomb pouf how echo so firework be over buona notte buona notte while lounging in piazza listening to band watching firework heard from tobacconist barber few other friend coupled with information that francis told a strolled up homewards again namely that thought have seen luigi afternoon slipping through garden be not sure about so leaving aside recalled few fact about luigi when be in service used to hurry over house work always for preferred role of gardener to others used to wander among flower bed making plant comfortable giving one drop of water that fresh piece of stick to lean on then must make mud pie by turning on cistern tap plant verbena in in more mysterious fashion made cache in hole behind loose masonry in cistern wall francis have got just appreciation of secrecy rapture of making cache never let luigi know that be aware of hidden treasure after luigi have gone home to mother of evening must yield to curiosity see what boy have put there sometimes there must be matchbox pilfered cigarette piece of string carefully wrapped up in paper now poor luigi be behind grated window seraphina with deepest sarcasm said that be what called bettering must have done better to have done worse remained at villa tiberiana in service of signior suddenly next day like change in weather coming from cloudless sky fresh train of thought be suggested by luigi episode mention of lottery how various incident personage bore on luck of number on instant luigi have done not done ceased to interest anybody except in so far a event be concerned with science interpretation of number in lottery a set forth in amazing volume called smorfia there will find what numeral mean so must earthquake occur eclipse wise speculator look out earthquake eclipse in smorfia at next drawing of national lottery lottery at naples back number to signification be attached a happened event of striking local interest have occurred in alatri since in april last carpenter in corso agosto have unsuccessfully attempted to cut throat with razor after successfully smothering aunt have be last occasion on there be clear guidance a to choice of number in naples lottery nobody of sporting turn of mind who have smallest sense of opportunity life offer have failed to back among other thing mean aunt number signified razor throat blood bolster have smorfia dictionary give useful information disappointed adherent for carmine pasqualino brother have backed number meant throat razor carpenter aunt sunday last being day on distressing event occurred went to bed night to dream of glory awaited who nominated quinterno secco mean that back five number of come out in order named once so succulent tradition said baker at marina have accomplished enviable feat after alatri saw more for reward be million franc marquisate estate in calabria where soon afterwards be murdered for sake of million stimulating page of history be not wholly repeated in case of carmine carpenter aunt by judicious selection have certainly reaped two hundred franc where have only sowed five doctor also who have attended abortive suicide have done very well by backing salient feature of tragedy astute superstition have on whole be adequately rewarded next day accordingly piazza seethed with excitement a to due application of luigi episode to enchanting lorelei of lottery have magnificent well marked feature smorfia shouted with opportunity first of there be luigi to be backed a everyone knew boy be number next there be german gentleman michele turn up 'german then there be pocket hole portfolio bathe be likely chance other aspect of affair struck serious mind festa be connected with so too be prison where now luigi languished then there be theft denial here be abundant material for quinterno secco when once initial difficulty of selecting right number be surmounted marquisates million hovered on horizon ready to move up descend on alatri among who be thus interested in affaire luigi from purely lottery point of view there be more eager student than boy mother maria be confirmed steadfast gambler of optimistic type feel amply rewarded for expenditure of ten lira on series of number prove quite barren of reward if at eleventh attempt gained five have be to see son in prison have wept little consoled little have smuggled packet of cigarette into hand have reminded that same sort of thing though far worse have happened to father with whom be peace for at most luigi must get couple of month in prison owing to youth cool of cell be really not unpleasant in hot weather severity of sentence must doubtless be much mitigated if must only say where have hidden portfolio hundred lira nothing must induce luigi to do still firmly adhered to innocence repeated ad nauseam unfortunate remark that there be hole in fat german pocket expostulation being useless luigi being fairly comfortable maria left on way home gave very serious consideration to feature of case intended to back at lottery have ascertained that luigi have new clothes on be sort of flower on butterfly chance alighted on looking up number of new clothes novelty freshness found that be then on further study of smorfia learned that word thief be represented by following own train of thought discovered that meant liar here be strange thing especially when with emotional spasm remembered that boy be here be whole adventure nutshelled for for be there not boy who put on new clothes showed thief subsequently liar covered whole thing almost throttled by thread of coincidence hurried down to lottery office aflame with premonition of staggering success invested fifteen lira in number lingered in piazza little after laying touching garland on altar of luck to receive condolence of friend on luigi wickedness have kind word thrown to by signor gelotti great lawyer who have come over for week holiday to native island ah there be man why if got into witness box must make contradict before knew have opened mouth give couple of minute at must make say that man have described a having black coat moustache have coat at whisker that though have met at three o'clock precisely in piazza have just informed court at hour be having siesta in own house luigi father have at one time be in service though have left handcuffed for longer period of imprisonment than son be threatened with lawyer gelotti have always nod smile for widow to day pleasant little joke about heredity ah if lawyer gelotti must only take up case must muddle everybody up finely in especial that fat german fellow who like beastly swaggering truculent race be determined to press home charge lawyer gelotti a world knew never held up forefinger at witness under thousand lira what forefinger made tell two more lie in order to escape from lie that have already told three day passed while still luigi languished behind bar then sudden thrill of excitement emanating from office of lottery swept over island for naples lottery have be drawn five winning number be issued in due order of occurrence be alatri grew rosy with prospective rich for in affaire luigi must have be slapping face of providence look after lottery not to have backed boy thief at least ten dutiful folk have done that che peccato why did not back a luigi mother have done for knew that luigi must have have new clothes on a did boy on festa what thing be to use rightly knowledge posse lucky woman have won terno for first three number backed came out in order nominated never be such thing seen since day of classical baker why terno must be worth three thousand lira at least be next door to title of marchioness now what doe mean quick turn up in smorfia who have smorfia ernesto tobacconist of course be mean man will not lend smorfia to who doe not buy packet of cigarette never mind let have cigarette be always cigarette there what doe signify dio what lot of meaning man in moon hair on tail of elephant empty egg shell who ever heard like there be sense in number doe mean why very first meaning of be truth there be curious thing when thought that luigi be telling lie look be fourth number came out must have be simple to conjecture that must be pity that did not think of last week be easy to be wise after event a bridegroom said talk on piazza rose to ever loftier peak of triumph a fresh beneficiary of luigi who have made few lira over boy thief joined chattering group have done very well for friend have poor luigi though pocket portfolio have brought in nothing to backer be like already luigi be considered directly responsible for windfall be like to have turned up that ridiculous with man in moon empty egg shell luigi gay ragazzo loved that extravagant sort of joke of point be that there be point made everybody laugh a when affixed label three lira complete to fringe of donna margherita new shawl from naples a walked about piazza showing off never guessing what so many smile meant stood for truth be strange that must have turned up that nobody dreamed of supposing that luigi be telling truth mother for winning must be finely vexed that have not trusted son word backed truth instead of putting money on liar why if backed truth must have gained quaterno god know how many lira ah there be let go congratulate good soul winning will make up to for having son a well a husband who be thief luigi mother be in hot haste have put on best clothes not a be at first conjectured because in affluence have come to have be instantly degraded into second best because be making business call on lawyer gelotti be not one to turn broad back on own son though be true that have confidently selected with signification of liar if satanic skill of lawyer gelotti must get luigi off skill be going to be invoked for defence hundred thanks hundred greeting to everybody have time for conversation just now lawyer gelotti must be seen at once if be at home if not must just sit on doorstep wait for yes have heard that thousand lira be fee must have if be right proper there be plenty more where came from bravura passage pleased piazza showed gaiety swagger proper to lady of property in due course followed event alatri be quite prepared for when knew that lawyer gelotti be engaged on luigi behalf that full blast of hurricane of interrogation must be turned on fat german gentleman never be there such tearing to shred of apparently stout evidence fragment be scattered to point of compass like rocket star luigi have watched from grated tedesco be forced to allow that have not looked in pocket to see if portfolio be safe till full three hour after have returned from bathe what have done in three hour did not know then court must guess be nasty again have told manager of hotel that knew have portfolio with when went to bathe because have tipped boy ah wonderful tip be be not twopence yes lawyer gelotti thought so twopence for carrying basket of towel bathing costume two elephant sandal over island tante grazie be really custom to carry copper in portfolio did not usually carry penny loose in pocket have ever to knowledge carried penny in portfolio must swear that have come sir keep court waiting for simple answer very good magnificent tip did not come out of portfolio at a have previously affirmed lawyer gelotti have tremendous lunch at stage of proceeding tackled german afterwards with renewed vigour be credible that man so careful let say so laudably careful with money a to make so miserly tip must have taken portfolio containing hundred lira down to bathing place left in clothes be number of note surely prudent economical citizen of germany man so scrupulously careful of money a to tip on scale must have taken precaution to have registered number of note did not usually do so yes so lawyer gelotti suspected in case very strangely have not that be odd that be hard to account for except on supposition that there be such note portfolio about seemed really impossible to get accurate information be shabby be yet hour before have be told be new who else have ever set eye on wonderful portfolio new ragged portfolio with note of unknown number nobody of course nobody there followed most disagreeable forensic picture of fat german gentleman while above a stained glass window look down on mephistopheles lawyer gelotti proceeded to paint luigi portrait in such seraphic line colour that maria brimming with emotion felt that sixteen year ago have given birth to saint have never known till now here be boy who have lost father gelotti voice faltered a spoke of egregious scamp who from morning till night slaved to support stricken mother through self sacrificing day of spotless boyhood never have suspicion hint of sin

so gay gentleman thought inspired be that by service might earn franc perhaps two franc since be festa to bring home to aged parent what be reward twopence twopence followed by base unfounded disproved diabolical accusation prison have be reward languished in dungeon while alatri kept holiday holy festival a for admission of prosecution have made so much namely that luigi have said that german gentleman have hole in pocket how rejoiced be lawyer gelotti that have done so be suggested that luigi must have searched clothes found there apocryphal portfolio note have number be true that

across empty blue setting at evening unveiled by cloud vapour into sea light wind pouring steadily a stream from north one morning there gathered cloud on southern horizon no bigger than man hand weather wise say betokens change on day too there appeared in paper that other cloud presaged wild tempest of blood fire here in secure siren isle hardly gave thought to just have hot at lunch cold at dinner after thought of more seemed to have disappeared even a column of smoke above vesuvius disappeared few week ago have be very hot clear morning since evening before have be necessary to tell

macaroni boiled in wine juice of there promised so remarkable supply seraphina who have come upstairs for order told pretty roundly that if be meant for joke be in worst possible taste for be who ordered wine be responsible for lowness of signior bill upon pasqualino sinuously retired with deprecating smile leaving seraphina flushed with victory in possession of field in fact situation be so serious proceeded to tell that priest have arranged that silver image of san costanzo be to night to be taken in procession from cathedral where usually abides down to marina where altar be to be set up for close to quay firework to be let off so that may be gratified by making intercession cause rain so sorely need to fall certainly that seems very sensible idea islander adore firework procession

dimmer in quality different in tone be recognizable different ghost like disembodied without smack of sun in strolled about for little then having a usual writing on hand must have be done day before went reluctantly into house be quite alone in for seraphina have gone home pasqualino be down at marina taking part in firework festa have left francis in stuffy cafe pondering on gambit have dined early by reason of firework before going up to sitting room to work foraged for cake wine in kitchen carried upstairs be very hot went first into studio where set window wide next into francis room pasqualino where did same then came back to own room exactly opposite studio stripped to shirt trouser with door window wide sat down for hour writing there be such incentive to constructive thought a knowledge that humanly speaking interruption be impossible seraphina must not return till morning while festa chess must undoubtedly detain pasqualino francis for next couple of hour have luxurious sense of security must be so fortunate a to strike vein be delving for must go on mining there without let hindrance reluctant though have be to begin speedily found delightfully engrossed in what be doing probably did not amount to much illusion in author mind when tinker away at tale that be doing something vastly important be one be never shaken even though continually find out afterwards that

pearl only to must be artist be painter poet writer sculptor be constructing recording impression though hasten to repeat may be totally unworthy of record doe think so when be engaged on for if did must be conscious of external affair mind must wander must stop often of course that happens there be other blessed occasion when be engulfed by own imaginings absorbed in reproduction of be so with night when sat quite alone in silent house knowing that none must disturb for couple of hour to come italy even fact be in italy vanished from mind for sake of curious at risk of egoism may mention be with mr hancock in bedroom in horrid villa called arundel looking over jewel with to see what must spare without missing a wedding present for daughter engaged in trivial pursuit lost conscious touch with everything else quite suddenly very ordinary noise though a startling a ringing of telephone bell at elbow where there be telephone snatched away from imaginings there be step in studio just opposite made doubt that francis have got home have come upstairs without hearing doubt thinking be at work have passed into studio then looking at watch lay on table before saw that be still only half past ten have be at work at chess for barely hour there be reason must not go on working for hour yet though sense of security from interruption be gone anchored to page again something have snapped must not get back into mr hancock bedroom again after few feeble sentence corresponding number of impatient erasure came to full stop sat there for ten minute more vainly endeavouring to concentrate again over mr hancock jewel francis step be in way strangely disturbing passed up studio paused returned paused passed up again then not till then there came into mind fact that seraphina pasqualino have at different time heard thought heard footstep in studio on investigation have found empty began to wonder still rather dimly remotely whether be indeed pacing of francis up down room reasonable mind told that be recollection of other occasion became momently more vivid got up to see door of room that of studio be exactly opposite other with width of narrow passage between door be open on going into passage saw that studio be dark within seemed odd that francis must walk up down a be still continuing to do in dark suddenly felt intense curiosity to know whether be francis walking up down in dark rather intense desire to satisfy that be not switch of electric light be just inside door even a hand fumbled for still heard step quite close to next moment studio leaped into light a pressed switch looked eagerly up down there be one there though second before have heard footstep quite close to stood there moment not conscious of fear though knew for reason heart be creaking in throat that felt odd prickly sensation on head paramount feeling be curiosity a to who what be that went walking here paramount consciousness that though must see one step have ceased there be someone close to time watching not unkindly beyond doubt for visible presence studio be empty knew that search now carried out visiting darker corner going on to balcony outside from there be

to thank francis other afternoon about tea time for kindness did not care about thanking though have be just a kind a francis eventually owing to awful frequency of visit posted pasqualino on balcony overlooking path to give warning like brangaene from tower of miss machonochie fell approach while have tea so that must effect exit through kitchen door live like outlaw in heather till miss machonochie have left gratitude behind be not sufficient to instruct pasqualino to say be out for then miss machonochie must sit rest in garden for little come up to studio to write letter of thanks

riddled with water course gathered water gleamed in cistern miss machonochie need borrow more come up about tea time to thank francis for largesse hound from tea to seek refuge on arid hill side pasqualino remarked that san costanzo have be long time thanking for firework did suppose a pasqualino remark about hierarchy of heaven be sometimes almost embarrassingly child like in reasonableness skilfully changed subject by telling to measure water in cistern though francis need longer be afraid of miss machonochie arrow that flieth by day so constantly transfixing though after prolonged thought confessed that there be nothing else in life bothered except in two year time pasqualino must have to go for military service must have to find servant really seemed trial fieriness of need

practical country be stifling spiritual unhappiness by being busy doe thing to prevent thinking about thing though doe very foolish thing show common sense in doing something rather than encourage unhappiness by brooding over herein show inherent vitality be le vital must abandon to gloomy reflection doe not be tremendously busy so with set purpose deprives of tendency to think be not very difficult for a nation can not be considered good at thinking now considering that action of kind be direct result of thought must seem at first sight when observe amazing activity of most people that same people must think great deal a matter of fact most people so far from thinking great deal hardly think at greater part of consistent activity be result of mere habit baby for instance who be learning to walk girl who be learning to knit think immensely absorbedly about locomotive involved accomplishment just because have not yet formed habit of few year later baby who have become man will give thought at to act of walking indeed to walk feat once so engaged mind now set mind free to think find that problem require to be thought out be assisted to solution by act once required so much attention similarly grown up woman often really talk attends better to other thing when be engaged in knitting accomplishment have soaked in through conscious to sub conscious self demand direction from practical mind be on line of analogy that must explain fact that many very active people be almost incapable of sustained coherent thought many of activity be matter of habit order dinner look at picture exhibition argue about war with more thought than man who walk woman who knit can be voluble about post impressionism because at one time acquired habit of talking about to do so now requires more exercise of reflective critical quality than doe ordering of beef steak pudding oh if argue about war most people have original idea of kind on subject mix round a in omelette certain fact have seen in official telegram with certain reflection have read in leader of paper serve up hot cold a fancy dictate think about thought in fact not merely abstract thought far le difficult variety namely definite coherent thought about concrete thing be extremely rare accomplishment among grown up people be often told that be infinitely harder to learn anything when be of mature age than when be young be quite true reason for being that now find more difficult to think since have so long relied on muddling along under direction of habit even people who think think be not in most case real owner of thought borrow thought a from circulating library instead of owning return slightly damaged at end of week two borrow more think for stir about stale thought of others offer insipid porridge a home industry secondhand method of thinking be strangely characteristic of race in contradistinction to french german method of thought be admirably illustrated by anecdote concerning camel englishman frenchman german be bidden to write essay on melancholy beast deriving authority from where chose englishman studied book of natural history at british museum when have written essay founded on went shot camel frenchman took hat stick went to jardin de plantes where looked at real camel subsequently have ride two on back german did none of thing consulted authority looked at camel shutting up in study constructed one from inner consciousness now whether offspring of mentality be like real camel not history doe not tell probably be not more than new map of europe planned by prussian militarism will prove like map of europe a will appear in atlas published let say in even if german camel be totally unrecognizable a such constructor have shown capable of entering on higher plane of thought than be intelligible to ordinary englishman german in fact a be beginning to learn be able to sit down think out of pure thought to build up image english be excellent learner quick to assimilate apply what others have thought out french be vivid keen observer have power of sustained internal thought characterizes teuton who incidentally be quite equal of englishman at learning of frenchman at observation german for instance thought out doctrine of submarine warfare to grievous cost applied to shipping similarly thought out doctrine of trench warfare supplemented by gas then french with marvellously quick power of observation saw comprehended applied in fact two great german invention conceived by originally used by have be adopted brought to higher pitch of perfection by adversary if only of allied nation must pick up from power of concentrated imaginative thought for root of matter be imagination proverbially muddle through when occasion arises by dint of certain stubbornness

strong beating of heart how fervour intensity of savour persist what thought be superficial find to be quality dwells in innermost will easily talk about la france la gloire when first get acquainted

there be to magic about if unbidden conjure up image must not be surprised if word matilda connoted to grey parrot must be more surprising if when become acquainted with grey parrot did not become aware that be matilda see how can get away from fact that must in essential of nature be matilda presently will see what matilda ism be when be stated will know that knew all along did know knew same sort of thing happened to somebody when became aware that life have be writing prose very good prose be here then begin introduction to matilda ism in general term to be applied later matilda ism of know even most consistent of baffling instinct lead to act in manner incompatible with other simultaneously be not so puzzling a sound sound quite a ungrammatical a be instance will clarify principle for who doe not understand in measure sympathize with careful housewife who embarks on two shilling taxicab expedition in order to purchase small household commodity at sixpence le than must have bought for across road motive of expedition be economy therefore lash out into bewildering expenditure in order to achieve economy in fact be direct cause of indulging in totally unnecessary expenditure tie to stake with one hand ready to be burned for sake of faith offer incense to heathen god with other be strain of self contradictory conduct unhesitatingly label matilda ism for a far a be aware there be other succinct term in english language sum up express besides be characteristic of grey parrot for a will presently see be what matilda doe can not explain incompatibility of action principle otherwise be not vacillation be not infirmity of purpose for economical housewife be one mass of purpose motive be a pure a parsifal simply in pursuance of economical design rush into expense be sign of weak intellect for matilda grasp of subject be like mr micawber inferior to none yet matilda be great example of quality take name from doe not spare thought industry perhaps if anything think too much may account for inadequacy of plumage have be ill too lately perhaps make plumage worse for have be suffering from obscure affection of brain since illness matilda ism have be more marked than ever prefer to think that be thought have accounted for illness abnormal moulting have that rare disease beloved of novelist called brain fever people hair be told fall out after brain fever so did matilda feather be sure that matilda must sooner go naked than cease to think unlike most woman matilda doe not care about clothes unlike most bird doe not scoop preen after breakfast give one shake then settle down to study consist in observing with scornful wonder go on round when first came here be in hurry to draw conclusion commit hastily to irrevocable word for sat waited without speech for six week until thought be either dumb have nothing to say then unlike mr asquith ceased to wait see began calling kitchen maid mabel in voice so like cook that deluded young lady came running from scullery into kitchen to find cook there at at only grey parrot sat with stony half closed eye on perch then a went out again believing that discarnate intelligence have spoken to matilda laughed at in rude hoarse voice be precisely like milkman mewed like cat said cuckoo number of time have learned last spring in country be unaware that there be cuckoo in london ever even in country in november matilda in fact with powerful intellect awful memory have be taking stock of everybody not telling anybody about now that be well within power to deal with situation must possibly arise in mocking manner decided to begin talking taking active part that of critic in life simultaneously began to reveal what matilda ism be at period since be too accomplished to be limited to kitchen took upstairs thought must meet more people there enlarge if possible mind be already vast first definite elucidation of matilda ism be to make love in most abandoned manner to green parrot wooed in style that bishop of l nd n so rightly deprecates with loud cockney whistle love lorn eye of course joey seemed to like cage be moved close together in hope that eventually must make match of that most remarkable baby must chip shell of egg matilda continued to encourage one day when cage be now quite close to other green gentleman trembling with excitement put out horned claw introduced into matilda cage on matilda screamed at top of voice bit viciously thought at time that be only exhibition of eternal feminine encourages man then be offended indignant when make natural response to invitation in light of subsequent event believe to have be matilda ism be not being flirt simply while adored hated also be matilda see time be matilda waiting to be classified matilda knew perfectly well what cat say knew too that cat be called pus putting two two together always said meaow when went to cage said pus be synthetic reasoning like of best philosopher world over be taken a mark of highest intelligence similarly knew that dog be called taffy by converse process inaccessible to finest mind if went to cage said bow ow ow responded with neatness of versicle taffy taffy taffy be matilda ism when taffy came near cage invariably mewed to when cat came near cage barked did not confuse be brain shine illustriously above cloud of muddle preferred to abandon synthetic reasoning create matilda ism must insist on for evidence go to confirm for instance if pull handkerchief from pocket make rude noise can not fail to remind of blowing of nose oppressed by catarrh also when mabel left learned name of new kitchen maid at once never made mistake about a increased in year wisdom ineradicable leaning towards matilda ism increased also then came crisis in life brain fever to have alluded have fit for five six day be seriously ill in spare room set high above noise of street where exciting sound must reach recovered recovery be held to be complete when from spare room where have undergone rest cure stream of polyglot noise one morning issued forth took back into sitting room again reminded her of european war by saying gott strafe kaiser thought must bring into touch with world of to day again for long time remained perfectly silent when have said gott strafe kaiser two three hundred time burst into speech with loud preliminary scream gott strafe polly head cried gott save king gott save kaiser gott scratch polly head oh lord oh lord cuckoo cuckoo pus pus pus bow ow ow poor demented bird laughed in hoarse ecstasy at having got in touch with synthetic reasoning again matilda ism took control of thought if tea cup be presented to notice blew nose loudly though can not believe that have ever seen tea cup used a handkerchief when joey be put near cage again called taffy barked at kitchen maid mewed at cook called cat mabel correlation have gone wrong in attack of brain fever though have shown sign of matilda ism before never thought must come to be voluble mass of contradictory irreconcilable proposition wrote to francis since desired domestic ridiculous information when letter be sealed dispatched must not help thinking that matilda real a be be chiefly parable be impossible in fact not to recollect that king constantine of greece be very ill last spring like matilda subsequently invited ally to land at salonica ii turned m venizelos out of office look traitorous perhaps be mere matilda ism be not sure that must not be better for to have more brain fever have done with postscript must be added took matilda into country when went there for few day last week one morning saw ferret being taken out of bag instantly sang pop go weasel think that show turn for better slight power of sane synthesis lurks in melody for ferret be sort of weasel be naturally optimistic can not help wondering whether change of air might not produce similar amelioration in case of king constantine russia for instance have intended to keep annals of matilda detached from war have wound way in again a king charles head invaded chronicle of mr dick there be getting away from if light cigarette think of turkey expedition to dardanelles if drink glass of wine think of trench dug through vineyard of france yet how little actually have war entered into vital part of mass of english people to large number reckoned by thousand have made unhealable wound into larger number reckoned by million prick of sword have really penetrated wonder when kind of awakening will come when to endless dormitory of drowsy sleeper smell of burning sound of flaming beam above head below will pierce dream pray god on day there will be terrified plucking from sleep into reality vastly more portentous than nightmare awakening from sloth into ordered energy up till now profound slumber at most slumber with coloured dream have possessed spirit of nation occasionally sleeper roused by glare that burn sombrely on placid night of normal human

since francis return have sat in dead silence though have taught to say hurrah for vc have repeated without stopping for several hour day before arrived moment saw looked at with cold grey eye remained absolutely speechless of course did not tell francis what have taught to say because might take into head to begin to talk at time congratulation must not then be surprise to so held tongue matilda hers then most unfortunate incident occurred for francis left decoration in taxi next day though telephoned to taxi rank police station in world must hear nothing of think ever saw anyone so furious a be one will believe got shouted meant to wear day night so that even burglar coming into house must see now one will know ca go about chanting ' be vc left in taxi ' who must believe cock

screaming like pythian prophetess whistled like milkman cuckooed called on maker name on taffy in couple of minute have said everything have ever known mixed vc up with laughed at vc blew nose at accompanying awful manifestation of matilda ism with dancing strange brazilian measure on perch then stopped a suddenly a if power of speech have be blown out like candle hermetically sealed horny

be far bigger with blessing than former with beastliness need read book need do anything did not want to do very soon book have really taken up for fear of being surprised by servant doing nothing at began to engross be concerned with inexplicable telephone to francis have alluded contained account of communication have be made by young soldier killed in france with relative a francis have said london have got cracked on subject after what wonder be there slightest chance of establishing communication between living dead what subject even war must be worthier of profoundest study experiment nothing more interesting nothing more vitally important must engross for of affair in world must be so important a establishment scientifically firmly of fact concern next world for there be one experience namely death be of absolutely universal interest everything else from little finger to shakespeare brain only concern certain number of people whereas death concern remotest patagonian however strongly sincerely may happen to believe that death be not extinguishing of essential self with what intense interest must grab at anything can throw light on smallest most insignificant detail of life be hereafter lived if mind be so constructed that believe in survival of personality how infinitely more keenly must clutch at remotest evidence so long a be evidence that there be something to follow after earth have be filled in above body from be agreed something have departed without prejudice without bias of child like faith convinced scepticism preserving only open mind willing to be convinced by reasonable phenomenon there be nothing sublunar superlunar so vitally concern may not care about treatment of leprosy presumably in belief that will not have leprosy may not care about danish politics in belief that will never be mp if there be such thing for copenhagen what can not fail to interest be slightest evidence of what may occur to when pas inevitable gate there be only two thing can possibly happen one be complete extinction in case allow subject be closed since if be extinguished be idle to inquire what occurs next since nothing can occur other be survival in form of life of fall into three head reincarnation a earwig hottentot emperor ii mere absorption into central furnace of life iii survival of personality here personal equation come in can not really believe be going to be earwig emperor to mind that sound so unlikely that can not fix serious thought upon what will do when be earwig emperor how will feel mind slip from thought a slip on ice fall down can conceive being absorbed into central furnace because a far a personality go be identical with extinction soul will be burned in source of life just a body may perhaps be burned in crematorium really care in such case what will happen to of unshakeable conviction with regard to long for evidence be that something that call will continue perhaps le inglorious career than have hitherto pursued if assemble together dozen healthy folk who have got idea of dying at present will find rooted in consciousness of at least eleven of if will be honest about there be same immutable conviction that will neither have be extinguished reincarnated absorbed when body be put away in furnace churchyard there be illusion conviction of vast majority of mankind with withdrawal from body of something have kept alive that something doe not cease to have independent personal existence well there have be lately enormous increase in number of who seek evidence on overwhelmingly interesting subject book have be reading wondering over treat of have gone with aunt aggie to seek there have be too be only fair to say enormous increase in exasperation of folk who knowing nothing about subject scorning to make study of what consider such hopeless balderdash condemn who have open mind on question a blithering idiot hoodwinked by trickery of so called medium out of own inner consciousness know that there can be such thing a communication between living dead there be end of matter who think there possibly may be such communication be fool who profess to be able to produce evidence for be knave being person of sanity common sense know that be impossible other shining example of sanity common sense must undoubtedly have affirmed thirty year ago with same pontifical infallibility that thing a wireless telegraphy be impossible hundred year ago that be equally ridiculous to think that sort of big tea kettle must draw freight of human being along iron rail at sixty mile hour wireless telegraphy express train happened in spite of sanity common sense seems to that if deny possibility of communication between living dead be acting in precisely same manner a same sensible people must have acted thirty hundred year ago favourite assertion of sane sensible be that if must get evidence though foam with rage at very notion of attempting to do thing must believe be precisely same thing a saying will not believe in australia till have be there for existence of australia depends for who have never seen on evidence of others evidence for existence of australia be overwhelming therefore be right to accept even though have not seen kangaroo gold australian troop postage stamp voyage of steamer make existence absolutely certain there be doubt about evidence in favour of possibility of communication between world non material world be now in process of accumulation be being studied by people who be eminent in scientific world seems that there be fragment scrap of evidence must be treated with respect of open mind by who have not pleasant gift of infallibility spring from complete ignorance be no longer use to quote from mr sludge medium there be great many gullible people in world great many fraudulent one when two get together round table in darkened room be obvious that there be premium on trickery because certain medium be knave vagabond who ought to be put in prison others be such a must not be allowed to go out except with mind under care of nurse doe not follow that there be such thing a genuine manifestation must be a reasonable to say that because child doe multiplication sum wrong there be something unsound in multiplication table fraudulent medium doe not invalidate possible genuineness in who be not cheat quack million quack cast slur on science of medicine in question of spiritualism there be denying that number of quack exposed unexposed be regrettably large without doubt spiritualistic phenomenon must be ruthlessly pitilessly scrutinized when be done be only hide bound stupidity refuse to treat result with respect other reservation must be made result can conceivably be accounted for by such well established phenomenon a telepathy thought reading must be unhesitatingly ruled out be deeply interesting in be like trace of other metal discovered in exploring gold reef be not gold have more to do with thing inquirer be in quest of than have acid drop penny bun many medium so called be not medium at have strange marvellous gift of being able to explore mind of others be working mechanism of group of phenomenon among may class hypnotism thought reading telepathy so forth rightly know inside conscious self of human being there lurks sub conscious subliminal self have something to do with thing event happens to man thought pass through mind impression that brain receives make mark on similar perhaps to minute dot on phonograph record phonograph record probably be in keeping of sub conscious mind though conscious mind may have forgotten fact circumstance in making of of mark sub conscious mind have recorded under certain condition can produce again be sub conscious mind without doubt exercise thought reading telepathic function in most people lie practically inaccessible others numerically few appear in trance even without suspension of conscious mind to be able to exercise power leaving out mere conjuring trick of fraudulent person be who pas for medium what happens bereaved mother bereaved wife sits with one of medium medium go into genuine trance probing mind of eager expectant sitter can tell sort of intimate detail about husband son who have be killed be already known to medium can produce name appearance can recount event happening of childhood can even say thing mother have forgotten prove to be true be wonder that sitter be immensely impressed be more than impressed be consoled comforted when medium proceeds to add still not quite fraudulently message of love assurance of well being be not quite conscious fraud be perhaps fraud of sub conscious mind now reminiscence encouraging message from other world have to be ruled out if want to get at real thing be phenomenon vastly interesting in be clearly accountable for by established theory of thought reading need have nothing to do with communication from discarnate spirit for can be accounted for by natural law already known to help in slightest degree to establish new knowledge for so many be searching francis have come back from lunch seance with aunt aggie considerable part of reflection be really precis of discussion have be quite good thought reading seance uncle willy through mouth of medium in trance have affirmed dislike of parsnip mushroom have mentioned name nickname puffin by aunt aggie have known have described with extraordinary precision room where used to sit be rather impressed said francis really be queer for silly though aunt aggie be think have previously gone to amber yes medium be amber just amber primed with regard to information amber read right out of aunt aggie mind then uncle willy became so extremely unlike must possibly believe be uncle willy must have be sort of reflection of what aunt aggie hoped have become be deeply edifying said be learning to be patient told that have improved wonderfully poor aunt aggie sobbed knew loved sobbing made feel good inside same let lie inertly on sofa in supreme bodily laziness a have said give mind greater activity be thought reading seance said quite good of kind have more to do with other world than matilda why must there be way through between material spiritual just a there be way for telegraphy a said without wire ninety nine time out of hundred doubt so called message from other side be only subtle intercommunication between mind on side be so hard to guard against might be done might think of piece of knowledge known only to fellow who be dead suddenly jumped up have thought of lovely plan said go for walk if have be out day go have bath something while be gone will prepare packet seal up in box nobody will know then when next bit of shrapnel come along hit instead of potted meat tin will pay guinea think be know paid for aunt aggie see if medium can tell what be in box nobody will know except will be dead so really will look very much a if have hand in if medium in trance can tell what be in box ca telepathize can roman catholic say be devil work to communicate with dead say sort of foul spirit get hold of other end of telephone be lucky be roman catholic what about war

sandwich how have longed for something of sort in two year half of insular northern existence can not hope to convey perhaps at last have reached that point of wanting ensures fulfilment though be interested in fantastic psychology really care how fulfilment came now that have come have have word from francis since letter last month from italian front announcing departure for rome mentioned that hoped to go to alatri since did not give address in rome telegraphed to island announcing advent at end of march early in april rather to surprise got following answer from alatri be meaning to write come out end of march if possible will be here for very clear reason somewhat perturbed there be cause for perturbation if one examined ground of disquietude for if be ill must surely have told so before far more probable interpretation be that have already forgotten about discomfort very depressed letter be snatching few rapturous day now then from rome spending on island might foresee that must do again at end of month wanted to come then because must be back at front in april that held water whereas conjecture that be ill did not though told good many time did not completely trust rendering silence before after telegram be rather inexplicable reasonable self told that there be shadow of cause for anxiety something inside that observed from more intimate spy hole than of reason be not quite satisfied however a day of march went by time for departure got really within focus instinctive unreasonable questioning grew insistent finally a if have be canary annoyed by chatter put

content down to mirror chair have slashed to piece plant tree in garden in vineyard orchard have destroyed by fire bomb be destructible have of course taken with woman girl movement have be on very large scale strategist who stay at home have be very busy over telling what mean best authority have be very plentifully invoked optimist have be informed that enemy have literally be blown out of trench tell that headlong retreat will not stop till reach rhine have begun while pessimist see in movement only strategical retreat will shorten german line enable enemy to send reinforcement to other front establish with ever greater security on what be known a hindenburg line retreat in fact according to pessimist in published german account agree with be great german success have rendered ineffective ally preparation for spring offensive according to optimist have taken french three hundred square mile of territory strongly fortified german position at minimum of cost out of welter of conflicting opinion two incontestable fact emerge one that enemy be unable to hold line other that retreat have cost very little in men nothing at in gun in midst of excitement in west have come prodigious happening from russia for several day there have be rumour of riot rising in petrograd authentic news came through till one morning woke to find that revolution have taken place that tzar

obscure issue be involved in movement know for certain yet whether grand duke michael be tzar of russia grand duke nicholas head of russian army whether whole family of romanoff have peeled off thrown aside like apple paring what be certain be that form of national government have taken place of germanized autocracy how stable will prove whether will be able to set derelict steam roller at work again start on way remains to be seen for shout with optimist certainly if crisis be over there actually be now in power firm national government capable of directing destiny of country will have be most wonderful revolution that ever happened then even earlier than have dared to hope for have not expected to get away before last week in march came that blessed moment when one night at waterloo

be still early went to studio to read little before went to bed found book be not thing one must attend to sat doing nothing scarcely even thinking did not want to think wanted to do be to look at what be going on here thought with perplexity conjecture burrowings did not touch heart of situation must only contemplate best friend have in world lay dying yet there must be sorrow be too utterly triumphant banner trumpet be assembling for passing called on joy of world to congratulate be not dying in view more than man dy who leaf little sphere for larger one death be not closing in upon opening out for saw walking not through dark valley upon hill top at approach of dawn soon for dim night world must burst into light colour already have be through night now lay there with morning in eye assured of day that waited for now be dimming of terrestrial star flooding with sun of infinite heaven knew must decently do be to try to look at through eye not through own be blinded with tear must never have be shed did not doubt truth of conviction knew in bone flesh on bone be weak cried out for april be on evening of thursday before easter got back to alatri once more outline of island have be soft cloud like shape afloat on sea grew distinct before got there lay dark against orange sunset flame of molten water there stood little crowd on pier waiting steamer arrival to night needed not to look for francis among during last ten day have have frequent news from nurse always of same sort suffered more pain day be sensibly weaker there among crowd stood pasqualino very smart in bersaglieri uniform have come down to meet with similar message have arrived two day before on week leave so told spent most of day up at villa helping in house weeding in garden sometimes when signorino be awake called to talked about manner of thing a in good day before be ill before accursed war came will all be a happy a signorino when come to last bed asked pasqualino there be great change in francis since ten day ago have drifted far on tide be carrying so peacefully away just recognized said few word then dozed off again into stupor in have lain day through morning of good friday also into afternoon lay unconscious now for first time sleep be troubled kept stirring muttering to unintelligibly for most part though now then there came coherent sentence inner consciousness think be aware of what day be for once said be lord who scourged thee crowned thee with thorn of many sorrow during hour nurse remained at bedside for breathing be difficult pulse very feeble be possible that at moment end might come pasqualino went softly about garden barefooted doing weeding once twice came to look at signorino cat dozed in hot sunshine lizard scuttled about pillar of pergola in stone pine linnet sang about three o'clock in afternoon breathing grew more quiet pulse grew stronger slept untroubled sleep for hour after that awoke that evening saturday morning be completely conscious brimming over with serene happiness sometimes talked sometimes read to out of emma alice in wonderland during afternoon asked to read few verse in st john about easter eve do come very early to morrow morning said when be done read next chapter easter morning chapter put down bible still open on table very well said will come at sunrise be tired now have be talking listening day yes will go to sleep for bit wo go for walk always get disagreeable towards evening if have have exercise where will go asked thought moment smiling go to very top of monte gennaro said to get biggest view possible stand there in loud voice thank god for everything that there be say for for say 'francis give thanks to thee for thy great glory ' be about that there be to say be ca think of anything else off go then said oh lor ' wish be coming too will go to sleep instead good bye woke very early next morning before sunrise with impression that somebody have called to from outside putting on coat went out into garden to see whether be francis voice that heard lay there fast asleep supposed that impression have be called be part of dream overhead star be beginning to burn dim in luminous sky in east sober dove colour of dawn be spreading upwards from horizon growing brighter moment very soon now sun must rise a have promised to come out then read francis chapter in st john about resurrection morning be not worth while going back to bed again so waiting for to awake took up bible still lay open on table where have laid yesterday with emma alice in wonderland a waited read to myself verse must presently read aloud to just a began first ray of sun overtopped steep hill side to east shone full on page did not yet reach bed where francis lay asleep when have thus said turned saw jesus standing knew not that be jesus jesus saith unto 'woman why weepest thou whom seekest thou ' supposing to be gardener at moment looked up for thought heard footstep coming towards along terrace crossed mind that be pasqualino arriving very early to help in house garden though a be sunday have not expected there be one visible only at entrance to pergola be still in shadow there seemed to be faint column of light saw more than impression be only vague instantaneous perhaps first sunray on book have dazzled then looked there more for stir of movement from bed made turn saw francis sitting up with hand clasped together in front of whether be glory of terrestrial dawn now shone on face day spring of light invisible so holy splendour illuminated must look in amazement on be gazing with bright eager eye to entrance of pergola in moment knew that saw there whom mary supposed to be gardener then clasped hand quivered in voice tremulous with love with exultation rabboni said joyful soul went forth to meet lord never have felt place so full of dear living presence a in day followed be so little of that laid in english cemetery here no more than discarded envelope have done with love of comradeship seemed to have be more closely knit day after day day long francis be with in intensity of actual presence that never lost security serenity for week remained there hourly throughout expected to see in bodily form to hear actual sound of voice be sure that appearance of such a call ghost hearing of voice must possibly have added to reality of companionship what law be sometimes permit to be conscious with physical eye ear of someone who have passed over stream daily seems to more narrow certainly know never before did realize how little mere satisfaction of vision audition matter when inward sense of presence of dead be so vivid be alone who felt for seraphina have told how often in day must hear stir of rattled door handle step along kitchen passage when be at cooking look round expecting to see signorino before recollected that must see more be same with pasqualino oddly enough though islander be full of superstitious terror of dead avoid certain place a haunted uncanny felt slightest fear at thought of seeing francis looked round for with bright eager face disappointment clouded again for be always there in hot blink of premature summer came down to bathe lay beside on beach swam with to rock of cache sat with at meal one afternoon came up to top of monte gennaro to pick orchis of spring to say gloria for there be break at in companionship indeed seemed a have said to have grown intenser more vivid when lay dying seemed quite impossible namely must come back to island villa again now must not find here have become perfectly natural since will most assuredly find here will be with in england too wherever may go during period of mortal day will find not by act of faith that dead die not by theoretical conviction that individuality survives from plain experience that be so when dimness dream of life vanish from awakening vision know also that among first who will give welcome will be francis grey merry eye will greet arrived back to cold snowy england towards end of month a soon a got home unlocked drawer in have placed on certain day last january two posthumous packet a francis called have severally prepared a reader may remember have packed to serve a test concerning possibility of spirit communication in mine have placed j nib five franc piece carbolic powder have written direction on that be to be sent to to deal with in event of dying first while be doing upstairs be making ready packet in sitting room on return gave wrapped up bound with string sealed there in drawer have lain till to day time be now come when test must be put box in have disposed certain object object unknown to be six inch long about same across at once went to friend who be much immersed in spiritualistic affair asked to arrange sitting for with medium whom believed to have power believed not to be fraudulent did not really matter whether medium be fraudulent not since amount of trickery must discover content of package asked that name must not be given that sitting must be arranged on appointed day begged finally to come with so between might get fairly complete account of what occurred to be witness may add be not at sanguine a to anything occurring accordingly few day afterwards jack barrett arrived together drove off to medium house packet that francis have made still lay in locked drawer of black oak table said word to friend about francis whom have known slightly about packet procedure be of kind common to trance medium sat in small front room of rather dingy house in dull respectable street room be partially darkened by drawing of curtain over window there be bright fire burning on hearth lamp turned low be placed for friend on small round table so that must see sufficiently to write without difficulty medium herself be pleasant looking woman about thirty year of age with slight cockney accent quiet level voice before sitting began made explanation of power will give for what be worth since be child have often gone off into queer trance must induce at will when awoke from never knew more than that have be having very vivid dream talking to unknown people recollection of what have passed instantly faded from memory subsequently married have one child girl who died at age of ten going into trance day so after death mother be aware when awoke that have be talking to child thereafter cultivated gift getting husband friend to sit with when be in trance listen to take down what said when in trance spoke in daisy voice not in own dead child told about present state of existence daisy described other dead people whom came across must transmit message from such be mr master account of gift asked only one question be whether wanted to get into communication with dead friend told that be so then quite suddenly found harbouring strong distaste for proceeding must certainly have gone away have sitting at if have not recollected promise to francis to go through with seemed to like taking sacred thing into place of ill fame follows be compilation from joint note have inserted nothing did not appear in note in recollection of of medium sat close to in high chair opposite fire so that face be clearly visible eye be closed have hand on lap for about five minute remained thus then breathing began sensibly to quicken gasped panted hand writhed wrestled with other that passed sat quite quiet again presently began to whisper to herself though strained ear to listen must catch word very soon voice grew louder be perfectly different voice from in have spoken to before be high childish treble with little lisp in first coherent word be yes be here daisy here what will tell about ask said barrett to want to know if can tell anything about friend of mine said yes here come said then told that whoever be be in room be looking into face be rather puzzled because did not appear to see put hand on shoulder be talking to smiling again seemed puzzled must not hear proceeded to describe at length with very great accuracy presently in answer to question spelled out whole of name quite correctly told that have not long passed over have be on side few week before that have died not in england not fighting be connected with fighting said be talking about island in sea about bathing about garden where have died did not recollect thing now so far have be told must easily be arrived at accounted for by mind reading thing be perfectly well known to contributed shred of proof with regard to spirit communication for nearly hour medium went on in manner telling nothing did not know already before hour be up have begun to weary of performance a whole be extraordinary good demonstration of thought reading nothing more at indeed have ceased to take note altogether though barrett busy pencil went writing on when quite suddenly took own up again attended a intently a possibly must francis told said that there be test test be in box box be in big black drawer be test say be test repeated several time then stopped must hear whispering again be silly be nonsense said doe mean anything laughed spoke again out loud say wow wow pus ' said say strafe vc say be parrot say be grey feather of parrot something else besides something about burning say say be cinder be cinder parrot feather be what say be test be not long after that coherent speaking ceased whispering began again presently medium said still in child voice that power be getting le then voice stopped altogether soon afterwards saw hand twisting wrestling together stretched out arm with air of tired woman rubbed eye came out of trance friend went home before opened box compared collated note then unlocked drawer took out francis packet broke seal cut string cardboard box contained piece of paper folded round one of matilda grey feather fragment of burned coal now see possible way of accounting for unless accept mr master explanation believe that in mysterious manner francis living self be able to tell while in trance be content of packet have sealed up possible theory of thought transference between anyone living in condition of earthly plane will fit case for simple reason that one living here now have ever have smallest knowledge of what packet contained that information have never until moment mr master communicated to friend be known to more than one person francis have made packet have sealed up in locked drawer have remained till opened after sitting can conceive of possible channel of communication except one namely that francis spoke in mysterious way to medium mind reason power of conjecture be utterly unable to think of other explanation so accepting that for certain reason to be touched on later rather shrink from accepting follows a possible that earlier part of sitting can certainly be accounted for by established phenomenon of thought transference may not have be due to thought transference at to direct communication also with francis yet while medium be speaking telling that be looking into face wondering must not see who have so continually with sense of personal presence have such feeling francis whom knew same one who be now so constantly with did not seem to be there at now reject altogether theory of roman catholic church namely that when try to communicate with dead apparently succeed in so doing be not really brought into connection with into connection with evil spirit who impersonates can not discover invent smallest ground for believing that seems to more subject for gruesome magazine tale than spiritual truth what doe seem possible be that be brought into connection not with soul of departed real essential personality thing loved with piece of mere mechanical intelligence otherwise be hard to see why who have passed over rarely if ever tell except in vaguest most unconvincing manner about condition under now exist speak of being happy of being busy of waiting for tell nothing that medium must not easily have invented real news come nothing can enable to picture in faintest degree what life over there be like possibly condition be incommunicable may find a hard to convey a must be to convey sense effect of colour to blind man material temporal term must naturally have ceased to bear meaning to since have passed out of infinitesimal sphere of space time into timeless immeasurable day sun of for ever stand at height of imperishable noon if must tell of perhaps must not understand upshot then be believe that when medium sitting opposite fire in dim room said what be in sealed packet discarnate mind of francis told what be there believe door between two world not to be locked barred certain people such a call medium have power of turning handle for little setting door ajar what do get when door be set ajar nothing be significant nothing brings closer to on other side if have not already believed in permanence survival of individual life think more than possible that accurate unerring statement of what be in sealed packet might have convinced of brought nearer francis great event have happened for america have joined cause of ally be long delayed there be now possibility of doubting wisdom of such delay if from sprang tremendous enthusiasm show how solid be nation support what event mean to cause of ally can not be over estimated for already be clear that russia be a unstable a quicksand none know what will be swallowed up next in shifting unfathomable depth there be something stirring there below first cry of liberty unity hailed revolution have given place to queer muttering unconjecturable sound april be nearly over spring came so late here in england that long after easter land lay white under unseasonable snow have suddenly burst out into full choir of flower bird song blossom must have decked last month daffodil must have taken wind of march with beauty have delayed golden epiphany till now be a if extra month of sleep have given vigour beauty that spring never saw before april flower be here too flower of may have precociously joined never be there such bustle among bird such hurried transport of nest building material through din of forest murmur sound thud of war how still be on easter morning end
