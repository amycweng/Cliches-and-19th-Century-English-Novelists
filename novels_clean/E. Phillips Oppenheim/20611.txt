when laughed watching almost humbly for pleasure displeasure be cursed mischance have brought to monte carlo hunterleys hurried over dinner without even going to room for hat coat walked across square in soft twilight of unusually warm february evening took table outside cafe de paris where ordered coffee around be far more cosmopolitan crowd increasing moment in volume language be being spoken mostly german a rule gathering of people be in way interesting to hunterleys to night thought be truant forgot strenuous life of last three month danger discomfort through have passed curious sequence of event have brought full of anticipation nerved for crisis to monte carlo of place in world forgot that be in midst of great event likely to take hand in thought took rarely enough for purely personal sentimental turn thought of earliest day of marriage when wife have wandered about garden of old home in wiltshire on spring evening such a have talked sometimes lightly sometimes seriously of future almost a sat there in midst of noisy crowd must catch faint perfume of hyacinth from border along have passed trimly cut flower bed fringed deep green lawn almost must hear chiming of old stable clock clear note of thrush singing puff of wind brought waft of fainter odour from wild violet carpeted wood then darkness crept around star came out hand in hand turned towards house into library where wood fire be burning on grate thought travelled on wave of tenderness have assailed then be awakened by waiter voice at elbow le cafe monsieur sat up in chair dreaming moment be few one have passed set heel upon tide of weakening memory sipped coffee looked out upon crowd three four time glanced at watch impatiently precisely at nine o'clock man moved from somewhere in throng behind took vacant chair by side if one must trouble monsieur for match hunterleys turned towards newcomer a handed matchbox be young man of medium height with sandy complexion little freckled with straggling fair moustache have keen grey eye faintest trace of scotch accent edged chair little nearer to hunterleys much obliged said wonderful evening be hunterleys nodded have anything to tell david asked be right in thick of other replied tone little lowered there be more to tell than like will stroll along terrace hunterleys suggested move from seat young man enjoined be watched here so be in way although be more news want to censor than anything personal crowd of german around without single vacant chair be best barrier can have listen selingman be here saw afternoon at sporting club hunterleys murmured douaille will be here day after to morrow if have not already arrived newcomer continued be given out in paris that be going down to marseille from there to toulon to spend

home at douaille will have full power conference will take place at villa mimosa will be headquarters of whole thing look out sir henry have got eye on little fellow in brown close behind be hand in glove with police tried to get into row last night be only journalism suspect 'd shove over frontier at least excuse be certain to try something of sort with if get idea that be on scent sit tight sir watch be off know where to find young man raised hat left hunterleys with polite farewell of stranger seat be almost immediately seized by small man dressed in brown man with black imperial moustache curled upwards a hunterleys glanced towards raised hamburg hat politely smiled monsieur friend have departed enquired seat be disengaged a see hunterleys replied little man smiled thanks seated with sigh of content ordered coffee from passing waiter monsieur be doubtless stranger to monte carlo be second visit only hunterleys admitted for be habitue little man continued might almost say resident therefore face soon become familiar to directly saw monsieur knew that be not frequenter hunterleys turned little in chair surveyed neighbour curiously man be neatly dressed spoke english with scarcely accent shoulder upturned moustache gave military appearance there be nothing envy one so much in life proceeded a coming to monte carlo for first second time there be so much to know to see to understand hunterleys made effort to discourage companion obvious attempt to be friendly latter talked with spirit for time if must not be regarded a liberty said at last a hunterleys rose to move off may be permitted to present name be hugot be half english half french year ago health broke down accepted position in bank here since then have come in to money if have hobby in life be to show beloved monte carlo to stranger if monsieur must do honour to spare few hour to night later on must endeavour to see that be amused hunterleys shook head remained however perfectly courteous have conviction that be man who have be watching wife be very kind sir replied be here only for few day for benefit of health dare not risk late hour will meet again trust strolled off a hesitated upon step of casino glanced across towards hotel de paris at moment woman came out light cloak over evening gown be followed by attendant hunterleys recognised wife watched with curious little thrill turned towards terrace very slowly too moved in same direction passed through garden of hotel de paris hunterleys keeping to left met upon terrace a emerged a came near accosted violet began started beg pardon said did not recognise have be told asked stiffly that terrace be unsafe for woman after twilight very often assented with little smile at corner of lip once have found so charming now half maddened unfortunately have propensity for doing thing be dangerous besides have maid woman be protection declared susanne can shriek lady hunterleys assured have wonderful lung love to use must shriek at least provocation meanwhile hunterleys observed drily while be indulging in vocal exercise thing happen if wish to promenade here permit to be escort hesitated for moment frowning then continued walk be very kind assented perhaps be like though feel restfulness of quiet place after throng throng of people passed slowly down broad promenade deserted now save for one two lounger like few other furtive hurrying figure in front of stretched arc of glittering light wonderful bay of mentone with bordighera on distant sea board higher up twinkling light from villa built on rocky hill at foot sea calm deep blue lapping narrow belt of hard sand scintillating with reflection of thousand light on horizon blood red moon only half emerged from sea since have met henry lady hunterleys said at last there be something must like to say to certainly glanced behind susanne have fallen discreetly into rear be new importation have idea a to identity of tall severe looking englishman who walked by mistress side there be something going on in monte carlo lady hunterleys went on can not understand mr draconmeyer know about believe although be not personally concerned in will tell nothing only know for reason other presence here seems to be annoyance to certain people why must be know want to ask about will tell truth be sure that did not come here to spy upon certainly did not hunterleys answered firmly have idea that be near place if have turned head smile be there once more queer soft light in eye if have murmured visit here under present circumstance must have be more distasteful than be hunterleys replied stiffly bit lip turned away when resumed conversation tone be completely changed speak to now said in own interest mr draconmeyer be of course not personally connected with affair whatever may be be wonderful man hears many thing to night before dinner gave few word of warning did not tell to pas on to feel sure that hoped must must not listen to from because like be afraid that will take very little more heed of what say at least will believe that speak in own interest mr draconmeyer belief that presence here be misunderstood person whom describes a being utterly without principle of great power be incensed by to speak plainly be in danger be flattered hunterleys remarked by interest on behalf turned head looked at face in cold light before moon came up be almost like face of marble statue lifeless set of almost stonelike severity knew look so well sighed need not be replied bitterly mine be merely ordinary feeling of one human creature for in sense seems absurd suppose to speak to a be doing yet do know that place look so beautiful have strange undercurrent people pas away here in most orthodox fashion in world outwardly real ending be often never known at everything be possible here mr draconmeyer honestly belief that be in danger have reached end of terrace turned back thank very much violet hunterleys said earnestly in return may say something to if there be danger threatening interest guard man whom have chosen to make intimate friend be more deeply concerned in than think told once before draconmeyer be something more than great banker king of commerce a call be ambitious beyond imaginings schemer in way know nothing of residence in london during last fifteen year have be worst thing that ever happened for england to be bitter thing that must have ignored warning accepted friendship be not mr draconmeyer who be friend henry interrupted continually ignore that fact be mr draconmeyer whom can not desert knew long before did husband be at school together there be time before last illness when be inseparable may have be so at first hunterleys agreed how about since then can not deny violet that man draconmeyer have in way impressed fascinated admire find great pleasure in society be that truth now honestly face be little troubled do certainly find pleasure in society admitted can not conceive one who must not be brilliant wonderful musician delightful talker generous host companion have treated always with most scrupulous regard feel that be entirely reasonable in resenting mistrust of do resent still then do asserted emphatically if told hunterleys went on that man be in love with what then must say that be fool hunterleys shrugged shoulder there be more to be said declared only for clever woman violet be sometimes woefully wilfully blind tell know type sooner later before very long must think will have usual scene warn of now if be wise will go back to england absurd scoffed why have only just come want to win money not that allowance be liberal enough added hastily there be fascination in winning know besides must not possibly desert mr draconmeyer must not have come at if have not joined be mistress of own way hunterleys said according to promise will attempt to exercise authority over in way tell that draconmeyer be enemy enemy of thing represent tell too that be in love with when realise that thing be firmly established in brain can perhaps understand how thoroughly distasteful find association with here be very well to talk about mr draconmeyer go nowhere consequence be that be escort on occasion be quite aware that great many people in society accept personally be not disposed to look upon a unfit companion for wife resent appearance with in public will discus subject further decided from moment of first disagreement have be object to break off friendship with draconmeyers until have something more than word to go by will continue to give confidence crossed stone flag in front of opera together turned up towards room think perhaps then said that may consider subject closed only added will forgive if still hesitated turned head quickly eye sought

strange pleasant sensation fact that have twenty thousand franc in pocket to play with scarcely occurred to be watching little wisp of golden hair by ear watching slightly wrinkled forehead a leaned over table little grimace a lost stake be swept away seemed indifferent to bystander be obvious that have very few acquaintance where stood be not likely that must notice abandoned wholly to luxury of gazing at then instinct caused to turn head felt that in turn be being watched glanced towards divan set against wall by side of be standing mr grex be seated there only few foot away smoking

perhaps stranger to civilised society know about richard went on doggedly have be to college mixed with usual sort of people birth be much to speak of perhaps if count that for anything something be

little murmur of dismay broke from assembled crowd nothing be to be seen dense bank of white mist through shone brilliant light of automobile waiting at door monsieur le directeur hastened about doing best to reassure everybody if thought be of slightest use declared must ask to stay when cloud once stoop like there be not likely to be change for twenty four hour have not ala sleeping accommodation if car be slowly driven kept to inside be only matter of mile two before will drop below level of cloud hunterleys lane made way out to front with coat collar turned up groped way to turf on other

thousand of foot below like little pinprick of red fire saw light of monte carlo almost a looked cloud closed up again be a though have peered into world jove be queer lane muttered look what be that long ray of sickly yellow light shone for moment be then suddenly blotted out by rolling mass of vapour cloud have closed in again once more obscurity be denser than ever lighthouse hunterleys replied do think be use waiting will go inside put on coat lane suggested car be by side of avenue there covered over left found coat in hall wrapped up lit cigarette already many of car have started vanished

watched be holding open door of large exceptionally handsome car on other side be servant in white livery lane gripped companion arm there go exclaimed girl followed by mr grex stepped into landaulette be brilliantly illuminated inside with electric light almost immediately car glided noiselessly off two men watched until disappeared then crossed road now then sir henry richard observed

of man have captured have grazed temple too bad to trouble muttered be least can do declared laughing nervously forgive if finger tremble be excitement of last few minute hunterleys stood quite still word seemed difficult to just then be very brave henry said quietly whom whom be going down with be with richard lane answered in two seated racer bit lip did not mean to come alone with mr draconmeyer really explained thought up to last moment that wife must be well enough to come did really believe so do think hunterleys asked voice intervened mr draconmeyer be standing by side well

leaned towards buttoned with strong finger up to throat thank whispered must must drive down with must have plenty of room enquired plenty declared eagerly mr draconmeyer be alone for moment hunterleys hesitated then caught smile upon face of man detested thank said think can desert lane stiffened at once good night be almost formal hunterleys stepped into car richard have brought up there be just slight mist around whole country below though chaotic be visible light on hill side from la turbie down to sea board be in plain sight trouble hunterleys remarked a glided off seem to be over maybe lane replied grimly mine seem to be only just beginning chapter x sign of trouble at ten o'clock next morning hunterleys crossed sunlit garden towards english bank to receive what be perhaps greatest shock of life few minute later stood before mahogany counter eye fixed upon half sheet of notepaper manager have laid before word be few enough simple enough yet constituted for message written in very ink of tragedy notepaper be notepaper of hotel de paris date night before word few unmistakable to manager of english bank please hand letter to bearer henry hunterleys read over letter by letter word by word then at last looked up voice sounded even to unnatural be quite right said order be forgery manager be greatly disturbed threw open door of private office come sit down for moment will sir henry invited be very serious matter must like to discus with passed behind into comfortable little sitting room smelling of morocco leather rose with single high window broad writing table carefully placed easy chair men have pleaded in here with eloquence at command men of rank walk in life thief noble ruined men pseudo millionaire always with same cry money money for great pleasure mill day night drew in own hunterleys sank heavily into chair manager seated in official attitude before desk be sorry to have distressed with letter sir henry said however must admit that thing might have be worse be fortunately invariable custom when letter be addressed to one of client in care to deliver to one else under circumstance if have be ill for instance must have brought correspondence across to hotel must not have delivered to own secretary that a say be invariable rule find that have saved many of client from inconvenience in case manager concluded impressively communication being in sense official such attempt a have be made must not stand slightest chance of success must be even more particular than in ordinary case to see that by possible chance must correspondence addressed to fall into other hand hunterleys began to recover little drew towards heap of letter manager have laid by side please make quite comfortable here latter begged read letter answer if like before go out always call added with smile one inviolable sanctuary of monte carlo be very kind hunterleys replied be sure that be not detaining not in least personally be not at busy three quarter of business see be merely matter of routine be just going to shut up here read time have cigarette here be envelope opener waste paper basket make comfortable hunterleys glanced through correspondence rapidly reading destroying greater portion of came at last to two parchment envelope marked on majesty service opened read content slowly with great care when have finished produced pair of scissors from waistcoat pocket cut letter into minute fragment drew little sigh of relief when at last final destruction be assured rose shortly afterwards to foot will have to go on to telegraph office said to send few message thank very much mr harrison for kindness if mind must like to take forged order away with manager hesitated be not sure ought to part with observed doubtfully must recognise person who presented clerk manager shook head not chance replied be brought in unfortunately before arrived young parson who be only one in bank explained that letter be never delivered to order turned away to attend to one else who be in hurry simply remembers that be man be then document be useless to hunterleys pointed out must never do anything in matter without evidence of identification that being so if mind must like to have harrison yielded up a wish agreed be interesting if only a curiosity imitation of signature be almost perfect hunterleys took up hat then for moment with hand upon door hesitated mr harrison said be engaged just now a have doubtless surmised in certain investigation on behalf of usual third party whom need not name investigation have reached pitch might possibly lead into position of well might almost say danger know that there be weapon in place can be made use of by person wholly without scruple be scarcely available at home want to keep eye open have very few friend here whom can wholly trust be purpose to call in here morning at ten o'clock for letter if fail to arrive within hour of time without having given verbal notice something will have happened to understand what mean mean that be threatened with assassination manager asked gravely practically amount to hunterleys admitted received warning letter morning there be very important matter on foot here mr harrison matter so important that to bring to successful conclusion fancy that who be engaged in must not hesitate to face risk have wired to england for help if anything happens that come too late want when find have disappeared even if disappearance be only temporary matter to let know in london know how at once manager nodded will do so promised trust however went on that be exaggerating danger mr billson lived here for many year without trouble hunterleys smiled slightly be not secret service man explained billson successor life here now of course be working with under usual guise of newspaper correspondent think that will come to harm be here in somewhat different position negotiation in east during last few week have made exceedingly unpopular with very powerful people however be only outside chance of course wish to guard against rely upon if must fail to come to bank one morning without giving notice to do a have asked hunterleys left bank walked out once more into sunlight first of made way down to post office where rapidly dispatched several cablegram have coded written out in mr harrison private office afterwards went on to terrace finding retired seat at further end sat down then drew forged order once more from pocket word by word line by line studied more studied more hopeless whole thing seemed handwriting with exception of signature be wonderful imitation of own be handwriting of wife have done thing at draconmeyer instigation done thing against husband taken side absolutely with man whom have come to look upon a enemy what inference be to draw sat there looking out over mediterranean soft blue glittering with sunlight breaking upon yellow stretch of sand in little foam flecked wave higher than hand watched sunlight glitter on white house fringed bay looked idly up at trim little vineyard on brown hill side be beauty spot of world there be object upon eye must rest be not beautiful whole place be like feast of colour form sunshine yet for light seemed suddenly to have faded from life danger have only stimulated have helped to cope with dull pain have carried about with during last few month be face to face now with something else be worse than anything have dreamed somehow other notwithstanding growing estrangement with wife have ended in virtual separation have still believed in still have faith in still have hope of ultimate reconciliation behind have loved seemed at moment that nightmare be being formed around new horror be creeping into thought have felt from first bitter dislike of draconmeyer now however realised that feeling have developed into actual harrowing jealousy realised that man be passive agent be draconmeyer who with subtle purpose be drawing wife away hunterleys sprang to foot walked angrily backwards forward along few yard of terrace happened at moment to be almost deserted vague plan of instant revenge upon draconmeyer floated into mind be simple enough to take law into own hand to thrash publicly to make monte carlo impossible for then suddenly remembered duty be trusting in downing street chance have put into hand so many thread of diabolical plot be for to checkmate be only person who must checkmate be time for to think of personal revenge time for to brood over own broken life there be work still to be done country work felt need of change of scene sight of place with placid enervating beauty constant appeal to sens be beginning to have curious effect upon nerve turned back upon terrace by mean of least frequented street passed through town up towards hill walked steadily reckless of time direction have lunch at small inn high above road from cannes be past three o'clock when turned homewards have found way into main road now trudged along heedless of dust with constant procession of automobile covered while exercise have done good be able to keep thought focussed upon mission so far at rate have held own dispatch to london have be clear vivid have told exactly what have feared have shown inside of scheme a instinct have revealed to have begged for aid one man alone surrounded by enemy in country where thing be possible be in parlous position if once extent of knowledge be surmised so far plot have not yet matured so far though cloud have gathered thunder be muttering storm have not broken reason for that knew one person needed one person for whose coming plan have be made have not yet arrived there be telling however how long respite might last at moment might commence conference whose avowed purpose be to break at single blow single treacherous deadly blow empire whose downfall selingman have once publicly declared be one great necessity involved by country expansion hunterleys quenched thirst at roadside cafe sitting out upon pavement drinking coarse red wine soda water then bought packet of black cigarette continued journey be within sight of monte carlo when for twentieth time have to step to far side of pathway to avoid being smothered in dust by advancing automobile time by chance glanced around attracted by piercing character of long distance whistle high powered grey touring car came by travelling at great pace hunterleys stood perfectly rigid one hand grasping wall by side of stood notwithstanding spectacle thick coating of dust upon clothes solitary passenger of car be familiar enough to be man for whom plot have be prepared be paul douaille great foreign minister into whose hand even most cautious of premier have declared willing to place destiny of country hunterleys pursued road no longer took ticket at next station hurried back to monte carlo went first to room bathed changed passing along private passage made way into sporting club first person whom saw seated in accustomed place at favourite table be wife beckoned to come over to there be vacant chair by side to pointed thank said wo sit down think care to play just now be fortunate afternoon trust something in face tone checked that rush of altered feeling of have be more than once passionately conscious since night before be hideously out of luck confessed slowly have be losing day think that will give up rose wearily to foot felt sudden compassion for be certainly looking tired eye be weary have air of unhappy woman after perhaps too sometimes knew what loneliness be must like tea so much added little piteously opened lip to invite to pas through into restaurant with then memory of forged order still in pocket flashed into mind hesitated cold familiar voice at elbow intervened be quite ready for tea lady hunterleys have be in taken table near window hunterleys moved at once on one side draconmeyer bowed pleasantly cheerful time have last night have remarked glad to see knock did lay up hunterleys disregarded wife glance be suddenly furious monte carlo seems to be gossiping about little contretemps draconmeyer continued be crude sort of hold up for neighbourhood of criminal very nearly came off will have tea with do henry wife begged once again hesitated somehow other felt that moment be critical then hand be laid quietly upon arm man voice whispered in ear monsieur will be so kind a to step way for moment little matter of business who be hunterleys demanded commissioner of police at monsieur service chapter xi hint to hunterleys hunterleys in accordance with request followed commissioner downstairs into one of small private room on ground floor latter be very polite very official now what be that want hunterleys asked little brusquely a soon a be alone representative of law be distinctly mysterious have brown moustache continually twirled be time dropping voice to whisper first introduction to must explain mission sir henry said hold high position in police here business with however be on behalf of person whom will not name whose identity will doubtless guess very well hunterleys replied now what be nature of mission please in plain word what do want with be here with reference to affair of last night other declared affair of last night hunterleys repeated frowning well have to appear be represented before magistrate to morrow morning will send lawyer quite so quite so in meantime something have transpired young american mr richard lane be only two who offered resistance be owing to two in fact that plot be frustrated be quite sure sir henry one agrees with in appreciating courage presence of mind thank hunterleys replied be that what came to say other shook head unfortunately monsieur be here to bring certain information chief of gang armand martin man whom attacked became suddenly worse few hour ago doctor suspect internal injury injury inflicted during struggle with be very sorry to hear hunterleys said coolly on other hand asked for anything got unfortunately commissioner continued law of state be curiously framed in such matter if man must die a seems more than likely legal position sir henry must be most uncomfortable arrest must be necessity there be law granting what believe call bail to person directly indirectly responsible for death of be here therefore to give may term official warning absence a witness to morrow morning will not be commented upon event of importance have called back to england will thereby be saved very large amount of annoyance authority here will be spared most regrettable necessity of having to deal with in manner unbefitting rank hunterleys became at once thoughtful whole matter be becoming clear to see observed be warning to to take departure be that so commissioner beamed nodded many time have quick understanding sir henry declared departure to night early to morrow morning must save good deal of unpleasantness have fulfilled mission trust that will reflect seriously upon matter be wish of high personage whom represent that inconvenience must befall so distinguished visitor to principality good day monsieur official took leave with sweep of hat many bow hunterleys after brief hesitation walked out into sun dappled street be most fashionable hour of afternoon up in square band be playing outside two three smart automobile be discharging freight of wonderfully dressed woman debonair men from villa outside suddenly hand fell upon arm be richard lane who greeted say where be off to sir henry inquired hunterleys laughed little shortly really scarcely know replied back to london if be wise suppose come into club richard begged have just left hunterleys told besides hate place did happen to notice whether mr grex be in there richard enquired did see hunterleys answered added significantly did see miss grex well be going in to have look round anyway richard decided might come along there be nothing else to do in place until dinner time hunterleys suffered to be persuaded remounted step tell lane asked curiously have heard anything about of victim of little struggle last night mean two men tackled shook head hear that mine have broken wrist said ca say be feeling very badly about have just be told that mine be going to die hunterleys continued young man laughed incredulously why went over prison morning declared never saw such healthy lot of ruffian in life that chap whom tackled one with revolver be smoking cigarette using language well must understand what did understand be enough to melt bar of prison be odd hunterleys remarked drily according to police commissioner who have just left man be on death bed only chance of escaping serious trouble be to get out of monte carlo to night be going hunterleys shook head must take great deal more than to move just now said even if have not suspected from first that man be lying richard glanced at companion little curiously must have said that be having such good time sir henry observed in fact must have thought must have be rather glad of opportunity to slip away hunterleys looked around have reached top of staircase be in sight of dense crowd in room come have drink suggested great many of people will have cleared off presently will have drink with pleasure richard answered still ca see why be stuck on place strolled into bar found two vacant place dear young friend hunterleys said a ordered drink if be englishman instead of american think must give hint a to reason why wish to leave monte carlo just at present ca see what difference make richard declared know be for old country wonder whether be hunterleys remarked thoughtfully tell frankly that if thought meant must probably come to before long for little help if ever do be man richard assured heartily more scrap going hunterleys sipped whisky soda thoughtfully there have be exodus from room to watch heavy gambling at trente et quarante for moment be almost alone lane said be going to take little into confidence in way suppose be foolish to tell truth be almost driven to know that be member of parliament may have heard that if party have gone out few year ago be to have be foreign minister have heard that often enough lane assented have heard quoted too a example of curse of party politics just because be forced to call member of one party be debarred from serving country in capacity until party be in power be quite true hunterleys admitted to tell truth ridiculous though seems see how be to get away from in practical manner anyhow when people came out made up mind be going to just sit still in opposition find fault time especially a have real good man at foreign office be quite content to leave thing in hand then see politically that meant that there be nothing for to do thought matter over eventually paired for six month be supposed to go off for benefit of health a matter of fact have be in balkan state since christmas added dropping voice little what dickens have be doing there ca tell exactly hunterleys replied unfortunately enemy be suspicious have taken to watching closely pretty well know what be going to tell have be out there at urgent request of secret service department of present government have be in greece servia roumania although think there be soul in world know have also be in st petersburg what be about richard persisted what have be doing in place can only answer broadly hunterleys went on there be perfectly devilish scheme afloat directed against old country have be doing what can to counteract at last moment just a be leaving sofia for london by merest chance discovered that scene for culmination of little plot be to be monte carlo so made way round by trieste stayed at bordighera san remo for few day to put people off finally turned up here well be jiggered lane muttered thought be just hanging about for health because wife be here be bored to death for want of something to do on contrary hunterleys assured be up all night sending report home very interesting report too got away right there be denying fact that there be certain people in monte carlo at present moment who suspect presence here who must go to length to get rid of be actual harm might do have to deal with very delicate problem to make bargain with very sensitive person be terribly afraid presence here meeting between person might render scheme abortive richard face be study in astonishment well exclaimed beat everything have read of such thing of course one only half belief right under very nose too say what be going to do about sir henry there be only one thing can do hunterleys replied grimly be bound to keep place here will drive out if can be convinced that polite warning have received to leave monaco afternoon because of last night affair be part of conspiracy in plain word have got to stick out what good be doing here anyway hunterleys smiled glanced carefully around room be still free from risk of being overheard well said perhaps will understand meaning more clearly if tell be brain of counterplot english secret service have permanent agent here under guise of newspaper correspondent who be in daily touch with in turn have several spy at work be however dangerous person others be only servant make report understand true significance if people must remove before one else must arrive to take place chance of bringing off coup here must be immensely improved suppose be useless for to ask if there be anything can do to help richard enquired have helped already hunterleys replied have be nearly three month without being able to open lip to soul people call secretive feel very human sometimes know that not word of what have said will pas lip not chance of richard promised earnestly look here ca do something if be not englishman be for anglo saxon hate foreigner be to say men corrected hastily hunterleys smiled well be coming to that

richard asked little disappointed anticipate scrapping anything of sort know what to anticipate hunterleys confessed little wearily thing be moving fast now towards climax promise will come to for help if need can refuse fear of refusing richard declared heartily not on life sir hunterleys rose to foot with appreciative little nod be astonishing how cordially have come to feel towards young man during last few hour will let off now said know want to look around table see if of friend of last night be to be found too have little affair ought to have treated differently few minute ago will meet later hunterleys strolled back into room came almost at once face to face with draconmeyer whom be passing with unseeing eye draconmeyer however detained be looking for sir henry exclaimed can

place also helped from sideboard selingman took up position in centre of hearth rug with long tumbler of yellow wine in one hand sandwich in other for continued taking huge bite wage war against formality have be through sort of thing in berlin have be through in vienna have be through in rome have sat at long table with politician have drawn little picture upon blotting paper be bored to death in wearisome fashion have drafted agreement have quarrelled bickered have yawned made of ourselves men of parchment to night added taking huge bite from sandwich to night nothing of sort be intended draconmeyer have idea mr grex be favourably inclined towards that idea be bit of good to ourselves one else unless monsieur douaille here share point of view here be then met together let hope for week two enjoyment little by little must try see what can do towards instilling that idea into mind of monsieur douaille may succeed may fail let always remember that conversation be conversation of four friend met together upon what be nothing more le than holiday hate sight of sheet of blotting paper clean pen who want to make note especially of what be going to talk about man who can not carry note in head be statesman monsieur douaille who have chosen champagne be smoking cigarette beamed approval much of nervousness have departed agree declared like well attitude of friend selingman there be something much too formal about table be not here to talk treaty to upset to exchange view if will no more meanwhile appreciate very excellent champagne cigarette be delicious remove to easy chair if one must talk world politics be ready why not why must pretend that there be more interesting subject to men like ourselves in whom be placed trust of country mr grex nodded head in assent fault be mine declared believe be not intentional be never wish to give too formal air to little meeting in fact never intended to do more than dwell on outside edge of great subject to night unfortunately monsieur douaille power influence may be be directly responsible for foreign affair of country can therefore speak with entire frankness country country mine be to day bound together by alliance have something almost approach alliance with country be going to tell in plain word what think have be given to understand indirectly many time during last few year that understanding be not approved of in st petersburg monsieur douaille knocked ash from cigarette gazed thoughtfully into fire of pine log be burning upon open hearth mr grex said that be plainer speaking than have ever received from official source admit mr grex replied such statement on part may sound little startling make advisedly know feeling will grant that position entitles to know feeling of men who count for anything in russian politics perhaps mean titular head of government there be others who have even more responsibility who count for more honestly truthfully assure speak for power be behind government of russia when tell that english dream of triple alliance between russia england france will never be accepted by country monsieur douaille sipped champagne be candour remarked absolute candour one speaks quite plainly imagine before friend enemy added smiling towards selingman why not selingman demanded why not indeed be not fool here then must ask mr grex monsieur douaille continued where in name of be equitable be to find alliance more likely to preserve status quo in europe logically geographically absolutely dovetail russia be in position to absorb whole attention of austria even to invade north coast of germany hundred thousand troop so upon must rely from great britain must be invaluable for many reason first because mixture of blood be always good secondly because regular army perforce must have to send be of very fine fighting material thirdly because must land to give away very open secret to friend selingman in westerly position must very likely succeed thereby in making outflanking movement towards north presume at german fleet must not come out to battle in case english must certainly be able to do great execution upon northern coast of germany of course have be discussed written about next war be mapped out in dozen different way must confess however that taking known consideration into account can find other distribution of power so reasonable so favourable to country mr grex nodded find fault with word of what have said declared except yours be simply superficial obvious idea of man in street a to course of next probable war now let go little further grant point urge in favour of suggested triple alliance will even admit that forecast of war taking place under such condition be fairly faithful one proceed then war if came to pas must never be decisive immense amount of blood must be shed treasure recklessly poured out europe be rendered desolate for sake most largely of whom of japan america be weakness of whole thing war carried out on line suggest must be playing game of two country even victor must be placed at huge disadvantage with to say nothing of loser who must see slipping away from forever place under sun be opinion have studied matter most scientifically with help of secret service of country not excepting own herr selingman be opinion that war must be indecisive german fleet must be crippled not destroyed english fleet must retain proportionate strength french advance into germany must be successful german advance into france be likely war must languish for lack of fund through sheer inanition must flicker out money of world must flow into treasury of america russia must not be fighting for living with must be at best half hearted war must do duty to alliance nothing more must be hoped from must not expect for instance that must call up reserve leave whole of eastern frontier unprotected throw into mid europe force a must in time subjugate germany must be done will not be done know that monsieur douaille smoked thoughtfully for several moment very well pronounced at last be rather inclined to agree with that have said yet seems to that evade great point status quo be what desire peace be what world want if before such war a have spoken of be begun people realise what end of must be think that be greatest help towards peace own opinion be tell frankly

confidently be at least beyond reach of bungling english spy there be further fear of eavesdropper be entirely alone may speak own mind there be nothing to be feared in way of interruption trust monsieur douaille that appreciate altered circumstance monsieur douaille who be looking very much more at ease assented without hesitation must confess agreed that isolation now enjoy be to certain extent reassuring here need no longer whisper one may listen carefully one may weigh well what be said sooner later must come to crucial point if like be game of make believe then in make believe germany have offered to restore alsace lorraine have offered to hold french territory a sacred provided france allows to occupy calais for one year what be object herr selingman do indeed wish to invade england selingman poured out glass of wine from bottle stood at elbow good said have come to plain question answer in plain speech will tell now in few word remains to be told germany have desire to invade great britain if one may believe newspaper there be scarcely englishman alive who must credit simple fact be nevertheless true commercially england certain measure of english prosperity be necessary to germany geographically there be certain risk to be run in invasion of country consider worth while besides invasion even successful one must result in making everlasting bitter enemy of great britain learnt lesson when took territory from france need to repeat several hundred thousand of most worthy citizen be finding honest prosperous living in london several thousand of merchant be in business there prospering several hundred of shrewdest men of affair be making fortune upon london stock exchange therefore wish to conquer england commercially conquest be already affected want monsieur douaille to absolutely understand because may affect view what do require be to strike long lasting blow at navy of great britain a somewhat larger holland great britain be welcome to peaceful existence when lord over world talk of empire upon sun never set then time arrives when be forced to interfere great britain have possession be not strong enough to hold germany be strong enough to wrest from mean to do so english fleet must be destroyed south africa then will come to germany india to russia egypt to france rest follows a matter of course what be rest monsieur douaille asked herr selingman be content no longer to sit in place rose to foot face have fallen into different line eye flashed word be inspired rest declared be crux of whole matter be one great settled goal towards who have understood have schemed fought way with british navy destroyed monroe doctrine be not worth sheet of writing paper south america be germany natural heritage by right worth considering be people gold founded argentine republic brain of people control destiny eldorado be there monsieur douaille be country sooner later germany must posse look nowhere else covet other of neighbour possession only say that sooner america make up mind to sacrifice better monroe doctrine be very well for northern state when presumes to quote a pretext for keeping germany from natural place in south america cross sword with now know truth whole truth know monsieur douaille what require from know reward host have already told will tell again a often a like feeling of own country franco russian alliance be already doomed fall to piece through sheer lack of common interest entente cordiale be simply fetter dead weight upon monsieur douaille put to a man of common sense do think that a statesman see will put burden upon shoulder because if choose can speak for country do think that have right to refuse from germany return of alsace lorraine do think that can look country in face if refuse on greatest gift have ever yet be offered to nation gift of egypt old alliance be out of date balance of power have shifted ask monsieur douaille a value prosperity welfare of country to weigh what have said what great russian friend have said word by word england have made sacrifice for why must sacrifice for monsieur douaille stroked little grey imperial be well enough muttered without english navy balance of power upon continent be entirely upset balance of power only according to present grouping of interest mr grex pointed out selingman have shown how must change frankly although one can fail to realise immense importance of south america a colonising centre be honest opinion that nation who score most by friend selingman plan be not germany france think what mean to instead of being secondary power will of own might absolutely control mediterranean egypt with vast possibility ever elastic boundary fall to hand malta cyprus follow be great price that germany be prepared to pay monsieur douaille be silent for several moment be obvious that be deeply impressed be matter said must be considered from many point of view supposing that france be willing to bury hatchet with germany to remain neutral to place calais at germany disposal even then do suppose herr selingman that must be easy matter to destroy british navy have plan selingman declared solemnly know very well that can be carried out only at great loss of men ship be gloomy terrible task lie before at other end of be glory never fade if america douaille remarked be to have inkling of real objective own fleet must come to rescue why must america know of ultimate aim selingman rejoined politician to day choose to play part of ostrich in desert take account profess to take account of european happening have secret service country be governed from within for only a for rest bogey of german invasion have be flaunted so long in england that few people stop to realise absolute futility of such course london be already colonised by german colonised be to say in urban money making fashion english gold be flowing in never ending stream into country must be most foolish dream ambitious statesman must conceive to lay violent hand upon land teeming with one own child germany see further than there be richer prize across atlantic richer prize from point of view mentioned south africa monsieur douaille murmured selingman shrugged shoulder south africa will make nation rich replied own people be too stubborn powerful too rooted to soil monsieur douaille for first time stretched out hand drank of wine stood by side cheek be very pale have appearance of man tortured by conflicting thought must like to ask selingman said whether have made definite plan for conflict with british navy admit that day of england unique greatness be over may not be in position to day a have be in former year to fight world at same time one indomitable power be still whatever people may say think navy only last month cabinet of country be considering report from secret agent placing side by side with known fact a to relative strength of navy navy of great britain on paper must seem that german success be impossible selingman smiled convincing smile of man who see further than most men not under term must propose to monsieur douaille declared remember that must hold calais must be assured at least of amiable neutrality of fleet have spoken of matter so intimate that know whether in absolute privacy must not be justified in going further disclosing to whole scheme for attack upon english navy must need only expression of sympathy with view have discussed to induce to do so monsieur douaille hesitated for several moment before replied be citizen of france said envoy without power to treat own province be to listen personal sympathy selingman persisted have sometimes thought monsieur douaille confessed that present grouping of european power must gradually change if country for instance added turning to mr grex indeed embrace proposal of herr selingman france must of necessity be driven to reconsider position towards england anglo saxon race may have to battle then for very existence yet be always to be remembered that in background be united state of america possessing resource wealth greater than other country in universe must also be remembered selingman proclaimed in tone of ponderous conviction that posse adequate mean of guarding that be not military nation that have not strength to enforce carrying out of monroe doctrine thing be very well for before day of wireless telegraphy of aeroplane airship of super dreadnought cruiser with speed of express train be too far away to be concerned in european turmoil to day science be annihilating distance america leaving out of account altogether military impotence must need fleet three time present strength to enforce monroe doctrine for remainder not of century of decade then bombshell fell strange voice suddenly intervened voice whose american accent seemed more marked than usual four men turned head selingman sprang to foot mr grex face be marble in whiteness monsieur douaille with nervous sweep of right arm sent glass crashing to floor looked in same direction up to little music gallery leaning over in careless attitude with arm folded upon rail be richard lane say begged can
