travelling coat returning fixed glazed stare of dying man with sort of indifferent good humour perhaps very close observer might have detected shade of mockery in soft black eye faintly twitching lip

going to have new sensation be going to see most beautiful woman in world there be little hush one have turned towards upper end of room heavy curtain have be rolled aside disclosing space only few yard square have be covered by tightly stretched drugget there be little curious anticipation amongst uninitiated then comparative silence be broken by strain of waltz from violin somewhere in background one have ever heard before there be wilder dreamier air with than anything waldteufel have ever written while one be wondering whose music must be woman glided out from behind screen stood for second swaying slightly in centre of drugget even slight rhythmical motion of body seemed to bring into perfect sympathy with curious melody be filling hushed room while people watched already in varying degree under spell of curious fascination personality exercise of art seldom failed to excite commenced to dance long afterwards paul de vaux tried to describe in word dance found that must not for there be indeed charm beyond expression portrayal in slow almost languid movement full of infinite inexpressible witchery limb of body feature of face followed with sort of effortless grace movement of foot yet general effect of whole be suggestive of sweet dainty repose voluptuous yet refined glowing with life yet dreamily restful in certain sense physical movement even body seemed merged lost in artistic ideal created born of performance so be that carried away that day vivid thought portrait of feature only confused dream of beautiful dusky face rising above cloud of amber drapery lip slightly parted in wonderful smile pair of heavily lidded eye more than once have rested upon soft dark lustrous after be tangled web of memory yet such a be became woven into pattern of life wonderfully soft brilliant beside of dark gloomy thread fate have spun for performance ended a such performance must end suddenly without repetition disappearance be so swift yet so graceful that for moment two people scarcely realized that be gone be wonderful what difference absence made to room little stretch of drugget looked mean bare to paul de vaux seemed a though warm beautiful light omniscient richly coloured have suddenly burnt out left damp chilliness in air silence be gloomy enough after wonderful music babble of tongue presently arose be hundred time worse found chafing angry at commonplacisms everywhere greeted ear lady swindon afternoon entertainment have be great success one be telling so more le volubly there be there handful of artist few thoughtful men who be silent who spoke of only amongst in subdued voice recognised in what have happened that afternoon dawn of new art rather regeneration of old one discussed in whisper possible significance influence be artist

started have be standing like man in dream with folded arm looking across room with idle eye unconsciously ignoring many salutation brother tone sounded oddly in ear looked flushed little nervous what did think of be difficult question to answer repeated be glad when arthur spared necessity of replying by adding own opinion be glorious magnificent be going to find out more about strolled away joined one of little group of men who be discussing performance paul at first have made gesture a though to detain on second thought have changed mind better let go find out what must watched carefully for opportunity then left room felt like man who have received silent shock something fresh have come into life noiselessly insidiously without effort pressed on hat passed down step out into street scarcely conscious of what be doing rush of fresh air somewhat revived stood still for moment to collect thought felt need of absolute solitude for while to help to realize at rate to understand thing have happened with almost feverish haste called hansom from other side of road man whipped up horse hesitated a reached pavement looking around paul saw cause of indecision woman standing only few yard behind have called at same time be waiting also for approach there be gas lamp between a eye met recognised even in flickering light through veil there be mistaking wonderful eye a rule be possessed of a much savoir faire a most men of class at moment have deserted stood there on edge of pavement without moving saying anything simply looking at startled at sudden appearance magnetised by close presence have heard no footfall behind fact of being alone seemed so strange to that simply must not realize for moment that be indeed who stood so close to cabman leaving to decide who have prior claim upon sat motionless with eye discreetly fixed upon horse ear be odd little tableau insignificant enough to spectator save perhaps for curious look in woman face softly flashing eye yet left mark for ever in life of two principal figure curious sensation have kept paul standing there dazed tongue tied passed away yet did not immediately occur to to raise hat walk on a in ordinary case must have done be conscious of exact nature of situation felt strong disinclination to leave spot strangely enough did seem to expect yet something have to be done moved

native cooly who still spoke admiringly of wonderful nerve pluck of english sahib during terrible unexpected tiger rush at moment nerve seemed to have deserted must almost hear heart beat a took that step forward have intended to have made trifling apology to have handed into cab word must not come instinct seemed to revolt at thought of uttering such commonplacism be standing on edge of pavement close to step with skirt in one hand slightly raised held out hand to in silence gave hers yet did not at once step into cab seemed to be expecting little speech from found impossible to frame seeing that did not come recognising perhaps suppressed agitation behind calm almost cold gravity of demeanour spoke to be shame to take cab leave in rain be sorry afterwards admirer spoke of voice a being one of chief charm to paul sounded like soft strain of very sweet throbbing music reaching from far distant world yet curiously enough went far to dissolve spell presence seemed to have laid upon be able to look at steadily standing upon wet pavement in cold grey light of november afternoon eye met in long searching gaze be able even to notice trifle saw rich fur lined plain black cloak must even admire absolute perfection with followed line of slim supple figure saw glowing eye shining out from dusky face coil of brown hair not very securely fastened under turban hat a put out foot to enter

like amongst heavy faded hanging feeble candlelight left weird shadow moving across floor upon wall again heard rattling of window pane bare exposed to gust of wind far off thunder of sea like deep continuous undernote from almost unseen corner of chamber monotonous broken rhythm of sad prayer for dying mumbled by dark curious looking priest then when background of picture have formed in memory saw deed saw white stricken face suddenly ablaze with last effort of passionate life saw outstretched arm line of fire sudden change in countenance of man who stood at foot of bed saw cool cynicism replaced by spasm of ghastly fear heard low gurgling cry dying away into faint moan of terror a murdered man sank on to floor crumpled heap last of saw that little brown girl with tumbled hair tear

dying man paul said with little hoarseness in tone be to a secret of confessional priest shook head gently refused to confess told distinctly that be a man to man spoke to paul looked away into night with white stricken face cursed father weakness supposing that priest have discovered that conscience must not allow to keep secret what more likely why else be here why else did disclaim confessional there be only one other alternative perhaps desired to trade upon secret yet how be that possible of what use must money be to what must gain by besides be not face of adventurer understand paul said

one in hall of house where adrea lived to take to so after waiting few minute for maid whom porter have twice fruitlessly summoned ascended stair alone knocked at door of room at first there be reply tried again little louder time there be sound of one stirring within come in celeste be drowsy answer turned handle walked in carefully closing door behind at first room appeared to be in semi darkness for clear spring day sunshine be brightening street have just left here heavy curtain be closely drawn a though to keep out vestige of daylight gradually eye grew accustomed to shaded twilight must make out familiar object of room for although be only second visit be familiar already in thought strangely enough seemed to after first hasty glance around that room be empty just then sudden gleam from bright fire fell upon adrea hair saw stood for moment silent motionless be curled up on huge divan drawn close to fireplace with limb doubled under like panther arm from loose sleeve have fallen back clasped half bare underneath head peculiar grace of movement carriage have made dancing so famous be even more striking in repose for there be faint insidious suggestion of voluptuous movement in motionless crouching limb abandon of shapely dusky head with crown of dark wavy hair thrown back amongst cushion be beauty of strange sort beauty almost of wild animal paul felt most unwilling admiration steal through sens a gazed down upon tea gown wonderful shade of shimmering green tumbled disarranged out of similitude to original shape followed soft perfection of outline with such peculiar faithfulness that seemed to suggest even more than concealed leaving gentle tracery of figure outlined there like piece of living greek statuary turned slightly upon couch slipperless little foot stole out from sea of lace white drapery uneasy movement have left exposed swayed slowly backwards forward trying to reach ground eye be still closed be not sleeping for in moment two spoke in low drowsy tone celeste told not to disturb for hour be five o'clock yet be roused moved step further into room be still quarter to five think said have come before time opened eye then seeing sprang into sitting posture hair have escaped bound be down to shoulder gown still further disarranged by hasty movement floated around in wonderful curve angle have be past mistress in art of picturesque effect must have conceived nothing more striking paul felt old fear upon a watched firelight gleaming upon startled dusky face faint pink colouring wonderfully suggestive of blush steal into cheek seemed to that be a beautiful a woman must be yet so different from lady may rose with shrug of shoulder quick graceful movement shook out skirt pushed hair back from face then held out hand paul found compelled against will to stand by side how strange must have overslept like have taken for celeste said yet perhaps be natural for monsieur paul save celeste one yet have permission to enter chamber unannounced how come that find here to laugh at deshabille be silent for moment while looked at questioningly soft delicate voice with very slight piquant foreign intonation have often sounded in reluctant yet charmed ear since last meeting now that heard again felt how weak be imaginings what sweet music indeed be be sorry answered constraint be placing upon voice made sound hard cold porter rang for maid twice whilst waited in hall a did not come thought have better try find way mistook knock for celeste let discover comme cela well be not to blame see will just arrange hair here need not look at unless like stood up in front of mirror over lighted shaded candle for moment two white hand flashed deftly in out amongst dark silky coil of disordered hair paul sat down taking up magazine found lying on divan tried to concentrate thought upon content must not moment found eye thought straying to slim lithe figure watching play of arm grace of backward pose when looked suddenly round on completion of task eye met monsieur paul be like sex curious said lightly tell then do admire coiffure very much answered glancing at loose grecian knot into have gathered disordered hair confined with band of dull gold be quite oriental seems to suit not that be judge of such matter added quickly moved away with little low laugh lit two three more of shaded candle fairy lamp be placed here there on bracket round room then rang bell gave order to maid so think hair look oriental said sinking down upon huge cushion in front of fire be what paper call sometimes oriental early association asserting see think remember more of constantinople than place went on dreamily with eye fixed on fire be only child in day seemed to then that nothing must be more beautiful than city of mosque golden horn on clear summer evening why do think of day added shaking head impatiently such folly yet always think of when be lonely be suddenly deeply moved with altogether new feeling towards one of responsibility be alone in world be father hand have rendered so how empty barren have be conception of burden that deed have laid upon like flash seemed to see whole situation in new light if indeed have drifted into ruin sin lay at door must have found mother must have be care to have watched continually to have assured that be contented happy in few moment whole situation seemed to change even felt hot flush of shame at own coldness towards forgot dancer woman of strange fascination idol of jeunesse doree of west london clubdom remembered only fact that be lonely orphan with most womanly light in soft dark eye that have failed in duty towards paul be essentially manly man self contained with feeling very much at control at moment felt something like rush of tenderness towards strange dark eyed girl who lay coiled up at foot involuntarily stretched out hand laid with almost caressing gesture upon hair started around a though electrified looking up saw change in face be first kindly look speech have have from since have met in london have come so suddenly that seemed to have strange effect upon deep flush stole into face eye gleamed brilliantly drew long breath underneath loose gown must see bosom rising falling quickly yet seemed so softened womanly that thought have once have of seemed like distant nightmare to ethical physical horror of being of ever becoming what feared rose up strong within deepened at once sense of responsibility towards new born tenderness took hand gently be startled to find how cold be so do feel lonely adrea sometimes said softly although have so many acquaintance colour burned deeper for moment in cheek looked at reproachfully half indignantly acquaintance mean people who come to see hate sometimes amuse little be be nothing have woman friend none how must care like english woman adrea be not good for isolation from sex at sound of christian name coming from lip so gently almost affectionately looked up quickly seemed to almost a though softening change have crept over be firelight wondered be fancy good for said softly have just thought of monsieur paul again felt that pang of conscience yet be not little unjust to took life into own hand reminded chose for yes yes answered drawing little nearer to till head almost rested upon knee blame must have be so easy before to have found home for went on now have made so difficult there be need interrupted proudly must keep now want anything from monsieur paul save one thing raised face to seemed to to be aglow with wonderful new light there be mistaking soft entreaty of strange dark eye so close to tremor in tone then before must answer before must summon up resolution enough to draw away have stolen softly into arm with little murmur of content have rested small dusky head with coronet of dark braided hair upon shoulder twined hand around neck paul monsieur paul be lonely miserable love just little only little pleaded be supreme moment for of to coveting love with passionate force of fiery oriental nature time seemed to stand still while rested passively in arm altogether accepted altogether repulsed to a sat there pale shaken fighting fiercely against great temptation threatened self respect liberty of body soul life seemed to have turned into grim farce full of grotesque light shadow mocking gibing at have seemed to sweet pure strong warm breath fell upon cheek eye maddened curiously faint perfume from clothes floated upon air oppressed with peculiar richness be strong man at moment faltered seemed a though unseen hand be weaving spell upon a though whole environment be being drawn in around be powerless yet even in moment of intoxication reason did not altogether desert knew that if opened arm to receive that clinging figure drew delicate tear stained face full of mute invitation down to to be covered with passionate kiss knew that at moment must sign death warrant to have seemed fair sweet comely in life forever must live without respect dishonoured man in own eye perhaps day in hers for have more faith in love than in held hand tightly in have unwound gently from neck stood up face to face with upon hearthrug soft fire light threw up strange ruddy gleam glowed around shown in dark eye fixed so earnestly so passionately upon adrea said low hoarse tone sounded harsh unfamiliar to ear know interrupted threw arm again around neck upturned face almost met do know do know understand everything only can not live without paul head sank upon shoulder must not thrust away very gently passed arm around drew to knew that must trust for battle be over even a have crept into arm there have come to flash of memory sudden swift vision wall of dimly lit dainty little chamber with charm of faint perfume soft light luxurious drapings have opened before looked out upon world bare northumbrian moor with tumbled mass of grey rock low hanging misty cloud silent tarn stretched away before eye strong fresh breeze salt smelling bracing cooled hot face roar of great ocean thundered in ear angry sunset burned strange colour into western sky with actual memory came healthier tone of feeling something indeed of old north country puritanism be in blood sea spoke to of vastness of life dared to cast away soiled tarnished for sake of brief passionate delight breeze nature very voice whispered to to stand true to taste once more for ever deep joy of pure perfect communion with voice of past life spoke to in one long sweet chorus held up to ideal to have be ever true blended with be memory faint sweet of fair womanly face into whose clear grey eye must never dare to look again if yielded now to fierce temptation new strength came upon brought with great tenderness adrea child said softly make almost forget that be guardian be ward sit down here want to talk to led dumb unresisting to chair stood by side adrea interrupted throwing arm roughly from shoulder springing to foot how dare touch how dare stand there mock oh how hate hate hate voice limb trembled with passion face be a pale a death before anger bowed head be silent against sombre background of dark curtain slim form seemed to gain added strength dignity have insulted paul de vaux do not owe enough already without putting to score dare think that be indeed love offered who stood by saw father murdered that

room door be thrown open arthur de vaux pale splashed with mud from head to foot stood upon threshold chapter xx new strong wine of love situation although be only brief one be for moment possessed of singularly dramatic force grouping colouring in dimly lit drawing room be that artist must desire facial expression bordered upon tragic of men in world brother be last whom of own choosing paul must have wished to see there be brief silence arthur breathless through hasty entrance must only stand there upon threshold face white to lip eye flashing with passionate anger dismay to situation be more than painful be horrible to have believed ill of paul from hearsay must have be impossible confidence in elder brother have be unbounded have always looked up to a mirror of everything be honorable chivalrous even now perhaps there might be explanation partial explanation at rate paul be standing back amongst shadow face be only barely visible doubtless be only surprise held silent in moment

contradict might have be tragedy of situation vanished for paul at sound of brother word after be not just anger of deceived man with be confronted empty scream of boy passion arthur infatuation have skimmed surface of light nature be pricked not wounded yet though in sense realization brought relief paul felt humbled into dust be actually conscious of own humiliation so far a nature such a must be conventional have become so in deference to opinion of who looked up to a head of great house of whom much be to be expected socially politically what must become of opinion now arthur word too plainly foreshadowed moved forward into centre of room faced brother there be only small table between know who sent here arthur said what report have heard seems to that explanation may wish have

hate begone leave house stood quite still white trembling scorn of word have fallen like ice upon heart then turned groped for door a though there be mist before eye suppose be quite right faltered out did see quite same way be understand now door opened shut in moment two sound of horse hoof be heard in avenue growing rapidly le distinct a galloped away into darkness to paul sounded like knell of self respect adrea felt only relief eye full of soft invitation sought did not move stood there silent motionless with face turned towards window dying sound meant so much to so much that must never understand consciousness of near presence suddenly disturbed turned round warm breath be upon cheek white arm be twined about neck paul whispered look so miserable please come talk to arm tightened around looked down at with peculiar helplessness light weight seemed to like chain of iron weighing down down down have told that have come to bid farewell that father adrian word vague

because hate dumb confidant may be trusted with name so will be clearer still love paul de vaux hate father adrian oh that must have dared that must have dared to speak so to if only paul have be there must have beaten if have have strength mean must have killed where stood silenced thin cruel lip for ever must have stabbed to heart hand must never have faltered let try to recall scene be not difficult word be ringing still in ear white passionate face seems to follow mock wherever look see out there in white moonlight rise up from dark corner of room haunt hate hate a woman hate one who come between man love be alone paul at least thought so have heard one enter have suddenly voice rang out filled room fierce cruel voice so changed hardened with passion scarcely recognised when sprang up peered through twilight of chamber saw standing close to so close that might even have heard whispered word to one there have be ceremony at monastery amongst hill where most of time here be spent have evidently come straight from there flowing black robe be splashed with mud torn by bramble white face be livid with exhaustion anger dark eye burned like fire in hollow depth right hand be raised above head a though have be on point of striking denouncing will not forget appearance while live will haunt to dying day think that be mystery of torture so what have paul to fear from whence come power what evil be hold suspended over head there be only one can imagine father adrian must hold key to awful deathbed scene at monastery of cruta a write word hand shake heart sickens with horror of memory well have cause to shrink from thought of hideous night to whom son of martin de vaux have become dearest amongst men what be paul said to know something father told whilst lay dying be that knowledge give strange power did not believe in must not have believed in in dreadful moment turned to paul saw face volley of word seemed trembling on father adrian lip yet did not speak waited for storm to burst waited till must bear silence no longer felt that if be not broken must go mad so drew near to spoke single word in ear then glided back to paul side spy treated insult a one might treat bite of insect in face of imminent danger did not reply to did not appear to have heard eye traveled over a though have be sightless challenged paul in excitement of moment word sounded tame almost meaningless be answer then paul de vaux let be so accept decision there be defiance in paul answer manner be quite subdued think that word tone surprised have seen be in hand looked from

tangled shrubbery below to be sweet grateful be in mood for pleasant sound sight dreariness of night find echo in heart damp breeze cool forehead to night feel conscious of new strength be strength of hate mind be full of dim purpose time will aid to gather strength a group together action will suggest to time leave let go back to recital of what passed between three strange lethargic calm seemed to have fallen upon paul turned to without even single trace of passion have lit up face few moment before must go said quietly farewell must scarcely believe that meant that be going away without word at what be really priest unspoken bidding be so from moment fear of father adrian have grown up in heart leaped into new strength be angry full of resistance why must go cried have much to say to

always creeping across life like dark noisome shadow go away begone will not be left with turned shade paler did not sacrifice dignity a hoped that must by answering with anger did not even answer at looked over head at lover to morrow night said calmly to morrow night paul answered stood between angry log of wood have just fallen from fire on to hearth in sudden blaze must see face distinctly utter contrast between two men threw into strong relief paul in scarlet coat riding clothes pale impassive debonnaire father adrian strange black garb mud bespattered disordered dark angry face livid with passion so hardly suppressed be odd to think of a creature of same specie odder still to think that there must be link between walked with paul to door holding to arm talking half gaily half reproachfully way stood on step together while horse be being brought round in half light stooped down kissed manner have changed even lip be cold eye be no longer bright there be far away look in face be white set there be tear in eye a watched ride away on great brown horse listened to distant thunder of hoof across moor face have told own story be nerving to face expected danger from whose
