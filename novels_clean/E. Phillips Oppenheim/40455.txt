vaguely troubled by memory of girl white face pleading brown eye then nightingale sang to at once mind be swept bare of such thought once more pine clover scented air around seemed quivering with strange passionate music night in ground of lingford grange man stood like statue half invisible among shadow only face wrung with emotion gleamed pale through darkness out from window ablaze with much illumination out into cool still night came wonderful music tugging at heartstrings sending blood rushing through vein at fever heat song swelled music grew with impotence then came end dying away of long sustained melodious note crash of chord on piano buzz of applause merging into conversation thing strone heard for lingford grange with magnificent front grove of poplar stood with back sheer upon country road newly built music room almost overhung pathway heard listened for more must make sing again soon silence silence of expectation note two upon piano again voice more wonderful than ever be fantasy of music elusive capricious delightful song ended with woman laughter strone groaned where stood under rustling leaf be like omen chill forewarning of own certain fate shadow

came knew at once a came slowly into sight leaning on arm of colonel devenhill diamond star burned in hair great bunch of white rose be clustering loosely at bosom walked straight to window looked out spirit of song seemed still to linger in face eyelid dropped little lip be parted in faintest of smile against lamplit background formed perhaps fairest image of woman strone have ever gazed upon bare arm neck shone like alabaster black net gown glittered over with marvelous trimming traced in strange design about skirt stood there looking out strone lifted eye to hers be like fire flashing through summer darkness then heard voice how delicious air be must trouble to fetch fan colonel devenhill be on piano man disappeared then strone heart throbbed though dared not speak move toward seemed to that be alone watched breathlessly white jeweled hand played for moment with ornament held rose then came dropping into darkness little shower of white blossom almost immediately young man rejoined fan in hand with single bound strone cleared road picked up rose one by one with hot dry finger regained shelter with echo of woman soft laugh ringing in ear chose safe place watched go by hour so later leaning back in carriage with half closed eye a though asleep cloud of drooping white lace around shoulder be only glimpse then lit pipe trudged homeward across hill with gray dawn turned upon madness fought day by day rode backward forward from hillside cottage to gascester through misty dawn white moonlight like man at bay fought madness grimy mechanic in grease stained clothing who have
