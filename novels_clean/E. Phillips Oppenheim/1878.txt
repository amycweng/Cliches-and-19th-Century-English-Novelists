fire black form of men stark naked wounding with spear danced around made air hideous with discordant cry king too drunk to stand squatted upon ground with empty bottle by side breath of wind brought strong noxious odour to two men who stood watching captain francis puffed hard at cigarette ugh muttered beastly may take word for trent said gruffly that if two hundred soldier be camped in bush

be by accident too that monty with little groan changed position at moment so that face be in shadow captain francis be puzzled be like said to softly after thing too improbable turned away with shade upon face followed trent out into moonlight screeching from village below grew louder more hideous minute chapter v howl became roar blind passion be changed into purposeful fury who be white men to march so boldly into presence of king without even formality of sending envoy ahead for king of bekwando drunk sober be stickler for etiquette pleased to keep white men waiting for day sometimes visitor be kept waiting pleasure not altogether certain a to ultimate fate for there be ugly story a to who have journeyed to bekwando never be seen heard of since be sort of visitor with whom ebon majesty loved to dally until became pale with fright furious with anger impatience men like white captain who have brought present who came in overwhelming force demanded passage through country a matter of right be special detestation on arrival have simply marched into place at head of column of hausa without ceremony almost a master into very presence of king now have come again with one of other miscreant who at least have knelt before brought rum many other present slow burning sullen wrath be kindled in king heart a three men drew near people half mad with excitement debauch needed only cry from to have closed like magic round insolent intruder thick lip be parted breath came hot fierce whilst hesitated away outside clearing be little army of hausa clean limbed faithful well drilled armed choked down wrath there be grim story about who have yielded to luxury of slaying white men story of village razed to ground destroyed of king who have be shot of vengeance very swift very merciless closed mouth with snap sat up with drunken dignity oom sam in fear trembling moved to side what want king asked oom sam spread out document trent have handed upon tree stump explained

harshly will swim in sam said will float down to hell upon oom sam explained to king owing to sentiment of affection admiration with white men regarded three barrel must be made into four whereupon majesty bluntly pronounced audience at end waddled off into imperial abode two englishman walked slowly back to hut between there have sprung up from first moment strong mutual antipathy blunt savagery of trent apparently heartless treatment of weaker partner avowed unscrupulousness offended newcomer much in same manner a in many way be obnoxious to trent immaculate fatigue uniform calm superciliousness obvious air of belonging to superior class be galling to trent beyond measure felt difference realised ignorance unkempt uncared for appearance perhaps a two men walked side by side faint foreshadowing of future showed to trent larger world where two must once more walk side by side outward difference between lessened smouldering irritation of present leaping up into red hot flame of hatred perhaps be just a well for john francis that man who walked so sullenly by side have not eye of seer for be wild country trent have drunk deep of lawlessness little accident with knife

fresh world to conquer to night told that be equal to there be something out here in dim moonlight something suggested by shadow rose perfumed air delicate languid stillness crept into vein coursed through blood like magic yet now then same thought came lay like small threatening black shadow across brilliant hope dream be filling brain so far have played game of life a hard man perhaps selfish one always honestly now for first time have stepped aside from beaten track told that be not bound to believe da souza story that have left monty with honest conviction that be past human help yet knew that such consolation be merest sophistry through twilight a passed to fro fancied more than once that wan face of old man with wistful sorrowing eye be floating somewhere before stopped to listen with bated breath to wind rustling in elm tree fancying must bear that same passionate cry ringing still in ear cry of old man parted from kin waiting for death in lonely land chapter xix ernestine found letter on plate few morning afterwards rather puzzled be from firm of solicitor in lincoln inn eastchester family solicitor requesting to call morning to see on important business there be not hint a to nature of merely formal line two signature ernestine who have written insulting letter to relative during last few day smiled a laid down perhaps family have called upon mr

threatening word trent have always felt that man be enemy certainly power to do incalculable harm if not to altogether ruin be now must not hesitate about trent knew that although broadly speaking be innocent of desire to harm desert monty power on earth must ever convince francis of appearance be always must be overwhelmingly against without interference from one have already formulated plan for quietly putting monty in rightful position making over to share in bekwando syndicate to arrange without catastrophe must need skill tact interference from outside source must be fatal francis meant to interfere nothing must stop trent walked backwards forward with knitted brow glancing now then at unconscious man francis must certainly interfere if be allowed to recover chapter xxvii fortnight
