accustomed to speak mind freely at time if be never brilliant have never be heard to say foolish thing make pointless remark moved on way through life held place there more by reason of certain negative quality amongst community of optimist be universally ascribed to than through more personal likable gift have dark strong face slim weakly body be never unduly silent be better listener than talker if have close friend certainly have enemy whether be rich poor man knew next to colonel one be more ready to subscribe to of charity sheridanites be continually inaugurating on behalf of le fortunate member man who succeeds in keeping ego out of sight a rule neither irritates greatly attracts stephen heneage be one of who stood in position be talking about murder rather colonel be talking be listening there be one point remarked filling glass beaming good humouredly upon companion seems to have be entirely overlooked be referring to sex of supposed assassin wrayson looked up inquiringly be point interested nearly of have assumed colonel continued that must have taken strong man to draw cord tight enough to have killed that poor fellow without noticeable struggle a matter of fact child with particular knot must have done requires strength only delicacy of touch rapidity nerve woman then wrayson began bless yes woman must have done easily colonel declared only unfortunately there seem to have be woman about why have seen done in korea with turn of wrist be knack wrayson shuddered slightly colonel word have troubled more than must have cared to let one know woman man child mason remarked person who did seems to have vanished in remarkable manner from face of earth certainly seems colonel admitted to have covered up trace with admirable skill have read

light scarcely heard interruption be on fire with subject see continued that man day be spent amongst class where passion run loose where restraint be unknown virtue where self sensuality be upraised god one can easily imagine that from amongst slough might spring at time weed of tragedy in other word man morris barnes moved amongst class of people to whom murder if must be safely accomplished must be little more than incident colonel lit cigar leaned back in chair be enjoying immensely curious part of affair be though continued deliberately that murder a suppose must call bear none of hall mark of rude passion on contrary suggests in more way than one touch of finished artist man whole evening have be traced without slightest difficulty dined at cafe royal alone promenaded afterwards at

glanced through case in paper did not even interest since have listened to have fallen under spell of mysterious have theory colonel face fell little well be afraid not admitted regretfully to be perfectly interesting affair certainly ought to present something more definite in shape of clue see providing accept evidence of wrayson cabman suppose added laying hand affectionately upon wrayson shoulder must actual murderer be person absolutely unseen unheard of by one if be really interested will discus again in week time after adjourned inquest for one will look forward to heneage remarked

believe for moment that must be connected in way with beastly affair unfortunate part of be that others who know might easily be led to think otherwise be altogether own fault too mason remarked gave evidence shockingly movement night rather that morning be certainly little peculiar man remarked connection with affair seemed to consist of series of coincidence law doe not look favourably upon coincidence after colonel remarked scarcely knew fellow just nodded to on stair sort of thing why there be shadow of motive ca be sure of colonel heneage remarked quietly wonder how much really know of inner life of even closest friend fancy that must be surprised if realized ignorance colonel stroked grey moustache thoughtfully may be true said of good many of wrayson however never struck a being particularly secretive sort of chap unfortunately that count for very little heneage declared thing surprise most in life come often from most unlikely people none of mean to be deceitful

morris barnes be murdered for sake of security believe nothing lawyer answered be not business to believe mr morris barnes be in receipt of income of two thousand year might call dividend upon security client through made mr barnes cash offer to buy outright although must admit that mr barnes have not closed with yet believe that be on point of doing so have doubtless have brought home to

sombre yet vivid upon marble pedestal at end of room lifelike untouched by century stood wonderful presentation of ralph de st etarpe founder of house clad in armour of day dinner table with brilliant modern appurtenance of flower plate standing in middle of floor seemed like minute yet startling anachronism brilliant patch of scarlet geranium deep blue livery of two footman glitter of venetian glass upon table be like note of alien colour amongst surroundings whose chief characteristic be magnificent restraint yet such dignity a be possible to impart into everyday business of eating drinking be certainly manifest in meal presently took leisurely course wrayson although one must accuse of lack of savoir faire found scarcely at ease madame de melbain erect dignified beautiful sat at head of table although addressed remark to of occasionally remained always unapproachable baron made only formal attempt at conversation mademoiselle de courcelles be absolutely silent wrayson be

conversation between however languished for baron spoke only in monosyllable attitude gave wrayson idea that viewed presence at chateau with disfavour with stiff punctiliousness begged wrayson to try wonderful burgundy passed box of cigarette did not however open topic of conversation wrayson embarrassed in choice of subject by fact that remark must make might sound like attempt at gratifying curiosity remained also silent in very few minute baron rose will take glass of wine sir asked wrayson rose too with alacrity bowed refusal recrossed great hall entered drawing room louise madame de melbain be talking earnestly together in corner from look that latter threw at a entered wrayson be convinced that in way be concerned with subject of conversation be look deliberate scrutinizing in sense doubtful yet not unkindly behind wrayson felt that there be something must not understand there be something of mystery in dark sad eye seemed to pervade whole atmosphere of place life of people louise rose a approached motioned to take vacated place madame de melbain must like to talk to for few moment said quietly afterwards will come on to terrace swept away through open window be at once followed by baron mademoiselle de courcelles be playing very softly on grand piano in unseen corner of apartment wrayson hostess be alone turned towards with faint smile spoke with great deliberation very clearly there be in voice hidden quality indefinable in word yet musical singularly attractive will not keep very long mr wrayson said louise have be talking to about be happy think to have found

veritable land of enchantment service of dinner have be somewhat leisurely affair hour be already late moon be slowly rising behind tree landscape be at present wrapped in soft doubtful obscurity of late twilight flower with whose perfume air be faintly fragrant remained unseen visible only in blurred outline tall tree whose top be unstirred by even slightest breeze stood out like silent sentinel against violet sky madame de melbain stopped short upon threshold of terrace with head slightly thrown back half closed eye suzanne be right murmured there be peace here peace if only must last baron came hastily forward seemed to be eyeing wrayson little doubtfully madame de melbain pointed down avenue think said that must be pleasant to walk for little way give arm baron will go first mr wrayson will follow with louise descended step crossed lawn through gate into broad grass grown avenue cut through wood to road wrayson at first be silent louise seemed little nervous more than once started at sound of rabbit scurrying through undergrowth there be something little mysterious about otherwise profound silence of impenetrable wood even footstep fell noiselessly upon spongy turf wrayson spoke at last have fallen sufficiently far behind others to be out of earshot do know what madame de melbain have be saying to asked louise turned head little there be faintest flicker of smile about lip can not imagine declared looking once more straight ahead have be inciting to bold deed wrayson said how must like to be carried off in mediaeval fashion married willing unwilling be that what madame de melbain have be recommending to do asked nodded yes be thinking of taking advice said coolly laughed quietly yet ear be quick caught note of sadness moment later crept into eye must solve so

softly disengaged other two be still in sight already curve of moon be creeping over tree spoil murmured talk of to morrow future have to night there followed minute of took count then of sudden hand clutched arm listen whispered hoarsely came suddenly down to earth be walking in shadow of tree close to side of wood footstep upon soft turf be noiseless wrayson almost held breath a leaned towards dark chaos of thickly planted tree only few yard away must distinctly hear dry snapping of twig one be keeping pace with inside wood now must see stooping figure of man creeping stealthily along little exclamation broke from louise lip be spy after muttered said that entrance to place be guarded wrayson have time to take only one quick step towards wood when shrill cry rang out upon still night then there be trampling under foot of bush undergrowth sound of men voice one english threatening other guttural terrified madame de melbain escort have paused be looking back louise be moving towards wrayson be on point of entering wood into little semicircle formed by four people there suddenly strode wrayson friend from inn grasping by collar shrinking protesting figure in much dishevelled tweed suit be right mr wrayson former remarked quietly fellow have be spying round day have better ask friend what wish done with chapter xxviii scene in avenue there followed few minute of somewhat curious silence at first sound of voice of man who have made so startling appearance in midst cry only half suppressed have broken from madame de melbain lip have moved impulsively little forward moon visible now from over tree top be shining faintly upon absolutely colourless face dilated eye for reason seemed terror stricken louise who be clinging now to arm neither of seemed even to have glanced at cowering figure of man who have relapsed now into venomous silence of be gazing at captor upon face be strangest expression wrayson have ever seen on human feature be a though stood upon edge of world peered downwards into forbidden depth a though suddenly found in presence of thing so wonderful that thought speech alike be chained wrayson involuntarily followed direction of rapt gaze stranger certainly presented somewhat formidable appearance be standing upon slightly higher ground massive proportion of tall powerful figure stood out with almost startling distinctness against empty background face be half in shadow yet seemed to wrayson that touch of mystery be quivering in drawn face of two woman be also reflected in dimly seen feature something indefinable be in air something so mysterious wonderful that voice seemed stricken dumb life suspended owl flew slowly out from wood with ponderous flapping of wing sailed over head one started madame de melbain gave half stifled strain be over louise be half sobbing now in one arm will leave fellow to be dealt with a owner of chateau may direct stranger said stiffly turning to wrayson can tell that know about turned
