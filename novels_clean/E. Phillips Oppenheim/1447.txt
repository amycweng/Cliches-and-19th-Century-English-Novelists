funnel belching forth fire smoke into blackness of night huge engine with solitary saloon carriage guard brake thundered way through night towards great metropolis across desolate plain stripped bare of vegetation made hideous forever by growth of mighty industry where furnace fire reddened sky only unbroken line of ceaseless light showed where town dwindled into village suburb led back again into town ugly thickly populated neighborhood whose area of twinkling light seemed to reach almost to murky sky hideous indeed by day not altogether devoid now of certain weird attractiveness by reason of low hung star on through many tunnel into black country where furnace fire burned oftener sign of habitation be fewer down great iron way huge locomotive rushed onward leaping bounding across maze of metal tearing past dazzling signal light through crowded station where passing be like roar of earth shaking monster station master at crewe unhooked telephone receiver rang up liverpool what about

pantry be met by locked door let down window looked out be within few foot of engine be obviously attached direct to saloon mr hamilton fynes resumed seat having disturbed nobody produced paper from breast pocket spread out on table before one sealed envelope immediately returned slipping down into carefully prepared place between lining material of coat of others commenced to make close minute investigation be curious fact however that notwithstanding recent searching examination looked once more nervously around saloon before settled down to task for reason other there be not slightest doubt that for present at rate mr hamilton fynes be exceedingly anxious to keep own company a drew nearer to journey end indeed manner seemed to lose something of composure of during earlier part of evening have certainly be possessed scarcely minute passed that did not lean sideways from seat look up down saloon sat like man who be perpetually on qui vive furtive light shone in eye be manifestly

little crowd be completely mystified one have slightest idea of what have happened attendant be besieged by question be sitting on step of car in shadow of policeman with head buried in hand did not once look up of more adventurous tried to peer through window at lower end of saloon others rushed off to interview guard in very few minute however station master reappeared upon scene accompanied by doctor little crowd stood on one side two men stepped into car doctor proceeded at once with examination mr hamilton fynes mysterious person who have succeeded indeed in making record journey be leaning back in corner of seat arm folded head drooping little eye still fixed in unseeing stare body yielded unnaturally to touch for main truth doctor needed scarcely glance at be dead station master asked stone dead be brief answer good god station master muttered good god doctor have thrown handkerchief over dead man face be standing now looking at thoughtfully did die in sleep wonder

if be must have saloon shunted on to siding left absolutely untouched have better place two of station police in charge while telephone to scotland yard to scotland yard station master exclaimed

yard perhaps must be a well too not to touch paper until one come see that attendant doe not go home guard will probably be wanted to answer question station master stepped out to platform summoned inspector gave few brief order slowly saloon be backed out of station again on to neglected siding sort of backwater for spare carriage empty truck ignominious resting place indeed after splendid journey through night door at end be closed two policeman placed on duty to guard doctor station master seated out of sight of gruesome companion station master told that knew about despatch of special man who have ordered attendant who still moved about like man in dream brought brandy soda served with shaking hand three talked together in whisper attendant telling few incident of journey

helped up into car saluted doctor mechanically eye be already travelling around saloon inspector jack from scotland yard sir announced have man outside if mind will have in by mean station master answered be afraid that will find rather serious affair have left everything untouched so far a must second detective be assisted to clamber up into car seemed however a though whole force of scotland

in buttonhole patent boot silk hat have carefully deposited upon floor be sitting closeted with miss penelope morse be obvious that young lady did not altogether appreciate honor done to by visit from so distinguished person a inspector jack be sorry said that must find visit in least offensive miss morse have approached so far a possible a ordinary visitor one connected with household can have idea a to identity nature of business have done out of consideration to feeling at same time have duty to perform must be done what can not understand penelope said coldly be why must bother about duty when saw at carlton hotel told exactly how much knew of mr hamilton fynes dear young lady inspector jack said will not ask for sympathy for be afraid must ask in vain be just now people at scotland yard up against one of most extraordinary problem have ever be put before have have two murder occurring in two day have much at least in common that have be work of so accomplished criminal at present moment although must not like to tell one a much have not in case ghost of clue sound very stupid of penelope remarked still ask ask for minute two inspector interrupted think remarked just now that two crime have one thing in common be fact that have be perpetrated by criminal of unusual accomplishment also have one other point of similitude what be penelope asked victim in case be american inspector said penelope sat very still felt steely eye of man who have chosen seat so carefully fixed upon face connect two affair in way asked be what be asking mr jack continued in absence of definite clue coincidence such a be always interesting in case a happens can take even little further find that for instance miss penelope morse young american lady celebrated for wit accomplishment well known in london society be to have lunched with mr hamilton fynes on day when made tragical arrival in london find too curiously enough that be one of party with whom mr richard vanderpole be to have dined gone to theatre on night of decease penelope shivered half closed eye think said that shock of coincidence a call have be quite sufficient without having come here to remind of madam mr jack said have not come here to gratify personal curiosity have come here in cause of justice must find welcome visitor for men who have lost life be friend of yours must be very sorry indeed penelope answered to stand in way of justice one can hope more fervently than do that perpetrator of deed will be found punished what can not understand be coming here reopening subject with tell again have possible information for perhaps not inspector declared on other hand there be certain question can answer answer not grudgingly a though in duty bound answer intelligently with apprehension of thing lie behind what be thing lie behind asked theory madam inspector answered more in case unfortunately have not passed stage of theory theory at present moment be that murderer of two men be same person have evidence to effect said suddenly surprised to find that voice have sunk to whisper very little mr jack admitted see in case of theory one must build brick by brick then if after a reach end foundation be false well must watch collapse start again supposing leave generality penelope remarked get on with question wish to ask aunt a may have heard be invalid although seldom leaf room be one of afternoon when sometimes sits here for short time must not care to have find inspector leaned back in chair be very pleasant drawing room looking out upon park little french

mr jack noticed that although paper cutter be lying by side leaf of be uncut question said may seem to irrelevant yet please answer if can mr hamilton fynes for instance be to knowledge acquainted with mr richard vanderpole have never heard speak of one penelope answered must think very unlikely have knowledge of common pursuit interest in life two men may have shared inspector asked hobby for instance collection of postage stamp china common aim of sort shook head knew little of mr fynes taste dicky mean mr vanderpole have none at except enthusiasm for profession love of polo profession inspector repeated mr vanderpole be attached to american embassy be not believe so penelope answered mr hamilton fynes inspector continued might almost have be said to have followed same occupation surely not penelope objected always understood that mr fynes be employed in government office at washington something to do with custom thought forest duty mr jack nodded thoughtfully be not aware a yet said of precise nature of mr fynes occupation only knew that be in shape form government work know a much about answered a do have sent inspector continued smoothly special man out to washington to make inquiry be possible on spot incidentally to go through effect of deceased with view to tracing complication in may have be involved in country penelope opened lip closed again be not however inspector continued very sanguine of success in case of mr vanderpole for instance there must have be nothing of sort be too young altogether too much of boy to have have enemy so bitterly disposed towards there be explanation somewhere feel convinced at root of matter believe then asked penelope that robbery be really motive not ordinary robbery mr jack answered man who be capable of two crime be capable of easier greater thing mean explained that must have attempted enterprise of far more remunerative character with prospect of complete success will forgive said if ask to go on with question providing have more to ask notwithstanding excellence of disguise remarked with faint curl of lip might find somewhat difficult to explain presence if aunt visitor must come in be sorry miss morse inspector said quietly to find so unsympathetic have found differently disposed be going to ask to put in place be going to ask to look at two tragedy from point of view from own at same time be going to ask whether possible motive suggested to possible person cause might be benefited by removal of two men if think mr jack penelope said that be keeping anything from be very much mistaken such sympathy a have must certainly be with who be attempting to bring to justice perpetrator of such unmentionable crime what object to be unpleasantness of being associated with inquiry when be absolutely unable to give least help to supply with information be not equally attainable to a for instance inspector asked be detective penelope said coldly need to point out certain thing to mr hamilton fynes be robbed murdered american citizen on way to london mr richard vanderpole be also murdered after call upon mr james b coulson only acquaintance whom mr fynes be known to have possessed in country did mr fynes share secret with mr coulson if so did mr coulson pas on to mr vanderpole for reason did mr vanderpole meet with same death at same hand a have befallen mr fynes inspector jack

entered inspector turned to follow penelope remained a have be standing hand have touched bell fallen to side eye fixed upon with new light stirring quiet depth one moment morton said wait outside mr jack added a door closed what do mean what can have told how can have helped inspector stood very still for brief space of time very still very silent face too be quite expressionless yet tone when spoke seemed to have taken to note of sternness if have chosen said slowly to have become ally in matter to have ranged altogether on side of law answer must have be ready enough what have told however have told against will not in actual word have told in way too added that be impossible for to doubt intention to mislead be forced to conclude that stand on opposite side of way will not trouble more miss morse turned to door penelope remained motionless for several moment listening to retreating footstep chapter x mr coulson outmatched mr james b coulson settled down to live what be

minute in new york have big city full of alien quarter full of hiding place chock full of criminal police catch em same there be one going to commit murder in street of new york without finding in tomb before be week older offence mr jack be not taking mr coulson inspector answered must admit that there be great deal of truth in what say be rather reflection upon that have not a yet even made arrest think will also admit that circumstance of murder be exceedingly curious mr coulson knocked ash from cigar well a to that said if be to judge only by what read in paper be curious without doubt be not supposing for one moment that fellow at scotland yard know more than have let on to newspaper keep discovery out of press over here good job too must persuade that have very distinct theory a to how crime be worked sort of person who did eh mr jack be perhaps not quite so ignorant a seem inspector answered of course be right when say that have few more fact to go by than have appeared in

difficulty in ascertaining that person for whom asked with whom spent twenty minute in very room be mr james b coulson of new york seated on very couch sir mr coulson declared striking arm of with flat of hand seated within few foot of where be at present moment inspector nodded naturally continued when became aware of so singular occurrence felt that must lose time in coming having few more word with mr coulson became meditative upon word when come to think of said be coincidence sure two men murdered within twenty four hour seem to have be last person who knew to speak to tell what mr jack if go on will get bit scared think will let london business alone go on over to paris inspector smiled fancy nerve remarked be quite strong enough to bear strain however be sure will not mind telling exactly why mr richard vanderpole secretary to american embassy here must have come to see on thursday night why be easy mr coulson replied may have heard of firm coulson bruce company of

went on come of good american stock too tell there be going to be inquest that will be summoned know nothing more than what have told if did 'd be welcome to mr jack leaned back in chair certainly situation increased in perplexity man by side be talking now of adaptation of one of patent to existing machinery jack watched covertly considered to extent physiognomist told be not possible that man be playing part mr james b coulson sat there absolute incarnation of genial man of affair interested in business interested in great subject of dollar getting content with position person apparently of little imagination for shock of matter concerning have be talking have already passed away be doing best to explain with pencil on back of illustrated paper new system of wool bleaching mr coulson inspector said suddenly do know young lady named miss penelope morse be here perhaps that mr coulson sank little from height of complete success repeated name obviously took time to think before answered miss penelope morse inspector continued be young american lady who life with invalid aunt in park lane who be taken everywhere by duchess of devenham aunt believe suppose may say that be acquainted with mr coulson admitted came here other evening with young man sir charles somerfield ah inspector murmured 'd read interview of mine with comet man mr coulson said fancied that perhaps

with one man woman who doe find america good enough for to live in inspector nodded quite so agreed so have anything to tell young lady not thing that have read in comet mr coulson replied what

find loose end of little tangle stay have drink mr coulson begged have nothing to do there be one two boy coming in later who will like to meet inspector shook head must be off said want to get into office before six o'clock dare say will be running across again before go back shook hand turned away then mr coulson made what be perhaps second slight mistake say mr jack exclaimed what made mention that young lady name anyway be curious to know inspector looked thoughtfully at end of fresh cigar have just lit well said know that there be anything definite in mind only seems little strange that miss penelope morse must have be acquainted with murdered man that must have come across one sort of bond between eh mr coulson replied seemed very charming young lady cut above fynes must think detective smiled american young lady who come over here be charming said goodbye mr coulson many thanks inspector passed out man whom have come to visit after moment hesitation resumed seat be american method muttered to understand that man jack be simpleton be too cunning for crossed to writing table scribbled unnecessary note addressing to firm in city then rang for messenger boy handed to for delivery few minute afterwards strolled out into hall boy be in act of handing note to one of head porter who carefully copied address mr coulson returned to smoking room whistling softly to chapter xi commission mr robert blaine harvey american ambassador plenipotentiary extraordinary to england be man of great culture surprising personal gift with diplomatic instinct amounted almost to genius yet there be time when be puzzled for at least hour have be sitting in great library looking across park trying to make up mind on very important matter seemed to that be face to face with what amounted almost to crisis in career two year at court of st james have be pleasant uneventful enough small question have presented for adjustment between two country be after of particular importance be easily arranged day seemed to have gone by for over strained sensitiveness be continually giving rise to senseless bickering when trilling breeze seemed to fan smouldering fire of jealousy two great english speaking nation appeared finally to have realized absolute folly of continual dispute between country whose destiny ideal be so completely in accord whose interest be in main identical period of absolute friendliness have ensued now there have come little cloud be small enough at present mr harvey be not one to overlook sinister possibility two citizen of country have be barbarously murdered within space of few hour one in heart of most thickly populated capital in world there be certain significance attached to fact ambassador others at washington perfectly well realized glanced once more at most recent letter on top of pile of correspondence away again out into park be difficult matter friend at washington did not cultivate art of obscurity in word used have be suggested to in black white that murder of two men under particular circumstance existing be matter concerning must speak very plainly indeed to certain august personage mr harvey who be born diplomatist understood difficulty of such proceeding good deal more than who have propounded there be knock at door footman entered ushering in visitor young lady whom be expecting sir announced discreetly mr harvey rose at once to foot dear penelope said shaking hand with be charming of penelope smiled seems quite like old time to feel at home here once more declared mr harvey did not pursue subject be perfectly well aware that penelope who have be first wife greatest friend have never altogether forgiven for somewhat brief period of mourning drew easy chair up to side of desk placed footstool for must not have sent for said be really honestly in dilemma do know that apart from endless cable have favored with one hundred forty page of foolscap about event of week before last penelope shivered little poor dicky murmured looking away into fire to think that be who sent to death mr harvey shook head said think that need reproach with a matter of fact think must have sent dicky in case be not so well known a others rather be associated so closely with embassy be constantly at savoy on own account if have believed that there be danger in enterprise continued must still have sent be a strong a young hercules hand twisted that noose around neck must have be hand of magician with finger of steel penelope shivered again face showed sign of distress think said that be nervous person can not bear to think of even now naturally mr harvey answered be fond of dicky such thing have never happened so far a be aware in european country own private secretary murdered in broad daylight with apparent impunity murdered robbed whispered looking up at with white face frown on ambassador forehead darkened not only that declared secret of be robbed have gone to one country interested in knowledge of be sure of asked hoarsely be sure of mr harvey answered penelope drew little breath between teeth thought flashed back to recent dinner party prince be once more at side almost must hear voice low clear yet with note of inexpressible convincing finality heard speak of country reverently almost prayerfully of sacrifice true patriotism must always demand what have be in mind wondered at back of inscrutable eye gazing even at moment past bank of flower across crowded room with splendor of light color through wall whither brushed thought away be absurd incredible be allowing to be led away by old distrust of man remarked just now mr harvey continued that thing have never happened so far a be aware in european country own word seem to suggest something to method be not european savor more of east think have better go on said quietly there be something in mind can see that have told so much that have better tell rest content of despatch mr harvey continued intrusted in duplicate a have doubtless surmised to fynes to coulson contained assurance that sending of fleet to pacific be in fact a well a in appearance errand of peace be demonstration pure simple behind there may have lain indeed masterful purpose determination of great country to affirm strenuous existence in manner most likely to impress nation unused to seeing in such role became necessary in view of certain suspicion for to be able to prove to government here absolutely pacific nature of great enterprise despatch contained such proof now listen penelope before murder of poor dicky vanderpole know for fact that great nation who chooses to consider enemy in eastern water be straining nerve to prepare for war today preparation have slackened great loan have be withdrawn in paris invitation cabled to fleet to visit thing have plain reading plain indeed penelope assented spoke in low tone because there be fear in heart why have told about throw new light upon everything awful light have known ambassador said quietly since be baby member of family have be friend of mine come of silent race know very well that be person of discretion there be certain small way in government can occasionally be served by help of one outside diplomatic service altogether one who must not possibly be connected with know very well penelope because have already be of service to on more than one occasion be long time ago murmured not so very long reminded for first of tragedy fynes despatch must have reached through be going to ask help even once more in somewhat cold spring sunlight came streaming through large window penelope seemed little pallid a though indeed fatigue of season even in earlier stage be leaving mark upon there be violet rim under eye certain alertness seemed to have deserted usually piquant face sat listening with air of one half afraid who have hope of hearing pleasant thing have be remarked mr harvey continued rather may say that have noticed that be on exceedingly friendly term with very distinguished nobleman who be at present visiting country mean of course prince maiyo eyebrow be slowly elevated be that really impression people have lip just moved well asked have met prince maiyo mr harvey continued have found charming representative of race be not going to say word against if be american must be proud of if belonged to other country must accept at once for what appears to be unfortunately however belongs to country have reason to mistrust belongs to country in whose national character have not absolute confidence for reason dear penelope mistrust prince maiyo know so well a seem to imagine penelope said slowly be not even friend in ordinary acceptation of word be to extent prejudiced against yet believe that be capable of dishonorable action do ambassador declared smoothly yet in country almost in man exact standard of dishonor varies man will lie for woman sake even in law court certainly at club amongst friend will be accounted to righteousness patriot will lie intrigue for country sake now believe that to prince maiyo japan stand far above whole world of womankind believe that for sake must go to very great length indeed go on please penelope murmured prince be over here on sort of errand be business to understand mr harvey said have heard rumored that be special mission entirely concerned with renewal of treaty between england japan however may be have sat here have thought have come to conclusion ridiculous though may seem to at first believe that somewhere behind hand killed robbed hamilton fynes poor dicky stood benevolent shadow of friend prince maiyo have proof asked breathlessly proof at ambassador admitted be scarcely in position to search for conclusion have come to have be simply arrived at through putting few fact together considering in light of certain event in first place can not doubt that secret of despatch reached at once very people whom must have preferred to remain in ignorance of have told of sudden cessation of war alarm in japan when once be assured by mean must not mistrust that be not intention of american nation to make war upon subtlety of murder knowledge by be inspired must have come from one in altogether unique position may be sure that one connected with japanese embassy here must be permitted for one single second to take part in such illegal act know better than that wily oriental will play game from grosvenor place right enough prince maiyo be here stand apart from accredited institution although have confidence of ambassador can command entire devotion of own secret service have not come to conclusion hastily have thought out step by step in own mind be now absolutely convinced that murder be inspired by prince maiyo even if be so penelope said what can do why have sent for prince be not on especially friendly term be only just lately that have be decently civil to one ambassador looked at with surprise dear penelope said have seen together last three four evening prince look at one else while be there talk to know more freely than to other woman be by chance penelope protested have tried to avoid then can not congratulate upon success mr harvey said grimly thing have changed little between perhaps penelope said what be that really want want to know ambassador said slowly want to know how japan became assured that america have intention of going to war with in other word want to know whether paper be stolen from fynes poor dicky found way to japanese embassy into hand of prince maiyo anything else asked with faint note of sarcasm in tone yes mr harvey replied there be something else must like to know what attitude prince maiyo take towards proposed renewal of treaty between country great britain shook head even if be friend said very closest of friend must never tell be far too clever be too sure mr harvey said sometimes man especially oriental who doe not understand significance of sex in matter can be drawn on to speak more freely to woman than must ever dream of doing to best friend must not tell in a many word of course on other hand might show be in mind be going back very shortly penelope remarked mr harvey nodded be why sent for to come immediately will see tonight at devenham house with rest of world answered man be not likely to talk confidentially under such condition mr harvey rose to foot be only chance of course admitted remember that know more than other person in country except must be impossible for prince to give credit for such knowledge casual remark word perhaps may be sufficient penelope held out hand servant for whom ambassador have rung be already in room will try promised ask mr harvey to excuse going up to see afternoon have call to make want to rest before function

single sheet of notepaper starting little at signature then read again placed document beneath paper weight in front of when leaned across table folded arm formed semicircle around letter mr coulson

mr coulson assented delivered to in presence of one other person whose name will find mentioned in letter sir edward bowed head when spoke again manner have somehow changed have become at once more official trifle more stilted be great subject mr coulson said be subject have occupied attention of majesty minister for many month will take opinion of other person whose name be mentioned in letter a to whether can grant mr jones request if must do so will not be sure be necessary to say to that communication may make on subject tonight will be from men to man of honor must be accepted a such

few minute conversation upon matter mr coulson showed sign of surprise how be that asked there be subject sir edward said must like to discus with while be waiting for mr smith chapter xx answer mr coulson moved cigar into corner of mouth a though to obtain clear view of questioner face expression be one of bland interest well guess have got puzzled sir edward said be thinking of doing anything in woollen machinery be sir edward smiled not mr coulson answered at rate question have nothing to do with other very interesting avocation what wanted to ask be whether must tell anything about compatriot of yours mr hamilton fynes hamilton fynes mr coulson repeated thoughtfully why be man who got murdered on car going from liverpool to london be so sir edward admitted mr coulson shook head told that reporter fellow knew about said be unsociable sort of chap know sir edward be in line of business h be thought might have be minister answered glancing keenly for moment at visitor to tell truth mr coulson have be great deal bothered about unfortunate incident by subsequent murder of young man who be attached to embassy here scotland yard have strained nerve to bring guilty people to justice so far unsuccessfully seems to that friend on other side scarcely seem to give credit for exertion help in least assure that have knowledge of mr fynes other than have appeared in paper recognize only a american citizen going about legitimate business little more confidence on part must think render task easier mr coulson scratched chin for moment thoughtfully well said can understand feeling bit sore about be not exactly given to brag when be away from own country one hears too much of that time between must say that be possible for two crime like to be committed in new york city for murderer to get off scot free in case matter sir edward declared have given great deal of anxiety can assure that home secretary have taken strong personal interest in at same time a have just pointed out to investigation be rendered more difficult from fact that can not learn anything definite concerning mr hamilton fynes visit to country now if knew for instance sir edward continued that be carrying document even letter similar to one have just handed to might at once discover motive to crime work backwards until reached perpetrator mr coulson knocked ash from cigar see what be driving at said be sorry can be of assistance to sir edward in case of mr hamilton fynes in case of mr richard vanderpole sir edward asked mr coulson shook head quite out of line declared notwithstanding fact sir edward reminded quietly that be probably last person to see vanderpole alive came to savoy to call upon before got into taxicab where be murdered be so be sure mr coulson answered nice young fellow be too well set up real american manner hail fellow well met ' with right away suppose mr coulson minister suggested smoothly must answer purpose to put aside bluff about patent for development of woollen trade for few moment tell exactly what passed between mr vanderpole at savoy hotel object of calling upon whether for instance took away with document paper intended for embassy have brought from america do think of thing mr coulson remarked admiringly be on wrong track time though sure still supposing be able to tell that mr vanderpole be carrying paper of importance to country that mr hamilton fynes be also in possession of same class of document how must help in what fresh direction must look then for murderer of two men mr coulson sir edward said must consider nature of document must see to whose advantage be that be suppressed mr coulson face seemed suddenly old lined spoke with new vigor eye be very keen bright under bushy eyebrow supposing be country asked supposing contained instruction to ambassador might consider inimical to interest do mean that must look at home for murderer mean that have men so devoted to native land that be willing to run risk of death by hangman to aid mean that secret service be perfected to extent that scale of justice be held blindfolded do mean that scotland yard must have order that men must go free be not thinking of own country sir edward admitted must confess that thought have turned elsewhere let tell sir mr coulson continued must imagine that trouble with washington if there be be simply that will not believe that police have free hand will not believe that be honestly genuinely anxious for discovery of perpetrator of crime speak without authority understand be more in position to discus affair than other tourist from country who might happen to come along sir edward shrugged shoulder can suggest method asked little dryly by mean of might remove unfortunate impression mr coulson flicked ash once more from end of cigar looked at thoughtfully be show said understand be giving view of mr james b coulson nobody mr james b coulson if be in position knew that friendly country be feeling little bit sore at having two of citizen disposed of so unceremoniously 'd do best to prove by only possible mean be taking matter seriously only possible mean being sir edward asked guess 'd offer reward mr coulson admitted sir edward did not hesitate for moment idea be excellent one mr coulson said have already be mooted will give little emphasis tomorrow will offer reward of one thousand pound for information leading to apprehension of murderer that sound bully mr coulson declared think that will have good effect upon friend in washington mr coulson asked know nothing about have given personal opinion only seems to though be best way of showing that be in earnest before quit subject finally mr coulson sir edward said be going to ask question have be asked before referring to hamilton fynes mr coulson asked yes get young man to lay hand on copy of comet mr coulson begged earnestly told that pushing young journalist knew bit more assure information be worth anything be meant to be worth anything sir edward asked mr coulson remained imperturbable if mind sir edward said guess will drop subject of mr hamilton fynes ca get forwarder let go at there be knock at door sir edward secretary ushered in tall plainly dressed gentleman who have slightly aggrieved air of man who have be kept out of bed beyond usual time dear bransome said shaking hand be little unreasonable of business at hour of night be in midst of most amusing conversation with delightful acquaintance of wife young lady who turned up nose at hegel have developed philosophy of own be just beginning to grasp first principle nothing else be quite sure must have kept awake sir edward leaned across table towards mr coulson mr coulson have risen to foot gentleman said be mr newcomer opened lip to protest sir edward held out hand one moment begged friend here mr j b coulson from new york have brought letter from america be sailing tomorrow leaving london somewhere about eight o'clock in morning imagine wish to take back verbal reply letter will understand come from mr jones reply be delivered in presence of mr smith friend here be not personally concerned in affair a matter of fact believe have be on continent exploiting patent of own invention newcomer accepted burden of altered nomenclature took up letter glanced at signature manner became at once more interested accepted chair sir edward have placed by side drawing electric light little nearer read document through word by word then folded up glanced first at colleague afterwards at mr coulson understand said that be private inquiry from private gentleman who be entitled however to a much courtesy a be possible for to show be exactly position sir mr coulson replied negotiation of more formal character be naturally conducted between foreign office foreign office of country few line come from man to man think that occurred to friend that might save great deal of trouble great deal of specious diplomacy great many hundred page of labored despatch if at bottom of knew true feeling concerning question be after simple matter mr coulson continued yet be matter with so many ramification that after much discussion might become veritable chaos mr smith inclined head gently appreciate situation said friend here sir edward bransome have already discussed matter at great length have also have benefit of advice help of greater foreign minister than of must ever hope to become see objection to giving verbal reply ask for do bransome none sir leave to to put in own word mr smith continued affair be within province policy of majesty minister be absolutely fixed sir edward turned toward visitor mr coulson said be asked by friend in few plain word what attitude of great britain must be in event of war between japan america answer answer to be war between japan america be likely to take place unless cabinet must go to unreasonable uncalled for extreme have ascertained beyond measure of doubt sincere feeling of ally in matter japan doe not desire war be not preparing for be unwilling even to entertain possibility of at same time feel that son must receive same consideration from nation in world a son of other people personally be profound conviction that good sense fairness generous instinct of great country will recognize act accordingly war between country japan be impossible thing thought of exists only in frothy vaporing of cheap newspaper sensational utterance of catch politician who must find audience hearing by method sober possibility of such conflict doe not exist mr coulson listened attentively to word when sir edward have finished withdrew cigar from mouth knocked ash on to corner of writing table be very interesting indeed sir edward declared be very pleased to have heard what have said will repeat to friend on other side who be sure will be exceedingly obliged to for frank exposition of view now continued want to keep gentleman up too late so perhaps will be coming to answer of question answer sir edward exclaimed surely made clear that have said mr coulson admitted have be remarkably clear question asked be what be to be position of country in event of war between japan america have told sir edward declared that war between japan america be not subject within scope of practical politics may consider friend mr jones must certainly consider mr coulson affirmed a good judge a sir edward so far a regard that matter be not asking whether be probable improbable may know feeling of ally know ours may look into future may see sooner later war between country japan be necessity may decide that be better for to fight now than later thing be in cloud only enter into present discussion to extent be not for to sit here say whether war between united state japan be possible impossible what mr jones asks be what must be position if must take place little diatribe with have just favored be exactly reply must have expected to receive formally from downing street be that sort of reply want to take back to mr jones mr smith colleague exchanged glance latter drew chief on one side will excuse for moment know mr coulson said why by mean mr coulson declared time be own be entirely at service if say word will go outside wait be not necessary sir edward answered room be large one two men walked slowly up down mr smith leaning time upon colleague shoulder spoke in undertone what said be inaudible to mr coulson during period of waiting drew cigar from pocket lit from stump of old one then made little more comfortable in chair looked around at wall of handsomely furnished rather sombre apartment with air of pleased curiosity be scarcely perhaps what must have expected from man in similar position in own country be at rate impressive presently came back to time be mr smith who spoke mr coulson said need not beat about bush ask plain question want plain answer then must tell matter be not one concerning can give definite information appreciate position of friend mr jones must like to have met in same spirit a have shown in inquiry may tell that being utterly convinced that japan doe not seek war with that therefore war be likely government be not prepared to answer question consider based upon impossibility if war must come position of country must depend entirely upon right of dispute a corollary to must mention two thing read newspaper mr coulson sure gentleman answered be aware then mr smith continued of present position of fleet know how many month must pas before can reach eastern water be not within tradition of country to evade fulfillment of obligation however severe unnatural may seem in three month time mr coulson treaty with japan will have expired be seeking to renew coulson declared quickly mr smith raised eyebrow renewal of treaty said be on knee of god one can not tell go so far only a to tell that in three month present treaty will have expired mr coulson rose slowly to foot

life prince be satisfied with belongs to race whom understand let alone presume to imagine yourselves superior because doe not conform to pygmy standard of life penelope be standing now slim elegant

duchess smiled come said soothingly must take little affair too seriously be right of one must live according to bringing up prince doubt be a faithful to training instinct a young men of own country be more interesting to compare than to criticise somerfield who for moment have be too angry to speak have now recovered think said stiffly that have better drop subject have idea that miss morse felt
