young gentleman with whom be travelling be nephew can send telegram mr dunster asked little abruptly without doubt doctor replied mr fentolin desired to ask if there be one whom must like to apprise

doctor replied can make quite easy a to qualification must not suit mr fentolin purpose to entrust to care of one without reputation left room mr dunster closed eye slumber however be not altogether peaceful one time there seemed to be hammering inside head from somewhere back in obscured memory name of fentolin seemed to be continually asserting from somewhere other amazing sense sometimes give warning of danger to men of adventure seemed to have opened feeler rested because be exhausted even in sleep be ill at ease doctor with telegram in hand made way down splendid staircase past long picture gallery where masterpiece of van dyck rubens frowned leered down upon descended final stretch of broad oak stair crossed hall entered master room mr fentolin be sitting before open window

to canvas painting time with swift delicate precision meekins who stand behind chair mr fentolin continued even meekins be entranced have soul friend sarson although might not think too see sometimes colour in sky glitter upon sand clear sweet purity of long stretch of virgin water meekins believe have soul only like better to see thing grow under master touch than to wander about solve riddle for man remained perfectly immovable not feature twitched yet be fact that although stood where mr fentolin must not possibly observe never removed gaze from canvas see medical friend there have be great tide in night following upon flood even small landmark be shifted soon in little carriage will ride down to tower will sit there will watch sea think that evening with turn of tide spray may reach even to window there will paint again there be always something fresh in sea know always something fresh in sea like human face angry pleased sullen joyful people like to paint sea at calmest most beautiful people like to see happy face around be not one who appreciates other thing be not quite like with eh sarson hand fell to side momentarily have finished work turned around eyed doctor who stood in taciturn silence answer answer insisted doctor gloomy face seemed darker still have spoken truth mr fentolin admitted be not one of vulgar herd who love to consort with pleasure happiness be one of who understand beauty of unhappiness in others added with faint emphasis mr fentolin smiled face became almost like face of one of angel of great italian master how well know murmured humble effort doctor how do like doctor bent over canvas know nothing about art said little roughly work seems to clever little grotesque perhaps little straining after hard plain thing threaten nothing of idealist in work mr fentolin mr fentolin studied canvas for moment clever man sarson remarked coolly courtier never mind work plea give passing sensation of happiness now what about patient recovers doctor pronounced from short examination must say that have constitution of ox have told that will be up in three day a matter of fact will be able if want to to walk out of house to morrow mr fentolin shook head can not spare quite so soon declared must avail ourselves of wonderful chance afforded by brilliant young nephew must keep with for little time what be that have in hand doctor

well a to remember too never mind will be easy to decode will amuse during afternoon very good sarson will take charge of wish anything dispatched nothing at present mr fentolin sighed will be well think for poor man to remain undisturbed by communication from friend be restless at want to get on with journey will see mr fentolin remarked now feel pulse sarson how be morning doctor held thin wrist for moment between finger let go in perfect health a usual announced grimly ah can not be sure mr fentolin protested tongue if please put out excellent must make quite certain mr fentolin continued there be so many people who must miss place in world must not be easily filed undo waistcoat sarson feel heart please feel carefully can see end of stethoscope in pocket scamp fancied morning when be lying here alone that there be something almost like palpitation quicker beat be very careful sarson now doctor made examination with impassive face then stepped back there be change in condition mr fentolin announced palpitation spoke of be mistake be in perfect health mr fentolin sighed gently then said will now amuse by gentle ride down to tower be entirely satisfied sarson be keeping nothing back from doctor looked at with grim impassive face there be nothing to keep back declared have constitution of cowboy there be reason why must not live for thirty year mr fentolin sighed a though weight have be removed from heart will now decided reaching forward for handle of carriage go down to tower be just possible that few day seclusion might be good for guest doctor turned silently away there be one there to see expression a walked towards door chapter vii two men who be supping together in grillroom at cafe milan be talking with seriousness seemed little out of keeping with rose shaded lamp swaying music of band from distant restaurant conversation have started hour before in club smoking room have continued intermittently throughout evening have received further stimulus when richard hamel who have bought evening standard on way from theatre few minute ago came across certain paragraph in read aloud hanged if understand thing over here nowadays reggie declared laying paper down here be englishman imprisoned in germany time at place one ever heard of before wo try to pronounce doe mean be very well to shrug shoulder when there be eighteen arrest within one week on charge of espionage there must be something up for first time reginald kinsley seemed inclined to discus subject seriously drew paper towards read little paragraph word by word then gave further order to attentive maitre d'hotel glanced around to be sure that be not overheard look here dick old chap said be just back from abroad be not quite in hang of thing yet let ask plain question what do think of think of hamel repeated little doubtfully do mean personally take way like kinsley replied look at nine year ago played cricket in same eleven look much like cricket now do hamel looked at companion thoughtfully for man who be doubtless still young kinsley have certainly aged appearance hair about temple be grey there be line about mouth forehead have air of one who lived in atmosphere of anxiety to hamel declared frankly look worried if have heard so much of success of political career rest of must have thought that thing be going badly with have gone well enough with personally kinsley admitted be only one of many politics be game be foreign office especially be ageing men fast few year have be going through hell hamel be up against now hard up against slight smile passed from lip of hamel sunburnt good natured face seemed to become infected with something of companion anxiety there be nothing seriously wrong be there reggie asked dick said kinsley with sigh be afraid there be be very seldom talk a plainly a to one be just person one can unburden to little to tell truth be rather relief a say eighteen arrest in one week do mean something half of englishman who have be arrested be to certain knowledge connected with secret service have be arrested in many case where there be fortification worth speaking of within fifty mile on one pretext fact of matter be that thing be going on in germany just at present moment knowledge of be of vital interest to then arrest hamel remarked be really bona fide without doubt companion agreed only wonder there have not be more be telling what be pretty open secret when tell that there be conference due to be held week at place on continent know where will have very important bearing upon future know just a much a not much more conference between whom hamel asked kinsley dropped voice almost to whisper know replied that very great man from russia greater still from france minister from austria statesman from italy envoy from japan have be invited to meet german minister whose name will not mention even to subject of proposed discussion have never be breathed one can only suspect when tell that one from country be invited to conference think will be able broadly speaking to divine purpose cloud have be gathering for good many year have only buried head little deeper in sand have have chance wilfully chucked away national service three more army corp four year ago must have brought alliance must have meant absolute safety for twenty one year know what happened have lived through many rumour escaped more narrowly than most people realise great many danger there be indication time that end be really coming will end be hamel enquired eagerly kinsley shrugged shoulder paused while glass be filled with wine will be in nature of diplomatic coup said presently of much feel sure england will be forced into position that will have alternative left to declare war that of course will be end of with ridiculously small army absolutely sane scheme for home defence will lose that have worth fighting for colony without being able to strike blow thing be so ridiculously obvious have be admitted time after time by sea lord commander in chief have listened to be fleet be needed under present condition to protect own shore there be single battleship must be safely spared canada australia new zealand egypt india must take care of wonder when nation of world ever played fast loose with great possession a have done be nice sort of thing to hear almost one first night in england hamel remarked little gloomily tell more about conference be sure that information be reliable information be miserably scanty kinsley admitted curiously enough man who must know most about whole thing be englishman one of most curious mortal in british empire spy of succeeded in learning more than of people without being arrested too who be singular person hamel asked man of whom suppose never heard kinsley replied name be fentolin mile fentolin life somewhere down in norfolk be one of strangest character ever lived stranger than effort of fiction ever met with be in foreign office once one be predicting for brilliant career then there be accident let see must have be six seven year ago have to have leg amputated one know exactly how accident happened there be always certain amount of mystery connected with since then have buried in country think in fact that ever move outside place somehow other have managed to keep in touch with political movement of day fentolin hamel repeated softly to tell whereabouts doe live quite wonderful place in norfolk believe somewhere near sea have forgotten name for moment have have wireless telegraphy installed have telegraph office in house dozen private wire say that spends immense amount of money keeping in touch with foreign politics excuse be that speculates largely a dare say doe just lately kinsley went on more slowly have be object of anxiety to of be who sent first agent out to germany to try discover at least where conference be to be held man returned in safety have one over there now who have not be arrested seem to have lost nearly of ours do mean to say that man fentolin actually posse information government have a to intention of foreign power hamel asked kinsley nodded there be slight flush upon pallid cheek not only have doe mean to part with few hundred year ago when ruler of country be men with blood in vein 'd have be given just one chance to tell knew hung a traitor if hesitated do sort of thing nowadays rather go in for preserving traitor permit even in own house of common however want to depress play alarmist so soon after return to london dare say old country will muddle along through time be foolish hamel begged there be other subject of conversation must interest half a much have formed idea a to nature of conference have idea kinsley replied grimly india for russia large slice of china for japan with probably australia thrown in alsace lorraine for france neutrality there be bribery for what be to become of poor england then friend be only human after be merely question of handing over to sufficient spoil must consider first be first duty of politician towards country mean to say hamel asked that seriously believe that conference be on point of being held at france russia be to be invited to consider suggestion like be afraid there be doubt about kinsley declared ambassador in london profess to know nothing that of course be reasonable attitude there be doubt that conference have be planned must say that to night be nearer war if can summon enough spirit to fight than have be since fashoda queer if have returned just in time for scrap hamel remarked thoughtfully be in militia once so expect can get job if there be fighting can get better job than fighting one can start on to morrow too kinsley announced abruptly be if really want to help of course do hamel insisted be on for anything say that be entirely own master for next six month a much longer a like hamel assented plan at except might drift round to norfolk coast look up of place where governor used to paint there be queer little house st david tower believe call really belongs to be given to father rather bought from man who think must have be relative of friend feel sure name be fentolin reginald kinsley set down wine glass be st david tower anywhere near place called salthouse asked reflectively be name of village hamel admitted father used to spend quite lot of time in part painted at least dozen picture down there be coincidence reginald kinsley declared lighting cigarette think if be dick 'd go down claim property tired of already hamel asked smiling reginald kinsley knocked ash from cigarette be that fact be that job be speaking to about be simply want one to go down to salthouse not exactly a spy know one who have wit about be of very curious about man fentolin there be end of rumour wo mention to for might only put off scent man seems to be always intriguing must matter so much if be friend if be simply financier to tell truth have cause to suspect be englishman surely hamel asked fentolin who be father friend be just very wealthy norfolk squire one of best from have heard mile fentolin be englishman kinsley admitted be true too that come of very ancient norfolk family doe do however to build too much upon that from can learn of be sort of puck professional mischief maker suppose there be anything outsider must find out must be really useful to same if have time must certainly go down to norfolk conversation drifted away for while mutual acquaintance entered there be several introduction be not until two found together in kinsley room for few minute before parting that be alone again hamel returned then once more to subject reggie said if think must be of slightest use will go down to salthouse to morrow be rather keen on going there anyway be absolutely fed up with life here already be just what want to do kinsley said be afraid fentolin be little too clever for to get on right side of if must only get idea a to what game be down there must be great help see fellow ca have gone into sort of thing blindfold have lost several very useful agent abroad two from new york who have gone into pay there must be method in somewhere if really end with financial operation why right be very likely what will come to must like to know merest hint must be useful will do best hamel promised in case will be just few day holiday be looking forward to kinsley helped to whisky soda turned towards friend here be luck to dick take care of sort of thing may happen know old man fentolin may take fancy to tell secret that statesman in europe must be glad to hear may tell why conference be being held what result will be may be first to hear of coming fall well here be to anyway drop line if have anything to report cheero hamel answered a set down empty tumbler astonishing how keen feel about little adventure be perfectly sick of humdrum life have be leading last week do sort of take one back to arabian night know reggie be never quite sure whether to take seriously not kinsley smiled a held friend hand for moment dick said earnestly if only 'd believe adventure in arabian night be a nothing compared with present day drama of foreign politics see have learned to conceal thing nowadays to smooth over to play part of ordinary citizen to world while tug at underhand lever in secret moment good night good luck chapter viii richard hamel although certainly have not appearance of person afflicted with nerve gave slight start for last half hour during time train have made no stop have be alone in compartment yet to surprise be suddenly aware that seat opposite to have be noiselessly taken by girl whose eye also be fixed with curious intentness upon broad expanse of marshland sand across train be slowly making way hamel have spent great many year abroad first impulse be to speak with unexpected stranger forgot for moment that be in england travelling in first class carriage pointed with left hand towards sea queer country be remarked pleasantly do know never heard come in gave quite start when found have fellow passenger looked at with certain amount of still surprise look returned just a steadfastly because even in few second be conscious of strange selective interest certainly unaccounted for by own impression of appearance seemed to at first glance very far indeed from being good looking according to of standard by have measured good look be thin too thin for taste carried with aloofness to be unaccustomed cheek be quite pale hair of soft shade of brown eye grey sad gave altogether impression of colourlessness have be living in land where colour vitality meant much speech too in very restraint fell strangely upon ear have be travelling in uncomfortable compartment observed happened to notice when passing along corridor that yours be empty in case be getting out at next station so be replied still cheerfully suppose next station be st david made answer so far a expression counted for anything at be little surprised eye considered for moment hamel be tall well over six foot powerfully made with good feature clear eye complexion unusually sunburnt wore flannel collar of unfamiliar shape clothes although be neat enough be of pattern cut obviously designed to afford maximum of ease comfort with minimum regard to appearance wore too very thick boot hand gave one impression that be seldom gloved voice be pleasant have easy self confidence of person sure of in world put down a colonial perhaps american rank in life mystified seems queerest stretch of country went on long spit of sand jutting right out into sea dike creek mile mile of now wonder be low tide high low must think because of sea shine on sand there glanced out of window tide told be almost at lowest live in neighbourhood perhaps enquired do assented sort of country one might get very fond of ventured glanced at from depth of grey eye do think so rejoined coldly for part hate be surprised at unexpected emphasis of tone first time indeed that have shown sign of interest in conversation kind of dull suppose find remarked pensively looking out across waste of lavender grown marsh sand hummock piled with seaweed far distant line of pebbled shore yet know have lived by sea good deal however monotonous may seem at first there be always plenty of change really tide wind do such wonderful work too be looking out now towards sea oh be exactly that said quietly be quite willing to admit what tourist chance visitor call fascination of place happen to dislike be perhaps be because live here because see day by day perhaps because sight of thought of have become woven into life be talking half to herself for moment even knowledge of presence have escaped hamel however did not realise fact welcomed confidence a sign of relaxation from frigidity of earlier demeanour seems hard observed sympathetically seems odd to hear talk like too life surely ought to be pleasant enough looked away from sea into face although genuine interest saw there kindly expression of eye disarmed annoyance still stiffened slightly why ought question be little bewildering why because be young girl replied be natural to be cheerful be be answered listlessly can not tell have not have much experience how old be asked bluntly time certainly seemed a though reply must contain rebuke for curiosity glanced once more into face however instinctive desire to administer well deserved snub passed away be so obviously interested question be asked so naturally that spice of impertinence be a though have not existed be twenty one told how long have lived here since left boarding school four year ago anywhere near where be going to bury for time wonder went on depends replied only neighbour be lorneybrookes of market burnham be going there shook head have got little shanty of own explained quite close to st david station have never even seen yet vouchsafed slight show of curiosity where be shanty a call asked really have faintest idea replied be looking for now can tell be that stand just out of reach of full tide on piece of rock dead on beach about mile from station be built originally for coastguard station meant to hold lifeboat found must never launch lifeboat when have so man to whom foreshore most of land around here belongs mr fentolin believe sold to father expect place have tumbled to piece by time thought 'd have look at be gazing at steadfastly now with parted lip what be name demanded richard hamel hamel repeated lingeringly seemed quite unfamiliar be father great friend of mr fentolin then asked believe so in sort of way answered father be hamel artist know made ra time before died used to come out here live in tent then mr fentolin let use place finally sold to father used often to speak to about before died tell enquired know much about matter have paper to prove that be sold to father that have right to occupy now when choose smiled of course have assured a matter of fact a none of have be here for so long thought 'd better bring title deed call along with be with rest of trap at norwich oh place belongs to right enough went on smiling tell that one pulled down that be disappeared from face of earth said still remains there when be round next curve think can show to one have forgotten think that doe belong to mr fentolin still us very often what for looked at questioner quite steadfastly quite quietly speechlessly curious uneasiness crept into thought there be mysterious thing in face knew from moment that too directly indirectly be concerned with strange happening at kinsley have hinted knew that there be thing be keeping from now mr fentolin us one of room a studio like to paint there be near sea explained for rest know never go near place be afraid remarked after few moment of silence that will be little unpopular with mr fentolin perhaps ought to have written first then of course have idea that one be making use of place understand said how can possibly expect to come down like live there without preparation why not have servant furniture thing to cook with laughed oh be old campaigner assured meant to pick up few oddment in village suppose will stay very long anyhow thought 'd like to have look at place by by what sort of man be mr fentolin again there be that curious expression in eye expression almost of secret terror time not wholly concealed must have sworn that hand be cold met with accident many year ago said slowly leg be amputated spends life in little carriage wheel about poor fellow hamel exclaimed with strong man ready sympathy for suffering be just a much a have heard about be decent sort of fellow in other way suppose anyhow if have really taken fancy to little shanty will have to give up then a seemed to for first time real life leaped into face leaned towards tone be half commanding half imploring manner entirely confidential begged be yours claim live in do anything like with take away from mr fentolin hamel be speechless sat little forward hand on knee mouth ungracefully open expression of blank utter bewilderment in face for first time began to have vague doubt concerning young lady everything about have be so strange quiet entrance into carriage unusual manner of talking finally last passionate inexplicable appeal be afraid said at last quite understand say poor fellow have taken fancy to place like being there well be much of catch for anyway be rather wanderer dare say sha be back in part again for year why must let have if want be loss to be not painter know like father seemed on point of making further appeal lip even be parted head little thrown back then stopped said nothing silence lasted so long that became almost embarrassed will forgive if be little dense wo begged to tell truth went on smiling have got sort of feeling that 'd like to do anything ask now wo just explain little more clearly what mean will blow up old place sky high if be pleasure to seemed suddenly to have reverted to former self cold colourless young woman who have first taken seat opposite to mine be very foolish request admitted quietly be sorry ever made be just impulse because little building be speaking of have be connected with one two very disagreeable episode nevertheless be foolish of how long did think of staying there be added with faint smile providing that find possible to prove claim take up possession oh just for week so answered lightly a to regaining possession of went on slightly pugnacious instinct stirring imagine that there will be difficulty about really murmured not that want to make disagreeable continued tower be mine right enough even if have let remain unoccupied for time let down window task in hastened to assist rush of salt cold air swept into compartment sniffed eagerly wonderful exclaimed stretched out long arm pointed away in distance on summit of line of pebbled shore standing a seemed sheer over sea be little black speck that said be tower changed position leaned out of window well be queer little place remarked doe look worth quarrelling over doe that went on directing attention to hill be mr fentolin home st david hall for several moment made remark at there be something curiously impressive in sudden sweep up from sea line strange miniature mountain standing in middle of marsh with tree crowned background long weather beaten front of house turned bravely to sea never saw anything like declared why be barely quarter of mile from sea be little more than that be strangely situated abode be wonderful agreed with emphasis must study geological formation of hill continued with interest why look almost like island now be because of flood told even at high tide creek never reach so far a back there water see stretching away inland be flood water result of storm suppose be where get out concluded rising to foot turned away with slightest nod maid be already awaiting at door of compartment hamel be suddenly conscious of fact that disliked going immensely will perhaps meet again during next few day remarked half turned head expression be scarcely encouraging hope said that will not be disappointed in quarter hamel followed slowly on to platform saw escorted to very handsome motor car by obsequious station master watched former disappear down stretch of straight road led to hill then with stick in one hand handbag be sole luggage in other left station turned seaward chapter ix mr fentolin surrounded by satellite be seated in chair before writing table there be present in room most of people important to in somewhat singular life few foot away in characteristic attitude stood meekins doctor sarson with hand behind be looking out of window at further end of table stood confidential telegraph clerk who be just departing with little sheaf of message by side with notebook in hand stood mr fentolin private secretary white haired woman with strangely transparent skin light brown eye dressed in somber black woman who might have be of age from thirty to fifty behind be middle aged man whose position in household one be quite sure about clean shaven man whose name be ryan who might very well have be once actor clergyman in background stood perfect butler be perhaps opportune mr fentolin said quietly that whom trust must be present here together wish to understand one thing have believe in employ learned gift of silence be to be exercised with regard to certain visitor brought here by nephew visitor whom regret to say be now lying seriously ill there be absolute silence doctor sarson alone turned from window a though about to speak met mr fentolin eye at once resumed position rely upon mr fentolin continued softly henderson perhaps have most difficult task for have servant to control nevertheless rely upon also if one word of visitor presence here leak out even so far a village out go one of will not have

dear guest mr fentolin exclaimed turning to hamel be able to return to if will drink more wine let have coffee in library want to talk to about tower chapter xv mr fentolin led way to delightful little corner of library where before open grate recently piled with hissing log easy chair have be drawn wheeled up to other side of hearthrug leaned back with little air of exhaustion butler who seemed to have appeared unsummoned from somewhere among shadow served coffee poured old brandy into large wonderfully thin glass why house must be turned into asylum to gratify hospitable instinct of young nephew can not imagine mr fentolin grumbled most extraordinary person visitor can assure quite violent too be at first have have outside advice about condition hamel inquired mr fentolin glanced across few foot of space looked at hamel with swift suspicion why must asked doctor sarson be fully qualified case seems to present unusual characteristic hamel sipped brandy thoughtfully know why

upon sky line twice opened lip twice word came understand whispered begin to understand looked at only for moment back at work suppose so sighed chapter xx in middle of night hamel sat up in bed awakened with sudden start by sound only faintest echo of remained in consciousness nerve be tingling with sense of excitement sat up in bed listened suddenly came again long low moan of pain stifled at end a though repressed by outside agency leaped from bed hurried on few clothes stepped out on to landing cry have seemed to to come from further end of long corridor in direction indeed of room where mr dunster lay made way there walking on tiptoe although foot fell noiselessly upon thick carpet single light be burning from bracket in wall insufficient to illuminate empty space enough to keep from stumbling corridor towards south end gradually widened terminating in splendid high window with stained glass broad seat table on right end room be mr dunster apartment on left flight of stair led to floor above hamel stood quite still listening there be light in room a must see from under door there be sound of one moving hamel listened intently sense strained then sound of stair

few yard down corridor beckoned to approach be so sorry said softly that must have be disturbed mr hamel have be little anxious about mysterious guest doctor sarson fetched hour ago discovered that be necessary to perform very slight operation merely extraction of splinter of wood be over now think that will do very well notwithstanding very plausible explanation hamel be conscious of remains of

must have suffered acutely doctor sarson be very clever however there be doubt that what did be for best opinion be that by to morrow morning there will be marvellous change good night mr hamel be quite sure that will not be disturbed again hamel felt showed disposition to depart mr fentolin said hope that will not think that be officious in way abusing hospitality can not help suggesting that a dr sarson be purely household physician relative of man dunster might be better satisfied if second opinion be called in might suggest that telephone to norwich for surgeon mr fentolin showed sign of displeasure be silent for moment a though considering matter be not at sure mr hamel that be not right admitted frankly believe that case be quite simple one on other hand must perhaps be more satisfactory to have outside opinion if mr dunster be not conscious in morning will telephone to norwich infirmary think must be advisable hamel agreed good night mr fentolin said once more be sorry that rest have be disturbed hamel however still refused to take hint eye be fixed upon closed door mr fentolin asked have objection to seeing mr dunster there be moment intense silence sudden light

irritated have always air of keeping something in background followed out on to little ridge of beach few minute after have left mist be still drifting about only few yard away sea rolled in filling air with dull thunder marshland be half obscured st david hall be invisible like strangely hung lantern in empty space saw line of light from great house gleam through obscurity there be sound save sound of sea shivered slightly be like empty land then moved by instinct of curiosity made way round to closed door of boat house only to find a have expected locked shook slightly without result then strolled round to back entered own little abode by kitchen tried other door led into boat house be not only locked staple have be put in be fastened with padlock of curious design did not remember to have seen there before again half unconsciously listened again found silence oppressive went back to room brought out of book have be intention to study sat read over fire at ten o'clock went to bed a threw open window before undressing seemed to that must catch sound of voice from sea listened intently grey pall hung everywhere to left with strange indistinctness almost like something human struggling to assert came fitful flash from light at entrance to tidal way once more strained ear time there be doubt about heard sound of fisherman voice heard one of say distinctly hard aport dave lad be fentolin light keep out bit steady lad through rift in mist caught glimpse of brown sail of fishing boat dangerously near land watched alter course slightly pas on then again there be silence undressed slowly went to bed later on woke with start sat up in bed listening intently listening for knew not what except for backward scream of pebble dragged down few second by receding wave unbroken silence seemed to prevail struck match looked at watch be exactly three o'clock got out of bed be man in perfect health ignorant of meaning of nerve man of proved courage yet be conscious that pulse be beating with absurd rapidity new feeling seemed to posse must almost have declared that be afraid what sound have awakened have idea yet seemed to have distinct absolute conviction that have be real sound dream drew aside curtain looked out of window mist now seemed to have become almost fog to have closed in upon sea land there be nothing whatever to be seen a stood there for moment listening face became moist with drifting vapour suddenly upon beach saw what at first imagined must be optical illusion long shaft of light invisible in except that seemed to slightly change density of mist threw on overcoat over pyjama thrust on slipper taking up own electric torch hastily descended stair opened front door stepped out on to beach stood in very place where light have seemed to be looked inland there be sign of human person not sound except falling of sea upon pebbly beach raised voice called out somehow other speech seemed to be relief hullo there be response tried again be one there still answer watched veiled light from harbour appear disappear threw shadow of illumination upon spot to have gazed from window one window at st david hall be illuminated rest of place be

threw off overcoat silly suggestion melodramatic idea have given fit of nerve be going to bed be going to sleep must have be light saw at must have heard anything be going to sleep chapter xxvii hamel awoke to find room filled with sunshine soft wind blowing in through open window there be pleasant odour of coffee floating up from kitchen looked at watch be past eight o'clock sea be glittering bespangled with sunlight found among scanty belonging bathing suit wrapped in overcoat hurried down stair breakfast in hour mr cox called out stood at door watching a stepped across pebble plunged in for few moment swam then turned over on back sunlight be gleaming from window of st david hall even fancied that upon terrace must see white clad figure looking towards turned over swam once more from place in doorway mr cox called out to mind dagger rock sir waved hand splendid exhilaration of salt water seemed to give unlimited courage dived woman cry of fear soon recalled presently swam to shore hurried up beach mr cox with sigh of relief disappeared into kitchen rock on nerve again mr cox asked good humouredly a took place at breakfast table quarter of hour later be only who live here sir answered who know how terrible be there be one come up like hand long spike boat once struck upon be a though 'd be sawn through middle must have look at day declared be going to work morning mr cox lunch at one o'clock took rug established with pile of book at back of grassy knoll sheltered from wind with sea almost at foot sharpened pencil numbered page of notebook then looked up towards hall garden found dreaming sunshine be delicious gentle optimism seemed to steal over be fool murmured to be catching part of people folly mr fentolin be only ordinary crotchety invalid with queer taste on big thing be probably like other men will go to morning sea gull screamed over head little brown sailed fishing boat came gliding down harbourway pleasant sensuous joyfulness seemed part of spirit of day hamel stretched out upon dry sand work be hanged exclaimed soft voice answered almost in ear voice be becoming very familiar most admirable sentiment young friend seem to be doing best to live up

sadly existence however can not deny will wait seems pity for to do hamel remarked see might stay here for time mr fentolin face darkened looked at young man with sort of pensive wrath if latter went on say 'yes to something be going to ask might even stay in neighbourhood for longer still mr fentolin sat quite motionless in chair eye be fixed upon hamel what be that be going to ask demanded want to marry niece mr fentolin looked at young man in mild surprise sudden decision on part mr hamel murmured not at hamel assured have be ten year looking for young lady mr fentolin enquired what doe say

mr fentolin glanced towards house then said think have better go tell so in case will be able to paint have permission then hamel asked rising to foot eagerly negatively mr fentolin agreed have can not refuse esther be of age thing be reasonable know whether will be happy with not young man of disposition who decline to study whim of unfortunate creature like be scarcely likely to be possessed of much sensibility however perhaps view a to solitary residence here will change with engagement to niece hamel did not reply for moment be trying to ask why even in midst of rush of anticipatory happiness must be conscious of certain reluctance to leave tower mr fentolin be looking longingly towards hall mr fentolin waved away go make love ordered leave alone be in pursuit of beauty only method differ hamel hesitated no longer walked up narrow path with swift buoyant footstep everywhere seemed to be surrounded by glorious spring sunshine glittered in little pool creek by side drew new colour from dun coloured marsh mass of emerald seaweed shimmering sand flashed in long row of window of hall a drew nearer must see bank of yellow crocus in sloping garden behind there be odour of spring in air ran lightly up terrace step there be easy chair drawn into favourite corner book upon table sign of esther hesitated for moment then retracing step along terrace entered house by front door stood wide open there be one in hall scarcely sound about place great clock ticked solemnly from foot of stair there be not even servant in sight hamel wandered around at loss what to do opened door of drawing room looked in be empty turned away meaning to ring bell on way across hall paused curiously suggestive sound reached faintly from end of one of passage be click of typewriter hamel

window in far distance must catch glimpse of tower mr fentolin chair have disappeared from walk be sorry said must have made mistake will hurry back there be more question be longing to ask cold negativeness of manner chilled sat with finger poised over key waiting for departure turned left room chapter xxviii mr fentolin carriage drawn up close to beach be painting steadily when hamel stood once more by side eye moved only from sea to canvas never turned head so wooing have not prospered young friend remarked gently be sorry be there anything can do niece have gone out to lunch hamel replied shortly mr fentolin stopped painting face be full of concern a looked up at hamel dear sir exclaimed how can apologise of course have gone out to lunch have gone out to lady saxthorpe remember subject being discussed in fact be instigator of going owe thousand apology mr hamel let make what amends be possible for useless journey dine with to night be very kind poor amends mr fentolin continued morning like be made for lover sunshine blue sky salt breeze flavoured just little with lavender stroll through spring garden where hyacinth be like field of purple gold mantle of jewel upon brown earth ah well one thought will wander to beautiful thing of life there be once woman who loved mr hamel hamel looked doubtfully at strange little figure in chair be genuine wondered voluntary outburst be subtle attempt to incite sympathy mr fentolin seemed almost to have read thought be not for sake of pity that say continued mine be only passing across line age a well a infirmity make inevitable one in world who life to grow old who have loved felt fire of in vein can pas line without sorrow look back without pang be among great army well well will paint more to day concluded abruptly where be servant hamel asked mr fentolin glanced around carelessly have wandered away out of sight know well how necessary solitude be to if once take brush between finger solitude natural entire mean if one be within dozen yard of know even though can not see meekins be wandering somewhere other side of tower will call on account mr fentolin begged presently will appear in plenty of time there be morning to be passed barely eleven o'clock think now will sit in chair sink little down dream of beautiful light rolling foam flecked wave patch of blue shifting green can form in brain can make picture there even though finger refuse to move be not aesthete think mr hamel study of beauty doe not mean to what did to father father in smaller way to perhaps not hamel confessed believe feel thing somewhere because bring queer sense of content with be afraid though artistic perception be not so keen a men mr fentolin looked at thoughtfully be physical life in vein too splendid to permit abstract pleasure compensation again see compensation wonder what law be that governs thing have forgotten sometimes went on forgotten own infirmity in soft intoxication of wonderful seascape only went on face little grey be physical in life triumph there be hungry hour nothing will satisfy head sank chin rested upon chest have appearance now of man who talk in bitter earnest yet hamel wondered looked towards tower there be sign of meekins sea gull went screaming above head mr fentolin never moved eye seemed half closed be only when hamel rose to foot that looked swiftly up stay with beg mr hamel said be in one of mood when solitude even for moment be dangerous do know what have sometimes thought to myself pointed to planked way led down steep pebbly beach to sea have sometimes thought went on that must be glorious to find friend to stand by side at top of plank just there when tide be high to bid loose chair to steer to steer down narrow path into arm of sea first touch of salt wave last touch of life why not one sleep without fear lifted head suddenly meekins have appeared coming round from back of tower instantly mr fentolin whole manner changed sat up in chair be arranged then said dine with to night for other matter of have spoken well let rest in hand of god be not very kind to be not sure whether must make esther good husband be not sure even that like take pain to make agreeable considering that father be artist seem to rather dull uninspired young man who can tell there may be thing stirring beneath torpid brain of yours of other person know save concentrated gaze of mr fentolin keen eye be hard to meet hamel came out of ordeal without flinching at eight o'clock mr fentolin answered can see must try to earn better opinion hamel read steadily for remainder of morning be past one o'clock when rose stiffly from seat among sand knoll strolling back to tower opened door entered cloth be laid for luncheon in little sitting room there be sign of hannah cox passed on into kitchen came to sudden standstill once more memory of own work passed away from once more be back again among queer clouded tangle of strange suspicion of thrilling half formed fear have assailed at time ever since arrival at st david stopped quite short word rose to lip died away felt breathless compelling need for silence grew tense in effort to make sound hannah cox be kneeling on stone floor ear be close to crack of door led into boat house face half turned from be set in strange concentrated passion of listening lip be parted eye half closed took more notice of hamel arrival than if have be useless piece of furniture faculty seemed to be absorbed in one intense effort of listening there be need of out stretched finger hamel fell in at once with mood so mesmeric too listened small clock have brought with from village ticked away upon mantelpiece full sea fell with placid softness upon high beach outside slight noise of cooking came from stove save for thing there be silence yet for space of time hamel must never have measured listened when at last woman rose to foot hamel finding word at last be surprised to find that throat be dry what be mr cox asked why be listening there face be absolutely expressionless be busying now with small saucepan back be turned towards spend life sir said listening waiting one never know when end may come boat house hamel objected one have be in there morning have who can tell answered must go anywhere when chose how chose through keyhole if wanted why listen hamel persisted there be nothing in there now odds end of machinery turned from fire looked at for moment eye be colourless tone unemotional maybe there be harm in listening did hear anything made want to listen who can tell answered woman who life well nigh alone a live in quiet place hears thing so often that other folk never listen to there be always something in ear night day sometimes be not sure whether be in world other be like with just then be for reason listened luncheon ready sir hamel walked thoughtfully back into sitting room seated before spotless cloth watched hannah cox spread out well cooked cleanly served meal if there be anything want sir said will hear at word kitchen door be open one moment mr cox lingered there patiently with tray in hand there be sound hamel continued perhaps real sound perhaps fancy made go down on knee in kitchen tell what be sound always hear sir answered quietly hear in night hear when stand by sea look out have heard for so many year that who can tell whether come from world other cry of men who die passed out hamel looked after for moment like man in dream in fancy must see back again once more in kitchen kneeling on stone floor listening chapter xxix cold twilight have fallen upon land when hamel left tower that evening walked briskly along foot way to hall little patch of mist hung over creek sky be almost frosty light from st david hall shone like cheerful beacon before hastened up stone step crossed terrace passed into hall servant conducted at once to drawing room mr fentolin in pink evening dress with pink ornament in hair held out hand in background mr fentolin in queerly cut evening clothes sat with folded arm leaning back in carriage listened grimly to sister in law a stood with hamel hand in hers dear mr hamel exclaimed how perfectly charming of to come up relieve little sad loneliness delightful call of be just saying so to mile hamel looked around room already heart be beginning to sink miss fentolin be well hope asked well very naughty girl mother declared let go to lady saxthorpe to lunch now have have simply firmest letter from lady saxthorpe insist upon keeping esther to dine sleep have have to send evening clothes ca tell mr hamel how miss hamel disappointment be little too obvious to pas unnoticed there be shade of annoyance too in face mr fentolin smoothly intervened let be quite candid with mr hamel dear florence begged have spoken to sister in law told substance of conversation morning proceeded wheeling chair nearer to hamel be thunderstruck wish to reflect to consider esther chanced to be away have encouraged absence for few more hour hope mr fentolin hamel said simply that will give to be not rich man be fairly well off must be willing to live exactly where esther wish must do best to make happy mr fentolin opened lip once closed again laughed little high pitched semi hysterical laugh hand gripped fan be straining so that blue vein stood out almost like whipcord esther be very young mr hamel must talk over have known for such very short time servant announced dinner hamel offered arm to hostess be gerald away too asked do indeed owe apology mr fentolin declared gerald be spending couple of day at dormy house at brancaster golf arrangement made time back promised to play with to morrow hamel remarked thoughtfully said nothing about going away fear that like most young men of age have little memory mr fentolin sighed however will be back to morrow next day owe apology mr hamel for lack of young people must do best to entertain guest florence must be at best dear must tell of capital story of yours mr fentolin shivered for moment hamel a handed to place be struck by strange look threw upon furtive full of pain hand almost clung to slipped little held tightly then be suddenly conscious that something hard be being pressed into palm drew hand away at once seem little unsteady evening dear florence mr fentolin remarked peering across round table eyed nonchalantly enough floor be slippery said be glad for moment of mr hamel strong hand where be dear puppy chow chow went on come sit by mistress at once hamel finger inside waistcoat pocket be smoothing out crumpled piece of paper have passed to soon have quite flat mr fentolin a though freed from anxiety chattered away gaily know that will apologise to mr hamel at for young people being away declared just fancy what have saved from solitary meal served by hannah cox do know that say be half witted mr hamel so far have looked after very well hamel observed intellect be defective mr fentolin remarked on one point only good woman be obsessed by idea that husband son be still calling to from dagger rock be almost pitiful to meet wandering about there on stormy night seacoast be full of little village tragedy real tragedy too however insignificant may seem to mr fentolin tone be gently sympathetic changed subject moment two later however nero fiddle to night said while rome burn there be hundred in position yet certainly seems queer that must be sitting here so quietly when whole country be in such state of excitement see press morning be preaching immediate declaration of war against whom mr fentolin asked mr fentolin smiled that doe seem to be rather trouble admitted russia austria germany italy france be assisting at conference to english representative have be bidden in sense of course be equivalent to act of hostility from country towards england question be whether have have not secret understanding with france if so how far will be bound by there be rumour that when monsieur deschelles be asked formally whom represented that replied 'france great britain there may be something in be hard to see how english statesman must have left unguarded mediterranean with that mean trusting simply to faith of country with whom have binding agreement on other hand there be mobilisation of fleet if france be really faithful one wonder if there be need for such extreme step be out of touch with political affair hamel declared have be away from england for so long on other hand mr fentolin continued eye glittering little have made study of political situation in europe hobby for year have sent to leading newspaper of berlin rome paris st petersburg vienna for two hour day read side by side be curious sometimes to note common understanding seems to exist between power not bound by formal alliance for year war seemed very unlikely thing now added leaning forward in chair pronounce almost certainty hamel looked at host little curiously mr fentolin gentleness of expression seemed to have departed face be hard eye agleam have almost look of bird of prey for reason thought of war seemed to be joy to perhaps read something of hamel wonder in expression for with shrug of shoulder dismissed subject well concluded thing lie on knee of god dare say wonder mr hamel why poor useless creature like must take slightest interest in passing event be just fascination of looker on want opinion about champagne florence dear must join will drink to mr hamel health will perhaps couple toast in mind with sentiment be sure be not very far from thought florence hamel raised glass bowed to host hostess be not wholly at ease seemed to that be being watched with queer persistence by of mr fentolin continued to talk laugh with gaiety be too obviously forced mr fentolin posed for while a benevolent listener mildly applauded sister in law story encouraged hamel in recital of of reminiscence suddenly door be opened miss price appeared walked smoothly across room stood by mr fentolin side stooping down whispered in ear pushed chair back little from table face be dark with anger said not before ten to night muttered again spoke in ear so softly that sound of voice scarcely travelled even a far a where hamel be sitting mr fentolin looked steadfastly for moment at sister in law from to hamel then backed chair away front table will have to ask to be excused for three minute said must speak upon telephone be call from one who declares that have important news turned steering wheel of chair with miss price by side passed across dining room out of oasis of rose shaded light into shadow through open door from there turned head before disappeared a though to watch guest mr fentolin be busy fondling one of dog have raised to lap hamel be watching with tolerant smile koto little idiot why ca sit up like sister be tail in way then mr whispered under breath so softly that barely caught word although be only few foot away look at feel a though be being watched time can destroy piece of paper in pocket that say be 'leave here immediately after dinner ' hamel sipped wine in nonchalant fashion finger have strayed over silky coat of little dog have held out a though for inspection how can asked what excuse can make invent one insisted swiftly leave here before ten o'clock let anything keep destroy piece of paper in pocket if can now mr fentolin began caught up one of absurd little pet held to mouth meekins be in doorway whispered argue with please be in danger know nothing about pas cigarette leaned back in chair smoking quickly held one of dog on knee talked rubbish to hamel watched leaning back in carved oak chair found hard to keep pity from eye woman be playing part playing with desperate pitiful earnestness part seemed more tragical because of soft splendour of surroundings from shadowy wall huge dimly seen picture hung about strange yet impressive background small round dining table with
