humiliation have be piqued that must not answer eager question of own party a to two people subsequently wolfenden inquiry thought very soon at rate name must be known to be in sense consolation rest must be easy until knew about meant to conceal so far a possible own interest chapter ii drama of pavement pitch of conversation have risen higher still mingled with intermittent popping of cork striking of match blue wreath of cigarette smoke be curling upwards delicate feeling of abandon be making felt amongst roomful of people music grew softer a babel of talk grew in volume whole environment became tinged with faint genial voluptuousness densham be laughing over foible of mutual acquaintance wolfenden leaned back in chair smoking cigarette sipping turkish coffee eye scarcely left for moment girl who sat only few yard away from trifling with certain dainty indifference with little dish one after other have be placed before removed have taken pain to withdraw from discussion in friend be interested wanted to be quite free to watch to be certainly most wonderful creature have ever seen in one of most trifling action seemed possessed of original curious grace even way held silver fork toyed with serviette raised glass to lip set down again little thing seemed to to accomplish with peculiar wonderful daintiness of conversation between companion there be evidently very little did appear to expect be enjoying supper with moderation minute care for trifle denote epicure only spoke to between course on other hand appeared to be eating scarcely anything at last however waiter set before dish in be evidently interested wolfenden recognised pink frilled paper smiled be human enough then to care for ice bent over shrugged shoulder turning to waiter who

owl time felt hot uncomfortable veritable schoolboy at thought plunged into conversation between harcutt densham conversation have be sustaining with effort too be still a interested in neighbour although position at table made difficult for to observe closely when three men be thinking intently of something else be not easy to maintain intelligent discussion wolfenden to create diversion called for bill when have paid be ready to depart densham looked up with little burst of candour be wonderful exclaimed softly marvellous wolfenden echoed wonder who on earth can possibly be harcutt said almost peevishly already be being robbed of part of contemplated satisfaction be true that must probably find man name on table list at door have sort of presentiment that girl personality must elude question of relationship between man girl puzzled propounded problem discussed with bated breath there be likeness at be there relationship be significant that although harcutt be scandalmonger wolfenden somewhat of cynic discussed with most profound respect relationship after of sort there must be what be be harcutt who alone suggested what to wolfenden abominable possibility scarcely husband wife must think said thoughtfully yet one never can tell involuntarily three glanced towards man be well preserved little imperial short grey moustache be trimmed with military precision yet hair be almost white age must scarcely be le than sixty in way be quite a interesting a girl eye underneath thick brow be dark clear feature be strong delicately shaped hand be white very shapely finger be rather long wore two singularly handsome ring set with strange stone by side of table rested stick upon have be leaning during passage through room be of smooth dark wood polished like malacca cane set at top with curious green opalescent stone a large a sparrow egg eye of three men have in turn be arrested by in electric light fell softly upon upper part of stone seemed to burn glow with peculiar iridescent radiance evidently be precious possession for once when waiter have offered to remove to stand at other end of room man have stopped sharply drawn little closer towards wolfenden lit fresh cigarette gazed thoughtfully into little cloud of blue smoke husband wife repeated slowly what absurd idea more likely father daughter how about rose harcutt remarked father doe not a rule show such excellent taste in flower have finished supper suddenly girl stretched out left hand took glove from table wolfenden smiled triumphantly have wedding ring exclaimed softly then harcutt for first time made remark for be never altogether forgiven remark other men received in chilling silence may may not be matter for congratulation said twirling moustache one never know wolfenden stood up turning back upon harcutt pointedly ignoring let go densham said be almost last a matter of fact movement be made at exactly right time must scarcely have left room at same moment a two people in whom manifestly have be taking so great interest by time have sent for coat hat from cloak room harcutt have coolly scrutinised table list found together in little group at head of stair wolfenden who be few step in front drew back to allow to pas man leaning upon stick laid hand upon girl sleeve then looked up at man addressed wolfenden directly have better precede sir said progress be unfortunately somewhat slow wolfenden drew back courteously be in hurry said please go on man thanked with one hand upon girl shoulder with other on stick commenced to descend girl have passed on without even glancing towards have twisted white lace mantilla around head feature be scarcely visible only a passed wolfenden received general impression of rustling white silk lace foaming tulle a gathered skirt together at head of stair seemed to too that somewhat close atmosphere of vestibule have become faintly sweet with delicate fragrance of white rose hung by loop of satin from wrist three men waited until have reached bend of stair before began to descend harcutt then leaned forward name whispered be disenchanting be mr sabin whoever heard of mr sabin yet look like personage at door there be delay be raining fast departure be little congested three young men still kept in background densham affected to be busy lighting cigarette wolfenden be slowly drawing on glove place be almost in line with girl must see diamond flashing in fair hair through dainty tracery of drooping white lace in moment through slight change in position must get better view of face than have be able to obtain even in supper room be beautiful there be doubt about there be many beautiful woman in london whom wolfenden scarcely pretended to admire girl have something better even than supreme beauty be anything reproduction be new type have originality hair be dazzlingly fair eyebrow delicately arched be high distinctly dark in colour head be perfectly shaped feature seemed to combine delightful piquancy with somewhat statuesque regularity wolfenden wondering of what in manner reminded suddenly thought of old french miniature have stopped to admire only day two before in little curio shop near bond street there be distinct dash of something foreign in feature carriage might have be french austrian be most certainly not anglo saxon crush became little le moved step two forward wolfenden glancing carelessly outside found attention immediately arrested just a have be watching girl so be man who stood on pavement side by side with commissionaire watching companion be tall thin apparently dressed in evening clothes for though coat be buttoned up to chin wore opera hat hand be thrust into loose pocket of overcoat face be mostly in shadow once however followed motion of mr sabin moved head little forward wolfenden started looked at fixedly be fancy be there indeed something clenched in right hand there gleamed like silver be steel in momentary flash of passing carriage light wolfenden be puzzled there be something too seemed to vaguely familiar in man figure person be certainly waiting for somebody to judge from expression mission be pleasant one wolfenden who through latter part of evening have felt curious unwonted sense of excitement stirring blood now felt go tingling through vein have subtle prescience that be on brink of adventure glanced hurriedly at two companion of have noticed fresh development just then commissionaire who knew wolfenden by sight turned round saw standing there stepping back on to pavement called up brougham be waiting little way down street carriage lord said to wolfenden touching cap wolfenden with ready presence of mind shook head be waiting for friend said tell man to pas on yard two man bowed danger of leaving before two people in whom interest now be becoming positively feverish be averted a if to enhance singular thing now happened interest suddenly became reciprocal at sound of wolfenden voice man with club foot have distinctly started changed position leaning forward looked eagerly at eye remained for moment two fixed steadily upon there be doubt about fact singular in though be wolfenden noticed so did densham harcutt before remark must pas between little coupe brougham have drawn up man girl started forward wolfenden followed close behind feeling prompted to do so be curious one seemed to afterwards that have even at time conviction that something unusual be about to happen girl stepped lightly across carpeted way entered carriage companion paused in doorway to hand silver to commissionaire then too leaning upon stick stepped across pavement foot be already upon carriage step when suddenly what wolfenden have be vaguely anticipating happened dark figure sprang from out of shadow seized by throat something glittered like streak of silver in electric light flashed upwards blow must certainly have fallen for wolfenden be only person not wholly unprepared for something of sort be consequently not paralysed into inaction a be others be so near too that single step forward enabled to seize uplifted arm in grasp of iron man who have be attacked be next to recover raising stick struck at assailant violently blow missed head grazed temple fell upon shoulder man released from wolfenden grasp by convulsive start went staggering back into roadway there be rush then to secure be too late wolfenden half expecting attack have not moved from carriage door commissionaire although powerful man be not swift like cat man who have made attack sprang across roadway into garden fringed embankment commissionaire loiterer followed just then wolfenden felt soft touch on shoulder girl have opened carriage door be standing at side be one hurt asked quickly one answered be over man have run away mr sabin stooped down brushed away grey ash from front of coat then took match box from ticket pocket re lit cigarette have be crumpled in finger hand be perfectly steady whole affair have scarcely taken thirty second be probably lunatic remarked motioning to girl to resume place in carriage be exceedingly obliged to sir lord wolfenden believe added raising hat for intervention matter might really have be serious permit to offer card trust that day may have better opportunity of expressing thanks at present will excuse if hurry be not of nation share antipathy with hate row stepped into carriage with farewell bow drove off at once wolfenden remained looking after with hat in hand from embankment below came faint sound of hurrying footstep chapter iii warning of felix three friend stood upon pavement watching little brougham until disappeared round corner in flickering glitter of light must have be in accordance with precedent if after leaving restaurant have gone to one of club to smoke cigar drink whisky apollinaris while harcutt retailed latest society gossip densham descanted on art wolfenden contributed genial remark upon thing in general to night three be inclined to depart from precedent perhaps surprising incident have just witnessed made anything like normal routine seem unattractive whatever reason may have be young men be of sudden not in sympathy with one harcutt murmured conventional lie about having engagement supplemented with quite unconvincing statement about pressure of work concluded with obviously disingenuous protest against tyranny of profession of journalism then sprang with alacrity into hansom said goodbye with good deal le than usual cordiality densham too hailed cab leaning over apron delivered of farewell speech sounded rather malignant be lucky beast wolfenden growled enviously adding with note of venom in voice forget take more than first game to win rubber then be whirled away nodding head wearing expression of wisdom deeply tinged with gloom wolfenden be surprised not exactly sorry that first vague expression of hostility have be made by others of must be confoundedly hard hit murmured to never knew densham turn nasty before to coachman said aloud may go home dawson be going to walk turned on to embankment conscious of curious sense of exhilaration be blase cynic uniformly easy life tends to become just trifle monotonous lord wolfenden somewhat epicurean mind derived actual pleasure from subtle luxury of new sensation what have said of friend must have said with equal truth of be confoundedly hard hit for first time in life found mere memory of woman thrilling whole nature vibrated in response to appeal made to walked along buoyantly under star revelling in delight of being alive suddenly stopped abruptly huddled up in corner of seat be man with cloth cap pulled forward screening face at moment lord wolfenden be in mood to be extravagantly generous to poor applicant for alms lavishly sympathetic to tale of distress be not ordinary curiosity arrested progress now knew almost at first glance who be that sat in dejected attitude although opera hat be replaced by soft cloth cap in other detail man appearance be altered be indeed mr felix who have supped with at milan subsequently behaved in so astonishing fashion knew that be recognised sat up looking steadfastly at wolfenden although lip trembled eye gleamed wildly across temple bright red mark be scored lord wolfenden broke silence be nice sort of fellow to ask out to supper what in name of be wonderful be trying to do must have thought be sufficiently obvious man replied bitterly tried to kill failed well why call police be quite ready will not run again wolfenden hesitated then sat down by side of surprising individual man went for did seem to care so see why must why do want to kill to keep vow other answered how why made will not tell how did escape wolfenden asked abruptly probably because did care whether escaped not felix replied with short bitter laugh stood behind shrub just inside garden watched hunt go by then came out here sat down sound very simple said wolfenden trifle sarcastically may ask what be going to do next felix face so clearly intimated that might not ask anything of kind that if did curiosity must not be satisfied that wolfenden felt compelled to make apology forgive if seem inquisitive find situation little unusual be guest see have not be for chance invitation might not have met that man at then again have not be for interference must have be dead now must have be in fair way to be hanged felix evinced sign of gratitude for wolfenden intervention instead said intensely oh fool fool well really wolfenden protested see why felix interrupted yes be fool repeated because saved life be old man now wonder how many there have be in course of long life who desired to kill one not one solitary human being have ever befriended come to rescue in time of danger without living to be sorry for so will be with will live to be sorry for what have done to night will live to think must have be far better for to fall by hand than for to suffer at will wish passionately that have let die before heaven wolfenden swear that be true man be so much in earnest passion be so quietly intense that wolfenden against will be more than half convinced be silent suddenly felt cold buoyant elation of mind in have started homewards vanished leaving anxious heavy perhaps just little afraid did what man must do for one else said almost apologetically be instinctive a matter of fact that particular man be perfect stranger to have never seen before be quite possible that will never see again felix turned quickly towards if believe in prayer said go down on knee where be pray a have never prayed for anything before that may not see again there have never be man woman yet who have not be worse for knowing be like pestilence walketh in darkness poisoning one be in way of horrible infection wolfenden pulled together there be doubt about companion earnestness be earnestness of unbalanced mind language so exaggerated a be out of keeping with time place tell more about suggested who be wo tell felix answered obstinately well then who be lady know be quite enough for to know that be companion for moment intend to be communicative can see

three distinct separate reason why must take life of good three mean why must do have not be only victim there be plenty of others who have heavy reckoning against know what be to carry life in hand bear charmed existence did see stick yes said wolfenden did have peculiar stone in handle in electric light looked like huge green opal felix assented moodily be struck with stick must not part with for anything be given by indian fakir be said that while carry be proof against attack who say so wolfenden inquired never mind said felix be enough that be said relapsed into silence when next spoke manner be different excited vehemence have gone there be nothing in voice demeanour inconsistent with normal sanity yet word be le charged with deep intention know much about lord wolfenden said beg to take advice be offering one ever gave better in life avoid man a must avoid plague go away before look up to thank for what did go abroad anywhere farther better stay away for ever if be only mean of escaping friendship even acquaintance lord wolfenden shook head be very ordinary matter of fact englishman said leading very ordinary matter of fact life must forgive if consider such sweeping

anybody be afraid of nobody man can not have anything to gain by injuring believe said did not know lady lady felix repeated know anything of beyond fact that be with for time being be quite sufficient for wolfenden got up thanks said lazily only asked for fact a for suggestion will be well advised not to repeat oh exclaimed felix scornfully how blind pig headed english people be have told something of man reputation what can hers be do suppose if will sup alone with in public restaurant good night said wolfenden will not listen to word felix rose to foot laid hand upon lord wolfenden arm lord wolfenden said be very decent fellow do try to believe that be only speaking for good that girl wolfenden shook off if allude to young lady directly indirectly said very calmly will

breakfasted before eleven be riding in park perhaps have faint hope of seeing there something of two people in whom be now greatly interested if so be certainly disappointed looked with new curiosity into face of girl who galloped past be careful even to take particular notice of few promenaders did not see anything of mr sabin companion at twelve o'clock returned to room exchanged riding clothes for ordinary garb of west end even looked on hall table a passed out again to see if there be note card for must scarcely look up just yet at rate reflected a walked slowly along piccadilly for did not even ask for address took whole thing so coolly that perhaps doe not mean even to call nevertheless looked in rack at club to see if there be anything against name tore into piece few unimportant note found there with impatience scarcely deserved of few acquaintance whom met there inquired casually whether knew anything of man named sabin one seemed to have heard name before even consulted

follow home last night harcutt densham exchanged quick glance wolfenden have asked question quietly be evidently what have come to know yes harcutt said did be evidently people of consequence went

where a rule guest make up in respectability what lack in brilliancy a to relationship wolfenden said be quite prepared to take for granted for one never doubted that harcutt remarked be because be young little quixotic when have lived a long a have will doubt everything will take nothing for granted unless desire to live for ever amongst ruin of shattered enthusiasm if be wise will always assume that swan be goose until have proved to be swan be very cheap cynicism wolfenden remarked equably be surprised at harcutt thought that be more in touch with time know to day nobody be cynical

doubt to be so now more than ever yet must not understand going away like tone of note so far a be concerned be most satisfactory thing must have happened relieved of responsibility scarcely knew how to deal with in face of dismissal from deringham assistance might have accepted from must naturally have be open to misapprehension that must have gone away have written to in strain be directly

about eleven suppose quarter past mr sabin said stepping into cab may go to theatre hansom drove off wolfenden stood on pavement hat in hand what fortune must scarcely believe in then just a turned to move on something lying at foot almost at edge of kerbstone attracted attention looked at more closely be ribbon little delicate strip of deep blue ribbon knew quite well whence must have come have fallen from gown a have stepped into hansom looked up down street be full saw one whom knew thing must be done in minute stooped quickly down picked up crushing in gloved hand walking on at once with heightened colour general sense of having made fool of for moment two be especially careful to look to right to left then sense that one from other side of road be watching drew eye in direction young man be standing upon edge of pavement peculiar smile parting lip cigarette between finger for moment wolfenden be furiously angry then eye of two men met across street wolfenden forgot anger

then crossed street stood side by side with felix upon pavement be glad to see that be looking sane man again wolfenden said after have exchanged usual greeting might have be in much more uncomfortable place after last night escapade felix shrugged shoulder think said that if have succeeded little discomfort must only have amused be not pleasant to fail wolfenden stood squarely upon

permitted usual good natured grumble at wolfenden for dilatoriness in choice of profession did not once refer to subject of own weakness until dessert have be served when passed claret to wolfenden without filling own glass will excuse not joining said to son have still three four hour writing to do such work a mine requires very clear head can understand daresay wolfenden assented in silence for first time perhaps fully realised ethical pity of seeing man so distinguished victim of hopeless incurable mania watched sitting at head of table courteous gentle dignified noted too air of intellectual abstraction followed upon last speech in seemed to dwell for rest of time during sat together instinctively knew what disillusionment must mean for sooner anything than that must never be never repeated firmly to a smoked solitary cigar later on in empty smoking room happens must be saved from that there be knock at door in response to invitation to enter mr blatherwick came in wolfenden who be in humour to prefer one society to own greeted pleasantly wheeled up easy chair opposite to own come to have smoke blatherwick said that be right try one of cigar governor be right be in such shocking condition mr blatherwick accepted one with hesitation puffed slowly at with air of great deliberation be young man of mild demeanour deportment clerical aspiration wore thick spectacle suffered from chronic biliousness be much obliged to lord wolfenden said seldom smoke cigar be not good for sight occasional cigarette be permit wolfenden groaned inwardly for regalia be priceless not to be replaced said nothing have taken liberty lord wolfenden mr blatherwick continued of bringing for inspection letter received morning be presume intended for practical joke need not

having reference to coast defence navy of great britain writer be engaged upon somewhat similar task not having have facility accorded to lord deringham be without one two important particular service required of be supplying of for be offered one thousand pound a man of honour may possibly hesitate to at once embrace offer need not lord deringham work be practically useless for be work of lunatic from intimate association with must know that statement be true will never be able to give coherent form to mass of statistic information have collected therefore do harm in supplying few particular to one who will be able to make use of sum be offered be out of proportion to value few month delay must easily be acquired by writer without expenditure of single halfpenny that however be not point be rich have time to spare hence offer take that be man of common sense take for granted therefore that will not hesitate to accept offer acquiescence will be assumed if lunch at grand hotel cromer between one two on thursday following receipt of letter will then be put in full possession of information necessary to carrying out of proposal made to be well known to writer who will take liberty of joining at table letter ended thus somewhat abruptly wolfenden who have only glanced through at first now re read carefully then handed back to blatherwick be very curious communication said thoughtfully very curious communication indeed know what to think of mr blatherwick laid down cigar with air of great relief must have liked to have thrown away dared not must surely be intended for practical joke lord wolfenden said that correspondent have be ludicrously misinformed consider then that father work be of value at wolfenden asked mr blatherwick coughed apologetically watched extinction of cigar by side with obvious satisfaction must be sure prefer said that gave perfectly straightforward answer to question er can not conceive that work upon lordship be engaged can be of slightest interest use to anybody can assure lord wolfenden that brain at time reel positively reel from extraordinary nature of manuscript father have passed on to to copy be not that be merely technical be absolutely entirely meaningless ask for opinion lord wolfenden conceive to be duty to answer honestly be quite sure that lordship be not in fit state of mind to undertake serious work person who wrote that letter wolfenden remarked thought otherwise person who wrote that letter mr blatherwick retorted quickly if indeed be written in good faith be scarcely likely to know so much about lordship condition of mind a who have spent greater portion of day for three month with do consider that father be getting worse mr blatherwick wolfenden asked week ago mr blatherwick said must have replied that lordship state of mind be exactly same a when first came here there have be change for worse during last week commenced with sudden be bound to say unfounded suspicion of miss merton whom believe to be most estimable worthy young lady mr blatherwick paused appeared to be troubled with slight cough smile wolfenden be not altogether able to conceal seemed somewhat to increase embarrassment extraordinary occurrence of last night ladyship have probably detailed to mr blatherwick continued be next development of what fear can only regard a downright insanity regret having to speak so plainly be afraid that milder phrase must be inapplicable be very sorry to hear wolfenden remarked gravely under circumstance mr blatherwick said picking up cigar be now extinct immediately laying down again trust that lady deringham will excuse not giving customary notice of desire to leave be of course impossible for to continue to draw er stipend such a be in receipt of for service so ludicrously inadequate lady deringham will be sorry to have go wolfenden said must put up with little longer must much prefer to leave mr blatherwick said decidedly be not physically strong must confess that lordship attitude at time positively alarm fear that there be doubt that committed unprovoked assault last night upon unfortunate keeper there be er telling whom might select for next victim if quite convenient lord wolfenden must like to leave to morrow by early train oh ca go so soon a wolfenden said how about letter can take step think proper with regard to mr blatherwick answered nervously personally have nothing to do with thought of going to spend week with aunt of mine in cornwall must like to leave by early train to morrow wolfenden must scarcely keep from laughing although be little annoyed look here blatherwick said must help little before go there be good fellow doubt for moment what say about poor old governor condition of mind at same time be rather odd thing be that own sudden fear of having work stolen be followed up by receipt of letter to there be one at rate who place very high value upon manuscript must say must like to know whom that letter came from can assure mr blatherwick said have not faintest idea of course have wolfenden assented little impatiently see how easy will be for to find out must go to grand hotel on thursday for lunch meet mysterious person must very much rather not mr blatherwick declared promptly must feel exceedingly uncomfortable must not like at look here wolfenden said persuasively must find out who wrote that letter can only do so with help need only be there will come up directly have marked man who come to table presence be be required will take a favour if will allow to make present of fifty pound note mr blatherwick flushed little hesitated have brother sister whose bringing up be terrible strain upon slim purse of father country clergyman great deal must be done with fifty pound be against conscience a well a inclination to remain in post where duty be farce be different sighed be very generous lord wolfenden said will stay until after thursday there be good fellow wolfenden said much relieved have cigar mr blatherwick rose hastily shook head must excuse if please said will not smoke more think if will not mind wolfenden turned to window held up hand listen said be that carriage at time of night carriage certainly be passing by window in moment heard draw up at front door one alighted odd time for caller wolfenden remarked mr blatherwick did not reply too be

however that might call on way back to cromer if must kindly let see lord deringham must be glad a opinion must be of material assistance to wilmot reputation a greatest living authority on case of partial mania be doubtless known to a never under circumstance visit patient outside london must be great pity to lose opportunity in great haste begging to excuse scrawl be dear lady deringham yours sincerely john whitlett p will please not offer fee wolfenden folded up letter returned well suppose be all right said be odd time though to call on errand of sort so thought lady deringham agreed dr whitlett explanation seems perfectly feasible doe not said that must consult will come in see wolfenden followed mother into drawing room tall dark man be sitting in corner under palm tree in one hand held magazine picture of seemed to be studying with aid of eyeglass other be raised to mouth be in act of indulging in yawn when wolfenden mother entered room be son lord wolfenden said dr franklin

such a understand lord deringham indulges in have devoted great deal of time to real imaginary work in connection with be generally able from study of work to tell how far brain be weakened if at in what manner can be strengthened be only crudest outline of theory to be brief can give opinion a to lord deringham mental condition advice a to maintenance if will place before latest work upon have be engaged hope have made clear perfectly wolfenden answered sound very reasonable very interesting be afraid that there be few practical difficulty in way in first place father doe not show work portion of to one on other hand take most extraordinary precaution to maintain absolute secrecy with regard to that dr wilmot remarked be rather bad feature of case be difficulty must imagine must get over though must easily frame excuse to get away from study for short time leave there of course affair be in hand altogether be presuming that be anxious to have opinion a to father state of health be not in habit of seeking patient added little stiffly be interested in friend whitlett description of case anxious to apply theory to a happens to differ in respect from anything have met with lately further may add continued glancing at clock if anything be to be done must be done quickly have time to spare have better wolfenden suggested stay here for night in case will send to station into cromer a early a like in morning absolutely impossible dr wilmot replied briefly be staying with friend in cromer have consultation in town early to morrow morning must really make up mind at once whether wish for opinion not think lady deringham said that need hesitate for moment about wolfenden looked at doubtfully there seemed to be possibility of anything advantage in accepting offer yet in sense be sorry that have be made in case must attach special importance to father manuscript dr wilmot remarked with note of sarcasm in tone might add that be not at necessary for to be alone in study wolfenden felt little uncomfortable under older man keen gaze neither did altogether like having thought read so accurately suppose said turning to mother must manage to get away from library for short time must at least try answered will think said that a dr wilmot have be good enough to go out of way to call here must make effort lady deringham left room dr wilmot whose expression of absolute impassiveness have not altered in least during discussion turned towards wolfenden have said never seen of father manuscript have never explained scheme of work to wolfenden shook head know central idea answered weakness of navy coast defence be about know father even when be admiral on active service took absolutely pessimistic view of may perhaps remember lord of admiralty used to consider believe one great thorn in side dr wilmot shook head have never taken interest in such matter said profession have be completely absorbing during last ten year wolfenden nodded remarked that used to read newspaper wonder why on earth father took such pain to try frighten everybody be altogether changed now even avoids subject although be quite sure that be one engrossing thought be certain that one have ever given such time concentrated energy to before if only work be work of sane man must understand being very valuable not least doubt about must say dr wilmot replied carelessly door opened lady deringham reappeared have succeeded said be upstairs now will try keep there for hour wolfenden will take dr wilmot into study dr wilmot rose with quiet alacrity led way

scarcely yet dry many others be scattered about almost undecipherable with marginal note correction in father handwriting pushed of towards companion can help said seems to be most recent work dr wilmot seemed scarcely to hear have turned lamp up with quick finger be leaning over freshly written page decidedly be interested in case stood quite still reading with breathless haste paper seemed almost to fly through finger wolfenden be little puzzled mr blatherwick who have be watching proceeding with blank amazement rose came over towards will excuse lord wolfenden said if admiral must come

into eye answered bravely must not admit defeat hope that be not said will never regret chapter xx from dim world wolfenden be in particularly cheerful frame of mind when few moment after half hour be up mr sabin appeared upon pavilion tee followed by tall dark young man carrying bag of golf club mr sabin on other hand be inclined to be sardonically cheerful handicap remarked be two mine be one suppose play level ought to make good match wolfenden looked at in surprise did say one mr sabin smiled yes give one at pau cannes foot interferes very little with walking upon turf same expect will find easy victim here will drive just here dumayne added pointing to convenient spot upon tee with head of driver not too much sand where did get caddie wolfenden asked be not one of ours be mr sabin shook head found on link in south of france answered be only caddie ever knew who must make decent tee so take about with valet a well that will do nicely dumayne mr sabin expression suddenly changed body a though by instinct fell into position scarcely altered stand inch from position have first taken up wolfenden who have expected half swing be amazed at wonderfully lithe graceful movement with stooped down club flew round shoulder clean true ball flew off tee in perfectly direct line capital drive only little short of two hundred yard master servant watched critically fairly well hit ball think dumayne mr sabin remarked got quite clean away sir man answered have run very well though will find little near far bunker for comfortable second will carry right mr sabin said quietly wolfenden also drove long ball with little slice have to play odd caught top of bunker hole fell to mr sabin in four strolled off towards second teeing ground be staying down here for long mr sabin asked wolfenden hesitated be not sure said be rather oddly situated at home at rate will probably be here a long a be not sure about mr sabin said think that be going to like link if so will not hurry away forgive if be inquisitive reference to home affair be presume in connection with father health be very sorry to hear that be looked upon now a confirmed invalid wolfenden assented gravely did not wish to talk about father to mr sabin on other hand mr sabin be politely persistent doe not presume receive visitor said a left tee after third drive never wolfenden answered decisively suffers good deal in various way apart from that be very much absorbed in collection of statistic connected with hobby of doe not see even oldest friend mr sabin be obviously interested many year ago said met father at alexandria be then in command of victoria must perhaps scarcely recollect now at time made promise to visit if ever be in england must be yes surely must be nearly fifteen year ago be afraid wolfenden remarked watching flight of ball after successful brassy shot that must have forgotten about by now memory have suffered good deal mr sabin addressed own ball from bad lie sent flying hundred fifty yard with peculiar jerking shot wolfenden watched with envy must have wonderful eye remarked to hit ball with full swing lying like nine men out of ten must have taken iron mr sabin shrugged shoulder did not wish to talk golf be about to remark said that father have then reputation of impressed a being best informed man with regard to english naval affair with whom ever conversed be considered authority believe wolfenden admitted what particularly admired about mr sabin continued be absence of cocksureness sometimes be afraid almost blind judgment of great naval officer have heard even discus possibility of invasion of england with utmost gravity admitted that be far from improbable father view wolfenden said have always be pessimistic a regard actual strength of navy coast defence believe used to make great nuisance at admiralty have ceased now suppose mr sabin remarked to take much interest in matter can scarcely say that wolfenden answered interest however have ceased to be official daresay have heard that be in command of channel fleet at time of terrible disaster in solent retired almost immediately afterwards fear that health will never altogether recover from shock there be short intermission in conversation wolfenden have sliced ball badly from sixth tee mr sabin having driven a usual with almost mathematical precision way for few minute lay apart came together however on putting green have short walk to next tee be very creditable half to mr sabin remarked approach wolfenden admitted be lucky one be very fine shot mr sabin insisted spin helped of course be justified in allowing for especially a seem to play most of mashie shot with cut be talking about oh remember of course be about father solent catastrophe admiral deringham be not concerned with actual disaster in way be wolfenden shook hand thank god no said emphatically admiral marston be dearest friend saw go down with six hundred of men be so close that even shouted farewell to one must have be terrible shock mr sabin admitted wonder have suffered from now have spoken of think remember reading about retirement sad thing for man of action a always be doe remain in norfolk year round never leaf deringham hall wolfenden answered used to make short yachting cruise until last year be over now be twelve month since stepped outside own gate mr sabin remained deeply interested have occupation beyond hobby of spoke asked ride shoot little suppose like rest of country gentleman then for first time wolfenden began to wonder dimly whether mr sabin have purpose of own in so closely pursuing thread of conversation looked at keenly at moment attention seemed altogether directed to dangerous proximity of ball tall sand bunker throughout interest have seemed to be fairly divided between game conversation have initiated none le wolfenden be puzzled must scarcely believe that mr sabin have real personal interest in father on other hand be not easy to understand persistent questioning a to occupation doings last inquiry carelessly though be asked be direct one seemed scarcely worth while to evade father have special interest answered slowly be engaged now upon work connected with profession indeed mr sabin exclamation suggested curiosity be not wolfenden purpose to gratify remained silent game proceeded without remark for quarter of hour wolfenden be now three down with stimulus of strong opponent set to recover lost ground ninth hole won with fine long putt mr sabin applauded heartily drove from next tee walked together after ball lay within few yard of one be very much interested mr sabin remarked in what have be telling about father confirms rather curious story about lord deringham heard in london few week ago be told forget by whom that father have devoted year of life to wonderfully minute study of english coast defence naval strength informant went on to say that forgive be said quite openly know whilst on general matter father mental health be scarcely must be desired work in connection with two subject be of great value struck a being very singular very interesting case wolfenden shook head dubiously informant be misled be afraid said father take hobby very seriously of course humour a regard value of work be afraid be worthless have tested mr sabin asked have only seen few page wolfenden admitted be wholly unintelligible chief authority be own secretary who be giving up excellent place simply because be ashamed to take money for assisting in work declares to be utterly hopeless be man mr sabin remarked whom can trust suppose judgment be not likely to be at fault there be not faintest chance of declared be very simple good hearted little chap tremendously conscientious what friend told by bye reminds of rather curious thing happened yesterday wolfenden paused there did not seem however to be reason for concealment companion be evidently deeply interested man called upon wolfenden continued with letter purporting to be from local doctor here gave name a franklin wilmot celebrated physician know explained that be interested in new method of treating mental complaint be very plausible explained everything unusual about visit most satisfactorily wanted sight of work on father be engaged after talking over introduced into study during father absence from promised to give general opinion upon case treatment whilst be there doctor drove up in hot haste letter be forgery man impostor wolfenden glancing towards mr sabin a finished story be surprised at latter imperfectly concealed interest lip be indrawn face seemed instinct with certain passionate finely controlled emotion only slight hiss of breath gleam of black eye betrayed what happened asked did secure fellow wolfenden played long shot waited whilst watched run of ball then turned towards companion shook head be great deal too clever for that sent out to meet whitlett when got back have shown clean pair of heel got away through window did take away paper with mr sabin asked may have taken loose sheet two wolfenden said nothing of consequence think have time think that must have be object altogether must scarcely have suggested remaining with in study mr sabin drew quick little breath played iron shot played very badly be most extraordinary occurrence remarked what be man like did seem like ordinary thief wolfenden shook head decidedly not in least declared be well dressed manner be excellent have appearance of man of position completely imposed upon mother how long be in study before dr whitlett arrived mr sabin asked barely five minute be odd mr sabin seemed positively relieved mr blatherwick asked where be time who wolfenden asked in surprise mr blatherwick father secretary mr sabin repeated coolly understood to say that name be blatherwick remember mentioning name at wolfenden said vaguely disturbed mr sabin addressed ball with care played deliberately on to green then returned to subject think that must have done said suavely must scarcely have known be in room time wolfenden answered mr sabin drew little breath be there when fellow bolted wolfenden nodded why did not try to stop wolfenden smiled physically remarked must have be impossibility blatherwick be small man exceedingly nervous one be honest little fellow be afraid must not have shone in encounter of sort mr sabin be on point of asking question wolfenden interrupted scarcely knew why wanted to get away from subject be sorry that have ever broached come said be talking too much let play golf be sure put off last stroke mr sabin took hint be silent be on eleventh green bordering on far side be open road sea road followed coast for mile two then turned inland to deringham wolfenden preparing to putt heard wheel close at hand a stroke be critical one for stood back from ball till vehicle have passed glancing carelessly up saw own blue livery mother leaning back in barouche with word of apology to opponent started forward to meet coachman who have recognised pulled up horse in middle of road wolfenden walked swiftly over to carriage side mother appearance have alarmed be looking at yet past cheek be pale eye be set distended one of hand seemed to be convulsively clutching side of carriage nearest to have appearance of woman who be suddenly face to face with terrible vision wolfenden looked over shoulder quickly must see nothing more alarming in background than figure of opponent who with back partly turned to be gazing out to sea stood at edge of green on slightly rising ground figure be outlined with almost curious distinctness against background of air sky have anything fresh happened mother wolfenden asked with concern be afraid be upset be looking for shook head struck that be endeavouring to assume composure assuredly did not posse there be nothing fresh naturally be not well be hoping that drive will do good be enjoying golf very much wolfenden answered course have really be capitally kept be having close match who be opponent wolfenden glanced behind carelessly mr sabin have thrown several ball upon green be practising long putt fellow named sabin answered one must be likely to be interested in come down from london play remarkably fine game rather saturnine looking personage be be most unpleasant looking man lady deringham faltered white now to lip where did meet here in london in london wolfenden explained rather curious meeting be too fellow attacked coming out of restaurant one night interfered just in time have taken little house down here be alone lady deringham asked have niece living with wolfenden answered be very charming girl think that must like last word added with something of effort indifference be palpably assumed lady deringham however did not appear to notice at have more to do with than can help wolfenden said leaning little over to speaking in half fearful whisper think face be awful wolfenden laughed be not likely to see great deal of declared in fact ca say that seems very cordially disposed towards considering saved from rather nasty accident by bye said something about having met admiral at alexandria have never come across suppose sun be warm wind have dropped wolfenden must almost have declared that mother teeth be chattering eye be fixed again in rigid stare passed by travelled beyond looked over shoulder mr sabin apparently tired of practising be standing directly facing leaning upon putter be looking steadfastly at lady deringham not in least rudely with faint show of curiosity smile in way improved appearance slightly parting lip meeting gaze wolfenden looked away with odd feeling of uneasiness be right said face be really handsome one in way certainly be not prepossessing looking lady deringham have recovered leaned back amongst cushion did ask said whether have ever met man can not remember certainly be at alexandria with father so perhaps did will be home to dinner nodded of course how be admiral to day remarkably well asked for just before came out will see at dinner wolfenden said perhaps will let smoke cigar with afterwards stood away from carriage lifted cap with smile coachman touched horse barouche rolled on wolfenden walked slowly back to companion will excuse leaving said be afraid that mother might have be looking for by mean mr sabin answered hope that did not hurry on account be trying added to recollect if ever met lady deringham at time of life one reminiscence become so chaotic looked keenly at wolfenden who answered after moment hesitation lady deringham be at alexandria with father so be just possible said chapter xxi harcutt inspiration wolfenden lost match upon last hole nevertheless be finely contested game when mr sabin proposed round on following day accepted without hesitation did not like mr sabin better in fact be beginning to acquire deliberate distrust of something of fear with other people regarded have already communicated to wolfenden without having shadow of definite suspicion with regard to man character be inclined to resent interest in state of affair at deringham hall mr sabin have undoubtedly manifested at same time be helene guardian so long a occupied that position wolfenden be not inclined to give up acquaintance parted in pavilion wolfenden lingering for few minute half hoping that might receive sort of invitation to call at mr sabin temporary abode perhaps under circumstance be scarcely possible that such invitation must be given although have be wolfenden must certainly have accepted for have idea of at once relinquishing hope a regard helene be naturally sanguine be very much in love there be something mysterious about other engagement of have be told have idea for mr sabin unexpected appearance helene must have offered larger share of confidence be content to wait for have ridden over from home left horse in hotel stable a passed hall familiar figure standing in open doorway hailed glanced quickly up stopped short be harcutt who be standing there in norfolk tweed suit thick boot of men in world exclaimed in blank surprise what in name of be wonderful be doing here harcutt answered with certain doggedness almost a though resented wolfenden astonishment know why must look at a though be ghost said if come to might ask same question what be doing here oh be at home wolfenden answered promptly be down to visit people be only mile two from here to deringham hall harcutt dropped eyeglass laughed shortly be wonderfully filial of sudden remarked of course have other reason for coming none at wolfenden answered firmly came because be sent for be complete surprise to to meet mr sabin here at least must have be if have not travelled down with niece coming be simply stroke of luck for harcutt assumed more amiable expression be glad to hear said thought that be stealing march on there really be not necessity for interest clash in least be different between poor old densham be given up of own accord sailed for india yesterday poor old chap wolfenden said softly must not tell suppose even at last what be that have heard about people must not tell harcutt answered sent message to wished to remind that have be friend for fifteen year be not likely to deceive be leaving country said because have certain definite information concerning girl made absolutely hopeless for to think of advice to be to do same doubt densham wolfenden said slowly doubt information came from woman who have be densham friend then again what may seem insurmountable obstacle to may not be so to nothing vague in shape of warning will deter well harcutt said have given densham message responsibility concerning be ended a know own interest lie in different direction now want few minute conversation with hotel room be little too public be in hurry can walk up down drive with once twice can spare hour very well wolfenden said must prefer to do more walking just yet come sit down here be cold chose seat looking over sea harcutt glanced carefully around there be possibility of being overheard indeed be there one in sight be developing fresh instinct harcutt said a crossed leg lit cigarette be here must like to understand purely in professional capacity want help dear fellow wolfenden said understand if when say professionally mean a journalist why what on earth in place can there be worth chronicling there be scarcely single person known to society in neighbourhood mr sabin be here harcutt remarked quietly wolfenden looked at in surprise might have accounted for presence here a private individual said professionally how on earth can interest interest professionally very much indeed harcutt answered wolfenden be getting puzzled mr sabin interest professionally repeated slowly then have learnt something mr sabin have identity other than own suspect to be harcutt said slowly most important interesting personage have learnt little concerning be here to learn more be convinced that be worth while have learnt anything wolfenden asked concerning niece absolutely nothing harcutt answered decidedly may a well repeat that interest be in man alone be not sentimental person at niece be perhaps most beautiful woman have ever seen in life be with thought of have taken up investigation having assured of want to know if will help must speak little more plainly wolfenden said be altogether too vague what help do want for what purpose mr sabin harcutt said be engaged in great political scheme be in constant anxious communication with ambassador of two great power affect secrecy in movement name by be known be without doubt assumed one much have learnt for certain own idea be too vague yet for to formulate can not say more except believe to be deep in design be certainly not for welfare of country be assurance of justifies in exercising certain espionage upon movement justifies also wolfenden in asking for assistance position wolfenden remarked becomes little difficult whoever man sabin may be nothing must induce to believe ill of niece must take part in anything likely to do harm will understand better harcutt when tell that few hour ago asked to be wife asked what to be wife refused harcutt looked at for moment in blank amazement who refused mr sabin niece did did mr sabin know position did understand that be future earl of deringham without doubt wolfenden answered drily in fact mr sabin seems to be pretty well up in genealogy have met father once told harcutt with natural selfishness of man engaged upon favourite pursuit quite forgot to sympathise with friend thought only of bearing of strange happening upon quest remarked disposes once for of suggestion that people be ordinary adventurer if one wolfenden said be ever idiotic enough to entertain possibility of such thing may add that from first have have almost to thrust acquaintance upon especially so far a mr sabin be concerned have never asked to call upon here in london morning when found with niece be quietly furiously angry be never worth while harcutt said to reject possibility until have tested proved what say however settle one be not adventurer in sense of word now will answer few question may be just a much to advantage a to mine to go into matter wolfenden nodded can ask question at rate said will answer if can young lady did refuse from personal reason man can always tell know have impression from answer that be more force of circumstance than objection to prompted negative have put bluntly know what mean wolfenden did not answer for nearly minute be gazing steadily seaward recalling with swift effort of imagination word have passed between must even hear voice see face with soft dark eye so close to be luxury of recollection will admit said quietly that what suggest have already occurred to if have not must be much more unhappy than be at moment to tell honest truth be not content with answer rather manner of must have have hope of inducing to at rate modify for mr sabin unexpected appearance about at least there be hesitation said meant be what imagined might be case harcutt said thoughtfully want to have think that imagine disrespect to young lady see that mr sabin must stand towards one in equivocal position else must be in altogether different station of life to assumed one when dismiss subject of alliance with so peremptorily wolfenden flushed up to temple eye be lit with fire may dismiss idea of former possibility said with ominous quietness if wish to discus matter with further will be particularly careful to avoid faintest allusion to have never seriously entertained harcutt assented cheerfully too believe in girl look at once too proud too innocent for association of such thought with have bearing manner of queen granted then that dismiss first possibility absolutely for ever wolfenden said firmly may add that mr sabin met with distinct reason for refusal informed niece be already betrothed that may may not be true harcutt said doe not affect question be considering at present must come to conclusion that be people of considerable importance be what honestly believe now what do suppose brings mr sabin to out of way hole a golf very likely wolfenden said be magnificent player harcutt frowned if thought so said must consider journey here wasted one ca be in midst of delicate important negotiation know a much a that must not come down here at time to play golf be absurd idea really see how else can explain wolfenden remarked greatest men have have hobby know need not remind of nero fiddle drake bowl quite unnecessary harcutt declared briskly frankly believe in mr sabin golf there be somebody something down here connected with scheme golf be subterfuge play well because doe everything well will tax ingenuity wolfenden said to connect visit here with anything in shape of political scheme ingenuity accepts task at rate harcutt said be going to find out about must help will be for interest be afraid wolfenden answered that be on wild goose chase still be quite willing to help if can well to begin then harcutt said have be with time to day did ask question about locality did show curiosity in of resident wolfenden shook head absolutely none answered only conversation have in showed interest at be concerning own people by bye reminds told of incident occurred at deringham hall last night be certainly interested curious chanced to look at at unexpected moment appearance astonished have never seen look so keen about anything before will tell incident at once please harcutt begged eagerly may contain very clue for be hunting anything interest mr sabin interest there be secrecy about matter wolfenden said will tell about may perhaps have heard that father have be in very poor health ever since great solent disaster unfortunately affected brain to certain extent have be victim of delusion ever since most serious of be that have be commissioned by government to prepare upon gigantic scale plan description of coast defence navy have secretary typist work ten hour day from report own observation be afraid only result be absolutely unintelligible chaos still of course have to take seriously be thankful that be worse now incident told mr sabin be last night man called introduced a dr wilmot great mind specialist represented that have be staying in neighbourhood be on friendly term with local medico here dr whitlett father case have be mentioned between have become much interested in have theory of own for investigation of such case consisted briefly of careful scrutiny of work done by patient brought letter from dr whitlett said that if must procure sight of father most recent manuscript must give opinion on case never have slightest suspicion a to truth of statement took with to admiral study however while be there be rattling through manuscript up come dr whitlett local man in hot haste letter be forgery man impostor escaped through window got clean away be story just a told to mr sabin what do make of harcutt stood up laid hand upon other shoulder well have got clue be declared thing a plain a sunlight wolfenden rose also to foot must be fool said for certainly ca see harcutt lowered tone look here wolfenden said have doubt that be right that father work be of value may be very sure of one thing mr sabin doe not think so see what mr sabin have got to do with said harcutt laughed well will tell one thing said be content of father study have brought mr sabin to deringham chapter xxii from beginning woman stood in midst of salt wilderness gazing seaward around be long stretch of wet sand of seaweed stained rock rising from little pool of water left by tide beyond flat marshy country be broken only by line of low cliff from little tuft of grass sprouted feebly wave rolled almost to foot be barely ripple breaking with scarcely visible effort upon moist sand above sky be grey threatening only few minute before cloud of white mist have drifted in from sea settled softly upon land in form of rain whole outlook be typical of intense desolation only sound breaking silence almost curiously devoid of physical animal noise be soft washing of sand at foot now then jingling of silver harness a horse of carriage drawn up on road above tossed head fidgeted carriage seemed grotesquely out of place coachman with powdered hair dark blue deringham livery sat perfectly motionless head bent little forward eye fixed upon horse ear footman by side stood with folded arm expression a wooden a though be waiting upon bond street pavement be weary must have liked to vary monotony by little conversation only few yard away woman be standing whose curious taste have led to visit spot arm be hanging listlessly by side whole expression although face be upturned towards sky be one of intense dejection something about attitude bespoke keen intimate sympathy with desolation of surroundings woman be unhappy light in dark eye be inimitably sad cheek be pale little wan yet lady deringham be very handsome a handsome a woman approaching middle age must hope to be figure be still slim elegant streak of grey in raven black hair be few far between might have lived hand in hand with sorrow have done very little to age only few year ago in crowded ball room of palace prince have declared to be handsomest woman of age prince have reputation of knowing be easy to believe how long woman might have lingered there be hard to say for evidently spot possessed peculiar fascination for have given up

road after be not so sure that mr blatherwick salvation have be cheaply won chapter xxviii midnight visitor wolf wolf wolfenden to whom sleep before early morning hour be thing absolutely impossible be lounging in easy chair meditating on event of day over final cigarette have come to room at midnight in rather dejected frame of mind day happening have scarcely gone in favour helene have looked upon coldly almost with suspicion in morning must be able to explain everything in meantime blanche be upon spot have uneasy feeling that girl be enemy have begun to doubt whether drive so natural thing a really happened be not carefully planned on part with full knowledge of fact that must meet mr sabin niece be more irritating because during last few day have be gradually growing into belief so far a suit with helene be concerned girl herself be not altogether indifferent to have refused definitely enough so far a mere word went there be light in soft dark eye something indefinable apparent in manner have forbidden to abandon hope yet be hard to believe that be in way subject to will of guardian mr sabin in small thing took pain to study be evidently not in least under dominion on contrary there be in manner towards certain deference a though be whose will be ruling one between a matter of fact appearance whole bearing seemed to indicate one accustomed to command family connection have never spoken of to yet have not slightest doubt that be of gentle birth even if must turn out that be not case wolfenden be democratic enough to think that made difference be good enough to be wife appearance manner be almost typically aristocratic whatever there might be in present surroundings in past savoured of mystery must at least have staked soul upon honesty realised very fully a sat there smoking in early hour of morning that be passing fancy of be first love for good for evil must be last failure said to be word must not admit in vocabulary be moving towards already day must be through mist of blue tobacco smoke hovered around seemed with very slight very pleasant effort of imagination to see faint vision of in more softening mood vaguest recollection of set heart beating fast sent blood moving through vein to music how delicately handsome be how exquisite line of girlish yet graceful queenly figure with clear creamy skin soft a alabaster below red gold of hair somewhat haughty poise of small shapely head brought vivid recollection of old aristocracy of france a one read of now only in page of romance history have grand air even great queen must not have walked to scaffold with more magnificent contempt of rabble whose victim be more personal thought came to half closed eye leaned back in chair steeped in pleasant thought then came to swift abrupt end revery pleasant castle building be back in present suddenly recalled in most extraordinary manner to realisation of hour place surely must not have be mistaken be low knocking at locked door outside there be doubt about there be again heard own name softly unmistakably spoken in trembling voice glanced at watch be between two three o'clock then walked quickly to door opened without hesitation be father who stood there fully dressed with pale face angrily burning eye in hand carried revolver wolfenden noticed that finger clasped be shaking a though with cold father wolfenden exclaimed what on earth be matter dropped voice in obedience to sudden gesture for silence admiral answered in hoarse whisper great deal be matter be being deceived betrayed in own house listen stood together on dimly lit landing holding breath listening intently wolfenden be at once aware of faint distant sound came from ground floor almost immediately below father laid hand heavily upon wolfenden shoulder one be in library said door open distinctly when tried to get out found that door of room be locked there be treachery here how did get out wolfenden asked through bath room down back stair that door be locked too found key fitted come with be careful make noise be on way downstairs now a turned angle of broad oak stairway wolfenden caught glimpse of father face shuddered be very white eye be bloodshot wild forefinger be already upon trigger of revolver let have wolfenden whispered touching hand be steadier than yours admiral shook head made answer in word butt end of revolver became almost welded into palm of hand wolfenden began to feel that be on threshold of tragedy have reached ground floor now straight in front of be library door sound of muffled movement within room be distinctly audible admiral breath came fast tread lightly wolf muttered let hear let catch red handed last dozen yard of way be over white flag tesselated polished like marble wolfenden shoe creaked admiral tip toe walk be light one there be sudden cessation of sound have be heard admiral with low cry of rage leaped forward wolfenden followed close behind even a crossed threshold room be plunged into sudden darkness have momentary partial glimpse of interior wolfenden saw dark slim figure bending forward with finger still pressed to ball of lamp table be strewn with paper something somebody be fluttering behind screen yonder there be barely second of light then with sharp click lamp went out figure of man be lost in obscurity almost simultaneously there came flash of level fire loud report of admiral revolver there be groan so wolfenden concluded that man whoever might be have not be hit sound of report be followed by few second breathless silence there be movement of sort in room only faint breeze stealing in through wide open window caused gentle rustling of paper with table be strewn curtain swayed gently backwards forward admiral with sens on alert stood motionless revolver tense in hand fiercely eager eye straining to pierce darkness by side wolfenden equally agitated now though from different reason stood holding breath head thrust forward eye striving to penetrate veil of gloom lay like thick barrier between screen fear have suddenly taken to very real terrible form there have be moment before extinction of lamp have plunged room into darkness when have seen fancied that have seen woman skirt fluttering there up to present father attention have be wholly riveted upon other end of room yet be filled with nervous dread lest at moment that revolver might change direction ear be strained to uttermost to catch slightest sign of movement at last silence be broken there be faint movement near window then again without second hesitation there be that level line of fire loud report from admiral revolver there be groan sign of one having be hit admiral began to move slowly in direction of window wolfenden remained where be listening intently be right there be smothered movement from behind screen one be moving from there towards door one with light footstep trailing skirt drew back into doorway meant to let pas whoever might be meant to know who be must hear hurried breathing faint familiar perfume shaken out by movement of skirt puzzled be very familiarity bewildered knew that be there must know for have paused position be terribly critical few yard away admiral be groping about revolver in hand mumbling to string of terrible threat casting of shadow must call forth death dealing fire wolfenden thrust out hand cautiously fell upon woman arm did not cry out although rapid breathing sank almost to moan for moment be staggered room seemed to be going round with have to bite lip to stifle exclamation very nearly escaped then stood away from door with little shudder guided through heard footstep die away along corridor with peculiar sense of relief then thrust hand into pocket of dinner coat drew out box of match be going to strike light whispered in father ear quick then be reply think fellow have got away yet must be hiding behind of furniture there be scratching of match upon silver box feeble flame gradually developing into sure illumination wolfenden carefully lit lamp raised high over head room be empty there be doubt about two be alone window be wide open chair in front of have be thrown over admiral strode to casement called out angrily heggs be there be one on duty there be answer tall sentry box be empty wolfenden came over to father side brought lamp with together leaned

window eye be suddenly soft face be sorrowful did not speak feared silence more than indignation when knock at door came be grateful for interruption grateful be until saw who be upon threshold then started to foot with little exclamation lord wolfenden be early visitor wolfenden smiled grimly advanced into room be anxious said to run risk of finding out mission be not altogether pleasant one chapter make promise single glance from mr sabin into wolfenden face be sufficient under breath swore small quiet oath wolfenden appearance be unlooked for almost fatal yet did not prevent from greeting visitor with usual ineffusive well bred courtesy be finishing late breakfast remarked can offer anything glass of claret benedictine wolfenden scarcely heard answered altogether at random have suddenly become aware that helene be in room be coming towards from window recess with brilliant smile upon lip how very kind of to look up so early exclaimed mr sabin smiled grimly a poured out liqueur lit cigarette be perfectly well aware that wolfenden visit be not one of courtesy single glance into face have told that cared to know be fortunate that helene have be in room moment respite gained be precious have come to ask to go for drive in wonderful vehicle said lightly pointing out of window to where dogcart be waiting must want step ladder to mount wolfenden answered gravely must feel very honoured at being allowed to take for drive at time said only think must rather bring more comfortable carriage shrugged shoulder looked at significantly one be driving yesterday bit lip frowned with vexation yet on whole perhaps did not regret allusion be proof that have not taken affair too seriously one be driving yesterday must be great deal more comfortable said to day only thought of getting here quickly have little business with mr sabin be that hint for to go asked be not agreeable morning what possible business can have with uncle doe not include be not inclined to go away will stay listen mr sabin smiled faintly girl be showing sense now at rate wolfenden be obviously embarrassed helene remained blandly unconscious of anything serious suppose said that want to talk golf again golf why one hears nothing else golf down here ever shoot ride for change wolfenden be suddenly assailed by horrible suspicion must scarcely believe that unconsciousness be altogether natural at bare suspicion of being in league with man stiffened answered without looking at conscious though be that dark eye be seeking invitingly that lip be curving into smile be not thinking of playing golf to day said unfortunately have le pleasant thing to consider if must give five minute mr sabin added must be very glad rose immediately with appearance of being genuinely offended there be little flush in cheek walked straight to door wolfenden held open for be exceedingly sorry to have be in way for moment said pray proceed with business at once wolfenden did not answer a passed through doorway glanced up at be not even looking at eye be fixed upon mr sabin finger rested upon door knob seemed twitching with impatience to close stood quite still for moment colour left cheek eye grew soft be not angry longer instinctively idea of truth flashed in upon passed out thoughtfully wolfenden closed door turned to mr sabin can easily imagine nature of business said coldly have come to have explanation with mr sabin lit fresh cigarette smiled on wolfenden thoughtfully certainly said explanation exactly well said wolfenden suppose commence then mr sabin looked puzzled have not better be little more explicit suggested gently will be wolfenden replied a explicit a choose mother have given whole confidence have come to ask how dare to enter deringham hall a common burglar attempting to commit theft to demand that instantly return to letter on have attempted to levy blackmail be that explicit enough mr sabin face did not darken did seem in way angry discomposed puffed at cigarette for moment two then looked blandly across at visitor be talking rubbish said in usual calm even tone be scarcely to blame be altogether own fault be quite true be in house last night be at mother invitation must very much have preferred coming openly at usual time to sneaking in according to direction through window be only very small favour asked lady deringham persuaded that father mental health antipathy to stranger be such that must never give information desired voluntarily be entirely at suggestion that adopted mean did be very sorry indeed that allowed to be over persuaded placed in undoubtedly false position woman be always nervous imaginative be convinced that if have gone openly to father laid case before must have helped must have done nothing of sort wolfenden declared nothing must induce to show even portion of work to stranger mr sabin shrugged shoulder gently continued without heeding interruption a to blackmailing lady deringham have spoken plainly to must forgive for answering in same fashion be lie have letter of hers voluntarily destroyed in presence be only little foolish must have destroyed long ago have misfortune to be once favoured suitor for mother hand think may venture to say be sure will not contradict be hardly treated only letter ever have from likely to do least harm destroyed fifteen year ago when first embarked upon what have be to certain extent career of adventure told that be not in packet burnt together yesterday if understood from that that be still in possession be retaining for purpose be grievously mistaken in word be have to say have said very well indeed wolfenden listening intently to word with eye rigidly fixed upon man countenance must not detect single false note anywhere be puzzled perhaps mother have be nervously excited have mistaken sentence of for covert threat yet thought of earnestness terrible earnestness sense of positive bewilderment crept over will leave mother out of question then said will deal with matter between ourselves must like to know exactly what part of father work be so anxious to avail of for what purpose mr sabin drew letter from pocket handed over to wolfenden be from office of one of first european review briefly contained request that mr sabin must favour with article on comparative naval strength of european power with particular reference to armament coast defence of great britain wolfenden read carefully passed back letter be genuine there be doubt about that seemed to mr sabin continued most natural thing in world to consult father upon certain matter concerning be have be celebrated authority in fact decided to do so at instigation of one of lord of admiralty to whom be personally well known have idea of acting except in most open manner called at deringham hall yesterday afternoon sent in card in perfectly orthodox way a may have heard mother took quite unexpected view of whole affair owing partly to father unfortunate state of health partly to extraordinary attempt be given to understand have be made to rob of work be very anxious to help insisted that must be secretly last night business be admit ghastly mistake only be not mistake yielded to lady deringham proposal under strong protest a man think may say of intelligence be ashamed of whole affair at same time be guilty only of indiscretion be sanctioned instigated by mother really see how can take blame to myself in matter must scarcely attribute to lady deringham wolfenden remarked injury to watchman can take little blame to myself mr sabin answered promptly man be drunk have be imagine made drunk merely pushed out of way fell heavily fault be not mine look at physique remember be unarmed ask what mischief must possibly have done to fellow wolfenden reflected appear to be anxious said to convince that desire to gain access to portion of father paper be harmless one must like to ask why have in employ young lady who be dismissed from deringham hall under circumstance of strong suspicion mr sabin raised eyebrow be first time have heard of anything suspicious connected with miss merton said came into service with excellent testimonial engaged at willing bureau fact that have be employed at deringham hall be merely coincidence be also coincidence wolfenden continued that in reply to letter attempting to bribe father secretary mr blatherwick be miss merton who kept appointment with mr sabin answered know nothing of if wish to question miss merton be quite at liberty to do so will send for wolfenden shook head miss merton be far too clever to commit said knew from first that be being watched behaved accordingly if be not there a agent position becomes more extraordinary still can assure mr sabin said with air of weariness be not man of mystery seem to think must never dream of employing such roundabout mean for gaining possession of few statistic wolfenden be silent case be altogether one of surmise must prove nothing perhaps said have be precipitate must appear so if be unduly suspicious have only to blame admit that name be assumed one refuse suit to niece without reasonable cause be evidently to be frank person of much more importance than lay claim to be now be open with if there be reason although can not conceive honest one for concealing identity why will respect confidence absolutely may rely upon tell who be who niece be why be travelling about in mysterious way mr sabin smiled good humouredly well said must forgive if plead guilty to false identity preserve for certain reason must not suit to take even into confidence besides if will forgive saying so there doe not seem to be least necessity for be leaving here during week will in probability go abroad almost at once so be not likely to meet again let part pleasantly abandon somewhat profitless discussion for moment wolfenden be staggered be leaving england going away that meant that must see more of helene indignation against man kindled almost into passionate anger by mother story be forgotten overshadowed by keen thrill of personal disappointment if be really leaving england might bid farewell to chance of winning there be certain word of hers certain gesture have combined to fan little flame of hope nothing a yet have ever be able to extinguish looked into mr sabin quiet face be conscious of sense of helplessness man be too strong too wily for be unequal contest will abandon discussion then if will wolfenden said slowly will talk with lady deringham again be in extremely nervous state be possible of course that may have misunderstood mr sabin sighed with air of gentle relief ah if men of other country be only a easy to delude a englishman what triumphant career might yet be be very glad said that do honour to take what can assure be correct view of situation hope that will not hurry away may not offer cigarette wolfenden sat down for first time be in asked when speak of leaving england so soon assuredly will do justice to admit have never pretended to like country have hope to leave for several year if not for ever within course of few week niece mr sabin accompanies of course like country even le than do perhaps under circumstance departure be best thing must happen be at rate opportune can not agree with wolfenden said for be most inopportune need scarcely say have not abandoned desire to make niece wife must have thought mr sabin said with fine note of satire in tone that must have put far away from idea of connection with such suspicious personage have never have wolfenden said calmly suspicion at concerning niece must be be sure much flattered mr sabin declared at same time can scarcely see on what ground continue to hope for impossibility niece refusal seemed to explicit enough especially

exhibiting curiosity be hard to believe that be same woman who have virtually taken conversation into own hand on previous evening have talked to so well so brightly sat there white cowed looking great deal at mr sabin with sad far away eye seldom originating remark mr watson on contrary talked incessantly in marked contrast to previous silence drank wine seemed in best of spirit only once did

about man conviction of own absolute impotence suddenly laid hold of be completely shaken of what use be ordinary weapon of kind against antagonist such a knew nothing of silent evidence against on deck must only attribute mr sabin foreknowledge of what have be planned against to miraculous stumbled to foot muttering something about cigar left place mr watson rose almost immediately afterwards a turned to walk down saloon dropped handkerchief mr sabin who have risen while passed out stooped down picked up took with smile of thanks whispered in ear come on deck with quickly want to speak to

see green light of german man of war chapter xlvii charmed life night be still enough piled up mass of black cloud obscured weakly moon there be only now then uncertain gleam of glimmering light there be fog sign of captain slept in room on deck steamer be utterly deserted only through black darkness still bounded on furnace roaring black trail of smoke leaving long clear track behind seemed a though one be sleeping on board steamer except who fed fire below grim silent figure who stood in wheelhouse mr sabin who muffled up with rug be reclining in deck chair drawn up in shadow of long boat be already beginning to regret that have attached importance at to mr watson warning wanted only hour so of dawn night long have sat there in view of door of deck cabin shivered to sleep have be impossible dozing be only fitful unrestful hand be thrust deep down into pocket of overcoat revolver have long ago slipped from cold finger more than once have made up mind to abandon watch to enter

stealthily forward watching listening intently surely that be rustling of silken gown gleam of white behind funnel be fluttering of woman skirt suddenly saw distinctly be wearing long white dressing gown noiseless slipper of kind face be very pale eye seemed fixed dilated once twice looked nervously behind then paused before door of cabin hesitated for moment finally passed over threshold mr sabin who have be about to spring forward paused after perhaps be safer where be there be full minute during nothing happened mr sabin who have now thoroughly regained composure lingered in shadow of boat prepared to wait upon course of event man footstep time fell softly upon deck one have emerged from gangway be crossing towards room mr sabin peered cautiously through twilight be mr watson of new york partially dressed with revolver flashing in hand then mr sabin perceived full wisdom of having remained where be under shadow of boat drew little nearer to door of cabin there be absolute silence within what be doing must not imagine place be in absolute darkness thoroughly awake now crouched within few foot of door listening intently once fancied that must hear voice seemed to that hand be groping along wall for knob of electric light then door be softly opened woman came out stood for moment leaning little forward listening intently ready to make retreat immediately be assured that coast be clear be little pale in stray gleam of moonlight mr sabin fancied that caught glimpse of smile upon parted lip there be whisper from behind shoulder answered in german monosyllable then apparently satisfied that be unobserved stepped out flitting round funnel disappeared down gangway mr sabin made attempt to stop to disclose presence finger have closed now upon revolver be waiting for man minute crept on nothing happened then hand softly closed window looking out upon deck immediately afterwards door be pushed open mr watson with handkerchief to mouth stepped out stood

assailed with fume of strange sickly odour mr sabin laughed softly little bitterly very old fashioned device murmured gave credit for more ingenuity friend come have opened window door see let step inside there will be sufficient fresh air mr watson be evidently disinclined to make effort glanced covertly up deck seemed to be preparing for rush again little argument of steel grim look on mr sabin face prevailed crossed threshold odour though powerful be almost nullified by rushing of salt wind through open window door mr sabin have fixed open with catch reaching out hand pulled down little brass hook room be immediately lit with soft glare of electric light mr sabin having assured that companion revolver be safely bestowed in hip pocket must not be reached without warning glanced carefully around cabin looked first towards bed smiled little device then have succeeded rug have rolled up under sheet into shape of human form be undisturbed in absence of light mr watson have evidently taken for granted that man whom have sought to destroy be really in room two men suddenly exchanged glance mr sabin smiled at other look of dismay be not like said gently be really very clumsy indeed to take for granted presence here have great faith in method friend do think that must have be altogether wise for to have slept here alone with unfastened door under circumstance mr watson admitted error with gleam in dark eye mr sabin accepted a additional warning little device continued raising unstopped flask from table by side of bed be otherwise excellent feel that owe many

too strong mr sabin murmured sad waste of very valuable drug friend now will please come inside with must have little chat first kindly stand quite still for one moment there be particular reason why must run risk be going to take revolver from pocket throw overboard mr watson first instinct be evidently one of resistance then suddenly felt cold muzzle of revolver upon forehead if move mr sabin said quietly be dead man best policy must be to kill be foolish not to do hate violence be safe if do a tell mr watson recognised fact that companion be in earnest stood quite still watched revolver
