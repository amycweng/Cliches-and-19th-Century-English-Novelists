will take up inquiry from point name if find that fact correspond with what have told fear that consequence will be disagreeable for of of what on earth do suspect major forrest asked sharply do think

answered yet madam if daughter have wisdom to see that matter of wealth be after trifle amongst condition make for happiness why must deny benefit of wisdom dear friend continued earnestly for reason because jeanne to day be too young to choose for have not got over sickly sentimental age when girl make hero of anything unusual in shape of man find sort of unwholesome satisfaction in making sacrifice for sake may be that jeanne may after look to what call simple life for happiness well if doe that after year so well good will not do so with consent without indeed downright opposition until have have opportunity of testing side of weighing matter thoroughly from point of view do not agree with mr de la borne speak reasonably madam assented jeanne continued have perhaps charmed
