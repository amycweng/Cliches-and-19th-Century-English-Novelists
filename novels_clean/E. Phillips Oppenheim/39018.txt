casement wondering cold shiver of alarm chilled for saw man creep stealthily out from wood hurry across little stretch of meadow towards garden gate where be standing moon be shining with sickly light through thick halo of mist must only just distinguish figure of mother man side by side talking earnestly watched with riveted eye until quick step on floor behind hand be laid upon mouth stifling cry of surprise be only philip lad whispered hoarse tremulous voice did want to call out be hast seen anything of before pointed with shaking finger towards window from have drawn back little looked at

bramble time be on foot immediately scarcely conscious of pain in wild desire to keep near mother how found way can not tell great piece of dress be torn off remained hanging to bush into stepped many time saw run against tree recoil half stunned by shock still made progress at last came to part of wood where tree undergrowth be le dense there be steep ascent up ran when reached top mother paused to listen while stood breathless by side save that leaf above be stirring with curious motion there be not sound in whole wood bird animal even insect seemed to have crept away to hole before coming storm must see nothing for thick mantle of darkness darkness must almost be felt have fallen upon earth stood crouched together trembling fearful thank heaven for darkness mother murmured to herself philip went on stooping down feeling for hand do know where be must be close to slate pit be on point of answering word died away on parted lip such sight a be revealed to at moment might have driven strong man mad although lifetime have passed away can see now a at moment describe can not for word of mine must paint thrilling beauty at same time breathless horror of scene opened like flash before tree sky space be suddenly bathed in brilliant lurid light like of have never since seen ever will again came went in space of time only thought must measure be what showed yawning at foot deep pit sullen water of quarry for be scarcely single step from precipitous edge huge pile of slate shed with workman tool scattered around father arm thrown upwards in agony wild cry bursting from lip at very moment that be hurled over opposite side of chasm saw frantic convulsion of despair upon ashen face eye starting from socket a felt falling into space saw dim outline of man staggering back from brink with hand outstretched before face in horror at what have done then a suddenly a have come fierce glare vanished heaven only moment before open flooding land with sheet of living fire be black impenetrable crashing thunder shook air around made earth tremble a though be splitting up very element be being dissolved with cry heartrending anguish of will ring for ever in ear mother sank down white scared heap limb unstrung sens numbed crouched helpless beside then rain fell there be silence chapter iv mother warning for many week after terrible night in rothland wood lay wrestling with fierce fever recovery from be deemed little short of miraculous sound constitution however careful nursing brought round opened eye one sunny morning upon what seemed to almost new world first thing can clearly remember after return to consciousness be extraordinary change have taken place in mother from beautiful active woman seemed to have become transformed into stern cold statue even now can recall how frightened be of during first day of convalescence how shrank from constant presence by bedside with nameless dread change be in appearance a well a in manner rich brown hair have turned completely grey there be frigid set look in face denuded of expression affection chilled time looked into be face not of mother of stranger a began to regain strength doctor pronounced fit to leave sick room began to display sign of uneasiness often looked at in singular kind of way a though there be something must say to one night woke up suddenly to find standing by bedside wrapped in long dressing gown grey hair streaming down back wild gleam in burning eye started up in bed with cry of fear held out hand with gesture intended to be reassuring nothing be matter philip said lie down listen obeyed have noticed closely must have seen be shivering for strange appearance total lack of affection in manner have filled with something approaching to horror philip will soon be well enough to go out continued people will ask question about night be first time subject have be broached between raised little in bed gazed at with blanched cheek fascinated eye listen philip must remember nothing do understand yes answered faintly must forget that saw in garden must forget everything father said to do hear yes repeated mother well will be caught man who killed father asked timidly oh hope will lip parted slowly laughed bitter hysterical laugh seemed to most awful sound have ever heard hope yes may hope hope if will cried remember boy if hope come true will be evil day for for remember then turned walked to door without word sat in bed watched piteously with great lump in throat sore heart moonlight be pouring in through latticed window falling full upon long graceful line of stately figure hard cold face be forlorn unhappy to look at froze word upon lip merciless cruel feature seemed to there be pity no love not shadow of response to half formed appealing gesture let go sank back upon pillow weeping bitterly with deep sense of utter loneliness desolation on following day be allowed to leave room very soon be able to get about a mother have anticipated many people asked question concerning event of hideous night to one answer be same remembered nothing illness have left memory blank long afterwards saw more clearly how well be that have obeyed mother bidding brief extract from county newspaper will be sufficient to show what universal opinion be concerning father murder copy here in column will be found account of inquest on body of george morton farmer late of rothland wood farm verdict returned by jury namely 'wilful murder against john francis ' be in face of evidence only possible one everyone must unite in hoping that effort of police will be successful that criminal will not be allowed to escape fact be simple conclusive appears from evidence of mr bullson landlord of george hotel mellborough of several other habitue of place that only few day before deed be committed there be violent dispute between deceased francis that threat be freely used on side on night in question francis started from rothland village shortly after nine o'clock with intention of making way through wood to ravenor castle owing doubt to extraordinary darkness of night appears to have lost way to have be directed by mr morton who noticed wandering about near garden gate mr morton decline to swear to identity owing in darkness in face of other circumstance must count for little in favour be also seen by deceased who enraged at finding on land addressing wife started in pursuit followed by mr morton little boy who arrived at slate pit in time to witness too late to prevent awful tragedy fully reported few day since in face of flight of man francis known fact that be in wood night there be little room for doubt a to being actual perpetrator of deed although detail of struggle must remain for present shrouded in mystery mr ravenor who have just arrived in england have offered reward of l for information leading to arrest of francis who be servant at castle chapter v ravenor of ravenor be generally expected that mother must be anxious to depart a soon a possible from neighbourhood have such terrible association for a matter of fact showed intention of doing anything of sort at time rather wondered at be able now to divine

to read first part be composed almost entirely of sonnet love poem one after read wondered there be nothing amateurish nothing weak here be full of glowing imagery of brilliant colouring of passion of fire crude of seemed to who have read modern poetry knew many of shakespeare milton sonnet by heart full of genius nevertheless with breath of life warm in second portion be devoted to longer poem liked best there be in more than touch of graceful fascinating mysticism of shelley passionate outcry of strong noble mind seeking to wrest from nature vast secret to fathom mystery of existence wail of bewildered nobility of soul turning in despair from cold creed of modern religion to seek other higher form of spiritual life read on until sun have gone down shade of twilight have chased afterglow from western sky then closed book rose suddenly with great start scarcely dozen yard away on extreme summit of hill man on horseback sat watching unusually tall figure fine shape of coal

will be happier in folly than other men in wisdom there be great deal of comfort in ignorance gave careless yet not unkind nod wheeling great horse round with turn of wrist galloped down hillside across soft spongy turf at pace soon carried out of sight stood for while on piece of broken rock on summit of hill gazing after retreating figure watching twinkling light from many village stretched away in valley below sound of low strong voice yet vibrated in ear sad beautiful face with languid grey eye weary expression seemed still by side already began to feel something of influence man appeared to exercise over everyone whom came near felt vaguely even then that if suffered to grow must become influence powerful with when reached home be late so late that mother who seldom betrayed interest curiosity in doings asked question felt curious reluctance at first to tell with whom have be talking be justified when saw effect word have upon look almost of horror filled eye face be white with anger be a though long expected blow have fallen at last at last murmured to herself a though forgetful of presence then eye closed lip moved softly seemed to that be praying be bewildered inclined to be angry that must carry dislike of mr ravenor so far did think so weak impressionable that few minute conversation with man must bring harm carry dislike of mr ravenor little too far mother ventured to say what can know of so bad that see danger in having talked with for few minute looked at fixedly grew more composed be too late now philip said in low tone mischief be done if must have foreseen must have gone away to have avoided mr ravenor cried wondering yes chapter vi doubtful visitor late in afternoon of following day visitor rode through stack yard reined in horse before door be reading in room mother chiefly occupied when glanced out of side window overhung darkened by jessamine honeysuckle have great surprise book dropped from finger stood still for moment uncertain what to do for outside sitting composedly upon fine black horse apparently considering a to best mean of making presence known be mr ravenor saw with curt not ungracious motion of head beckoned out went at once found dismounted standing upon step want to see mother boy said sharply be there one about who can hold horse where be farm men hesitated stood there for moment awkward confused mother strange word concerning be still ringing in ear supposing refused to come down receive a visitor man of whom have spoken such mysterious word nothing appeared to more likely yet what

uncomfortable sensation be making fool of myself be judging from what said be last night if study have only brought to pessimism must rather be ignorant really be wonderfully wise boy for year said still smiling must remember that there be two distinct branch of study one more popular more commonly recognised lead to acquired knowledge knowledge of fact science language other be pure sharpening training of mind by reading other men thought idea theory in short by becoming master of philosophical writer of nation now be latter must have to avoid in order to retain present arcadian simplicity without former man be scarcely above level of animal think see what mean admitted must like to be good classical scholar mathematician know lot of thing seems to added hesitatingly that sort of knowledge be quite sufficient to strengthen train mind other must be very likely to overtrain prove unhealthy especially if lead everyone where have led oh wanted leading said lightly be born pessimist schopenhauer be earliest friend voltaire teacher shelley god matter of disposition of course have too little imagination to care rap about cultivating religion too much to be moralist mother be coming at last then door opened looked up anxiously word of introduction have be trembling upon lip be unuttered stood a helpless dumbfounded a ploughboy with eye fixed upon mother chapter vii

personal appearance bore witness to startling metamorphosis be more than astonished be thunderstruck what seemed to most wonderful be that visit from man against whom have so solemnly passionately cautioned must thus have galvanised into state of being mr ravenor rose at entrance bowed with easy grace of man of world mother returned greeting with stately self possession matched own struck watching closely that while be perfectly collected be in reality far from being so must see delicate white finger of left hand fold convulsively around lace handkerchief be carrying when entered shiver gone in moment perceptible only to because eye be fastened upon shook slim lithe figure in few commonplace remark first passed between there be nothing in speech manner betrayed least embarrassment answered a one of own order graciously yet just allowing to see that visit be surprise to that expected to declare purpose have dwelt somewhat upon meeting for reason will be sufficiently apparent when have finished story after few remark about farm crop favourable weather gave wished for explanation have come to say few word to about son mr morton began abruptly looked equally astonished be man of few word continued few desire to say upon subject have better be said think to alone mr morton must have left room at once mother prevented laid trembling hand upon shoulder drew closer to can have nothing to say to mr ravenor must not be better for to hear especially a say that concern shrugged high square shoulder a though indifferent fancied nevertheless that shade of annoyance lingered in face for moment very good said shortly rumour may have told mr morton if ever listen to such thing be very wicked man possibly deny at rate be by disposition custom profoundly selfish owe to son luxury that of having found thought withdrawn from for few minute with most rare event met last evening talked with talked like fool be true have nothing to do with

allowed to defray expense of finishing son education seemed to magnificently generous offer very simple one must not understand agitation apparent indecision caused mother prompt refusal must have understood although must have be blow to mixture of horror consternation of emotion dismay must make nothing of feeling have imagined must surely be manifested gratitude be conspicuous by absence what did mean mother sat down mr ravenor leaned back in armchair apparently content to wait for decision moved across room to side took cold finger into mine mother cried with glowing cheek voice trembling with eagerness what be matter why do not say 'yes know how have wanted to go to college there be reason why must not consent be there mr ravenor smiled very slight movement of lip if mother considers interest at said calmly will certainly consent be about to speak mother looked up checked word on lip mr ravenor said quietly accept offer thank for be can say quite enough remarked nonchalantly there

puzzled more than half inclined to be alarmed might have be cry of hare squealing of rabbit caught by stoat first impression have be strong one improbable though seemed poacher however daring must scarcely be likely to invade closely guarded inner ground where preserve be fewer risk of capture far greater than outside park besides there have be no discharge of firearm commotion loud cry only

unfortunately put down embarrassment to cause for seemed partly to gratify partly to amuse young friend admired performance equally miss fay although perhaps be more demonstrative said mr marx coming forward will accept congratulation thanks of provincial who seldom have pleasure of seeing such acting hearing such voice thanked with affected little laugh suddenly died away looked into face intently have met before asked curiously there be something about face voice seems familiar to returned gaze steadily shook head with slight smile be afraid may not claim that honour said if have

carriage leaning back among cushion by side began seriously to consider idea trifling incident during latter part of evening have pointed to mr marx have deliberately tried to lead into making fool of with miss mabel fay why chapter xviii at midnight on moor be more than half way home before mr marx broke silence be becoming oppressive well have enjoyed evening asked of course have be very much obliged to for taking to theatre added after perhaps be misjudging what possible motive must have for being enemy oh be all right declared carefully lighting cigar throwing match out of window be afraid have have more than one illusion dispelled evening though went on smiling must have have plenty of time opportunity too for weaving out here life have never be away to visit relation anything of sort shook head believe have relation said never heard of father used to say that be last of family mother surely know of people have never even heard speak of answered shortly strange happen to remember maiden name do know that ever heard told began to wish mr marx must choose other topic of conversation doubtless be exceedingly kind of to take so much interest in affair question proceeded from perfectly genuine motif inability to answer of be becoming little embarrassing one more question be going to ask will be last said a though divining feeling be born here suppose so never heard be born anywhere else there be long silence seemed to that mr marx be very deep in thought be beginning to feel sleepy closing eye leaned right back among soft yielding cushion be one of wildest roughest night of year carriage window be streaming with raindrop must hear wind howling across open country whistling mournfully among leafless tree have accomplished about three quarter of journey have just entered upon blackest part of on side of road running close up to without even division of hedge be stretch of bare open country pleasant enough in summer time now mere plain on be dotted about few straggling plantation of sickly stunted fir tree among hurricane be making weird music be in middle of dreary region mr marx be still smoking cigar with closed eye be either dozing deep in thought with share of fur rug wrapped closely around knee be trying in vain to sleep in vain for head be still in whirl after what have be for exciting day exciting though have be however close be to be more so suddenly without least warning felt sharp jerk heard coachman calling out to horse who be plunging furiously mr marx leaned forward just a did so there be tremendous crash of breaking glass through splintered carriage window on side nearest to came heavy piece of rock followed by confused mass of stone gravel other debris mr marx leapt to foot with hand on door handle blood streaming from forehead before must open door however strange thing happened outside half visible through remains of glass half without intervening obstruction flashed for one single second white ghastly face of man peering in upon came went so swiftly that must gain only very faintest idea of feature with mr marx seemed to be otherwise like flash of lightning look passed across face have never died out of memory feature seemed to be dilated shaken with spasmodic agony of horrified recognition for moment seemed struck helpless with power of movement nerve numbed then low cry such a have never before since heard from human throat burst from shaking lip right hand tore open coat sought breast pocket door of carriage burst open a sprang into road like wild animal long streak of fire flashed from gleaming revolver grasped in hand lurid illumination gave sudden glimpse of white bleeding face a stood in road firing barrel after barrel into darkness jumped out hurried to side looking eagerly around into dark night together stood listened in breathless silence across wild open moor wind came rushing towards with deep booming sound among bare tree top of small plantation before heard shrieking yelling like hellish laughter of army of witch ink black cloud lowering close above head be dissolving in mad torrent of rain darkness be so intense that although must hear frantic plunging of horse behind must neither see carriage element seemed to have declared on side of mysterious assailant blackness of night roaring of wind rain blotted out surroundings deadened sound save own wait here cried mr marx in harsh unnatural tone before must open mouth have vanished out of sight seemed a though black yawning darkness have swallowed up for while stood without moving then cry for help from coachman behind renewed sound of struggling horse reminded of plight groped way back to road again be only just in time horse fine powerful creature very nearly thoroughbred be perfectly mad with fright groom who have be holding striving to subdue be quite exhausted between managed to pacify after brief struggle a soon a must find sufficient breath began to question burdett who have stuck to place on box like immovable statue about first cause of alarm what be shied at first asked did see anyone just catched glimpse of blackguard sir be burdett answered be spinning along beautiful for knew a be on way home animal did when of sudden like dandy shy up go mare on hind leg a near a possible pitch into road slackened rein laid whip across while tom jumped down just then saw figure in middle of road heard crash through carriage window tom 'd catched hold of head by then be lucky for when firing began be like mad creature must never have held be mercy be altogether smashed up mistake lord save from ever being out wi 'osses again on night a did see face of man who attacked then asked eagerly not being possessed of eye of heagle cat sir did not burdett replied just look round see what sort of night be why can only just make out outline sir although have be looking at five minute ca see nothing of face did suppose tom asked groom sir nothing except just black figure good thing that be of hurt sir be not sure that mr marx be answered face be bleeding good deal wish 'd come back never did time pas so slowly a then when waited in storm rain for mr marx return must have be nearly hour before heard hailing in distance soon afterwards saw figure loom out of darkness close at hand be alone splashed from head to foot with mud hatless with great streak of blood clotted upon forehead cheek presented at first frightful figure face have lost that dreadful expression of numbed horror have made for moment so terrible to a sank back breathless exhausted among cushion even attempted smile in vain see said must find single trace of anyone anywhere be much hurt sir asked groom who be tying up broken carriage door not at only scratch tell burdett to drive home a fast a can now tom there be good fellow be left together to talk over strange affair mr marx seemed to have made up mind about already without doubt said deliberately be tramp desperate with want drink who made up mind to play highwayman started well then seeing two of instead of one funked bolted think ever have such start in life came off worst remarked pointing to forehead be that upset answered be horrible idea flashed upon just for moment face peered in at window saw be horribly like face of man who be dead whom know to be dead gave just while idea lasted sensation hope will never experience again a long a live be ghastly face of dead be not cheerful thought looked at wrecked door window of carriage felt immediately reassured assailant whoever might have be be ghostly one there be undeniable evidence of material presence strength in shattered glass wrenched woodwork wound on mr marx forehead carriage pulled up with jerk have reached home have better come in bathe forehead mr marx suggested hesitatingly shook head declined thanks will get back to castle a soon a can doctor good bye morton if see again before go wish success at mr randall thanked warmly shook offered hand shutting carriage door called out to burdett to drive on for moment two stood in road watching light a rapidly grew fainter fainter in distance then turned slowly up path towards house half way there stopped short holding breath listened intently wind have dropped rain have almost ceased night be still a dark a pitch listened with strained ear beating heart soon knew have not be mistaken coming down hill between rothland wood gate where be along road by have just come must hear faint nevertheless unmistakable sound of light running footstep turning back stole softly down path stood in middle of road waiting chapter xix strange attack must not in reality have be more than minute two although seemed to then terribly long while before again heard sound have attracted attention when did be quite close at hand just at beginning of range of farm building skirted road there be possibility of mistake situation be sufficiently plain at rate scarcely fifty yard away man be coming running towards either barefooted with very soft shoe on be past midnight pitch dark lonely road nearer step came heart began to beat very fast indeed at last peering earnestly through gloom made out shadowy figure of man only yard two away from running in middle of road pair of wild burning eye glistened like fire against dark background felt warm panting breath upon cheek heard low fierce cry second later saw figure give spring sideways vanish in shade of barn wall followed cautiously although groped about in direction must see nothing so stood quite still with back to wall called out softly who be why be hiding from answer tried again want to hurt wo do harm only want to know who be what never finished sentence became suddenly conscious of two glaring eye looking at like piece of live coal from crumpled heap on ground then there be quick panting snort spring felt man long nervous finger clutching throat gasping choking for breath flung off only to find held a though in vice by pair of long arm drawing deep breath braced up for struggle with unknown assailant more than once gave up for lost for opponent be evidently powerful man seemed bent on strangling fiercely though struggled at first soon saw that strength be only frenzy of nervous desperation that be fast leaving by degree began to gain upper hand at last with supreme effort threw on back before must recover have knee upon chest drew long breath of relief spoke to shouted threatened commanded took notice then peered down close into upturned face fierce eye truth flashed upon at once have be struggling with madman hopeless raving lunatic be probably who have made attack upon in carriage first impulse be one of deep gratitude for escape then began to wonder what on earth be to do with be lying like log now perfectly quiet knew that have only to relax hold upon struggle must begin again perhaps terminate differently must not take into house for there be room from must not easily escape only place seemed to to be coach house be dry clean with window save at top with good strong padlock coach house must do decided if only must get there drew handkerchief from pocket knotting with teeth secured hand a well a must then seizing by collar half dragged half helped up garden path till reached coach house opening door with one hand thrust in made resistance in fact seemed utterly cowed pitiable object looked crouched on floor with face turned to wall struck match to obtain better view of only attire be grey flannel shirt pair of dark trouser of be torn in place saturated with rain of face must see little for be half hidden by hair matted with dirt rain by bushy whisker beard ragged unkempt foot be bare black with thick coating of mud hence soft stealthy tread altogether be gruesome object a lay huddled heap against wall muttering to unintelligible jargon loosing hand left there softly entering house found food rug took out to eyed former ravenously before must set down snatched piece of bread from hand began eagerly to devour put remainder down by side throwing rug over stole away chapter xx monastery among hill when awoke in morning sun be already high in heaven be considerably past

be going to walk over to monastery philip said quietly will come with of course will mother answered promptly nothing must give greater pleasure when will start will be ready in hour said with faint smile a though be pleased at ready acquiescence then left room to get ready in about time have mentioned came into garden to started on walk be very uneventful one think that will ever forget mother seemed after brief relapse into comparative kindness to have become more inaccessible than ever walked along by side with downcast eye nervous thoughtful expression on pale face too felt somewhat depressed at starting soon fresh pure air becoming stronger stronger a left road followed footpath by beacon hill have invariable effect upon spirit perplexing thought foreboding of trouble passed away from like magic heart beat blood flowed through vein with impetuous ardour of sanguine youth at top of hill paused to look round upon favourite scene mother to rest for moment then saw how great have be storm of night before here there be bare trunk of tree many cattle shed barn stood roofless storm seemed to have worked havoc everywhere save where on summit of wooded hill ravenor castle with great range of mighty battlement vast tower grey wall of invincible thickness frowned down upon country at foot looking across at seemed to that place have never seemed so imposing a then mother stood by side noticed intent gaze admire ravenor castle very much philip said quietly withdrew eye with effort do mother confessed very much indeed place have sort of fascination for man who life there mother have turned little away from stood with face upturned to heaven mutely moving lip out of eye must see tear slowly welling tall slim figure be convulsed with sob sprang to side caught hold of hand what be mother cried tell shook head sadly not now philip not now come let go side by side began to descend hill path wound around several freshly planted spinney then led through plantation of pine tree then turned with regret so far a be concerned into muddy road again walked for more than mile between high straight hedge at last soon after mid day turned to left passed through farmyard along winding path led now by side of turnip field now across bracken covered open country to summit of last hill here again paused below close up against background of colourless hill drearily situated in bleakest spot of austere landscape straight spire severely simple building of monastery be clustered together little above on artificial eminence of rock rude cross stood out in vivid relief against sky on mother eye be fixed with sort of rapt wistfulness a stood side by side on top of hill looking downwards be fitting spot that men who counted among virtue that in rigid self immolation have cut off even from beauty of nature have chosen for habitation although place have peculiar impressiveness of own never failed to exercise sort of fascination upon be glad to day when mother moved forward again a neared end of journey turned in at long straight avenue led to monastery door strange agitation have noticed in mother manner during earlier part of day visibly increased cold inexpressiveness have dwelt for so long in face vanished into there crept look having once seen cared not to look upon again seemed a though be endeavouring to brace up for tremendous ordeal must have given anything to have be able to put into word sympathy have risen up strongly within unnatural cold severe at best of time indifferent a have lately be to be still mother loved dared not break in with word upon fierce anguish be already beginning to leave mark upon white strained face only when stood before bare stone front of monastery with feeble finger have pulled great iron bell must speak at then word be not such a wished to speak afterwards when thought of often did think of of trifling incident of memorable walk seemed to weak ill chosen such a be be glad that spoke listened a one whose thought be far away when ceased breathless laid hand upon arm with dim sad eye looking into mine said simply be for sake philip for sake then before must ask what meant great door slowly opened guest master stood before passed with silent salutation vanished on way to chapel though watched longingly dared not follow then declining father bernard invitation to go to room rest turned away from door wandered into ground hour after hour of brief winter day passed away father bernard came out in search of offered refreshment shook head must not eat drink rest strange powerful apprehension of coming crisis in life great evil connected with mother visit to place have laid hold of struggle against be impotent be late in afternoon before came have climbed up to top of calvary with sick heart longing eye be watching door from must issue suddenly be opened stood for moment upon threshold looking around for to dying day will think of a saw then face be face of saint calm passionless happy with gentle chastened happiness knew when looked upon that have left burden of great sorrow behind have paid price for pale fragile a have always appeared seemed now to have be wasted by fierce scathing ordeal have driven out of feature everything human left only spiritual life a moved slowly forward into drive saw even more distinctly seemed to to have gained strange new beauty be beauty made look upon with sudden shuddering fear hurried down to side welcomed with smile such a have seldom seen on face be altogether in harmony with softened expression then took arm turned towards home be happier now mother ventured to ask answered by silently pressing arm passed down avenue thickly strewn with decaying leaf along winding lane through gate led up to ive head hill once twice a be making ascent fancied that hung heavily upon arm asked if be tired only shook head have reached summit before terrible fear have be gnawing at heart took definite shape then for first time since have started upon return journey be able to look into face have be keeping averted from when saw ghastly change have crept into heart stood still sens seemed numbed with fear mother cried be ill what be matter oh speak to do have fallen into arm hand touched mine a fell to side be a cold a ice face be like face of one who have already triumphed over shadow of death far away at foot cross of calvary be standing out with rugged vividness against fast darkening sky upon closing eye be steadily fixed lip be slightly parted in happy confident smile whole being seemed absorbed in most religious devotion once whispered name faintly pressed hand then lip moved again heard dread sound of solemn prayer faltered out in broken whisper in manus tuas domine in heart knew that be dying human help must be of avail yet be loth to abandon hope setting gently down looked anxiously around on summit of next range of hill man be sitting on horseback looking down upon monastery motionless figure against sky cried out to at sound of voice started round looked towards then suddenly digging spur deep into side of great black horse came thundering up side of hill at pace made ground shake beneath foot like trembling of earthquake what be wrong cried hoarsely looking into face recognised mr ravenor pointed to mother prostrate figure gazing at with dry eye answered mechanically be dying word have scarcely left lip before have leaped from horse passing arm around bent over pallid face oh be horrible murmured must not die must not die have voice seemed choked with emotion did not finish sentence spoke to so softly must not hear word walked few yard away once more looked wildly round far away on dark hillside must see white robed figure of lay brother bending over labour nearer there be one road below be deserted deep stillness seemed brooding over bare shadowy landscape sick at heart turned back fell on knee by mother side remained there fearing almost to look into face until twilight deepened upon hill slowly blotted out from view even dark cross standing up against grey sky then mr ravenor leaned for moment forward low groan escaped from lip told what dreaded that mother be dead chapter xxi message from dead paroxysm of grief passed slowly away rose to foot looked around with streaming eye mr ravenor be still by side together carried mother back to monastery news of approach have preceded long before reached journey end solemn minute bell be tolling out to silent night awakening strange echo in hill finding reverberation of mournfulness in heart austere impressive a great bare front of monastery have always appeared to have never seemed so cold desolate a when melancholy little procession wound round hill of calvary slowly approached entrance gloom of winter evening be hanging around building with never ray of light from part looked like habitation of dead gigantic vault suddenly a drew near front door be slowly opened dark figure of monk holding above head lighted taper stood on step in low monotone repeated latin prayer when ceased there be moment silence then from chapel there came sound of deep voice chanting slowly in solemn unison miserere remainder of night seems like dream to now of can recall little remember that long past midnight when have thrown down upon stone floor of guest chamber heard soft step rustle of garment approaching looking up saw sweetest face ever beheld in man woman looking down into mine from deep fold of monk cowl stayed with for while speaking welcome word of comfort then gathering robe about stood up prepared to leave first handed small packet be left in charge for philip morton said little did dream that so soon must be called upon to fulfil trust take son packet opened with

castle on first visit vastness gloom have somewhat chilled now be altogether different small army of servant in picturesque livery with powdered hair be moving noiselessly about soft light be burning on many bracket dispelling deep shade have hung somewhat drearily about there be fragrant perfume of flower pleasant sense of warmth in air began to understand at once story have heard of luxury magnificence with mr ravenor entertained guest on rare occasion when threw open door mr ravenor be in private room be told own groom of chamber who have be summoned to take name ushered after moment hesitation into library walked to fire for be cold probably through being unused to wearing such thin clothes standing there with hand behind back looked around with feeling almost of awe at vast collection of book with be surrounded who be please started looked in direction from voice sweet childish treble came seated demurely in centre of large armchair with tumbled hair book upon lap be very young lady clear blue eye be fixed calmly inquiringly upon a though expecting immediate answer there be slight frown upon forehead altogether for such diminutive maiden appeared rather formidable did know that be there said in explanation of start name be morton philip morton looked over gravely critically succeeded in making feel uncomfortable apparently however examination ended in favour for frown disappeared closed book philip be pretty said condescendingly think much of morton rather like philip though be glad of answered lamely be very ridiculous must think of nothing else to say

lay in lap be not nice book at said decidedly like of book here oh turned round quickly for saw that be looking behind standing on threshold of inner room be tall dark figure of mr ravenor handsomer

here to talk to be so dull made reciprocative speech if be somewhat awkwardly expressed have at least merit of earnestness eye followed admiringly a walked to door disappeared with backward glance smile then started coloured to find mr ravenor be watching know why must have brought here said come way followed mr ravenor across hall into suite of room hung with satin opening out one from seeming to inexperience like succession of brilliantly lit fairy chamber in smallest most remote room three men be standing talking together in low chair by side reclined lady silchester holding dainty screen of peacock feather between face fire listening to conversation with slightly bored air be in full evening toilette several row of diamond flashed sparkled with rise fall of snow white throat afterwards grew to look upon lady silchester a good type of well bred society woman then be revelation to revelation of new specie appearance seemed at first to surprise then slightly to discompose emotion passed away at once welcomed with charming little smile a languidly raised hand placed within mine for moment at entrance conversation ceased for moment mr ravenor laid hand upon shoulder turned towards little group sir richard let introduce to young ward of mine disciple of yours sir richard hibbet mr morton professor marri mr morton mr later mr morton shook hand with widening circle little continued conversation be interrupted presently by announcement of dinner professor taking in hostess others following mr ravenor bringing up rear there be lack of conversation during dinner though gradually turned towards purely literary matter remained there to be altogether fascinating although be often beyond comprehension long after lady silchester have departed sat round small table glittering with plate finely cut glass loaded with choice flower wonderful fruit sens be almost dazed by brilliancy of material surroundings ever flowing conversation seemed always to be teaching something new opening up fresh field of thought at time scarcely knew most to admire dry pungent wit caustic remark of professor perfectly expressed classical english of mr later sound good sense of sir richard seasoned with apparently inexhaustible stock of anecdote quotation culled from imaginable source brilliant epigram trenchant criticism occasional flash of genuine eloquence by mean of mr ravenor with rare art continually stimulated talk almost unnoticed mr marx still in morning coat with pale face dark rim under eye have entered sank wearily into seat although listened with apparent interest took part in war of word be flashing around suddenly came to end mr ravenor glanced at watch rose gentleman said must ask to excuse for hour if care to see library mr marx will show smoking room billiard room be at service if care to remain here there be plenty more of yellow seal claret cigar be upon table philip want rose followed towards door a did so have to pas mr marx who have left

swear tear up chapter xxv mr marx warning first impulse on glancing through mr marx brief note be to show to mr ravenor after second consideration changed mind mr marx be complete mystery to at time seemed possible that interest undoubtedly showed in be genuine kindly struggled against dislike of man then remembered brutal conduct to lunatic other inexplicable part of behaviour darkest suspicion doubt began to take shape in imagination there be something altogether mysterious about connection with mr ravenor manner towards be puzzled more than half inclined to decide against man whom personally have grown to detest on other hand be young still optimist with regard to fellow men what harm have done mr marx why must seek to injure seemed improbable almost ridiculous so in end certain sense of fairness induced to respect postscript said nothing to mr ravenor about secretary warning interview with be very short one indeed led way into study in have first seen closing door turned round faced upon hearthrug room be dimly lit where stood fast dying fire cast faint glow around tall straight figure showed face cold resolute a marble not unkind philip morton said slowly have occurred to that in wishing to go to lincolnshire may have be influenced to certain extent by selfish consideration if have slightest preference for public school knew instinctively whence that idea have come interrupted nothing must induce to go anywhere else to dr randall exclaimed firmly in case continued wish to leave tomorrow will be ready assented at once too be leaving here may be for very long while went on in two month time hope to start for persia between now then movement will be uncertain can not settle down here be useless great weariness shone out of dark blue eye stifled sigh

rapidly be too utterly improbable nevertheless asked cecil question with curiosity what sort of looking man be cecil de cartienne began to describe at once a de cartienne modified contradicted everything cecil said be soon in state of complete bewilderment a to personality of missing man seemed that be short of medium height that be fair inclined to be dark stout thin pale ruddy milly put

have memory at expect moved bet turn up by morning think not cecil replied quietly a gathered up rein now then hold on behind rattled off down street out into open country again at pace precluded conversation low hedge stunted tree by roadside seemed to fly past sudden turn almost jerked from seat brought in sight of wide semi circle of twinkling light seemed to stretch right across horizon what be asked pointing forward oh fishing smack answered cecil be that sea then asked eagerly burst out laughing why what else do suppose be exclaimed ca hear bent head listened faint night breeze be just sufficient to carry to ear dull monotonous roar of incoming tide not very cheerful row be observed cecil cheerful call most infernally miserable sound ever heard growled de cartienne from back seat enough to give fellow horror day see that bright light close ahead said cecil pointing with whip be borden tower where hang out know will be there in minute two perhaps growled de cartienne from behind making nervous clutch at side of trap ci dear fellow be not driving fire engine there be nothing to be gained by confounded hurry george be nearly out that time have turned round sharp corner into winding drive devoid of tree planted only with stunted shrub on one side between shore be long irregular plantation of small fir tree through night wind be moaning with sound not unlike more distant roar of sea directly in front loomed high dark building standing out with almost startling abruptness against void of sky moor here be exclaimed cecil pulling up with flourish before front entrance john help down poor nervous invalid behind take brandy soda round to stable at once be too hot to stand still in damp air second passed across large somewhat dreary hall into warm comfortable dining room bright fire be blazing in grate table in centre of room be very tastefully laid for dinner make yourself at home morton exclaimed cecil standing on hearthrug stretching out numbed hand to

very little concealed fact a far a be able passed bottle continually to cecil did not much surprise for have already formed own opinion of de cartienne after dinner man who waited upon brought in coffee withdrew cecil whose cheek be little flushed whose eye be sparkling with more than ordinary brightness rose stretched say leonard exclaimed let adjourn to room have hand at card will de

sitting back in chair with arm crossed cigarette between teeth inscrutable smile upon thin lip somehow did not like expression there be something little too closely approaching contempt in a watched cecil action listened to exultant ring in tone something seemed to express latent power to reverse result with ease at time thought proper be rushing to conclusion doubt a glanced from cecil boyish handsome face trifle dissipated just now open candid to pale sallow countenance large black eye cynical callous expression of friend seemed to that be looking from face of tempted to face of tempter

reasserted remembered where be new life have indeed begun in earnest sprang out of bed pulled up blind be very strange prospect looked out upon after luxuriant hilly scenery of home where have lived life before be flat uncultivated common dotted here there with few stunted gorse bush numerous sand heap farther away long stretch of shingle sloped down to foam crested sea under grey sunless sky of early winter morning have dull forbidding appearance though be not inviting prospect there be something attractive in novelty dropping blind hastened into bath room began dressing be past eight o'clock when got downstairs saw one about so let out by front door walked down drive ground be small soon explored having exhausted passed through wicket gate into little plantation of pine tree thence out on to common then for first time in life felt strong sea breeze with cap in hand face turned seaward stood for few moment thoroughly enjoying glad to see that be early riser mr morton be

fantastically shaped cloudlets strewn upon background of lightest transparent blue far off sail of few fishing smack glittered like gossamer wing upon fairy ocean farther away still where bank of orange azure cloud seemed to sink into blazing sea of polished glass white funnel of passing steamer shone like pillar of fire be sight so new to cecil that stood spellbound with look of wondering awe

information manner be encouraging bade take seat went into matter gravely to tell truth said be rather surprised have not be appealed to before in ordinary case must feel bound to maintain strict secrecy with regard to ailment of patient be different a have asked question feel bound to tell must not otherwise divulge mr hart be patient on two several occasion during last two year for delirium tremens once within recollection have distinct touch of brain fever mind must not be very strong then remarked dr schofield hesitated have wonderful constitution said slowly constitution of iron in ordinary circumstance can not bring to think that must suddenly completely have lost reason supposing have received severe shock such a railway accident something of sort why then must be possible even probable might become raving lunatic in moment must madness be incurable if properly treated with knowledge of past ailment no answered dr schofield if be treated just like ordinary madman in pauper lunatic asylum must probably never recover must become worse worse finally be incurable see two objection to accepting theory of sort a accounting for disappearance doctor continued after short pause in first place shock must have to be violent unexpected seems improbable in next place must surely have have letter something about must have led to identification if shock be result of foul play must be destroyed suggested undoubtedly whence foul play hart be known to have have only few pound with when left perhaps have something in keeping more valuable than money remarked what secret

arrest for moment recollection of where be then suddenly remembered be behaving to say least of strangely turned abruptly away at third floor stepped out walked across corridor to room without glancing once behind be time before unpacked portmanteau even thought of dressing then remembered that if be dining at hotel must see again turning out clothes at once dressed with feverish haste for moment have forgotten about count de cartienne forgotten even very purpose of visit to london only one face linked with memory dwelt in mind usurped thought felt strange excitability stealing through

look upon be not that alone troubled during moment that expression have be transformed have given odd disagreeable sense of familiarity be again almost immediately so soon must scarcely credit change

look away must not felt somehow forced to return steady gaze when turned to husband touched on arm evidently to direct attention to spell be broken moved chair slightly making casual remark to companion be sufficient to set ball of conversation rolling again one stolen glance few moment later showed that husband wife be regarding attentively several time afterwards when looked over towards table met lady langerdale eye full of sad wistful withal puzzled expression must not read a dinner drew towards close occurred to that vi vi have studiously avoided turning once towards neighbour if desired to escape recognition however be unsuccessful for just a be beginning to think of quitting place lord langerdale left seat to speak to acquaintance at other end of room on way back looked

will reopen old wound stop away if not why come see have young friend with added turning slightly towards speaking little more earnestly than occasion seemed to require man whom called shook head be not so fortunate said stiffly can claim more than what on continent call 'table acquaintance ' with young gentleman might have be fancy seemed to that lord langerdale looked distinctly disappointed

looking most popular men about town there seemed to be nothing must not do art in be not proficient be passionately in love with mother whether ever really cared for can not tell if did must only have be very transitory feeling marriage day be fixed be general topic of conversation even believe that mother have begun to prepare trousseau when something happened count de cartienne be deposed from post of chief favourite in society at one time held by younger more extraordinary man that man be mr ravenor exclaimed lord langerdale nodded think went on that can possibly imagine from mr ravenor of to day what be when became rage of london society have just returned from first journey in east after perilous adventure have filled column of newspaper for week have already created strong curiosity

manner of grandison fire eloquence of burke when chose to open mouth men woman alike be fascinated be more remarkable a sought intimate amongst former studiously avoided compromising with of latter although heaven know have lack of opportunity only man with whom seemed to be on at friendly term be de cartienne only woman to whom paid save most ordinary attention be mother lord langerdale paused for several moment seemed wrapped in brown study from impatience aroused continued at once thing went on smoothly for time then rumour began to get about at first there be only faint whisper presently people began to talk openly count de cartienne have better beware said must lose bride at first treated such suggestion with contempt time came when be forced to consider seriously mr ravenor published small volume of poem anonymously amongst be passionate love sonnet addressed to m everyone be talking of book wondering who new poet be when through treachery in publisher office secret leaked out everyone then knew that thrilling love song be addressed to alice montavon de cartienne went straight to mr ravenor demanded explanation mr ravenor acknowledged authorship of poem did not deny that verse in question be addressed to mother further than that must not say word simply referred de cartienne to went straight to poor fellow be met with piteous entreaty that must release from engagement loved mr ravenor must marry one else what followed remains to extent secret much know there be furious scene between de cartienne mother ended in refusing to give up threatening to shoot rival if ever saw together again sir arthur montavon who be deeply in de cartienne debt swore that marriage must take place apparently gained end for mr ravenor suddenly disappeared be reported that have left country on very day before wedding however society be furnished with still more sensational piece of scandal mother left home secretly companion of flight be mr ravenor must sit still no longer rose walked up down room with quick unsteady stride lord langerdale watched with great growing pity in honest face there be silence between for several minute during after one keen restless look of inquiry kept face turned away from then continued story in somewhat lower key for two day de cartienne be virtually maniac then seemed suddenly to come to sens think elsie especially dreaded terrible set calmness more even than previous fury made wild threat did talk to anyone of intention knew what be when left secretly alone trembled for knew that be going in search of mother needed help for be born detective possessed in marvellous degree art of disguising day searched newspaper anxiously dreading lest must read of tragedy feared be inevitable heard nothing week crept on into month month to year still heard nothing not even from mother advertised made possible form of inquiry in vain then came news of mr ravenor shipwreck supposed death concluded that mother have perished with accepted foreign appointment only returned to england after ten year absence last week heard at once of mr ravenor marvellous return to life wrote to only reply received be single sentence can tell wife that sister be dead have more to say ' only yesterday to amazement met de cartienne again with who felt sure from beginning must be alice son may seem strange to must know so much yet know more be so turned round faced slowly do mean to say then that after elopement mother never once communicated with father sister only in way left private message for wife telling through whom to forward letter not disclosing whereabouts sir arthur montavon intercepted message took advantage of to write cruel stern letter forbidding ever to appear in presence again to address sister be sorry to say that at command wife too wrote in censorious vein hoping to make up for by sending letter few day afterwards first letter mother received second missed inherited good deal of father firmness almost severity of disposition have doubt that receipt of letter must lead to cut off altogether from family then even know where mr ravenor be married asked huskily lord langerdale shook head noticed that failed to look in face braced up with great effort lord langerdale said quietly be matter of life death to seem to avoid question answer have reason to suppose that there be marriage none at answered quickly dear boy went on coming over to side resting hand upon shoulder be always a well to be prepared for worst will tell how have seemed to sometimes mr ravenor have very peculiar view with regard to marriage something similar to shelley held in youth never heard of ceremony seems strange then too separation mother marriage to farmer stern lonely life afterwards fact that birth have be kept concealed from hesitated seemed to gather encouragement from face must not must not for moment share fear when thought steadfastly about thought of mother dying with saint like peace upon face in mr ravenor arm thought of calm sorrowful dignity of life idea refused for moment to linger in mind other great cause for estrangement there must have be between not that not will go down see

that be more matter for police than for to mix up in shook head of one thing did feel confident although a regard whole of rest of affair be in complete maze however anxious mr ravenor might be for truth concerning missing man to be discovered have strong reason for not wishing police to take part in search felt sure of be determined to act accordingly lord langerdale be not easily reassured
