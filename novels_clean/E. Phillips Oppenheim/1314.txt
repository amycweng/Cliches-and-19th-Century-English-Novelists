generally veiled have figure of miniature venus soft with delicate curve seemed somehow to be always subtly asserting although affected in dress almost puritanical simplicity presence in room be always felt at once there be woman beautiful plain whose sex one scarcely recognizes be not one of seemed to carry with concentrated essence of femininity quiet movement almost noiseless rustling of clothes quaint undistinguishable perfume used soft even voice be thing seemed individual to be like study in undernotes yet lovell paused moment yet spanish dancing woman whose dark eye voluptuous figure have won crown of demi monde ever possessed that innate mystic gift of kindling passion like woman told must describe ca can only speak of effect if story interest must build up own idea of

have to put story together partly from fact came to knowledge afterwards partly from reasonable deduction may say at once know what lumley saw when played spy housekeeper have just taken tea in be possible that wingrave may have be holding guest hand that something in face attitude convinced that jealousy be well founded anyhow be certain that lumley be half beside with rage when strode away from window then in avenue must have heard soft patter of hound coming along lane perhaps seen pink coat of huntsman through hedge much be certain hurried down drive returned with ruth husband lovell took drink one spoke one even made remark little circle of listener have caught something of own gravity story be ordinary one enough something in lovell manner of telling seemed somehow to bring into

with faint strange smile afterwards when tried to do so aynesworth found impossible to describe expression flitted across face only knew that left with impression of having received challenge incorruptible murmured sir wingrave seton be indeed fortunate man there be lingering sweetness in tone still have note of mockery in silence left aynesworth conscious of vague sense of uneasiness felt that eye be raised to for reason must not translate even into definite thought wished to avoid silence be prolonged for long afterwards remembered few minute there be sort of volcanic intensity in atmosphere be acutely conscious of small extraneous thing of perfume of great bowl of hyacinth ticking of tiny french clock restless drumming of finger tip upon arm of chair time seemed actually to feel eye commanding impelling beseeching to turn round did so at last looked full in face lady ruth said will favor with answer to message certainly answered smiling quite naturally will come see sir wingrave seton at four o'clock tomorrow afternoon can tell that think rather extraordinary request under circumstance will do a suggests be staying at clarence presume under own name will have

though there existed between already understanding mocked conventionality of word aynesworth left house lit cigarette upon pavement outside with little sigh of relief felt somehow humiliated did fancy wondered that be callow boy to dance to tune of piping that have never before seen beautiful woman who wanted own way gospel of hate what wingrave asked secretary a sat at dinner that night did think of lady ruth in plain word must not like to tell aynesworth answered only hope that will not send to see again why not lady ruth aynesworth answered deliberately be very beautiful woman with most dangerous gift of eve when wanted own way did scanty honor of appraising a easy victim asked question for instance wanted to tell if still have in possession certain letter of hers aynesworth said good what did say told of course aynesworth continued that having be in service for few hour only be scarcely in position to know ventured further to remind that such question addressed from to be to say least of improper wingrave lip parted in what must have be smile spirit of mirth be lacking then there be nothing else aynesworth answered simply dismissed can see wingrave remarked grievance be annoyed because regarded a too easy victim perhaps aynesworth admitted there be excuse for after wingrave continued coolly posse power have already admitted must say be fairly impressionable person so
