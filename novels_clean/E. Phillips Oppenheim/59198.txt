duncombe pupil seemed to be on quite good term vied with one in diving feat arthur exulting in one accomplishment clambered up rock more than once to considerable height before made plunge presently however all tired little of sport rose be already dressing in convenient cave be lying at full length enjoying sun bath on shingle when heard duncombe voice from behind great rocky promontory jutting out from sea little to left one more arthur have found new place be best of lot watched young man climb obediently up jagged boulder of rock topmost ledge must have be at least twenty thirty foot high

swimming round corner what be matter shouted where be arthur be climbing down from rock answered a duncombe came alongside have just stopped diving into pool why be by side now pointed downwards to dark line of cruelly jagged rock looked for moment concerned jove have never noticed muttered be barely three foot answered can reach duncombe turned over on back be in shadow almost surrounded by rock voice of others preparing lunch sounded long way away suddenly felt a though be cut off a though must read thought at back of man brain a though be in danger time be drawing little closer to leonard ella duncombe suddenly appeared upon summit of one of lower range of rock come along to lunch former shouted moment have passed duncombe began to swim vigorously for shore be quite when stepped out on to sand must make fuss about if be lister suggested look a though be careful enough a matter of fact think boy must have come to harm arthur be seated by on sand arm clenched around knee face turned away from of seemed to have ignored summons to prepare for lunch probably not answered trying to speak in a unconcerned tone a possible boy drunken men have wonderful knack of avoiding accident strolled up beach together duncombe paused spoke to arthur come along said be waiting luncheon for arthur turned looked at must not say that there be anything either malicious reproachful in look yet worried made answer in word few moment later however scrambled to foot went to rock behind clothes be lying duncombe seemed determined that nothing have happened must interfere with success of picnic abandoned reserve related anecdote chaffed everybody in turn opened wine absolutely created atmosphere of pleasure leonard told story rose sang to danced upon sand arthur after preliminary fit of gloom drank far too much champagne for age became in rather clumsy way a light hearted a rest ella sat for time apart from others arm drawn through hers until presently wandered off

to disturbing subject suppose suggested that arthur be thinking more about little affair eh why must answered coolly must know that made mistake naturally duncombe assented still think 'd have come to harm unless bungled dive be glad same that noticed rock marked end of incident worthy of note connected with picnic except arthur ella stayed away for over hour that when returned be clinging to arm with almost protective air night for first time not single member from grange turned up at performance somehow other when started for customary early morning walk on following day knew that there be

puzzled have be down here many morning have never seen arthur bathing before be in water now swimming out with long powerful stroke towards duncombe whilst arthur be still almost undistinguishable in sea duncombe be lying lazily on back a yet unconscious of pupil approach began to feel first misgiving there be something unnatural in very atmosphere that morning sulphurous gloom entire absence of sunshine still oily water found straining eye to catch nearer glimpse of boy face asking time why have chosen particular morning to bathe for first time before breakfast nearer nearer came passed within matter of fifty yard took notice of shout of greeting then a rolled from side to side caught glimpse of face seemed to be swimming in entire unconsciousness of physical effort chin be little protruded eye be fixed in unnatural stare upon spot where duncombe lay floating for moment two felt queer sensation of helplessness called out again knew time although must not acknowledge to myself

faraday at suspicion be confirmed by fact that according to week era faraday be performing in melbourne have doubt that information be correct duke replied coldly now come to think of believe agent told that be sending faraday man not faraday surely have reason for bringing information wild absurdity of whole thing made feel like fool then remembered however that have be deliberately sent here by machiavellian chief have never be sent anywhere in vain must sound idiotic grace confessed be very much impressed by precaution against robbery connected with jewel chamber fact that there be man staying here to whom preferred not to show jewel staying here under false name with ninety horse power motor car in garage duke interrupted with slight exclamation little wave of hand never dreamed

resting upon bowl of red rose adore acknowledged for own sake sometimes too went on meeting gaze with coquetry for must never have given credit sometimes too for sake of from whom come glanced almost imperceptibly towards leonard one of slow inimical glance seemed yet to betray evil purpose bearing in mind story one have be told of man cold blooded indiscriminate cruelty be easy to believe that if word from must have wiped off face of earth at moment must certainly have be spoken making best of presence however continued conversation in low tone once saw rose flinch glance up a though in distress came across room making pretence at filling pipe from jar stood upon table near creslin looked at through half closed eye miss mindel doe not approve of coming emancipation of sex observed suppose doctrine of new world must sound strange at first to who have counted hard fast chastity of puritan amongst virtue be doctrine of new world enquired include at rate replied in quiet sibilant

radius of twenty mile from here think must see riot must approach almost to revolution man be a cunning a fox will preach idealistic sociology first rest will creep in by degree meanwhile creslin spent greater part of spare time in sitting room scarcely now made pretence of taking particular interest in leonard whole attention be directed towards rose to do justice be man of considerable culture fine perception on many subject there be time when rose face seemed to light up when seemed to find genuine pleasure in conversation there be others when saw cold wooden parrying unspoken
