commandant admitted very dull place seems at time now be perfectly frank philippa begged be there single fact of importance must be learnt in place worth communicating to enemy be danger of espionage here worth moment consideration that captain griffith replied in somewhat stilted fashion be not question must be prepared to answer off hand philippa shrugged shoulder appealed almost feverishly to helen who have just entered room helen do come listen to captain griffith be making feel quite creepy there be secret about seems want to know about mr lessingham helen smiled with complete self possession well can set mind at rest about mr lessingham ca observed a shook hand can do more philippa declared can help to judge for be expecting mr lessingham for dinner captain griffith do stay

little shiver of complacency welcomed lessingham who be presently announced with very much le than usual reserve dinner be in way success towards close philippa became little thoughtful glanced more than once at lessingham who be sitting by side almost in admiration conversation gay at time always polished be interlarded continually with little social reminiscence inevitable amongst men moving in certain circle of english society apparently richard felstead be not only one of college friend with whom have kept in touch last remnant of captain griffith suspicion seemed to vanish with second glass of port although manner became in way more genial think be almost little too daring philippa asked favoured guest a helped afterwards to set out bridge table one adapts one method to one adversary murmured with smile friend captain griffith have only very conventional suspicion mention of few good english name acquaintance with ordinary english sport be quite sufficient with man like helen griffith be talking at other end of room philippa raised eye to companion become more of mystery than ever declared be making even curious tell really why have paid visit from cloud be sorry almost a soon a have asked question for moment calm insouciance of manner seemed to have departed eye glowed in search of new thing answered gun fortification spirit of mischief possessed lessingham manner be baffling yet provocative for moment political possibility of presence faded away from mind have intense desire to break through reserve wo tell why came must tell more easily answered in low tone why will be most miserable day of life when leave laughed at with perfect heartiness how delightful to be flirted with again sighed thought german men be so heavy paid elaborate underdone compliment still secret sir please be what want to know if will have just little patience begged leaning so close to that head almost touched promise will not leave place before tell to philippa eye

mr lessingham griffith asked never be calm reply be head shoulder above class down here very good of to say so lessingham replied courteously held good card to night wonder griffith went on dropping voice little keeping eye fixed upon companion what german substitute for bridge be wonder lessingham echoed a nation questioner proceeded probably waste a much time on card a do be interest in subject appeared to be non existent strolled away from sideboard towards philippa for part be watching captain griffith so many thanks lady cranston lessingham murmured for hospitality what about secret asked see there be two answered looking down at one will most surely tell before leave here because be one secret man have ever succeeded in keeping to a for other hesitated there be something almost like pain in face broke in hastily did not call away to ask about happened to notice captain griffith just now do know that be watching very closely have idea of lessingham admitted indifferently be rather clumsy person be not will be careful begged earnestly remember wo that helen be really in most disgraceful position if anything must come out nothing will promised think know do not that might happen to must find mean to protect for second time felt curious lack of will to fittingly reprove boldness have even to struggle to keep tone a careless a word really be delightful person exclaimed how long

approach if really must go please take mr lessingham with be making fun of allow even dick friend to do lessingham disclaimer be in quite correct vein must come again very soon hostess concluded a shook hand enjoyed bridge immensely two men be already on way to door when sudden idea seemed to occur to captain griffith turned back by by lady cranston asked have heard anything from brother

captain griffith offered clumsy expression of sympathy bad luck said be so sorry lady cranston good night once more time departure be uninterrupted helen removed handkerchief from eye philippa made little grimace at closed door do believe helen asked seriously that captain griffith have suspicion philippa shrugged shoulder if have who care replied little defiantly very idea of duel of wit

few month protected area be duty to examine enquire into business of stranger who appears here mr hamar lessingham have be largely accepted without comment owing to friendship with regret to state however certain fact have come to knowledge make wonder whether may not in measure have be deceived sound very ridiculous philippa interposed quietly few week ago captain griffith continued received information that neighbourhood must probably be visited by person connected with secret service of germany there be strong evidence that person in question be mr hamar lessingham graduate of magdalen brother intimate friend frequent visitor at father house in cheshire philippa observed with faint sarcasm possibility of having made mistake lady cranston captain griffith rejoined have must confess only just occurred to authority at magdalen college have be appealed to one of name of lessingham be there during one of brother term philippa took blow well simply stared at caller in

death in lessingham threat in flash of eye while hesitated there be knock upon door mill came silently in carried telegram upon salver for sir announced addressing captain griffith orderly have just brought down griffith looked at pink envelope frowned tore open however without word a read long upper teeth closed in upon lip so stood there until two little drop of blood appeared then turned to mill there be answer said man bowed left room walked slowly looked back from doorway be scarcely possible for even so perfectly trained servant to escape from atmosphere of tragedy something tell lessingham remarked coolly a soon a door be closed that message concern commandant made immediate reply straightened out telegram read once more under lamplight a though to be sure there be possible

after for moment thoughtfully then shrugged shoulder be quite sure that like captain griffith declared there be breeding about fellow chapter xxiv philippa even for moment after departure of captain griffith myrmidon remained in sort of nerveless trance crisis with bewildering denouement have affected curiously lessingham rose presently to foot wonder asked if must have whisky soda stamped foot

drink be richard world over know broke into little mirthless laugh will begin to think that be poseur exclaimed crossed room towards perhaps be dear confessed want just to sit up lose unnatural look be not really full of cheap bravado be philosopher something have happened to postpone end good luck to say raised tumbler to lip set down empty philippa rose to foot walked restlessly to window back will try be reasonable too promised resuming seat be right see captain griffith have discovered everything can tell what possible reason one in london must have have for interference seem to have got friend up there without knowing observed be aging terribly philippa declared throwing back into seat life have hated mystery here be face to face with two absolutely insoluble one captain griffith have assured that there be here in dreymarsh something of sufficient importance to account for presence of foreign spy have confirmed have be torturing brain about for last twenty four hour now there happens something more inexplicable still be arrested be not arrested identity be known captain griffith be forbidden to do duty seems puzzling doe not lessingham agreed must worry about first last little episode take explaining if anything further happens evening think will go mad philippa sighed something be going to happen lessingham declared rising to foot did hear that above even roar of wind heard brazen report of gun from almost underneath window room be suddenly lightened by single vivid flash mortar lessingham exclaimed be rocket unless be signal for lifeboat philippa announced wonder if can see anything hastened towards window paused at abrupt opening of door nora burst in followed more sedately by helen mummy there be wreck former cried in excitement heard something hour ago got up have be sitting by window watching saw lifeboat go out be signalling now for other one be quite true philippa helen declared be going to try fight way down to beach will go too lessingham decided perhaps may be of use will go philippa agreed wait while get thing on what be mill added a door opened latter presented there be trawler on rock just off breakwater ladyship announced have

fire will come back added turning around will come back lessingham promised fought way down to beach at first storm completely deafened sound lantern waved here there by unseen hand seemed part of ghostly tableau of only background be raging of storm then suddenly with startling hiss rocket clove way through darkness have instantaneous brilliant view of be happening saw trawler lying on side apparently only few yard from shore saw line stretched to beach on even at moment man be being drawn ashore licked by spray strained face wind tossed hair clearly visible then be darkness again more complete than ever struggled down on to shingle where little cluster of fisherman be hard at work with line almost first person ran across be jimmy dumble be standing on edge of breakwater with great lantern in hand superintending line a drew near lessingham who be little in advance must hear voice above storm be shouting towards wreck hand to mouth send master over next lubber will cut line do hear there be reply if there be be drowned in wind lessingham gripped fisherman by arm whom do mean by beaster ' demanded dumble scarcely glanced at interlocutor why sir henry cranston to be sure be agitated answer lubber of sea hand be coming off first line wo stand for more than one two added dropping voice then thrill of few minute excitement unrolled into great drama before lessingham eye sir henry be on ship a near a man might wish to be to death 'ere be next jimmy muttered a turned windlass vigorously gosh ' e heavy one too then came cry sounded like moan above shrill fearful yell of man who feel dropping out of world hearing lessingham raised lantern stood on beach by jimmy side line have broken body of suspended traveller have disappeared just then strangely enough for first time for over hour heaven opened in one great sheet of lightning must see figure of one man left on ship clinging desperately to rigging tie line around jimmy shouted let go get other end on windlass paid out rope through hand jimmy kicked off boot plunged into cauldron swam barely dozen stroke before be caught on top of incoming wave tossed about like cork flung back upon beach where lay groaning there be little murmur amongst fisherman who rushed to lean over swimming ai no more use than trying to walk on water one of declared lessingham raised lantern be carrying flashed around where be young lady asked gone up to house with two a have just taken off wreck one informed lessingham stooped down willing hand helped unfasten cord from jimmy waist tore off own coat waistcoat boot helped other sought to dissuade a secured line around own waist have sent for more rocket one man shouted in ear man will be back in hour lessingham pushed on one side stood on edge of beach borrowing lantern watched for opportunity then suddenly vanished looked after must see nothing rope slipping past foot inch by inch sometimes be stationary sometimes be drawn taut first great wave came flung yard so of slack amongst then after roar of breaking have died away saw rope suddenly tighten pas rapidly out excitement began to thicken 'un did get anyway one of muttered will go through next with luck declared hopefully lessingham fighting for consciousness deafened half stunned by roar of water about still felt exhilaration of great struggle looked once into sea seemed to touch cloud drew stiff plunged into depth of mountain of foaming water whose summit seemed to like one of grotesque nightmare distorted effort of opium eating brain then roar sounded behind knew that be through breaker swam to side of ship clutched hold of chain be sir henry out stretched hand pulled on to deck god be swim latter declared a pulled rescuer up not in least recognising let have end of cord quick so went on paying out through finger until end of rope appeared 'd better get breath young man then over go will follow be damned if do be vigorous reply start off while get breath be suddenly half drowned with shower of spray sir henry held lessingham in grip of iron must have be swept overboard get one arm through chain man shouted god added peering through gloom lessingham well stop to worry about be fierce reply let get on with job sir henry threw off oilskin underneath coat follow when wave lantern twice directed if of get knock well thanks lessingham felt grip of sir henry hand a passed went overboard into darkness then with one arm through chain drew towards by mean of heel coat sir henry have thrown upon deck gradually came within reach of disengaged hand seized shook out dived eagerly into breast pocket there be several small article threw ruthlessly away then square packet wrapped in oilcloth bent to finger breaking wave threw on back one arm be still through chain other gripped what illuminating instinct have already convinced be chart a soon a have recovered breath grim effort of humour parted lip lay there for moment laughed till spray time with rush of green water underneath very nearly swept from place be waving lantern on beach when struggled again to foot slipped little packet down clothes next to skin groped about to find end of line sir henry have fastened to staple below chain then drew long breath gripped rope shouted second two later be back in cauldron a pulled on to beach have one idea happened must not lose consciousness packet be still there against calf of leg must be own hand removed clothes seemed to that few bronzed face dozen rude lantern have become magnified multiplied hundredfold be army of blue jerseyed fisherman patted on back welcomed lantern like star flashing everywhere around set teeth fought against buzzing in ear tried to speak voice sounded like weak far away whisper be all right kept on saying then felt leaning on two brawny arm foot followed mesmeric influence of movement be going into cloud wondered stopped to open gate gate leading to garden of mainsail haul how did get there have idea more movement of foot then unexpected warmth looked around there be voice listened one voice one face bending over eye wet with tear whisper incoherent stream of broken word then warmth seemed to come back to vein sat up found on couch in library rain dripping from in little pool knew that have succeeded have not fainted be all right repeated what mess be making voice around be still little tangled hand held steaming tumbler to lip be philippa drink begged felt tear come into eye felt warm blood streaming through body felt little wet patch at back of calf of leg hand set down empty tumbler be almost steady there be hot bath ready philippa told dry clothes bedroom with fire in do let mill show way rose at once prepared to follow foot be not quite so steady a must have wished made very presentable show mill with little apology held out arm philippa walked by other side a soon a have finished bath got into dry clothes philippa whispered please ring send mill to let know be even able to smile at be quite all right assured once more chapter xxv philippa unusually early on following morning glanced at empty breakfast table with little air of disappointment rang bell mill enquired be one down sir henry be believe on beach ladyship man answered miss helen miss nora be with mr lessingham mr lessingham ladyship mill continued looking carefully behind a though to be sure that door be closed have disappeared disappeared philippa repeated what do mean mill left mr lessingham last night ladyship mill explained in suit of master clothes apparently preparing for bed must say morning a be probably about two o'clock called at half past eight a desired found room empty bed have not be slept in be there note message philippa asked incredulously nothing ladyship one of maid servant belief that heard front door open at five o'clock morning ring up hotel philippa instructed see if be there mill departed to execute commission philippa stood looking out of window across lawn shrubbery down on to beach there be still heavy sea be merely swell from day before wind have dropped sun be shining brilliantly sir henry helen nora be strolling about beach a though searching for something about fifty yard out wrecked trawler be lying completely on side with end of one funnel visible scattered group of villager be examining from sand in due course mill returned hotel people know nothing of mr lessingham ladyship beyond fact that did not return last night received message from hill garage however about hour ago to say that mechanic have driven mr lessingham early morning to norwich where have caught mail train to london boy be to say that mr lessingham must be back in day so philippa pushed open window made way down towards beach leaned over rail of promenade waved hand to others who clambered up shingle to meet scarcely seen yet dear have sir henry observed stooped kissed forehead salute suffered without response helen pointed to wreck doe seem possible doe said that men life must have be lost in little space two men be drowned say through breaking of rope recovered body morning everything else seems to have be washed on shore except coat sir henry grumbled be down here at daylight looking for coat philippa repeated scornfully fancy thinking of when only just escaped with life to tell truth dear sir henry explained pocketbook paper of value be in pocket of coat ca think how came to forget think be surprise of seeing that fellow lessingham crawl on to wreck looking like drowned rat jove what pluck must have fisherman can talk of nothing else nora put in excitedly mummy be simply splendid helen have gone up with two of rescued men got back just in time to see fasten rope round waist watch plunge in how be morning helen asked gone philippa replied looked at in surprise gone sir henry repeated what back to hotel do mean bed have not be slept in philippa told must have slipped away early morning gone to hill garage hired car motored to norwich from there went on to london have sent word that will be back in few day hope to god wo sir henry muttered philippa swung round upon what do mean by demanded want to thank for saving life dear certainly do sir henry replied just now well be little taken aback gone to london eh tore away without warning in middle of night to london coming back too be strange part of one must think from sir henry expression that be finding food for much satisfaction in recital of lessingham sudden disappearance be wonderful fellow lessingham added thoughtfully must have yes by god must have in storm too if must speak coherently henry philippa observed must like to say that be exceedingly anxious to know why mr lessingham have deserted so precipitately sir henry must have taken wife arm avoided shrugged shoulder plodded up steep path by side whole question of lessingham be rather problem said of course helen have seen very much more of than have be true that people have begun to make curious remark about how did know that henry philippa demanded well one hears thing replied must gather from what heard that position here have become little precarious hence sudden disappearance be coming back again philippa reminded husband perhaps philippa signified desire that husband must remain little behind with walked side by side up gravel path philippa kept hand clasped behind to leave subject of mr lessingham for time began feel very reluctant to ask for explanation of anything do must confess to certain curiosity a to why must find lunching at canton with two very beautiful lady few day ago when left here with jimmy dumble to fish for whiting also why return here on trawler belongs to part of coast sir henry made grimace be beginning to wonder whether curiosity be dead observed good humouredly if must mind giving well to be on safe side let say eight day think will be able to offer explanation will consider satisfactory thank philippa rejoined with cold surprise see reason why must not answer such simple question at once sir henry sighed deprecatingly made vain attempt to take wife arm philippa be little brick begged know seem to have be playing part of fool just lately there have be sort of reason for what reason must there possibly be demanded must not confide in be silent for moment when spoke again there be new earnestness in tone philippa said have be working for time at little scheme be ripe to talk about yet not even to may lead to something hope will alter opinion must see way clear to trust little longer must begged with rather plaintive gleam in blue eye must make so much easier for to say no more just have sit tight wonder answered coldly if realise how much have suffered sitting tight a call waiting for to do something fishing excursion went on desperately have not be altogether matter of sport know that quite well replied have be making that chart promised miserable fisherman none of thing interest henry fear be very much inclined to say that none of doings interest least of went on voice quivering with passion do appreciate in least mysterious appeal for patience have common sense henry be suspicious little beast told suspicious scoffed what word to use from man who go off fishing for whiting be lunching at carlton day afterwards with two lady of extraordinary attraction be trifle awkward sir henry admitted with little burst of candour go in with rest philippa then can stay with rest retorted exactly where have placed in mind please understand conduct for last twelve month absolves from tie there may be between if explanation that promise come in time feel like very well until doe be perfectly free a husband be non existent be reply henry to request for further indulgence rather foolish one dear answered patting shoulder then be rather child be swung away from angrily touch exclaimed mean word of what have said a for being child well may be sorry day that have persisted in treating like one sir henry paused for moment watching disappearing figure there be unusual shade of trouble in face love for confidence in wife have be so absolute that even threat have seemed to like little morsel of wounded vanity thrown to out of froth of temper yet at moment darker thought crossed mind lessingham realised be not rival after to be despised be man of courage tact even though sir henry in own mind have labelled a fool if indeed be coming back to dreymarsh what must be for how much have philippa known about stood there for few moment in indecision great impulse have come to to break pledge to tell truth then made disturbed way into breakfast room where be mother nora asked a helen took philippa place at head of table want coffee toast sent up to room nora explained wind made giddy sir henry breakfasted in silence rang bell ordered car going away again daddy nora asked be going to london morning replied little absently to london helen repeated doe philippa know have told yet helen turned towards nora wish 'd run up see if mother want more coffee there be dear suggested nora acquiesced at once a soon a have left room helen leaned over laid hand upon sir henry arm go to london henry begged dear helen must replied little curtly must if be persisted know have tried philippa very high lately be in extremely emotional state be worked up about last night must leave alone if be sir be blue eye seemed suddenly like point of steel a leaned towards think that be in love with fellow lessingham asked bluntly helen replied think be more furious with than believe for month have acted well how will say oh like coward if like fool go on have asked for explanation to be perfectly entitled helen continued have given none have treated like something between doll child philippa be a good sweet a woman who ever lived have ever occurred to that woman be rather mysterious being may sometimes do out of furious sense of being wrongly treated out of sort of aggravated pique what must never do for other reason if must go come back to night henry come back if be obstinate wo tell philippa that have right to know tell about luncheon in town sir henry frowned be very well know helen said woman ought to trust husband be friend remember helen replied upon word must trust believe even in dick if behaved a have done for last twelve month sir henry made grimace well that settle suppose then observed will have one more try see what can do with philippa perhaps hint of what be going on may satisfy climbed stair meeting nora on way down knocked at wife door there be reply tried handle found door locked be there philippa asked yes replied coldly be going to london morning can have few word with first sir henry be little taken aback be silly philippa persisted may be away for four five day there be answer sir henry suddenly remembered entrance from newly added bathroom availed of found philippa seated in easy chair calmly progressing with breakfast raised eyebrow at entrance be apartment reminded be little fool exclaimed impatiently philippa deliberately buttered piece of toast picked up book became at once immersed in wish to talk to then demanded agreed have have opportunity man must need of explaining certain matter to curiosity in have ended also interest in say be going to london very well pray hurry home on account sir henry a turned to leave room made common mistake of man arguing with woman attempted to have last word perhaps be better out of way eh perhaps so philippa assented sweetly chapter xxvi philippa late afternoon found what sought solitude have walked along sand until dreymarsh lay out of sight on other side of spur of cliff before stretched long level plain fringe of sand belt of shingly beach there be not sign of human being in sight of building only quaint tower on far horizon found dry place on pebble removed hat sat down hand clasped around knee eye turned seaward have come out here to think be odd how fugitive transient thought became husband be always there in background in moment be lessingham who be predominant figure remembered earnestness tender solicitude for courage when necessity demanded have flamed up in born natural quality remembered agony of few minute on preceding day when nothing what still seemed miracle have saved at one moment felt inclined to pray that might never come back at heart ached to see once more knew so well that if came must be for sake that must come to ask finally question with have fenced knew too that coming must be moment of life be so much of woman passionate craving of sex to give love for love be there in heart almost omnipotent in background there be that bitter desire to bring suffering upon man who have treated like child who have placed in false position with other woman who have dawdled idled away day heedless of duty heedless of serious obligation when tried to reason way seemed so clear yet behind there be that cold impulse of almost victorian prudishness inheritance of long line of virtuous woman prudishness have once when have believed that be part of second nature scoffed at a being outcome of one of finer form of selfishness told that have come there to decide decision came nearer to late afternoon star shone weakly in sky faint vaporous mist obscured horizon floated in tangled wreath upon face of sea only line of sand seemed still clear cut distinct a glanced along eye be held by something approaching something seemed at first nothing black moving speck then gradually resolved into semblance of man on horseback galloping furiously watched a drew nearer nearer sand flying from horse hoof figure motionless eye apparently fixed upon distant spot be not until have come within fifty yard of that recognised horse shied at sight of be suddenly swung round with powerful wrist little speck of sand churned up in momentary stampede of hoof fell upon skirt for rest watched struggle composedly struggle be over almost a soon a be begun captain griffith leaned down from trembling subdued horse lady cranston exclaimed in astonishment be replied smiling up at have be riding off bad temper glanced down at horse quivering side back a far a one must see there be that regular line of hoof mark be bad tempered asked well observed know well enough to answer question be simply thinking of yesterday evening slipped from horse stood before long severe face have seldom seemed more malevolent have enough to make bad tempered declared have tracked down german spy step by step until have there waiting for arrest expecting even then got that wicked message what be wicked message after enquired that doe matter answered be from quarter where ought to know better ordered to make arrest have sent to war office to day full report be praying that may change mind philippa sighed if have received that telegram last night observed seems to that must have be widow to day frowned struck boot heavily with riding whip yes heard of that admitted dare say if have gone though one else must must have gone if have be there asked if have told to replied looking at steadfastly philippa felt little shiver there be something ominous in intensity of gaze meaning have contrived to impart to tone rose to foot well said let keep here be getting cold passed arm through bridle of horse will walk with if may proposed made reply set face homewards hear lessingham have left place remarked little abruptly oh expect will come back philippa replied how long be lady cranston since took to consorting with german spy asked be foolish impertinent enjoined be making ridiculous mistake about mr lessingham laughed unpleasantly need for to fence said know who be what do want to know what have be wondering way from point there four mile of hard galloping one question why be friend what be to really captain griffith protested looking up at of what possible interest can be to well be anyhow answered gruffly anything that concern be of interest to philippa realised
