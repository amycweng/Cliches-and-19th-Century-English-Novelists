entirely obscured by unusually thick veil of black lace voluminous nature of outer garment only permitted suspicion a to figure be at time at once despair triumph of corsetiere with hand be holding fur lined skirt from contact with deck disclosing at same time remarkably shapely foot encased in trim patent shoe with plain silver buckle little more black silk stocking than seemed absolutely necessary deck steward after half puzzled scrutiny of label let down chair next to two men duchesse contemplated prospective neighbour with curiosity mingled with certain amount of hesitation be at

remembered that in keeping be many box of paper many letter have recently arrived belonging to bernadine reflected that there be certainly who be in confidence very soon must come from country take

harm to country have be kind to so came to again eye be lifted to peter be very sure indeed that be wonderfully beautiful began to realise fascination of woman of whom have heard so much very absence

in for reason other suited bernadine be over now little party of three lapsed into silence car driven carefully enough through busy street gradually increased pace a drew clear of suburb peter leaned back in place thinking bernadine be dead nothing else must have convinced so utterly of fact a simple sentence in daily telegraph have be followed up by confirmation brief obituary notice in evening paper curiously enough fact seemed to have drawn certain spice out of even adventure to point indeed to certain monotony in future present enterprise important though might turn out to be be nothing to be proud of woman greedy for gold be selling lover secret before breath be out of body peter turned in cushioned seat to look at without doubt be beautiful to one who understood beautiful in strange colourless feline fashion beauty of soft limb soft movement caressing voice with always promise beyond of more than actual word eye now be closed face be little weary did really rest peter wondered watched rising falling of bosom quivering now then of eyelid have indeed appearance of woman who have suffered car rushed on into darkness behind lay that restless phantasmagoria of light streaming to sky in front blank space peter through half closed eye watched woman by side from moment of entrance into library have summed up in mind with single word be beyond doubt adventuress woman must have proposed thing have proposed who be not of ilk yet for reason behoved to have care in dealing with at instigation have set out upon adventure might well turn out according to fashion that chose yet without bernadine what must do be not woman to carry on work have left behind for love of word have be frank action shameful natural bernadine be dead have realised quickly enough best market for secret in few day time friend must have come must have received nothing told that be foolish to doubt there be not flaw in sequence of event possible reason for suspicion yet lingered at back of brain intrigue be certain be to a breath of body be perfectly willing to believe that death of bernadine must have affected little more than sweeping aside of fly very common sense bade accept story by degree became drowsy suddenly be startled into very wideawake state through half closed eye have seen sogrange draw sheet of paper from pocket gold pencil from chain commence to write in middle of sentence eye be abruptly lifted be looking at baroness peter too turned head also looked at baroness without doubt have be watching of sogrange pencil continued task only traced more character instead seemed to be sketching face presently tore carefully up into small piece destroyed did not even glance towards peter peter understood very well what have happened have be about to send message have found baroness watching peter be fully awake now faint sense of suspicion have deepened into positive foreboding have reckless desire to stop car to descend upon road let secret of bernadine go where must then natural love of adventure blazed up once more moment of weakness have passed thrill be in blood nerve be tightened be ready for what might come seemingly still half asleep yet indeed with sense of intuition observation keenly alert sogrange leaned over from place be lonely country into be coming madame remarked shrugged shoulder indeed be not so lonely here a will think

in tree day long alone must not bear to morrow next day will pack up belonging come to london be unfortunately added with little sigh very very poor be hope that may find paper of have spoken to valuable sogrange smiled faintly peter must scarcely forbear to exchange single glance woman candour be almost brutal read thought ascend hill continued draw now very near to end of journey there be still one thing must say to think too badly of for what be about to do to bernadine whilst lived be faithful many time must have told of plan demanded great sum of money must have given willingly lip be sealed because in way loved while lived gave what owed to day be dead do can not concern more to day be free woman take side choose sogrange smiled suavely dear madame replied what have proposed to be after quite natural very gracious if one have fear at about matter be a to importance of document speak of bernadine know have dealt in great affair be diplomat by instinct experienced calculating

manoeuvre franked with name of one of own staff officer what must say went on to list of socialist deputy with amount against name amount paid in hard cash be of importance to madame sogrange answered simply for such information if be genuine must be hard to mention price must not be prepared to pay car came to sudden standstill first impression of two men be that baroness have exaggerated

remember sogrange reminded that baroness told that there be other save men servant here that be spy without master can not see that be dangerous one need however to watch time if see anything suspicious peter said tap table with forefinger personally will admit have have doubt of baroness on whole have come to conclusion that be groundless be not sort of woman to take up vendetta especially unprofitable one be exceedingly dangerous person for impressionable man like sogrange remarked arranging tie butler fetched in very few moment showed into pleasantly furnished library where
