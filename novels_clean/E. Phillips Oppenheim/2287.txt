dark mass black softthe body of man perhaps just above pair of eye gleamed at through semi darkness laverick at first have thought of tragedy might be tramp drunkard perhapsa fight man taken ill then something sinister about light of burning eye set heart beating faster struck match with firm finger bent forward what saw upon ground made feel little sick what saw racing away down passage prompted to swift pursuit down arched court into open space ran athlete mocked by swiftness of shadowlike form pursued at end be streetempty looked up down seeking in vain for sign of life there be nothing to tell way to turn opposite be very labyrinth of court turning there be not even sound of footfall to guide slowly retraced step lit match leaned over prostrate figure then knew that be tragedy indeed upon have stumbled man be dead have met with death by unusual mean be first two thing of laverick assured without doubt savage terrible crime have be committed hornhandled knife of unusual length have be driven up to hilt through heart of murdered man there have be other blow notably about head there be not much blood position of knife alone told ugly story laverick though nerve be of strongest

with twenty thousand pound of someone el money morally at rateprobably legally a wellhe be thief glimpse inside safe on part of astute detective might very easily bring under grave suspicion of being criminal of altogether deeper dye stephen laverick be in way something of philosopher in cold daylight with sound of water running into bath deed have done seemed to foolish reprehensible nevertheless realized absolute finality of action thing be done must make best of behaving in way like sensible man did not send for newspaper search hysterically for account of last night tragedy took bath a usual dressed with more than ordinary care sat down to breakfast before even unfolded paper item for searched occupied by mean so prominent position a have expected appeared under one of leading headline consisted of only few word read with interest without emotion afterwards turned to stock exchange quotation made note of few price in be interested completed in leisurely fashion excellent breakfast followed usual custom of walking along embankment a far a royal hotel where called taxicab drove to office little crowd have gathered around end of passage led from crooked friar laverick leaned forward looked curiously at spot where body of murdered man have lain seemed hard to to reconstruct last night scene in mind now that narrow street be filled with hurrying men stream of vehicle blocked inch of roadway in early morning mood thing be impossible in moment two paid driver dismissed fancied that certain relief be visible among clerk when opened door at precisely usual time with cheerful good morning made way into private office lit customary cigarette dealt rapidly with correspondence be brought in to by head clerk afterwards a soon a be alone opened safe thrust content of inner drawer into breast pocket took up once more hat glove be going around to bank told clerk a passed out will be back in hourperhaps le very good sir man answered will mr morrison be here morning laverick hesitated mr morrison will not be here to day be only few step to banker request for interview with manager be immediately granted latter received kindly with certain restraint there be not many secret in city morrison big plunge on particular mining share notwithstanding steady drop have be freely commented upon what can do for mr laverick banker asked be not sure answered laverick to tell truth be in somewhat singular position banker nodded have not doubt that understood exactly what that position be have perhaps heard laverick continued slowly that late partner mr morrison late partner manager interrupted laverick assented have few word last night explained mr morrison left office with understanding between that must not return will receive formal intimation of during course of next day so will revert to matter presently if wish immediate business with be to discus fact have to provide something like twenty thousand pound to day if decide to take up purchase of stock morrison have made understand position of course mr laverick if fail to do so manager remarked gravely naturally laverick answered be quite aware of fact that morrison acted on behalf of firm that be

serious attitude twenty thousand pound declared be great deal of money mr laverick be great deal of money laverick admitted be here to ask to lend to bank manager raised eyebrow dear mr laverick exclaimed reproachfully upon unimpeachable security laverick continued bank manager be conscious that have allowed little start of surprise to escape bit lip with annoyance be entirely contrary to

be of best laverick declared grimly have bank note here mr fenwick for twenty thousand pound bank manager be again guilty of unprofessional action whistled softly under breath very respectable client have always considered mr stephen laverick have certainly never suspected of being able to produce at pinch such evidence of mean laverick smoothed out note laid upon table mr fenwick said believe be right in assuming that when one come to one banker one enters a be into confessional feel convinced that nothing say to will be repeated outside office will be allowed to dwell in own mind except with reference to particular transaction between have right have not to take for granted most certainly banker agreed from strictly ethical point of view laverick went on money be not mine hold in trust for owner hold without condition have power to make what use wish of choose to day to use on own behalf whether be justified not be scarcely matter presume concern excellent banking establishment over preside so ably pay bank note in to account ask to credit with twenty thousand pound ask to allow to deposit here for seven day a security against overdraft can then advance enough money to meet engagement of to day banker took up note looked through one by one be very crisp very new absolutely genuine be somewhat extraordinary proceeding mr laverick said have doubt that must seem so to laverick admitted at same time there money be can run risk if be exceeding moral right in making use of note be who will have to pay will do a ask banker hesitated transaction be somewhat peculiar one on face of there must be possible risk at same time there be something about must not understand wish mr laverick remarked looking at thoughtfully seems to be to keep note out of circulation laverick returned gaze without flinching in sense be so assented on whole banker declared must prefer to credit to account in usual way be sorry laverick answered have sentimental feeling about prefer to keep note intact if can not follow out suggestion must remove account at once isnt threat mr fenwickyou will understand be sure be simply matter of business owing to morrison speculation have time for argument be quite satisfied to remain in hand feeling in matter be exactly a have stated can not change if be to retain account engagement for to day must be met precisely in way have pointed out banker excused left room for few moment when returned shrugged shoulder with air of one who be giving in to unreasonable client will be a say mr laverick announced note be placed upon deposit engagement to day up to twenty thousand pound will be duly honored laverick shook hand with talked for moment two about indifferent matter strolled back towards office have rather sense of man who move in dream who be living somehow in life doesnt belong to be doing impossible knew very well that name be in one mouth people be looking at sympathetically wondering how must have be fool a to become victim of irresponsible speculator one ever imagined that must be able to keep engagement have done price might be great one be prepared to pay at moment sensational news might be upon placard whole world might know that man who have be murdered in crooked friar last night have first be robbed of twenty thousand pound so far have felt curiously free from anything in shape of direct apprehension already however shadow be beginning to fall even a entered office sight of stranger offering office file for sale made start half expected to feel hand upon shoulder few word whispered in ear set teeth tight be risk must take for several hour remained in office engaged in scheme for redirection of policy with absence of morrison too there be other change to be madechanges in nature of

restraint at time during afternoon have sent out for one of early edition turned over now with firm finger there be absolutely fresh news one have come forward with suggestion a to identity of murdered man day long body have lain in mortuary visited by constant stream of curious presumably unrecognized laverick must scarcely believe word read thing seemed ludicrously impossible twenty thousand pound must have come from one why did keep silence be mystery about must be that be not in position to disclose fact curiously enough unnatural absence of news inspired with something be almost fear have taken risk boldly enough now that fate be playing unexpectedly good turn be conscious of growing nervousness who must have be man whence must have derived great sum one person at least must know that have be robbedthe man who murdered must know cold shiver passed through lavericks vein at thought somewhere in london there must be man thirsting for blood man who have committed murder in vain be robbed of spoil laverick have engagement for evening instead of going to club drove straight to room meaning to change little early for dinner go to theatre found there however small boy waiting for with note in hand be addressed in pencil only name be printed upon laverick tore open with haste only imperfectly concealed there be something ominous to in printed character content

particularly unsavory neighborhood laverick who have once visited partner somewhat extensive suite of room in jermyn street rang bell doubtfully door be opened almost at once not by servant by young lady who be obviously expecting before must open lip to frame inquiry have closed door behind will please come way said timidly laverick found in small sitting room unexpectedly neat with plainness of furniture relieved by certain undeniable trace of cultured presence girl who have followed stood with back to door little out of breath laverick contemplated in surprise be under medium height with small pale face wonderful dark eye brown hair be parted in middle arranged low down so that at first taking into account obvious nervousness thought that be child when spoke however knew that for reason be afraid voice be soft low be voice of woman be mr laverick be not asked looking at eagerly name be stephen laverick admitted understood must find mr arthur morrison here yes girl answered sent for note be from be here made movement to summon still stood in fact with back to door laverick be distinctly puzzled felt unable to place timid childlike woman with terrified face beautiful eye have never heard morrison speak of having relation presence in such locality indeed be hard to understand unless have met with accident morrison be one of young men who must have chosen hell with w rather than heaven e c be afraid laverick said that for reason other be afraid of can assure that be quite harmless added smiling wont sit down tell be matter be mr morrison in trouble yes answered be

really be perhaps be inclined to be short tempered admitted see to be frank with department of business be going wrong be one over morrison have have sole control have entered into certain speculation considered unjustifiable to day however matter took unexpected turn for better almost a spoke face clouded morrison of course must be triumphant perhaps must even expect to be reinstated for many reason be thing laverick did not desire now tell continued what be matter with morrison why have sent for if will pardon saying so why be here instead of in own room will explain began softly will please explain sitting down said firmly dont look so terrified added with little laugh can assure that be not going to eat anything of sort make feel quite uncomfortable smiled for first time laverick thought that have never seen anything so wonderful a change in feature strained rigidity passed away altogether softer light gleamed in wonderful eye be certainly by far prettiest child have ever seen a yet must not take altogether seriously thank said sinking down upon arm of easy chair first of then arthur be here because be brother brother laverick repeated wonderingly somehow other have never associated morrison with relation besides meant that must be of race there be nothing in face to denote except darkness of eye nameless charm of manner sort of ultra sensitiveness belongs sometimes to highest type of jew be not quality laverick thought must have associated with morrison sister brother in way resumed arthur father be widower mother be widow when be married be surprised there be reason why must be answered curiously relieved at last statement brother have be connected in business for year have seen very little of one outside dare say continued still timidly that arthur friend

from secret drawer worn brown leather pocket book first of all took out note laid upon table then felt pocket book over heart gave little leap be true what mademoiselle idiale have told on one side there be distinctly rustling a of paper opened case quite flat passed finger carefully over lining very soon found openingit be simply matter of drawing down stiff silk lining from underneath overlapping edge thrusting in finger drew out long foreign envelope securely sealed scarcely stopping to glance at rearranged pocket book replaced note locked up again then unbolted door sat down at desk with document have discovered on pad in front of there be not much to be made of there be address black seal at end bore impression of foreign coat of arm motto to be indecipherable held up to light outside sheet have not be written on gained idea a to content leaned back in chair for moment looked at so be document must probably reveal secret of murder in crooked friar alley be document mademoiselle idiale considered of so much more importance than fortune represented by packet of bank note what did mean be man who have expiated crime be victim of terrible vengeancewas politician dealer in trade secret member of secret society informer be one of underground criminal of world one of who crawl beneath surface of known thingsa creature of dark place perhaps during few minute when brain be cool active with great city awakening around laverick realized more completely than ever before exactly how stood without doubt be walking on brink of precipice four day ago there have be nothing for ruin mean of salvation have suddenly presented in startling dramatic manner without hesitation have embraced what did amount to how far be guilty of what be thief law must probably call so law might have even more to say must say that by keeping mouth closed a to adventure on night have ranged on side of criminalshe be guilty not only of technical theft of criminal knowledge of terrible crime event have followed upon one so rapidly during last few day that have little enough time for reflection little time to realize exactly how stood long expected boom in union coming of zoe strange advance made to by mademoiselle idiale incomprehensible connection with tragedy across have stumbled apparent knowledge of share in itthese thing be sufficient indeed to give food for thought laverick be not by nature pessimist other thing being equal must have made without doubt magnificent soldier for have courage of rare high order never occurred to to sit brood upon own danger rather welcomed opportunity of occupying mind with other thought yet in few minute while waited for business of day to commence looked exact position in face realized more thoroughly how grave really be how be to find way outto set right with law what must do with note be there untouched have only made use of in indirect way be there intact a have picked up upon fateful night be there possible chance by mean of might discover owner restore in way that name might never be mentioned eye repeatedly sought that envelope lay before inside must lie secret of whole tragedy must risk everything break seal must risk perhaps a much tell whole truth to mademoiselle idiale be strange dilemma for man to find in then a sat there business of day commenced pile of letter be brought in telephone in outer office began to ring thrust sealed envelope into breast pocket of coat buttoned up there for present must remain owed to to devote energy possessed to make most of great tide of business with set face closed door upon unreal world took hold of lever be to guide passage through one in be actual figure visit be not altogether unexpected yet when told that mademoiselle idiale be outside hesitated be lady who be here other day head clerk reminded made remarkably good choice of stock for must be showing nearly sixteen hundred pound profit perhaps want to realize in case have better show in said laverick came bringing with notwithstanding black clothes heavy veil atmosphere of strange world into somewhat severely furnished office skirt swept carpet with musical swirl carried with faint indefinable perfume of violetsa perfume altogether peculiar dedicated to by famous chemist in rue royale supplied to other person upon earth who else be there indeed who must have walked few yard a walked rose to foot pointed to chair have come to ask about share asked politely so far have nothing good news for recognized that spoke to in presence of clerk waved hand woman who will come to look after poor investment be nuisance suppose said indeed will not keep long few minute be that will ask of be beginning to find city affair so interesting be alone by now louise raised veil raised so high that must see eye leaned back in chair supporting chin with long exquisite finger of right hand looked at thoughtfully have examined pocket book asked have document be there document be there admitted perhaps can tell how must be addressed looking at closely came to that indifference be assumed be shivering slightly a though with cold imagine that there must be address said be right that document be in pocket what be going to do with asked what do advise to do with give to have claim leaned little nearer to at least have more claim to whispered than to twenty thousand pound claim replied be in safe at moment untouched be there ready to be returned to proper owner why do not find himwith note of incredulity in tone how be to do laverick demanded waste word continued coldly think that if leave with content of safe will be wise for to hand that document be inclined to do so laverick admitted very fact that knew of existence must seem to give sort of claim to mademoiselle idiale will answer few question think said that must be better if asked none listen begged be only person with whom have come into touch who seems to know anything about affair must rather like to tell exactly how stumbled in upon why can not exchange confidence for confidence want twenty thousand pound document want to be frank with nothing to escape from position be now in of being thief criminal show claim to document will have tell to whom that money belongs will be restored be incomprehensible declared be by chance playing part with do think that be worth while mademoiselle idiale laverick protested earnestly nothing in world be further from thought there be very little of conspirator about be plain man of business who stumbled in upon affair at critical moment dared to make temporary use of discovery can put if like be afraid want to get out nothing must give greater pleasure if such thing be possible than to send pocket book content anonymously to scotland yard never hear about again listened to with unchanged face yet for moment after have finished speaking be thoughtful may be speaking truth said if so have be deceived be not quite sort of man did believe be what tell be amazing may be true be truth laverick repeated calmly listen said after brief pause be at school be not with mr david bellamy know well who be perfectly well laverick admitted must consider person to be

beside life death be trivial happening laverick laughed shortly be matter of fact man there seemed something little absurd in such warning think declared that need have fear london be a doubtless find dull old city be remarkably safe one to live in nevertheless mr laverick repeated earnestly be on guard to day for sake bowed changed subject investment remarked will be content perhaps to leave a be be doubt of interest to to know that be showing already profit of considerably over thousand pound shrugged shoulder be excusethat investment declared yet money be always good keep for mr laverick do what will will trust judgment buy sell a please will let nothing prevent coming afternoon nothing promised from window of beautifully appointed little electric brougham held out hand in farewell think foolish know that persist said do beg that will remember what say be alone to day more than can help suspect one who come near to there may be trap before foot at moment be wary always forgetat five

secure absence from office at quarter to one with document in pocket safe securely locked laverick felt at ease a to result of attempted burglary of premise at same time curiosity be excited here perhaps be chance of finding clue to impenetrable mystery there be thee clerk in outer office put on hat despatched two of on errand in different direction last be obliged to take into confidence halsey said be going out to lunch at least wish to be thought that be going out to lunch a matter of fact will return in about ten minute by back way wish however to know want to have in mind have

in finger then stood once more quite still listening satisfied that one be disturbed closed door of safe softly moved once more to writing table with marvelous swiftness note be laid upon table pocket book be turned upside down secret place disclosedthe secret place be empty seemed to laverick that from hiding place must hear little oath of disappointment broke from thin red lip man replaced note with pocket book in hand hesitated laverick who thought that thing have gone far enough stepped lightly out from hiding place stood between unbidden visitor door have better put down pocket book ordered quietly man be upon with single spring laverick without slightest hesitation knocked prone upon floor where lay for moment motionless then slowly picked up spectacle be brokenhe blinked a stood there sorry to be so rough laverick said perhaps if will kindly realize that of two be much stronger man will be so good a to sit in chair tell meaning of intrusion man obeyed covered eye with
