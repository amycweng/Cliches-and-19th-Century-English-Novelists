have doubt be others who have followed in footstep in humbler way have shared success david have developed rare gift of silence smoked steadily expression be remarkably stolid find in need of sum marquis proceeded with air of man introducing business proposition of two hundred twenty thousand pound there thereabouts there be momentary gleam of interest in david eye gone however almost a soon a have appeared for first time made remark over million dollar eh marquis inclined head position continued naturally precludes from making use of of ordinary method by mean of men amass wealth have at various time however made small not entirely unsuccessful speculation upon stock exchange position in now find demand something upon larger scale what capital david thain enquired can handle marquis

in career david continued after moment pause must perhaps be surprised to hear have done very little speculating have made great purchase of railway land through railway must run because knew job because have insight time for be past now to make money rapidly one must a have already decided speculate can tell of speculation in have indulged for moment pretend that be certainty be good enough for to put in two million dollar if what believe happens two million will be forty million there be certainty marquis fidgeted in chair by what mean asked tentatively must interest in undertaking by

get exact information if have friend who understand oil prospecting marquis held out hand be not occasion upon further opinion be necessary declared approve of locality of property fact that be largely interested be sufficient for then time like to meet at lawyer david suggested will hand over share can sign note of hand for amount marquis considered matter for moment thoughtfully there be something about idea of letting mr wadham see sign promissory note for forty thousand pound occurred to a somewhat precarious perhaps have legal connection of own here ventured to tell truth have be

sun picking daisy buttercup watching for fish sometimes jumped from stream be entirely unexpected emotion when once more strode along footpath felt different man have lost slight touch of assurance looked about eagerly almost appealingly be ashamed to confess even to that have feeling of wanderer who have come home crossed last stile be now in park proper several villager be strolling about under tree looked at newcomer with dark coloured clothes strangely shaped hat with surprise nevertheless held uninterruptedly on way until reached broad drive led to abbey walked on turf by side of over bridge crossed stream through inner iron gate beyond village people be not allowed to pas so to well remembered spot on right be house strange uneven building at time ecclesiastical here there domestic always ancient with wing of cloister running almost down to moat surrounded just over moat crossed by light iron handbridge with back against what remembered a plantation have now become wood little red brick cottage smothered over with creeper tiny garden ablaze with flower empty row of dog kennel deserted line of coop david glanced for moment at drawn blind of abbey then crossed footbridge few yard of meadow lifted latch of gate walking up gravel path came to sudden standstill man who be seated almost hidden by great cluster of fox glove rose to foot be then lad exclaimed

admitted ushered into presence of marquis who laid down newspaper be reading nodded affably to visitor pointed to chair request for interview mr wadham former said anticipated own desire to see pray

yesterday morning from mr merridrew commenced made remittance be four hundred pound short of what expected explanation be that lordship have received that sum from quite right mr wadham marquis assented affably quite right be in neighbourhood finding mr merridrew with considerable sum of money in hand took from precisely amount have stated lordship have perhaps overlooked fact mr wadham continued that be amount short of interest on fakenham mortgage number seven mortgage usually call dear marquis observed surely such trifling sum doe not disturb calculation run affair on so narrow margin a trust mr wadham be question of narrow margin lordship mr wadham replied there be a rule no margin at usually have to make amount up by overdrawing by advancing time firm wish to point out that be unable to do dear dear marquis ejaculated in tone of concern have idea mr wadham if will forgive saying so that firm be in so impecunious position impecunious lawyer murmured with eye fixed upon client scarcely follow lordship did not understand to say marquis continued that trifle of four hundred pound have upset arrangement to extent that be unable to make customary payment on behalf will lordship forgive pointing out mr wadham explained that payment be on account that be part of business of solicitor to finance client without special arrangement have own more lucrative investment

having other fund of lordship at disposal be a have pointed out creditor for somewhat considerable amount marquis be leaning back in chair tip of long elegant finger pressed gently together appears to mr wadham said quietly that visit be in sense admonitory one firm resents be not right fact have found convenient to help to portion of revenue accruing from estate must not presume for moment to take up attitude lawyer protested on other hand four hundred pound in question requires replacement by to morrow find raising of sum inconvenient eh mr wadham young man be distinctly ill at ease instruction be to be firm dignified by mean to offend to deliver formal protest against tampering with fund already dedicate to do say nothing must give marquis excuse for reprisal against firm mr began to wonder whether perhaps be person of small tact whether instruction be more than usually difficult to carry out there be sacrifice lordship said slowly firm must hesitate to make in interest interest of mandeleys estate at same time unexpected necessity for finding sum of money be must confess at time strain upon marquis nodded sympathetically rose to foot crossed room towards desk unlocked with key attached to gold chain returned with bundle of scrip in hand have here mr wadham announced scrip in very famous oil company face value of share being believe trifle over forty thousand pound in fact paid that price for at beginning of week young lawyer uncrossed leg swallowed hard be prepared for many shock one seemed outside region of human probability did understand

increased amount actually paid for be in round figure forty thousand one hundred pound transfer duty something of sort have little head for figure a know mr wadham have better take not for sale mind for deposit at one of bank will probably find under circumstance will permit to overdraw additional five hundred pound on account without embarrassing own finance mr wadham junior took bundle of scrip

opinion of friend financial adviser mr david thain that forty thousand pound worth of share have in hand will be worth at least two hundred thousand before end of year mr david thain multi millionaire mr wadham faltered same lawyer gripped bundle hard in one hand closed eye for moment opened again struck out boldly a lordship adviser said may enquire a to nature of payment have made forty thousand

that press men be much better over here than in state in case mr wadham must believe read will give regard to father other member of firm marquis concluded with faintest possible indication of head towards door will probably have instruction of interesting nature to give before long with regard to cancellation of at rate home estate mortgage ah here be thomas very much obliged for attention mr wadham lawyer made adieu in somewhat confused fashion left room with ignominious sense of dismissal marquis glanced at clock be creature of habit mr thain said at twelve o'clock walk for hour in park

what be to tell truth dear marquis replied quite honestly be little ignorant a to humorous application of remark have just made be father definition of american institution lady letitia david explained be afraid that humour depended solely upon certain environment be able to conjure up in mind barroom at waldorf say disappointment letitia sighed mr thain be lunching with dear father announced so glad letitia remarked nodding to thain will meet again then passed out of front door david who be very observant noticing several thing be silent for first few moment after departure appeared a must scarcely fail to appear in eye charming even to point of bewilderment yet although wind be cold have only small very inadequate fur collar around neck tailormade suit showed sign of constant brushing there be little very modest little patch upon shoe very distinct darn upon glove david frowned in puzzled fashion a turned into park of boyish antipathy so carefully nursed by uncle fostered by atmosphere in lived during early day in america flashed into memory only to be instantly discarded remembered drawn blind weedy walk of mandeleys hasty glimpse have have of silent empty room uncarpeted way in higher storey of mansion in grosvenor square be not person marquis observed a proceeded upon promenade who need great deal of exercise be almost slave to habit for many year when in town have be custom to walk here for hour to exchange greeting perhaps with few acquaintance to call at club for ten minute take glass of dry sherry before luncheon in afternoon went on occasionally play round of golf at ranelagh be expert at game mr thain have made blasphemous effort david confessed certainly can not call expert perhaps what be known a american spirit have rather interfered with effort see want to get thing done too quickly golf be game eminently suited to british temperament be doubtless right marquis murmured that loitering backward swing eh lazy indisposition to raise one head follow mr thain call morning by by went on have news perhaps of pluto oil david shook head came to see announced upon different matter chapter xi marquis be occupied for several minute in exchanging greeting with passing acquaintance a soon a be alone again reverted to companion observation there be matter think said mr thain wished to discus with be going to ask about broomleys david replied marquis be puzzled broomleys be referring by chance to house of name guess so dear mr thain surprise marquis declared when did hear of broomleys must have explained david

be leaving within few day believe dear of course be marquis observed genially have quite forgotten fact quite forgotten marquis saluted more acquaintance be glad of opportunity for reflection fate be indeed smiling upon gleam of anticipatory delight shone in eye a thought of next interview with mr wadham junior on desk at present moment there lay letter from firm announcing colonel laycey departure adding that saw little hope of letting house at in present condition must be great pleasure to mr thain marquis continued pleasantly to have for neighbour did agent colonel laycey by by say anything about rent nothing david replied colonel pointed out to various repair certainly seemed necessary a be single man room affected must very well be closed for time be garden must confess

considerate last letter remember spoke of restoration must have meant couple of year rent if find little thing want doing urgently when get there david promised carelessly will have seen to myself if rent ask be not prohibitive be exactly place must like to take for say year at rate be man of modest taste mr thain marquis observed fact that be unmarried however of course render establishment unnecessary burden will bear in mind so far a regard rent of broomleys mr thain that house be furnished very uncomfortably very attractively furnished from what saw david assented marquis collected colonel laycey have be asked three hundred year be paying two hundred sum somehow other marquis have always considered own pocket money have never gone into estate account little increase must certainly be pleasant must five hundred year seem too much mr thain asked can not for moment remember what colonel laycey be paying know that be something ridiculously inadequate five hundred year must be quite satisfactory david agreed will have paper drawn up sent to at once marquis promised will be able to enter into possession a soon a like must like yearly tenancy presume must suit quite well will be able also to resume acquaintance with singular old man whom met upon steamer richard vont marquis remarked with slight grimace hear that be in residence there have already done so david

alliance with granthams must give much pleasure must in case be enabled to give up town house be content with bachelor apartment great saving in hard time naturally david murmured often in course of very agreeable conversation marquis went on be inclined to ignore fact of most amazing opulence few friend be sorry to say be in different position money in country be very scarce mr thain very scarce at least on side of temple bar david answered little vaguely eye be lifted above head of scattered crowd of people through be passing may ask if be not impertinence said be lady letitia engaged to lord charles grantham marquis manner be perhaps shade stiffer mr thain be just given to understand about family matter of such personage a marquis of mandeleys there must always be certain reticence

than must like to say what do see over there mr thain broke off suddenly following steadfast gaze david dropped eye from cloud finger relaxed nervous clutch of side of chair nothing answered be interested please go on reginald have stuck at nothing to get money duchess continued have be on board of company willing to pay few guinea for name believe thing have come to such pitch in direction that most foolhardy investor throw prospectus away if name be on have drained relative dry yet if can reconcile thing be in way very soul of honour now having told can do a please if lend money will

servant be waiting at window to show david out latter turned back be not making fool of with letitia be david be very white cold for moment looked hostess in face a expressed afterwards froze up be afraid that understand duchess said oh be silly replied remember that be oldest friend in country say like to everybody avoid most woman a must plague most woman except letitia have warned against

nice a can be though run along forget that be coming to dine on friday will meet chancellor of exchequer be going to try persuade to settle down here for sake of income tax plunderer david groaned be beginning to feel rather like lamb with exceedingly long fleece must look better with hair cut duchess remarked a waved hand try place at bottom of bond street duke always go there mr saunders be man better ask for will find at top end of room chapter xiii there be just one drop of alloy in perfect contentment with marquis contemplated new prospect be contained in telephone message from mr wadham junior received upon afternoon of david call upon duchess must apologise for troubling lordship mr wadham began know objection to telephone in instance be quite impossible to send message accept apology be listening marquis declared graciously be so good a to speak quite slowly mumble mr wadham junior cleared throat before continuing be little proud of voice although rise fall be perhaps more satisfactory from point of view of chancery court than from one who expected to gather sense of syllable be ringing up lordship continued concerning large batch of share in pluto oil company of arizona entrusted to for safe keeping for deposit with bank against advance required last monday can hear perfectly marquis acknowledged suavely pray continue lordship banker sent for morning mr went on in connection with share thought duty to point out through by communication with direct that according to advice of most reliable broker commercial value be practically nil be what marquis demanded nil nix not worth cent mr wadham junior proclaimed emphatically marquis in slang phraseology must have be first to decry never turned hair have not least intention moreover of permitting interlocutor at other end of telephone even momentary sensation of triumph can present compliment to manager said tell that value of share in question doe not concern broker in case must not possibly have information concerning company a be only just registered have not yet commenced operation understand mr wadham perfectly lordship be smooth reply fact remains however that broker do know something about company person interested in that knowledge regret to say be most unfavourable felt duty therefore to pas on fact be exceedingly obliged to for anxiety on behalf marquis declared legal interest be be quite sure safe in hand financial affair outside financial affair be to say prefer to keep under own control might remind that share be supported came into hand in fact through agency of mr david thain great financier there be moment pause have not forgotten fact mr wadham admitted diffidently certainly seems improbable that mr thain must introduce risky investment to lordship within few week of arrival in country at same time feel compelled of course to bring to notice broker report quite so marquis acquiesced kindly let people concerned know that be acting in matter upon special information good day mr wadham compliment to father so conversation terminated marquis for remainder of day felt a though just shadow of cloud rested upon happiness twice stared at address of david room occupied prominent place upon study table on occasion resisted impulse to seek out obtain reassurance needed buried instead in review letitia came in to see on way back from aunt tea party marquis carefully made note of place laid down periodical found aunt well trust dear oh be right letitia replied have irritating lot of caller there though father nodded sympathetically extraordinary habit people in rank of life seem to have developed lately for making friend outside own sphere be making society very difficult declared member of own family be be afraid amongst transgressor whom did meet afternoon letitia mentioned few name listlessly mr thain concluded father betrayed interest mr thain be there eh understood that be much averse to paying call looked a though have be roped in letitia observed aunt be over apologising to for having other people there wanted to consult seems about something other turned over to until be ready marquis enquired with questioning sympathy be perhaps bored not bored exactly rather irritated think be like in respect father letitia went on smoothing out glove prefer to find intimate within circle of own relative connection person like mr thain in way disturbs that marquis regretted be unfortunate a be likely to be neighbour at mandeleys shrugged shoulder oh be of consequence replied will never feel slightest compunction in anything might do say to if pay more for broomleys than be worth have advantage of countenance imagine to person in position make bargain equal mr thain doe not seem to to be one of men who must part with anything unless got return money nowadays marquis reflected pressing tip of finger together be marvellously revitalising influence people whose social position be almost if not quite equal to own have even taken into family through marriage letitia very charming mouth twitched lip parted laughed softly nothing amused more than extraordinary blindness of father to actual fact such for instance a lee woollen mill do hope remarked that be not thinking of offering up dad on altar of god of dollar dear child marquis protested can truthfully proudly say that be acquainted with young woman of position in connection with whom suggestion must be more sacrilegious have sometimes hoped went on that matter be already on eve of settlement in direction know be sure letitia answered thoughtfully sometimes think have great many more feeling dad than sole remaining daughter of right honourable reginald thursford marquis of mandeleys ought to posse fact be there be time when ca stand charlie anywhere near a to discussing subject of reasonable interest well can only see anything from own point of view be always wrong then marquis observed appear to share rather to posse essential for domestic happiness constant propinquity in married people of middle lower class be forced to live be doubt responsible in many case for early termination of domestic happiness always thought middle class be horribly virtuous letitia yawned however thursday night dad be dining out be thursday night marquis repeated telling for hundredth time with bland ease falsehood have almost ceased to have even intention to deceive yes dine at club to night dear bent over kissed forehead remember dear enjoined that wish to develop feeling of positive dislike towards mr thain such people have us in world must not forget that letitia laughed at understandingly closed door in silence chapter xiv marcia more especially perhaps during later day felt sense of humour gently excited time crossed threshold of trewly

more carefully than now be one first class restaurant in london to gilded youth of aristocracy perhaps sire might indulge in indiscretion of entertaining young lady from italian chorus without fear of meeting staider relative world of bohemian fashion have changed law since day trewly have be left high dry save for small clientele who remembered former glory esteemed cellar cuisine belonged to world marquis knew world whose maxim still recognised after year must still have thought committing breach of social etiquette if have invited marcia to lunch with at ritz carlton drank claret decanted with zealous care served by black aproned cellarman who waited anxiously by until marquis have gravely sipped first glassful approved dinner to day be very much what have be dozen year ago french fed chicken artichoke strawberry served with liqueur remained whatever season conversation marcia leaned back in chair for moment again corner of lip twitched a remembered faithfully year after year must trace conversation courtly old fashioned criticism of event of week criticism from one infallible standard standard of immutable whiggism upon constitution rested conversation with passing

empty profitless evening have be day by day after lunch sent out same message to chauffeur five o'clock for club instead of three o'clock for battersea on occasion word seemed to leave lip with more reluctance walked morning in park a carefully dressed a upright a ever one two of acquaintance noticed certain difference there be increased pallor listlessness of gait seemed to bespeak absent preoccupied mind even welcomed coming one morning just a be starting for promenade of mr wadham junior here at least be diversion mr wadham junior have be rehearsing interview prospective deportment towards marquis on way up started enterprise to own entire satisfaction entered library with exceedingly serious air took great pain to be sure that door be closed after retreating butler before did more than respond to distinguished client greeting anything fresh wadham latter enquired have ventured to see lordship once more mr wadham began with reference to scrip deposited at bank to meet certain liability on behalf well what about marquis asked good humouredly lawyer know nothing of stock exchange mr wadham assumed expression of great gravity must lordship begged for satisfaction of firm member of think will admit have always be devoted to lordship interest ring up stockbroking firm of say messrs young fielden company other like with reference to value of share be unfortunately marquis replied not in position to do so share be sold by personal friend be content to believe that if have not be of face value transaction must not have be suggested to that mr wadham declared seriously be not business happens to be only way in can look upon matter be cool reply to proceed little further lawyer continued be here to enquire solely in own interest a matter of business whether have made definite agreement to pay for share be under impression that lordship mentioned note of hand have signed marquis acknowledged bill believe document be called for forty thousand pound due in about two month time have lordship idea a to how liability be to be met none at be possible that share will have advanced in value sufficiently to justify selling if not take that bank will advance sum against scrip mr wadham junior must scarcely contain doe lordship know exclaimed that bank hesitated about advancing sum of le than thousand pound upon security of share marquis yawned will probably have changed mind in two month time remarked if have not mr wadham persisted be unfortunate proclivity of who be immersed in narrow way of legal procedure client observed to look only upon worst side of matter personally be optimist rather expect to make fortune on share be belief of firm on contrary mr wadham confessed gloomily that will end in petition in bankruptcy being presented against lordship marquis shook out handkerchief wiped lip lit cigarette yours appears to be rather dismal errand mr wadham said coldly be there reason why must detain further none so long a have made quite clear that there be prospect of raising single half penny in excess of mortgage already completed matter of forty thousand pound draft be of course entirely in lordship hand thought duty to inform a to value of share in case be able to persuade gentleman who sold to to cancel transaction mean well wadham doubt marquis declared little patronisingly a said before turn of mind be too legal respect to father will forgive ringing will not lady letitia be waiting for to walk with mr wadham departed saying blasphemous thing way into piccadilly marquis walked with lady letitia in park a rule conversation although mostly of personal matter be conducted in light hearted fashion enough by letitia responded to with certain dry though stately humour by father morning however silence amounted almost to constraint reigned between marquis realising finally dragged thought with difficulty away from own affair have intended to speak to letitia began concerning announcement of marriage festivity must naturally follow meeting between myself duke whom hate like poison dad letitia said with little grimace well so do for matter of one personal feeling be scarcely of account in case marquis averred be to say personal feeling with exception of yours grantham match be suitable in way at time when young man of account be being chased by new race of ineligible young woman must be comfort to family to contemplate alliance like letitia shrugged shoulder with regard to actual announcement dad said be going to keep to ourselves for few week longer at rate until be safely settled in country be such bore to have one have ever spoken to in life come rushing round to wish happiness that sort of thing charlie rather agrees with matter naturally be in hand marquis replied with slight air of relief of course be seeing rather more of charlie letitia went on people wo take notice of there have be rumour of engagement at least dozen time already be getting just little sick dad

on hall table where note be left for of old fashioned silver salver laid by side on breakfast table upon letter be placed thought of queer new feeling with day by day glanced through opening none searching always covering disappointment by mean of ingenious remark of day when returned from such walk a from club eye glued upon sideboard even while butler be relieving of coat glove morning accumulated sickness little throb of disappointment seemed to be lumped into one gigantic intolerable depression so that knee even trembled little while walked foot felt a though be shod with lead remembered sleepless night thought of dull ache came to sometimes in still hour when lay fancied that must hear voice cheerful laugh tender touch of finger felt sudden overmastering desire to be free at rate from that minute by minute agony at mandeleys there must be only post perhaps if made up mind to leave town earlier than have expected must not be breaking word to if sent just line to tell of changed plan country by mean so far a be concerned letitia said think have never before felt so strongly desire to leave london suppose that if be content to take thing quietly must collect few

be young make most of come when send for so david rode off up broad slope of great park along wonderful beech avenue out on to highway turned in saddle for moment looked towards road from london chapter xxiv marquis with after breakfast cigarette in mouth strolled out of front door few morning later to find face to face with richard vont called letitia who be behind worst have happened groaned letitia stood by father side looked across stone flag across avenue with central bed of gay coloured flower ring fence moat few yard of park to where just inside little enclosed garden richard vont be seated directly facing well expected did father observed same marquis declared with frown be irritating thing to have man seated there within hundred yard of front door with bible on knee cursing be convinced now more than ever that case against man must have be grossly mismanaged law must never permit such indignity letitia stepped back for moment to light cigarette then rejoined father contemplated that somewhat grim figure critically if be going to do that time marquis went on will have nerve will have to live in back part of house letitia gravely considered matter why try talking common sense to suggested perhaps few word from must make difference be probably sitting there with gun father sighed however be idea letitia will try strolled across avenue through little iron gate in railing across moat by footbridge when have approached within dozen pace of paling however richard vont rose to foot be nigh enough lord mandeleys called out nigh enough for own safety marquis advanced with usual leisurely aristocratic walk to edge of paling richard vont stood glaring at like wild beast there be sign of weapon about former said have right park be mine so far a paling just a garden be yours where be have fancy for shouting have word to say to say begone then vont exclaimed fiercely really marquis expostulated be behaving in most unreasonable manner be here to discus past for wrong may consider have done express regret suggest to that daughter present position in life must reconcile to what have happened daughter brain money make honest woman of marquis sighed wearily outlook vont said be full of prejudice utterly illogical found quality in daughter endeared to have lived perfectly reputable engrossing life ever since left home life a must not possibly have lived under roof in part of world in way that count have prospered therefore ask to reconsider matter claim that wrong may have done be expiated suggest that abandon attitude pardon be just little theatrical put aside that very excellent book else read a whole give hand 'd cut off first vont declared savagely be rank prejudice marquis protested seems so to belike be scornful answer clever folk who can crowd brain with thought idea from book have room there for big thing have so many little weed growing up around that flower doe count nought that can say about marcia can alter matter sooner have seen married to poorest creature on land than to know that have lived a dependent for year marquis shook head sorrowfully be obstinate old man vont said very selfish one be wrapped up in own narrow idea wo even allow one else to show truth marcia have be happy with must have be most miserable creature on earth married to clod ay be be here to show vont muttered down in motor car in fur silk like creature from world know not about be talked a have talked have listened to pair of thrust daughter out of garden bade go away learn truth well just take leave to say that a cursed nigh on score of year ago have cursed in heart ever since so curse now be going to sit there day doing marquis enquired little irritably house garden be mine richard vont replied stolidly although have done best to beggar by taking away when choose will sit here when choose will sit watch with guest watch morning noon night have one wish in heart hour by hour maybe wish will reach home marquis of mandeleys if doe will see in black along churchyard path there hear door of vault roll open be little mixed in simile friend marquis remarked because know if thing happen to will be one person who doe hear still gather that be implacable be came to find out what astonishingly fine hollyhock observed a turned away must go look at own for moment there be tragedy in vont clenched fist fierce convulsive movement forward marquis however without backward glance lounged carelessly away finding letitia strolled with to walled garden man be impossible proclaimed be obviously intention to sit there make nuisance well get used to everything may get used to richard vont letitia hesitated for few moment said there be certain subject be not a rule mentioned if will permit marquis stopped dear please not begged little stiffly remember if will have little in common with somewhat modern school of thought indulged in by most of friend there be certain subject can not be discussed between let hear what mr hale have to say hat in hand head gardener have hastened down to meet under tutelage explored domain master murmured little word of congratulation have done best lordship man observed mr merridrew have be cruel hard on for bulb seed plant a to shrub young tree will not have word to say marquis nodded sympathetically may be able to alter next year hale promised mr merridrew know have have great trouble with tenant for last few quarter next year mr hale will see what can do gardener once more doffed cap received intelligence with gratified interest over top of hill small governess cart drawn by fat pony came into sight letitia waved hand to girl who be driving be sylvia laycey murmured now how on earth can that child still be at broomleys if mr thain be really here sylvia explained matter a drove into great stableyard letitia walking on one side of marquis on other of course have left broomleys told be staying with medlingcourts for three four day asked at last moment then letter came letitia just in time be simply crazy to come stay with letitia lucky girl be going to be here time be simply foolish about about whom letitia asked indifferently why mr david thain of course be nicest thing have ever talked to lunched with on thursday of course be in love with too so there will be chance for letitia laugh be half amused half scornful if be in earnest sylvia said doe seem very likely can assure that need fear rival mr thain doe not appeal to have nevertheless found mr thain marquis observed suddenly reminding of presence very agreeable interesting acquaintance sylvia made little grimace thrust arm through letitia drew off towards lawn where chair have be brought out under cedar tree be such wonderful person letitia said of course father marquis mine be thought nowadays american be good enough for anybody in world if only have enough money father see letitia observed be little old fashioned have never have idea of marriage except with one whose family knew about of course sylvia declared be horrid radical think 'd sooner not know about mine if mr thain antecedent be unmentionable must adore just same a know father must remind in very delicate fashion if be here situation be different mind talking about do letitia because be what have come for well will listen letitia promised a settled in easy chair really know what must find to say except be moderately good looking have quite nice manner money enough to buy whole county be fearfully severe sylvia sighed of course have be talking rot a always do did find charming letitia daddy be so simple unaffected drove into fakenham bought cutlet for luncheon when come to think of went on with look of horror in face believe paid for too can well afford to letitia laughed marquis came to across lawn held in hand open telegram from grantham dear said to letitia appears that be bored with town proposes to come down to morrow night instead of waiting until saturday have replied that will be very welcome mr foulds will really have to bestir have line from caroline too to ask if may stay for couple of day on way to harrogate letitia rose to foot cloud have fallen upon face be doubtless owing to housekeeping care marquis shading eye with hand be gazing across park really remarked little drily will have to hint to new neighbour that turf be several hundred year old be not meant to be cut up like prairie land sits horse well though sylvia jumped quickly up letitia gazed in direction father have indicated david on black horse be riding across park towards broomleys chapter xxv marquis a sat at study table after lunch be not inclined to regard first day at mandeleys a success only post of day have be delivered letter for be waiting with anxiety greater than even realised be still absent there be letter however from mr wadham afforded food for thought be personal letter written by head of firm perused for second time with frown upon forehead dear lord mandeleys have ventured in interest to do what son tell felt hesitation in doing namely have made enquiry through firm of stockbroker who make speciality of american oil share a to pluto oil company limited of whose share have made so large purchase find that development of property have taken place very little if machinery have be erected oil have ever be discovered in locality upon estate may beg of that to avoid disastrous consequence at once see friend from whom purchased share endeavour to make arrangement with to take off hand a be doubtless tendered to by false representation be quite sure that need not point out to lordship that write letter entirely without prejudice in interest of mandeleys name estate there must be possibility of draft executed by lordship being met unless share provided fund under existing condition appears impossible respectfully yours stephen wadham marquis looked out upon lawn there be in memory too recent serious conversation with mr merridrew concerning accumulating charge for dilapidation upon property watched david playing croquet with sylvia laycey with deepening frown upon face glanced from to where letitia sat apparently absorbed in book be reading from looked through side window towards hated little demesne across moat where richard vont in shabby brown velveteen suit with white hair motionless figure seemed to dominate otherwise peaceful prospect somehow other outlook irritated almost a much a own mental condition hard pressure of circumstance be asserting in mind found struggling against insidious longing to see letitia in sylvia place in way be superstitious even began to wonder whether silent ceaseless hate daily litany of curse must really in way be responsible for increasing embarrassment by be surrounded that great dumb anxiety kept with wide open eye at night sent about in daytime with constant wearing pain at heart turned at last wearily away from window rose to foot opened french door led out into garden strolled across lawn to where letitia be seated laid down book welcomed with smile have in just shade of fatigue friend thain observed seems to be success with miss sylvia letitia turned head watched sylvia have already confided to ardent admiration marquis sighed a sank into chair letitia glanced at little anxiously anything wrong dad nothing must depress one on wonderful day be more state of mind than anything fancy be born few hundred year too late money again nodded be one of most humiliating feature of modern existence declared to find course of one daily life interfered with by paltry necessity of pound shilling penny one inherits great name went on ruminatively great tradition estate brimful of association with illustrious ancestor in one daily life one sense of dignity one whole position be time affected may say poisoned by lack of one commodity be proof of greatness even deserving be very poor indeed letitia sighed be anything fresh mr merridrew have be here morning father continued have spoken to very seriously about condition of whole estate repair rebuilding have be effected for year whole of rent a have be received have be required to pay interest on mortgage mr merridrew add that scarcely dare show before one of tenant to whose just demand be continually promising attention considers that unless whole of next quarter rent be spent in making repair will lose tenant property will be immensely deteriorated there be share mr thain sold reminded hopefully must take for what be worth said have private letter from mr wadham morning in tell frankly that have received report indicating that share be worthless worthless letitia exclaimed bewildered father nodded begs earnestly to appeal to mr thain to take off hand even if must bring to contemplate step must even then be faced with fact that adopting mr merridrew view there be fund to provide interest on mortgage next quarter day letitia glanced once more uneasily towards david thain worthless repeated understand father do really believe that mr thain must do ill turn like marquis shook head can conceive possible reason for action declared have not injured in way on contrary have at aunt caroline solicitation offered hospitality somewhat rarely accorded by dear to person of nationality position letitia made little grimace aunt caroline look at from different point of view doe aunt be intensely modern marquis agreed be modern too without real necessity outlook upon life be one considering descent can not understand think father letitia asked squarely that however disagreeable may be ought to speak to mr thain about share must probably tell something must relieve mind might offer to take back marquis be silent for moment probably one in world except letitia knew how much cost to say next few word will do so promised will find early opportunity of doing so at same time in absence of more definite information prefer to retain belief in value sylvia david came strolling towards former be looking almost distressed letitia dear be horrid said must go now promised mr medlingcourt 'd be back to tea have stupid people coming in have have wonderful game of croquet be quite sure must make expert of mr thain in very short time can have pony cart please letitia what time will come on thursday will be ready for time like letitia replied so please suit

declared bring father over to see will mark out croquet court at broomleys will come promised drove away david too turned to take leave so nice of to entertain little visitor letitia said smiling graciously upon be charming be quite replied will show way into park from flower garden continued save little led way across lawn very erect very graceful very indifferent david walked by side with hand behind must find country pursuit relaxation after more strenuous life observed find very pleasant to morrow letitia told aunt arrives for day two be almost a popular with know a seem to be with duchess repeated did not know that be coming here be kind enough to ask to go to scotland later on will be very foolish if go then letitia advised rossdale grouse moor be almost best in scotland aunt caroline be staying here for two day on way to harrogate must dine with on thursday night will be so disappointed if doe not see at once be very kind lady letitia said fear that be inclined to encroach upon hospitality picked rose held to lip for moment must amuse aunt caroline observed languidly be many year since imposed a visitor here dine at quarter past eight be gate passed through turned to make farewell left hand be resting upon iron railing right supported parasol nodded to little curtly promised reminded that day must come over help about garden did answered well remind sometime wo why not now persisted shook head have to go consult with mr foulds a to where to put visitor charlie grantham be coming with aunt think have so many room closed up fall into moat there be bridge just to left turned away david watched for several moment before swung round be conscious of sudden entirely purposeless feeling of anger almost of fury from higher slope of park turned looked once more towards mandeleys letitia have evidently forgotten household duty have thrown back in chair be once more apparently engrossed in book chapter xxvi david thain few hour later lounged in basket chair in one corner of lawn from must catch through hedge of yew tree furtive glimpse of mandeleys by side stood small coffee equipage unopened box of cigar in distance be vanishing figure of quiet mannered very excellent butler with whom famous registry office have endowed household be hour of supreme ease unusually warm day be succeeded by evening from only warmth of sun have departed evening full of scent from flower shrub alike evening during thrush prolonged music until from somewhere in distant grove at back of house nightingale commenced like tuning up of orchestra to make faint sweet essay at continued song be a light a day there be star already in sky pale colourless moon be there waiting for slowly moving mantle of twilight david thain be alone with thought have started somewhere in background in first throb excitement of life in moment when lip have framed that horrible oath held now in mesh then have come real struggle year of brilliant success final coup stepping in single day on to one of pedestal great republic keep for most worshipped son always seemed to that there be that old man in background waiting at last have come question yes be ready have come to england little protesting little incredulous always believing that fierce fire have burned for so long in grey haired patient old man must have burned out must become softened by sentimental association a soon a set foot in native place david awakening be complete disconcerting fury of richard vont showed sign of abatement found committed already to one loathsome enterprise there be future looked down gloomily at magnificent pile below with many chimney stretching front far reaching wing echo of bitterness raged in old man who sat watched at gate found echo in own heart remembered amusement with subtle absolutely natural air of superiority on part of father daughter alike have first imbued very kindness frank effort of marquis a well a of lady letitia to lead into channel of conversation in must easily express be kindness of belonging to world fearing lest consciousness of might depress visitor with resentment be mingled feeling not exactly acquiescence american education have be too strong for admiration for inherent gift seemed to bring with certain grace carried into even smaller matter of life perhaps exaggerated to importance a sat there in soft gathering twilight poured out neglected coffee still played with unlighted cigar rook have ceased to caw above head of peace of night be stealing down upon land in window of mandeleys little pinprick of light be beginning to show iron hand gate led from park into domain be suddenly opened closed way led through grove of tree through gate into garden turned head watched spot where figure of visitor must appear be curious that from first although common sense must have told how impossible such thing be have intuitive presentiment a to who visitor might be laid down unlighted cigar upon table leaned little forward in chair first heard footstep falling softly upon carpet of pine needle yielding turf slowly too a though movement of owner be in sense reluctant then slim tall figure in white familiar figure be up in moment striding forward have already passed through gate however be moving towards across lawn lady letitia exclaimed nodded please look a though 'd done anything so terribly unusual begged what pleasant spot have chosen for coffee david new treasure proved fully equal to occasion from unseen point of vantage seemed to have foretold coming of visitor prepared to minister to entertainment lady letitia sank into chair praised coffee so much better than stuff have be trying to drink told david must bring dad round one evening love good coffee how beautiful tree be tree reminded shrugged shoulder seems age since be here remarked sylvia be away when be down last dad colonel laycey be annoyed with one about repair want repair do mr thain have arranged to do be necessary david told in consideration of somewhat reduced rent be glad consider reduced letitia observed of course think be mad to come see like added little aggressively not in least replied must not have ventured to have expected visit now that be here seems quite natural after why be agreed walked round garden once thinking about certain matter in be concerned then walked in park occurred to that must probably be sitting out here only few hundred yard away just a be doing that must if must set mind at rest if can do that said be very glad that came be going to unburden mind then continued be about share sold father mr thain manner seemed to quick apprehension instantly to stiffen nevertheless be expectant be willing to go through good deal if only must hear voice for once falter if even tone must lose half wearied half insolent note if must raise eye speak to a woman to man pluto oil share murmured well of course father have least right to buy went on because have penny in world must possibly pay for unless fetched a much when payment fell due a gave for be rather stupid at thing mr thain understand perfectly long finger stole into cigarette box accepted light from leaned back once more in chair father proceeded have most implicit faith in everybody fact that be american millionaire be ample proof to that anything in way of share possessed must be worth great deal more than face value know led to buying probably do did asked for assurance a to intrinsic value warned david said that be entirely speculation asked advice a to way of raising large sum of money much larger than must hope to gain by ordinary enterprise presumed that be willing to speculate suggested share certainly be a speculative a man must desire be worth more now than when father bought enquired to best of belief have not moved replied a matter of fact have not yet have chance to prove be still worth dollar share then be worth dollar share a much a be when father bought turned head looked at father said decline to ask question must consider in bad taste to suggest for moment that felt uneasiness with regard to necessary payment for be none le however worried be foolish enough to tell lawyer about lawyer be afraid have very little faith in a business man result of enquiry made be most depressing probably must be david assented forty thousand pound worth of share letitia continued be worth a much now a when father bought be suppose nothing to wondered whether must object to have back again think that must relieve father mind thain be silent for moment have cigar now be smoking steadily have not much idea of business lady letitia remarked business repeated with note of surprise in tone how must have there be certain matter of common sense of honour suppose be common to one of reasonable intelligence there did not seem to to be principle of business involved in supposing david said share have risen be worth two dollar to day must not in case presume have honoured with visit certainly not replied did not sell share to father a act of philanthropy continued asked to show speculation showed share so far a know be a likely to be worth five time value next week nothing at be very large holder seemed to that must be reasonable act of prudence to sell few of at price showed small margin of profit profit repeated wonderingly be in need of profit be poison of wealth observed one be always trying to add to what one have turned head looked at intently for moment be almost startled there be something unreal in sound of word something be almost foreboding chilled mr thain said calmly yes have reason special reason mean for selling share to father face be inscrutable what reason must have lady letitia ca imagine replied yet for moment thought that be talking artificially probably did injustice be sorry david teeth came together there be lightning in eye a glanced down through tree towards vont little cottage apologise too soon lady letitia warned raised eyebrow be not accustomed to think worst of people said can scarcely picture to myself person already inordinately wealthy singling out father a victim for further cupidity let return to question have already asked must care without letting father know of visit request to return cheque promissory note whatever be in exchange for share be not even sure lady letitia reminded after moment pause that father wish can think take word that must be relief to asserted pondered for few moment light through tree seemed to be burning brighter in vont sitting room will be frank with lady letitia said there have be increase in value of share news have expected concerning have not arrived transaction therefore be one at present moment must probably entail loss do wish to make father present of twenty thirty thousand pound rose deliberately to foot shook few grain of cigarette ash from dress cigarette threw into laurel bush understand remarked what implied when said that woman did not understand business tone be unhurried manner expressed indignation yet a strolled towards gate david felt colour drained from cheek felt wicker side of chair crash in grip of finger rose hurried after lady letitia began impulsively turned upon a though surprised pray trouble to escort home begged be that went on falling into step by side make feel like thief be not thief asked have be told that nearly very rich men be thief begin to understand that may be so be possible to juggle with money honestly assured be also possible suppose observed with faint sarcasm to lower standard of honesty thank added a passed through second gate perhaps did not understand must prefer to return alone be going way insisted desperately way repeated there be nowhere to go to unless be proposing to honour with call at mandeleys be going in to see old richard vont said laughed in surprised fashion what old man who sits curse be friend of yours be on steamer coming home david reminded told so before take interest in point now be momentarily gained walked unhindered by side soft twilight have fallen around little wreath of mist be floating across meadow bird be silent pathway led through narrow grove of tree a neared gate letitia hesitated think be just a near across meadow said held open gate for have better stay on path advised grass be wet shoe be thin looked into face still hesitating then swiftly dropped eye man must be mad nevertheless seemed for moment to lose will gate have fastened behind with sharp click be in grove way be very narrow fir tree almost black there be only glimpse of deep blue sky to be seen ahead in front pigeon rustled wing great owl lumbered across way something happened to letitia then have never happened before felt hand gripped by man felt powerless in grasp lady letitia exclaimed feverishly think be fool will not ask for what have got to give will have father note will have for what will make free if will only treat like human being if
