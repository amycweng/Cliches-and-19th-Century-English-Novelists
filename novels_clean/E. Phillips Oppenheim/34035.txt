than one young woman from shop window pavement ventured to smile at few greeting received from wife daughter of neighbor be a gracious a must possibly be made john almost smiled once in act of raising hat a realized how completely whole charm of world for seemed to lie in one woman eye at crossway where must have turned up to inn paused while motor car passed contained woman who be talking to host

forgetfulness place in danger from friend here have just rescued do not best know word phrase will carry message of play across footlights who be to judge lady gentleman banged palm of left hand with rolled up manuscript looked at furiously slight middle aged man clean shaven with single eyeglass feature very well known to theatergoing world detached little from others one indeed dear m graillot admitted must possibly know thing so well a on other hand when write in study at fontainebleau write for quicker minded public than ours phrase must find way at once to brain of french audience need will say just little amplification to carry equal weight across footlights of theater will admit that be dealing with translation be in way not sufficiently literal friend shamus here have pointed out to difficulty fact be m graillot that of finest phrase in work be untranslatable there be time dramatist asserted moistening lip vigorously with tongue when regret that ever suffered mr shamus anybody else to attempt to translate inimitable play into language wholly inadequate to express charm subtlety quite so actor remarked sympathetically still since deed have be done m graillot since be going to produce result in course of fortnight so lose great deal of money think that have better try utmost to insure success of production only success care for graillot thundered be artistic success with miss maurel playing leading part m graillot actor manager declared not to speak of company carefully selected to best of judgment think may venture to anticipate even that dramatist bowed hurriedly to louise recall to fact said gallantly almost reconciles to diabolical travesty of of line proceed then proceed will be a patient a possible stage manager shouted out direction from box gentleman in faultless morning clothes who seemed to have be thoroughly enjoying interlude suddenly adopted puppetlike walk of footman other actor who have be whispering together in wing came back to place louise

of philistine with satisfaction have fear cher ami faraday mother will bring unmarried daughter to see play will watch without blush if there be anything to make others think will be beneath surface will be for great artist whom be supreme joy to watch went on bowing to louise to act express real truth of idea through music of innocent word then be arranged mile faraday concluded briskly will leave second act until tomorrow then m graillot will bring revision will proceed now to next act stand back little if please lady gentleman miss maurel will make entrance louise made movement eye be fixed upon certain shadowy corner of wing overwrought a have seemed few minute ago with emotional excitement of long speech there be now new curious expression upon face seemed to be looking beyond

in play to louise quitted chair to follow direction of friend eye faraday with frown of actor manager resenting intrusion gazed in same direction to sophy newcomer be simply handsomest young man have

be surrounded forgot existence of famous dramatist who hung upon word close presence of prince foot no longer trod dusty board of theater be almost painfully conscious of perfume of apple blossom exclaimed stretching out hand why do not come speak to be here john came out upon stage french dramatist with hand behind back made swift mental note of interesting situation saw coming of man who stood like giant among sunburnt buoyant with health eye bright with wonder of unexpected surroundings man in whose presence one else seemed to represent effete pallid type of humanity dramatist prince be satisfied however with one single glance at newcomer afterward whole regard be focused upon louise same thought be in mind of of same fear viii first few sentence spoken in midst of curious little crowd of stranger seemed to john when thought of long waiting almost piteously inadequate louise recognizing difficulty of situation swiftly recovered composure be tactful gracious do tell how got in

eye from dusty seat among rope pulley leaning fragment of scenery what saw heard seemed to for most part meaningless tangle of gesture phrase men woman in fashionable clothes moving about before gloomy space of empty auditorium looked more like marionette than creature of flesh blood drawn way at bidding of stout masterly frenchman who be continually muttering exclamation banging manuscript upon hand kept eye fixed upon louise told that be in presence at last a moment passed became more more difficult for to realize actuality of scene upon be looking seemed like dream picture with unreal

maurel john shook head gloomily not a much a must like confessed seems to think dream of nothing play of yours be hoping that when be once produced will be more free gather graillot concluded that to put concisely truthfully be most bored man in london there be something behind effort of yours friend to fit round human being into square place speak truth now treat a father confessor john swung round upon heel in clear light be obvious that be little thinner in face that of tan have gone from complexion be staying up here going on with announced doggedly because of woman graillot stopped eating placed remains of cake in saucer of teacup laid down then leaned back in chair balanced finger tip one against other woman murmured how astonish why candor be so good graillot continued so stimulating to moral system be absolute candor have made friend of two people so far apart in most way a surprise simply because of reputation what about reputation graillot smiled benignly in france observed must probably be offered choice of lunatic asylum here weakness seems to have made rather vogue what weakness be to certain extent hearsay must admit graillot proceeded report about be that although have have of most beautiful woman in london almost offer to still remain without mistress what in world do mean john demanded mean graillot explained frankly that for young man of age wealth appearance to remain free from feminine entanglement be thing unheard of in country must imagine rare in yours be not so that young men be made when be young happen to want mistress john remarked lighting cigarette want wife meanwhile can call fool if like john interrupted may be one suppose from point of view know be that want to be able to offer woman whom marry who hope will be mother of

john replied have peculiar taste eccentricity one of mine have to do with other sex can not make amusement of be against prejudice graillot carefully completed refilling of pipe lit satisfactorily then turned once more to john let not be mistaken said be purist can call what like john retorted believe in one law for woman for man if man want woman do more le seems to that ought to wait until

artist admit that have wonderful talent be even willing if wished to allow to remain for time upon stage what must say more want on side graillot graillot replied a shook friend hand hurried off want

world to quickly in ten minute how will begin whispered leaned once more toward need hint murmured be really quite good at xxxiv ten minute passed very much too quickly be gone john thrilled though be through sens by almost passionate fervor of leave taking found once more confronted by little black demon sat up in car bore quickly back toward room although sense of presence delicate perfume empty place by side even fallen flower from gown be still there unrest seemed sharper there be something about of people whom knew to be friend seemed to to savor of conspiracy one by one flitted through brain graillot covert warning sophy plaintive almost fearful doubt prince subtle yet cynical silence behind stephen brutal outspoken word there be nothing must be put into definite shape just ghost of torturing impossible thought john told that must be ended even though word must blister tongue with shame must be spoken moment later hated for thought set teeth filled thought with glory of presence crushed demoniacal suggestion to back of brain be in humor to go home however changing order have first given to chauffeur be driven instead to small bohemian club have joined at graillot instigation have vague hope that might find great dramatist there there be sign of however in smoking room one else whom john knew threw into easy chair ordered whisky soda two men close at hand be writing at desk others be lounging about discussing evening reception one man sitting upon table recognized authority be treating company to fluent dissertation upon modern actress winding up by contrasting louise maurel style with of chief french rival john found listening with pleased interest man opinion be certainly not unfavorable to louise be only in finer shade of emotionalism critic declared that french actress get at little more completely even than louise maurel do know reason will tell be because live life have dozen new emotion in season make cult of feeling use brain to dissect passion

self assertive in sober word of elderly well bred man who lounged upon table for moment two john be stunned wild impulse assailed to leap up confront to choke lie back down throat of man who have uttered nerve in body be tingling with desire for action stupor of sens alone kept motionless strange incomprehensible clarity of thought realized exactly how thing be man have not spoken idly a scandalmonger have spoken what have accepted a fact what other people believed john rose to foot made way toward door face showed little sign of disturbance even nodded to men whom knew slightly a passed down stair met graillot then once more self control became in danger seized frenchman savagely by arm come way said leading toward card room come in here want to speak to locked door most unheard of irregular proceeding graillot felt coming of storm well exclaimed grimly trouble already eh see in face young man out with john who have won hard match at racket few day before against more

remember view of world in live louise maurel be artist great artist if there have be affair a suggest between man if be something appealed to affection be opinion that must not hesitate seem to think outrageous thing that prince must have be lover to be perfectly frank must be very much more surprised at marriage john made escape somehow remembered opening door have recollection of reaching street
