butler from hall shrugged shoulder doubtfully one listened for comment with interest be admitted to be man of world person of considerable experience must say not decided be wearing clothes of country

impressed family enquired one son mr gregory ballaston then squire brother mr henry ballaston life at hall with butler added after scarcely perceptible pause not that be much company for one though indeed mr johnson murmured be too recluse invalid there seemed to be marked disinclination to discus inmate of hall innkeeper looked out of window mr craske gazed into tankard young man remained still almost outside conversation thing up at hall butler confided with reserve be not what used to be there have come change over place change indeed grocer sighed gloomily mr johnson sensed reserve prepared for departure well must be tiring with question declared good humouredly be going to ask one more though be fancy be place market ballaston scene of sort of tragedy time ago name market ballaston seemed familiar to directly read advertisement must recall what be if be anything serious must have be whilst be abroad looked at incredulously innkeeper picked up glass began to wipe grocer coughed nervously even butler seemed at loss for word will excuse sir mr craske said at last be very small place of course when thing happens right in midst of like what did happen seems to somehow a though whole world ought to know about still there be lot of stir lot of stir in london newspaper be careless reader of newspaper mr johnson confessed besides last twenty year of life up to few month ago have be spent not only abroad very long way abroad fill up glass mr innkeeper have asked so many question that must allow to be host once more now tell what be that happened here exchanged glance a though by common unspoken consent butler became spokesman there be very terrible murder committed in village sir just about twelve month ago gentleman be killed in night shot through head be never

brother to madame at little house have be here very long be harmless body well liked have dined with at hall niece very beautiful young lady a mr pank spoke of being also niece to madame seemed a though be going to become quite friendly one morning there be seated at desk where used to work at night shot through head stone dead box of paper be by side scattered about anyhow there be police come from norwich there be police come from scotland yard in london from day to do seem to have be fairly outwitted what terrible thing mr johnson exclaimed in small place like too where did happen where did say lived there be embarrassed silence time be grocer who intervened there be note of indignation in tone if agent a let property mr borroughes suppose be said nothing about sir then there be doubt be very much to blame murder be committed in great house where have come to live mr endacott niece be last tenant chapter ii mr johnson subsided once more into easy chair from have risen be most amazing exclaimed murder in great house only twelve month ago do seem most unaccountable sir grocer ventured that never heard about be abroad at time until month so ago mr johnson explained be astonishing how lose touch with thing altogether after while sometimes did open english newspaper for week at time well well went on perhaps be reason why asked extraordinarily low rent for house be many innkeeper observed who must live there rent free not that be saying that educated person ought to take notice of such added hastily be fine house garden be grand only hope sir that will be comfortable not be put off so to speak by thing be passed gone say that police have never even made arrest mr johnson asked incredulously surely that be very unusual thing in country unusual may be innkeeper admitted fact be same for week afterwards have gentleman from scotland yard almost living in place one stayed here in very inn question did ask be surely ridiculous there be one of clever enough to find out who killed mr endacott new tenant of great house finished drink in silence rose to foot well gentleman observed strolled in here to make friend with of new neighbour who might be around make acquaintance with place so to speak certainly did expect to hear anything like be bad start be afraid sir innkeeper regretted civilly 'd have be bound to have heard of before long such stir did make grocer reflected morning afternoon there be fresh rumour a might say not single arrest mr johnson repeated most extraordinary hope now that know worst a be to be told sir rawson ventured that will soon settle down here like neighbourhood mr johnson inclined head gravely have doubt that will declared in many respect great house suit perfectly be just sort of garden want to have neighbourhood seems healthy be not too far from sea wish good afternoon gentleman there be little chorus of farewell new tenant took departure swinging stick though naturally little thoughtful after news have heard there be nothing in manner to indicate that intended to take too seriously to heart watched from behind muslin curtain until opened gate led into garden disappeared do seem to to have plenty of courage proper man for neighbourhood innkeeper pronounced wiping up counter there be many might have be struck of heap at being told what have to tell sort of tenant be better than none grocer sighed family must confess be what be hoping for rawson a became position maintained somewhat dubious attitude must wish observed with heavy frown that have given indication a to previous occupation station in life coming in here sitting down for drink be friendly like not exactly usual to seemed scarcely sort of man whom squire for instance must be likely to take fancy to squire be great gentleman grocer said reverently there be many like left in part be not likely to take up with stranger why must why indeed rawson assented yet seemed to take quite fancy to mr endacott mr gregory too paid young lady quite lot of attention wonder innkeeper remarked be proper looking young lady there ai many in part must hold candle to for look be not very gay just now at hall mr rawson continued butler stifled regretful sigh thing at hall be great deal le gay than be prepared to disclose be generally pretty quiet during summer admitted squire be never one for entertaining much before shooting did think that mr gregory being at home might have made little difference be due say to start for foreign part at moment six o'clock gentleman wish good evening there be simultaneous break up of little party rawson ponderous a ever grey of complexion notwithstanding country life first made dignified exit walking short way down village street climbed stile led into park mr craske crossed street returned to pleasant looking creeper covered establishment behind long shop window of father grandfather before have dispensed grocery gossip for last hundred year finally young man fielding took silent departure mounting motor bicycle have left leaning up against wall glanced at watch reflected for few moment be going for ride mr fielding innkeeper who have followed outside enquired young man looked up down sleepy sun baked street glanced at signboard where road forked may get a far a norwich ruminated be wanting new fly pleasant ride evening other observed queer do seem day to think of getting to norwich back afore dark thing a ride have made power of difference in getting about young man smiled twenty mile to norwich remarked forty minute taking easy yes think will run over there swung on to machine started at once in three quarter of hour be writing out telegram in post office in norwich afterwards made pilgrimage to sporting emporium in main street with care of expert selected fresh assortment of fly with to tempt particularly elusive desirable trout eight o'clock be striking a passed once more through village street of market ballaston on way back to farmhouse lodging dismounted outside ballaston arm stood looking about with air of one absorbing to full gentle atmosphere of peace beauty rustic content at end of street row of house mostly of grey stone with deep red tile opened out into little market place where ancient covered cross stood in centre of cobbled space on stone trough three four youth two young woman be seated in peaceful almost aggressive silence mr houghton bank manager be standing on cool flagged pavement outside neat little house smoking cigarette chatting with foulds veterinary surgeon who have just driven up in little two seater car whilst just across way mr craske good looking daughter have stepped out of front door to water row of geranium in box before window from great house set in somewhat severe isolation behind encircling red brick wall came clamorous summons of dinner gong almost immediately afterwards similar invitation from tinkling of chinese bell sounded from little house melody from latter have scarcely died away before from hall came slow booming of alarm bell rung nightly at dinner hour young man listened into sleepy eye there crept speculative expression a travelled beyond village street beyond park up great grass bordered avenue towards window of hall seemed almost a though must see into very stately undisturbed jacobean dining room see three men who sat together at end of desert of mahogany frowned down upon by line of pictured ancestor slightest need anticipated by rawson well trained subordinate a though must hear languid stilted effort at conversation a though perhaps must see ghost behind chair a though when swung round moment two later must see into more modest still impressive dining room of great house where mr peter johnson sat alone before far simpler repast eating drinking with frown upon forehead line about mouth trace of have appeared during more genial moment of afternoon visit to ballaston arm a though turning still little farther round must see even into quaint low dining room of little house take note of invalid with golden hair weary brown eye who lay upon long chair drawn up by side of round table discontented earnest young woman who sat opposite to harsh featured sole attendant in end sighed abandoned reflection entered inn disturbing thereby mr pank landlord in middle of supper drank glass of gin tonic then quick explosion of bicycle disturbed once more quiet drowsy street a flashed through village on homeward way throughout whole of long summer day have scarcely seemed possible that there must be more peaceful spot in world than wide street cobbled market place winding country lane emptied into village of market ballaston at three o'clock on following morning there be not only peace silence absolute complete two hundred forty three men woman child who made up inhabitant have passed into land of ghost even house with closed blind sightless window breathed very spirit of repose chiming of church clock notwithstanding silvery distinctness seemed to carry with note almost of apology to sleeping world silence more complete than ever followed dying away of last trembling note for time not even uneasy dog too eager denizen of farmyard ventured to disturb moonlit pall of silence then came first sign of human movement small postern gate set in red brick wall surrounded great house be opened noiselessly peter johnson stepped into lane stood there for moment two perfectly still with air of man listening hopeless task seemed on night whilst listened eye wandered up down street away across churchyard into wood behind past steeple over sleeping country to horizon seemed however that if watched for unusual sight listened for unusual sound effort be in vain after few moment took step forward with postern gate still open stood gazing thoughtfully watchfully over medley of red tiled roof up great avenue beyond to where imposing front of hall with long row of uncurtained window filled background with serene brooding dignity stood there perhaps for a long a five minute until seemed to become part of dreaming landscape statue petrified by moonlight only living figure in drama of repose geniality kindliness drained somehow from expression sinister watchful figure alien inimical suddenly seemed to stiffen from outside of small wood adjoining hall flashed light little more than pin prick of fire vivid distinct three time flashed then disappeared peter johnson a silently a have come stepped back vanishing through postern gate reentered own domain chapter iii mr peter johnson on following morning be indulging in harmless occupation of practising mashie shot with dozen golf ball over shrub upon front lawn of great house when morton newly engaged butler who have arrived few day before from registry office at norwich sallied through garden door followed by young lady mr johnson promptly abandoned diversion came forward miss besant to see sir servant announced

young lady seemed to be carrying out line of thought with regard to from moment of appearance expression have not changed tone be level indifferent be tone of person who have concern in what said spoke mechanically a though choosing readiest word with sole object of concluding unavoidable task be tall inclined to be of full figure paler than ought to have be living in country with eye seemed seldom fully open mass of light brown hair brushed back from forehead mouth whose discontented corner gave to expression weary almost petulant note ordinary person admirer of sex studying a have crossed lawn must probably have troubled to look at again mr johnson however be not ordinary person be one of gift to appreciate people for what be not for what seemed to be realised that there be certain exceptional characteristic about young woman who stood waiting for reply please hesitate to say so went on half turning away if think be request unreasonable really see why must consent be simply bearer of message dear young lady pray sit down mr johnson invited pushing wicker chair towards please assure madame fear that name be little beyond must be very glad indeed for smith to continue to render service have hitherto performed a to remuneration began mr johnson waved hand pray settle with man begged will allow half hour off day have under gardener can spare time be only neighbourly action anything madame may choose to give be concern of mine be very kind said doubtfully think that madame will care to accept man service in time without seeing that be recompensed make

somewhat severe apartment with neatly arranged shelf of catalogue pile of volume of reference letter case many evidence of business detail exceptionally large writing table filled window recess on stood single bronze statue several curio blotter massive stationery rack on right hand side window panelling took wide inward sweep leaving space half platform half pedestal in centre stood fine china bowl filled with deep red rose on side body soul mr johnson gazed first at one of image then at other speechless expressionless absorbed cynical vice grotesque wickedness of one leered at from left hand side of drooping rose from right kindly benevolent face of saint seemed to breathe out strange atmosphere of peace sanctity mr johnson made comment attempted criticism yet very silence be in way suggestive gregory watched with eager interest conscious of surging resurrection of certain vague far fetched suspicion in background henry ballaston though face showed sign of emotion also watched be movement dispelled few second of paralysed silence voice always pleasant one notwithstanding formal note be softer lower even than usual there be curious glint in cold blue eye find miniature buddha interesting mr johnson asked tenant of great house did not at first appear to hear eye be fixed almost to rigidity here muttered effect of exclamation be disconcerting three companion closed in little upon there be something menacing about silence sir bertram repeated at last with air of puzzled man mr johnson appeared to awake from lethargy say seems to remarked lapsing into first americanism that

there be remember young american who started out to get be discovered with throat cut in train from pekin southward nobody seemed to know what have become of image there be brief silence sudden almost unaccountable lessening of tension of last few minute mr johnson loomed no longer a sinister figure of fate circumstance under came into possession of image henry intervened must seem to preclude idea of being one referred to in magazine article still story be interesting mr johnson turned away without further comment subject of image be exhausted screen in chapel beyond be inspected presently took formal leave of host will hope to see more of mr johnson sir bertram said a accompanied on to terrace entertain much at present son will be giving farewell shooting party before departure abroad will hope to number amongst guest very kind of be sure mr johnson replied climbing into car thrusting in clutch visit brief glimpse of treasure have be most enjoyable good day sir bertram good day

pronounced there be moment when thought otherwise on whole be inclined to agree with henry conceded after moment reflection gregory thought be too confused for speech watched car until became speck in distance then turned away followed others into house chapter v afternoon be still young when mr johnson passed through park gate of ballaston hall drove slowly down village street on way back to great house studied sign post marked road to norwich hesitated at moment young woman stepped out of grocer shop recognising nodded in spiritless fashion mr johnson fancied that caught almost wistful expression a glanced critically at car drew up by side of cobbled pavement good afternoon miss besant said good afternoon rejoined looking up a though surprised thought of motoring in to norwich confided wonder whether must care to come will take three quarter of hour to hour need not stay there for many minute sound delightful admitted be afraid that be quite impossible madame be very restless to day be quite sure that must not allow might ask suggested hesitated might agreed doubtfully be afraid must be scarcely worth while asking to wait nonsense have nothing to do replied cheerfully jump in will drive to gate 'd rather waited at corner begged will come back tell anyway mr johnson obeyed instruction drew up at point where by road curved around to own little house on to chain of rather remote village descended glanced into petrol tank lit cigarette settled down to wait in few minute miss besant reappeared be conscious of measure of disappointment rather puzzled when saw that be still without glove coat nevertheless there be slightly eager expression in face madame have surprised very much announced a paused by side of car seems willing for to go must like to

hall oak panelled to ceiling with several strange to mr johnson taste not yet educated to futurism extremely bizarre picture upon wall then opened door softly beckoned to follow be mr johnson who have come to live at great house madame announced left then mr johnson crossed room towards couch curiosity concerning madame rather increased a bent down to take unexpectedly beautiful hand be lying flat

like house too in man be murdered do wish to believe that be chance perhaps morbid curiosity have reason dear madame mr johnson assured a to morbid curiosity not soul even mentioned matter to till after have paid over contract deposit secured lease of house never mind whether mentioned not persisted fine eye challenging do mean to tell that did know about mr johnson thoroughly on guard now adopted soothing tone how must expostulated be complete stranger to neighbourhood a matter of fact have spent most of life abroad man who be murdered continued know be brother have also lived abroad

down contentedly be very much stronger than used to be must be in least surprised if recovered altogether then wo need companion longer mr johnson swung round corner with skill of practised driver in case observed sympathy be divided chapter vi mr johnson found plenty of time during journey to norwich to exchange remark with take notice of companion sulkiness of expression lightened considerably with pleasure of rapid motion sense of freedom springing from unexpected holiday road wound way between hedge from late honeysuckle still drooped through tract of pleasant varied country corn field where harvesting machine with musical mechanism be at work rich meadow where cow stood knee deep in flower starred herbage across great common where clump of heather gorse stretched away to border of thick encircling wood ballaston pheasant strutted about on side from slight rise in road mile so beyond village caught glimpse of back of hall lunched there to day mr johnson confided girl looked at

pleasanter for pointed out to have by side than to go alone shrugged shoulder why demanded be not good looking be not agreeable be not amusing if be fond of gallivanting well be sure that have sense enough to know that doe appeal to how can possibly therefore be of interest to smiled be there with word acknowledged rather depend upon feeling only know that feel pleasanter to have where be than to be alone a matter of fact there be several of glib statement of yours must quarrel with if wished well manner admitted be rather difficult one must call particularly amiable a to not being attractive however differ from think if took slightest trouble about put hat on straight for instance gathered up wisp of hair indulged in smile now then must be distinctly good looking for moment frown seemed even little more sullen than ever there be positive scowl upon face until to amazement suddenly burst out laughing saw then that have whitest of teeth little flush of colour have be gradually finding way into cheek completely dispelled sallowness of complexion eye seemed to reflect unexpectedly kindled sense of humour straightened hat felt hair really be very nice person said can go on talking nonsense if want to rather like if will give satisfaction will spend hour during be going to leave alone in norwich at hairdresser knew be right declared be good sort so be rejoined let be friend be going to start by asking question for god sake begged ask why came to settle at market ballaston why not because one pestering to death with same thing complained one can get murder out of head seems to have absorbed effort at individual thought in whole place why have seen men killed by dozen have lived in place where there be murder day yet here seem obsessed by one little tragedy can never get

begged earnestly mystery exclaimed what mischief can matter to know answered care much about of people like unhappiness man dead think over village same feeling exists think be afraid of what might happen if truth really came to light leaned little forward in car eye fixed upon steeple of cathedral slowly emerging to definite form slender exquisite yet dominating a rose from amongst incongruous mass of red tiled building mr johnson waited for several moment then a swung into main road broke brief silence be queer confided have formed same impression anyway will drop for present nodded assent wonder if realise said what great holiday be for have never be in norwich have not be in car for year be enjoying thoroughly be not going to think of disagreeable thing please put down wherever like

tea shop can see on right hand after if have time to spare will look round place together be that agreed delightful assented chief constable be in happy to see mr johnson be amiable ex officer a competent a must be expected exceedingly popular in county of be native be major holmes announced glancing at card still held in hand what can do for mr johnson give little of time great deal of patience be quiet reply have just come to live in county at market ballaston have taken great house there great house other repeated reminiscently oh yes remember of course so be living there scene of very unfortunate tragedy cost lot of time trouble lately so hear mr johnson murmured major holmes leaned back in chair be afraid confessed that norfolk have added to somewhat scanty list of undiscovered crime lay too much to heart however a scotland yard took whole business out of hand in early stage little unwise of perhaps mr johnson observed local police may not be so intelligent be at least tenacious often have better grasp of situation chief constable remained silent have own opinion be not matter for discussion with outsider imagine visitor proceeded that must be rather score for county police if be to achieve success where scotland yard have failed major holmes glanced across at caller keenly have brought information asked be laconic reply chief constable be startled eager god bless soul exclaimed sitting up be welcome visitor look here let ring for superintendent mr johnson held out hand not for moment if please begged must rather say what have to say to in confidence afterwards understand information must be used in such manner a think fit other nodded very well agreed tenant of great house squared up to desk be different looking man to kindly person who have driven miss besant over to norwich major holmes said will ask to consider a private so much of conversation a doe not come under heading of official information certainly murdered man endacott be associated in very large business established in china alexandria new york be together for over twenty year for last ten year be partner wound up business little over twelve month ago brought great fortune to england be partner major holmes repeated in tone of considerable surprise one in neighbourhood know of connection with endacott mr johnson continued have chosen to keep secret now let come to more precise information have to offer month so before endacott left east chinese temple near pekin be robbed two statue wooden image be with very peculiar history be stolen there be two young men concerned in robbery englishman american american got a far a railway although be murdered by band of robber who boarded train one of image reached destination englishman be captured by priest a by religion be unable to shed blood be handed over by to notorious river pirate with instruction that be to be thrown to alligator heard of affair in village where be trading up yun tse river rescued from pirate brought down to coast name of young man be gregory ballaston chief constable stared across table be odd story to hear told in such matter of fact way in law abiding city of norwich greg ballaston exclaimed good lord mr gregory ballaston narrator continued found image waiting for on steamer although friend be dead second of image with robber have decamped came by mean of indirect traffic with into possession showed to mr ballaston in warehouse coveted if old superstition be true image without mine be useless how useless major holmes asked puzzled because be supposed to contain hidden somewhere in interior sacred treasure of jewel accumulated by priest in temple if attempt to explain matter more fully will think that be telling fairy story so will content by saying that according to ancient superstition credited by many who have knowledge of affair also by two young men possession of one image without other be useless gregory ballaston left for england taking image other when wound up affair of firm be brought home to england by ralph endacott together with number of old manuscript from temple have also come into possession up to at rate few day before murder that image stood in study room where be found shot to day that image be in ballaston hall major holmes sat for moment two without speaking be scarcely to be wondered at prevailing impression be of blank incredulity be telling most extraordinary story mr johnson said guardedly truth be sometimes extraordinary other agreed can easily verify however correctness of main point of statement can give reference for instance to banker in london who will assure be head of firm in mr endacott be partner that be man of wealth reputation in position to know truth concerning matter gregory ballaston half recognised a out there passed a chinaman be only suspicious adopted garb speech of chinese very early in life because confessed european have chance of trading successfully in interior of country gregory ballaston be young man against whom have ill feeling in fact rather like endacott be associate for twenty year be responsible for image being in possession be arranged between with help of friend of at british museum must obtain translation of document have acquired concerning must then on return to england discus possibility of existence of jewel be very certain that in lifetime must never willingly have parted with image to gregory ballaston say that image be now at ballaston major demanded be there at present moment be unequivocal reply lunched there to day saw together with fellow image gregory ballaston brought chief constable moved uneasily in chair story to have listened be barely credible there be something very convincing about rather ponderous man of slow speech steady eye be stranger in part mr johnson said after moment pause probably know that ballastons be one of oldest most prominent county family sir bertram be lord lieutenant at present moment hunt hound occupies great position be aware of mr johnson replied also know a probably do that family be in great financial strait come to then chief constable summed up unwillingly be practically accusing young ballaston not only of theft of murder of late partner endacott have not gone so far a that other pointed out have supplied with motive for murder have given information that property belonging to dead man equally to by by be now in possession of ballastons be image really of great value major holmes asked leaving out other improbability must possession be considered a possible incentive for perpetration of such atrocious crime jewel supposed to be concealed in two image mr johnson confided be estimated if exist at to be worth anything up to million pound be sir bertram who first heard story when be in diplomatic service persona grata at late emperor court in china passed on to son without doubt two together planned expedition major holmes felt certain amount of conviction creeping in upon be only sense of officialdom enabled to conceal growing sense of horror must forgive mr johnson begged if accept story with reserve a man of common sense be sure will see that have incredible side especially when one considers great position of ballastons horrible result must ensue if story be proved true by by did hear that gregory ballaston be going abroad again for year be that fact mr johnson admitted have induced to pay visit instead of pursuing few investigation major holmes pushed pen paper across table will write down address of banker invited to whom may refer if also care to give reference to lawyer private person must confess must proceed with more confidence mr johnson acquiesced without hesitation there be something convincing about name of bank solicitor written in

be possessor of image inspector cloutson stroked chin thoughtfully looked across towards great front of hall be not type of brain to quickly absorb suspicion much of talk concerning wooden image

everything done in orthodox fashion know very well prejudice very natural one against interference of private detective mr fielding will withdraw from case from now onwards do expect that on basis of information have already received will at once proceed with necessary enquiry have alternative to do so chief constable admitted reluctantly must warn however that will do so in manner seems to most desirable will approach sir bertram will use own discretion of course mr johnson said action must be taken at once there must be time for one to slip off abroad anything of sort want to remember major

come across one who can swear that saw man leaving hall last night just before burglary took place there be actual burglary henry objected quantity of document appear to be missing sir bertram confided holmes attitude seemed to little suspicious fancy that one have be getting at be not sure must confess to having doubt about man johnson doubt explain bertram johnson account of have never be entirely credible one do remember day when lunched here saw image certainly betrayed surprise henry reflected gregory have queer idea about although only made laugh at time said reminded of chinaman

england will go in major use waiting for gregory be just a likely a not to lunch in norwich luncheon be at time difficult function holmes be in sense unwilling guest sir bertram be unusually silent be henry with stilted phrase old fashioned sense of obligation of host who kept conversation going towards end of meal gregory put in unexpected appearance shook hand with holmes of whose presence have obviously be informed apologised to father so sorry dad explained took time to find just trunk wanted then remembered that have ordered riding kit at houghton thought might a well be tried on news

holmes set down cup faced situation gregory said know will remember that a well a being friend hope friend of one here be government official gregory paused in act of lighting cigarette stared at why be all right assented what about police have evidence major holmes continued that at about three o'clock morning be to say twenty minute so before burglary at great house be committed one be seen to leave hall cross park enter great house at rate to disappear in neighbourhood gregory finished lighting cigarette where on earth did police get hold of information enquired from poacher from person whose word must be little difficult to upset chief constable replied acting on information have come up here to pay official visit have interviewed servant without result understand that posse key to smaller library door sometimes use often use gregory admitted if dine out anything of sort come home by mail from london use to avoid undoing bolt of front door where be key last night anywhere where one must have got hold of must have thought so be in dressing room somewhere did lend to one certainly not one have ever asked for did use last night have used for week major holmes nodded well said that be now appeal to can help reliable witness state that one left hall through library door last night be seen to walk across park to reasonable supposition be person who assaulted chloroformed mr johnson committed burglary will realise that be serious statement can of suggest anything might throw light upon affair can suggest gregory remarked be that informant must have be seeing spook who be one of villager there need longer be secret about identity major holmes decided informant be private detective employed by mr johnson there be intense ominous silence henry ballaston drew chair little farther back into shade a though suddenly felt sun too strong sir bertram whistled softly for once in life seemed guilty of almost unnatural action gregory stood a though turned to stone across face for moment there flitted expression of dismay chief constable saw heart sank be sir bertram brain moved quickest how mischief did mr johnson get hold of private detective at moment notice enquired have have in neighbourhood for time major holmes replied presence in park last night be not accidental be employed by mr johnson in connection with certain theory johnson held a to murder of mr endacott be most amazing sir bertram observed very curious action on part of man who be total stranger to neighbourhood henry put in chief constable brooded for several moment official duty be hard to follow whole circumstance be unusual faced situation from common sense point of view johnson may be stranger to neighbourhood admitted think that appearance here be so entirely casual a tried to make out transpires that be partner of endacott in great firm of johnson company believe that real object of coming here be to solve mystery of endacott murder wu ling god gregory exclaimed in genuine excitement moment saw thought recognised then seemed incredible why of course be fool ever to doubt went on played chinaman out there to do trading up in village have lived there most of life be easy enough then when finished with business came back here europeanised god what fool have be know anything about major holmes observed came to in short time ago placed before very serious information be using own discretion in what be about to say by now must know just what be up against again appeal to for help in background henry shook head gravely sir bertram with slightest possible shrug of shoulder turned away lit cigarette gregory completely at ease again lolled little deeper in wicker chair dear fellow expostulated how deuce can of help tell frankly if one left house last night believe did for one know anything about a to murder well if mr johnson private agent can find out anything about that whole neighbourhood will be indebted to how on earth be likely to succeed however when scotland yard have failed murder so far a investigation took major holmes said patiently be entirely lacking in direct motive burglary on contrary doe seem to have have extraordinary clear object burglar got away with number of chinese manuscript amongst manuscript know what be going to say gregory interrupted smiling a though in amusement be wrong same old endacott have be through there be one must help owner of image to discover treasure where be infernal image major holmes asked have be moved upstairs into apartment henry ballaston intervened if must afford satisfaction to inspect will take there with pleasure must like to see major holmes decided returned to house gregory quitting chair with air of reluctance two image stood in small sitting room opening out from henry ballaston bedroom at top of house apartment of extraordinary almost monastic simplicity stood side by side on old black oak bureau against white of wall showed up with almost glaring effect body soul gregory pointed out think have ever be worth what poor old bill hammonde went through for got bill too good chap be legend be sir bertram explained politely that head be filled with jewel yet have never be able to discover opening aperture of sort if there be truth in story major holmes suggested why break up sir bertram shivered that at least said one must keep for last effort image holmes be nearly thousand year old if be judge of such thing will see at once that be carved by great artist with history must imagine that value at christie must be at least several thousand pound so long a be intact major holmes took one into hand set down again amazed at weight why be almost a heavy a bronze exclaimed wood of be fashioned be specie of teak wood almost extinct now sir bertram explained weight of course be rather argument against being hollow on other hand might be hollow filled with jewel there be further legend gregory confided that there be inside sort of infernal machine invented during last century by priest must go off at rough usage must say seems to bit thick at same time chinese be always rather great at explosive imagine major holmes said that will not let superstition stand in way provided be unable to discover secret opening a last resort sir bertram declared have decided to destroy le pleasing of image gregory announced in low tone eye fixed upon leering image of body mean to be one to strike blow one get kind of superstitious over there know holmes went on lost possession of other image for time robber got off with when raided train killed poor old hammonde that unpleasing looking devil brought home with can say be want to be left alone with again for month six week must have much chance must at norwich assize if pleaded that have be driven to commit murder through influence of image chinese judge must have understood know be that on boat be never here holmes asked curiously kept out of way of thing when be once here gregory replied uncle henry

opening travelling bag by mean father begged ascended great staircase gregory pausing now then to look at one of favourite picture led way to own room with quaint air of monasticity severity accentuated by oriel shaped window closed door carefully behind must like before depart gregory began to assure that sympathy have be entirely with in gallant non successful attempt to restore fortune of family may may not agree with in decision that waved hand towards two image must remain unbroken there be time went on when fancy that friend there with very evil mocking leer be trying to boast of

undamaged except for slight injury to mr johnson regret be necessary affair seems to to be trivial gregory clasped forehead trivial groaned there will fear be certain loss of dignity must be called upon to answer for misdoing henry concluded can assure that will take step to evade action may ensue think be only remains for gregory to wish success abroad of own future here will not speak whilst

upon change speed gear when rawson hurried forward there be car coming up avenue sir announced must be a well to wait for moment gregory looked out of window must see twin light flashing in distance gleaming slantwise through tree then again pool of light in semi darkness for only moment hesitated during moment seemed to that be taking leave of much be dear in life then stepped out of car stood upon edge of terrace might be a well rawson agreed with somewhat elaborate casualness wonder who devil can be at time of night sir bertram speculated car resolved into shape very crudity ugliness seemed symbolic driver be in plain clothes sat stiffly there be something official about appearance by side be major holmes behind sat inspector cloutson two latter descended a car drew up well major sir bertram exclaimed what new thunderbolt be going to launch chief constable rather avoided eye want word with please confided laying hand lightly upon gregory arm entered house together sir bertram

instrument may say obtained with greatest possible difficulty from establishment in london there be moment blank silence major holmes expression after first shock of surprise be one of complete incredulity be very remarkable statement on part mr ballaston observed presume wish to take note of what say at same time have be sorry to remind warrant against nephew on more serious charge henry ballaston apologised with dignity regret said not to have mentioned two affair together also on june th of last year after few word of unpleasant discussion with mr endacott shot through head once more there be brief spell of breathless silence henry ballaston be entirely master of situation perfectly possessed slightly apologetic father son be gazing into other eye with mutual amazed interrogation see henry continued in explanatory fashion mr endacott be very unreasonable man admitted that have made translation of manuscript refused to give to desired niece to profit by suppose must have lost temper shot secured other image must find trace of manuscript hence second effort within last few day have made quite clear sir bertram finger upon son arm have grown like grip of vice
