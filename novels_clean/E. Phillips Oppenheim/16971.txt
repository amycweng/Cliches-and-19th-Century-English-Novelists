endeavoured to lure others into sense of false security a to well being of country by mean of illusive statistic in appreciation of dramatic effect small mean by audience can be touched henslow be past master early in speech have waved aside umbrella supporter be holding over regardless of rain stood out in full glare of reflected gaslight ponderous powerful figure one can accuse cried of being

in way arrangement be pushed through almost at once mr ascough on morning of return to london took opportunity warmly to congratulate brook lord arranmore have be marvellously kind to brook agreed to tell truth mr ascough feel almost inclined to add incomprehensibly kind older man stroked grey moustache thoughtfully lord arranmore be eccentric remarked have always be eccentric will remain so suppose to end of chapter be one who profit however be very glad of eccentricity brook remarked be of course only obvious explanation of generosity so far a be concerned have occurred to mr ascough to wonder whether friendship connection between father be in way le slight thing than have be led to suppose mr ascough shrugged shoulder lord arranmore said have told doubt that there be to be told brook sat at desk frowning slightly tapping blotting paper with pen holder lord arranmore have told said be that father occupied cabin not far from on bank of lake ono that saw little of other that only found out illness by accident that father then disclosed name gave paper address there be merely casual intercourse between two englishman coming together in strange country be what have always understood mr ascough agreed have reason to think otherwise definite reason except lord arranmore unusual kindness to brook remarked lord arranmore be one of most self centred men ever knew least impulsive why therefore must go out of way to do kindness can not understand if be really enigma to mr ascough answered can not help to solve arranmore have be reverse of communicative to be afraid

certainly not left england on friendly term with mother certainly be people for whom one who knew anything of life have highest esteem admiration can imagine reason then for father leaving england for good certainly not know of reason why must have abandoned trip to australia gone to canada none doing so be a inexplicable to a to entirely have never doubted lord arranmore story of death never why must one more question brook said do know that lately have met traveller man who visited lord arranmore in canada who declared to certain knowledge there be other human dwelling house within fifty mile of lord arranmore cabin be obviously mistaken think so be certain brook hesitated question said will have given idea of uncertainty have felt once twice lately owing to report of traveller lacroix lord arranmore unaccountable kindness to see be ordinary man be not philanthropist by mean in way person likely to do kindly action from love of now do know of fact can suggest anything might make situation clearer to can not mr brook older man answered without hesitation if take advice will not trouble more with fancy seem to pardon quite chimerical accept lord arranmore kindness a offshoot of sentimental feeling might well have entertained towards fellow countryman by whose death bed have stood in far away lonely country may even be mistaken in lord arranmore character can remember too that after what mean so much to cost nothing be probably for own advantage brook rose took up hat be very much obliged to mr ascough said yours after be common sense view of affair if like will walk up to station be going way so brook convinced of folly finally discarded certain uncomfortable thought once twice lately have troubled dined at enton night improved acquaintance with lady caroom daughter who be still staying there although be not matter have mentioned to mr ascough there be something found more inexplicable even than lord arranmore transference of care of estate to be apparent encouragement lady caroom gave to friendship between sybil have lunched with twice in medchester more often still enton barouche have be kept waiting at office whilst lady caroom sybil descended upon with invitation from lord arranmore after talk with mr ascough put matter behind remained at time inexplicable puzzle on evening of particular visit found sybil alone in recess of

there be great deal of distress admitted gravely be afraid that be true looked at with wide open eye understand said thought that there be society who dealt with sort of thing behind workhouse so there be lady sybil answered must remember that society be use unless people will subscribe to that there be great many people who must sooner starve than enter workhouse surely exclaimed there be difficulty about getting money if people only understand watched for moment in silence suddenly appreciating refinement costly elegance seemed in to be part of girl yet for surely toilette be in way also responsible white satin dress be cut fashioned in style be beginning to appreciate a evidence of skill costliness string of pearl around throat gleamed softly in firelight chain of fine gold studded with opal diamond reached almost to knee wore few ring indeed be such ring a have never seen before have come a guest to enton there be thousand like momentary flash of thought carried back to day of french revolution there be print hanging in room of girl a fair a proud a one surrounded by fierce rabble mad with hunger pent up rage of generation tearing jewel from finger tearing even thought trimming from gown answer mr brook reminded recovered with start beg pardon lady sybil question set thinking have tried to make people understand many have given most generously for that can not cope with such distress a there be to day in medchester be secretary for one of distribution society have seen thing be enough to sadden man for life only during last few day have seen people really hungry asked with something like timidity in face laughed bitterly that see moment of time spend down amongst answered have seen worse thing have seen sapping away of character men become thief woman worse to escape from starvation that think be greatest tragedy of make one shudder when one think that on shoulder of many people portion of responsibility at rate for thing must rest lip quivered emptied content of gold chain purse into hand be who be wicked mr brook said who spend end of money close ear to do take will can go to of woman know child there be only five six pound there will talk to mamma will send cheque took money without hesitation be very glad said earnestly that have given that have felt that wanted to give hope wo think too badly of for coming over here to help spend pleasant evening talking at of such miserable thing badly repeated will never be able to thank enough for telling what have done make one feel almost wicked to be sitting here wearing jewelry feeling well off spending money on want to think that there be people starving how must hate be wonderful part of answered believe that do suppose be sort of fatalism same sort of thing only much le ignoble a indifference keep rich people contented deaf to terribly human cry be young said looking at to be so much interested in such serious thing be blood suppose answered father be police court missionary mother matron of pauper hospital be dead be not asked softly many year ago answered lady caroom lord arranmore came in together certain unusual seriousness in sybil face be manifest two seem to have be amusing yourselves lady caroom remarked giving hand to brook mr brook have be answering of question about poor people sybil answered be not amusing subject lord arranmore laughed lightly there be touch of scorn in slight curve of fine lip raised eyebrow stood away from shaded lamplight before great open fire of cedar log red glow falling fitfully upon face seemed to brook watching with more than usual closeness to give something of mephistopheles aspect evening clothes hung with more than ordinary precision about long slim body black tie black pearl stud supplied touch of sombreness so aptly in keeping with mirthless bitter smile still parted lip must not take mr brook too seriously on subject of poor people said mockery of smile well matched in tone brook be enthusiast one be afraid of misguided people who have barred way to progress for century if only must be converted lady caroom sighed oh dear how enigmatic exclaimed do be little more explicit dear lady continued turning to be not worth while yet sometimes wonder whether people realize how much harm hysterical philanthropy purely sentimental faddism doe how retard natural advance of civilization throw dust in people eye salve easy conscience of rich man who bargain for immortality with few stroke of pen find mischievous occupation for good many weak mind parasitical female believe that personal charity be mistake be good deal worse than that be crime sybil rose up little unusual flush have stained cheek still understand in least lord arranmore said seems to that be making paradoxical ridiculous statement only bewilder why be charity crime be what must like to hear explain lord arranmore bowed slightly have idea said leaning elbow upon mantelpiece be going to be inveigled into controversy dear sybil will do best to explain to what mean especially a at age be not likely to discover truth for in first place charity of sort be most insidious destroyer of moral character world have ever known man who once accepts even in extreme imbibes poison from system can never be thoroughly cleansed let loose upon society evil have sown in spread be like man with infectious disease be source of evil to community have relieved physical want have destroyed moral quality need to point out to that balance be on wrong side sybil glanced across at brook smiled back at lord arranmore have not finished yet said let hear worst host smiled after said why do waste breath from teen to thirty sentiment smile be only later on in life that reason have show at yet must ask yourselves eager denying young people who go about with healthy moral glow inside because have fed poor given hour so of time to distribution of reckless charity must ask yourselves what be actual good of ministering to outward sign of internal disease be simply trying to renovate outside when inside be filthy see dear young people that to give meal to one starving man may be to do indeed good doe nothing towards preventing starving man from taking place to morrow stimulate disease help to spread see where instead must turn to social law outcome of be that starving man let remain unharmed untouched while fall over one in frantic effort to brush away to day effect of eternal cause let starving man die let bone break through skin carry up wife child fellow to house of common tell that there be more to morrow more next day let million of lower class look thing in face tell that by revolution doubt of must find worse than inconvenient by le drastic mean thing must right who work to relieve individual only postpone delay millennium people will keep eye closed a long a can be who help to do so dinner be served lord butler announced lord arranmore extended arm to lady caroom come said let be charitable to one for too be starving chapter xiv awkward question think really liked then how must help be such delightful idea of yours be sure that said be so simple yet suggestive good

astonishing to find how unpleasant thought of leaving medchester be to have idea of said thoughtfully did not know that went in for anything of sort literary ambition be slight enough answered yet can scarcely be surprised that find thought of definite career certain amount of independence attractive stole sidelong glance at in plainly made clothes quiet hat be scarcely perhaps girl likely to attract attention yet be conscious of certain personal quality have realized understood from first carried well walked with free graceful movement of well bred healthy girl in face be air of quiet thought self possession of woman of culture experience claim to good look be after slight enough yet on studying came to conclusion that must if chose appear to much greater advantage hair soft

glimmering of truth be right declared think that can understand what feeling must be be sure wish luck touch of sympathy helped to unbend glanced towards kindly thank said of course there will be difficulty uncle will not like be very good natured very hospitable be afraid limitation will not permit to appreciate exactly how feel about aunt be of course merely echo will not be unreasonable
