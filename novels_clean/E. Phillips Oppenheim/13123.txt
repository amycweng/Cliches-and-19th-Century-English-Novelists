fellow be too started out from washington for kroten six month ago of have be heard of since ever will be how done chalmers asked curiously in first place jesson explained city stand at arm of river in sort of cul de sac with absolutely untraversable mountain on three side of road have to come around plain enter from eastward there be only one line of railway so that approach into city be easily guarded that be right geographically of course nigel admitted what earthly excuse can one make for keeping tourist traveller out of place if want to go there be perhaps most ingenious thing of jesson replied know russia be now practically tranquil country there be certain band of extreme bolshevistic faction who never gave in to authority who practically exist in little known place by mean of marauding expedition mountain about kroten be supposed to have be infested by nomadic company whether outrage set down to be really committed not suppose one know point of view be that presence of

be that influence be waning believe that to day be terrified at bare reflection of how much naida karetsky know believe that doe know exactly what be intended nigel asked be perfectly certain of jesson replied if must be induced to tell everything journey to kroten might just a well be abandoned yet somehow think will go so far a that most that can hope for be that will advise matinsky to reject immelan proposal that will perhaps bring influence to bear in same direction upon prince shan be inclined to agree with jesson nigel pronounced inasmuch a believe that mademoiselle karetsky be disposed to change modify view concerning see after threatened blow against england be purely private affair of germany there be really reason why russia other country must be dragged into be monkey pulling chestnut out of fire for most dangerous rival matinsky might be brought to think way chalmers observed say member of cabinet be under german influence if matinsky believed that nigel declared

china russia associated presumably with third power whose name will forgive not mentioning preparation appear to have be brought almost to completion in strictest secrecy headquarters of whole thing very much to surprise must confess seems to be in southern china in case nigel pointed out if will permit to make suggestion sir have very simple course open to well send for prince shan prince shan prime minister replied with knitted brow be not over in country officially have begged to be excused from accepting returning diplomatic courtesy nevertheless nigel persisted must send for prince shan

have be replaced by look of deep solemn anxiety if be right lord dorminster pronounced presently world have rolled backwards last ten year who have failed to mark retrogression may have terrible responsibility thrust upon politically be afraid agree with nigel replied only idealist prejudiced idealist can ignore primal element in human nature believe that few lofty sentiment can keep nation
