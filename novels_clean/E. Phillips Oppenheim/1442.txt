before window cold spring light falling full upon face with nervous line strongly cut immobile feature felt curious indisposition to speak queer sort of desire to wait on chance of hearing more single kink in brain thomson continued secret weakness perhaps even dash of lunacy might be quite reasonably master spy of world be in berlin six week ago ambrose there be soul who ever knew made report on purpose perhaps knew said nothing ambrose suggested softly there be moment silence thomson seemed to be considering idea with strange intensity then shook head think not decided when history of war be written ambrose with flamboyant phrase copious rhetoric there will be unwritten chapter more dramatic having really more direct effect upon final issue than even great battle have seemed dominant factor sit tight here ambrose wait may be going over to boulogne at hour thomson pushed on one side curtain concealed inner room passed through in quarter of hour reappeared dressed in uniform tone bearing whole manner be changed walked with springier step carried little cane be whistling softly to be going to one two place in tottenham court road by appointment announced to inspect new pattern

embarrassment to mr sidney bowed be tall apparently elderly man dressed with utmost sobriety accepted chair without undue haste adjusted pair of horn rimmed spectacle took paper from pocket sir began speaking deliberately without foreign accent be here to make certain proposal to on behalf of person who at own request will be nameless lord romsey frowned ponderously tapped desk by side with thick forefinger can not prevent speaking of course said wish to understand from first be not in position to deal with message communication from master whoever may be one else in country nevertheless other

for war be for to end rubbish other exclaimed hoarsely be attempting to saddle with responsibility like simply because personal sympathy have always be on side of country be representing be not question of personal sympathy mr sidney returned swiftly in black white pledged government to abstain from war against germany how must tell statesman protested that germany be thinking of tearing up treaty of entering into campaign of sheer scandalous aggression made stipulation condition in what wrote be calm reply pledged word that government must never declare war against germany alluded to

disappointed well be mistaken admitted what said be true enough never did believe that government with be associated must declare war against germany even now let tell that there be soul breathing who know how close real issue be if people have only chosen other line of advance have not come here to recriminate mr sidney declared be not mission be here to state term for refraining from sending letter personal letter to kaiser to english press lord romsey sprang to foot good god man do know what be saying exclaimed perfectly other replied told that errand be serious one will proceed minister slowly resumed seat from behind electric lamp face be ghastly white in brief pause followed seemed to be looking through wall of room into ugly chapter of future saw headline in newspaper leading

overture may come ostensibly through washington if will must come in reality from minister leaned back in chair be calmness of despair might a well ask said simply to order fleet out of north sea mr sidney rose to foot think advised that have better try what can do lord romsey will give little time may even extend if find trace of influence have two colleague at least who be pacifist at heart take on one side talk in whisper at first plant just little seed be careful that grows expect impossibility only remember what failure will mean to lord romsey looked steadfastly at visitor mr sidney be tall spare there be certainly nothing of teuton american in appearance accent voice be characterless restraint almost unnatural relieved of more immediate fear minister be conscious of renewed instinct of strong curiosity how can communicate with mr sidney asked in way other replied when think advisable will come to see again be american german englishman be choose for moment be cool response if doubt credential can perhaps establish in confidence by repeating conversation took place between kaiser on terrace of imperial palace at potsdam between three four o'clock on afternoon of

interest in future a matter of fact must have be at tower underneath at very moment for young lady who probably perjured to save now that know opinion of captain granet will understand must hesitate before recommending to post whatever in service of country granet made stealthy movement forward have be edging little closer to desk be barely two yard away suddenly paused thomson have closed drawer

there be something between two understand declared there be very great deal about captain granet be only just beginning to understand thomson said calmly must find solicitude about movement evening great compliment geraldine arises entirely from desire to spare shock of what may turn out yet to be very lamentable catastrophe two men be quite incomprehensible geraldine sighed if only of must

lost at sea so far a must see there be light glimmer of one reached corner of street like blind man by tapping kerbstone with cane arrived here stood for moment in middle of road bareheaded there be not breath of wind anywhere made way carefully down towards downing street meeting few people still obliged to grope rather than walk along downing street made way by railing rang bell at last at premier house be shown at once into council room four five men who be seated around table who looked up at entrance bore one of household name premier held out hand good evening major thomson began please sit down join for moment thomson be little surprised at gathering will forgive suggesting that be likely to be marked spot to night said premier smiled well must scarcely expect to hide must

scandal shock of must do enormous harm apart from terrible financial panic must ensue will see to that doe further mischief than may already have done make appeal to of here to night be guided entirely by in matter have rendered country great service by discovery render greater one major thomson by keeping discovery secret will not make condition with thomson replied gravely will say at once be perfectly willing to yield to judgement in matter in return ask something have more serious charge still to bring against sir alfred nephew will leave matter of dealing with young man in hand with pleasure premier agreed think gentleman added looking around table that need not detain major thomson longer others have still little business to finish be over in few minute thomson found in street again guided way by railing into blackness seemed to to be now le impenetrable looking fixedly eastward seemed to be conscious of faint lightening in sky heard rumbling of cart in road horse mostly being led by driver here there odd taxicab have escaped police order came along with one lamp lit only to be stopped in few yard escorted to edge of pavement way up whitehall there be one long line of taxicab unable to ply for hire find way to garage until daylight unusualness of be almost stimulating at top of broad thoroughfare thomson turned to left through pall mall arch passed into st james park strolled slowly along until came to thoroughfare to left leading down to admiralty there paused for moment turning around listened intently be possessed of particularly keen hearing seemed to a though from afar off must hear sound of thousand muffled hammer beating upon anvil of strange methodical disturbance in air grasped railing with one hand gazed upward with straining eye just at moment saw distinctly what appeared to be flash of lightning in sky followed by report sounded like sharp clap of thunder then instinctively covered eye with hand from dozen place one close at hand long level stream of light seemed to shoot out towards cloud there be one of came from near carlton hotel lit up whole of pall mall arch with startling distinctness gave sudden vision of admiralty roof a followed up brought cry to lip far away beyond even limit of quivering line of light there be something in sky seemed little blacker than cloud even while looked at from admiralty roof came lurid flash hiss screech of shell a dashed upwards then sleeping city seemed suddenly to awake night to become hideous not fifty yard away from something fell in park around lump of gravel clod of earth fell in shower great elm tree fell crashing into railing close by side then there be deafening explosion thunder of falling masonry house by side of arch broke suddenly into flame few moment later queer sight amongst untoward unexpected happening fire engine dashed under arch narrowly missing broken fragment of brick stone swung around dozen fire hose commenced to play upon flaming building darkness be over now silence there be house on other side of river on fire scarcely moment passed without crash of falling bomb air for second two be filled with piteous shriek from somewhere towards charing cross shriek drowned almost immediately by tremendous explosion from further north now then looking upwards in line of long searchlight thomson must distinctly see shape of one of circling airship once light flashed downwards between buckingham palace saw great aeroplane coming head foremost down heard strike ground with tremendous crash heard long death cry cry be more like sob of men who perished with moment uproar became more deafening from sort of unsuspected place building came lightning quiver of gun followed by shrieking of shell right on to top of house between where be standing carlton aeroplane fell smashing chimney window hanging there like gigantic black bat there be not soul anywhere near by occasional flash of light thomson must see soldier hurrying people in admiralty square along strand must hear patter of footstep upon pavement remained alone silent spellbound fascinated witness of epic of slaughter ruin then came what seemed to to be culmination high above head be suddenly conscious of downward current of air looked up shouting voice apparently from falling cloud voice unfamiliar guttural warned of what be coming darkness loomed over took shape turned ran for life only little way above head storm of shrapnel now be streaming from lowered gun of admiralty turning back to look saw scarcely fifty yard above falling of huge zeppelin felt just outside range paused breathless with crash seemed to split air huge structure fell far end of buckled up rested against back of admiralty other end be only few yard from where thomson stood at bottom of step leading up into pall mall dozen searchlight played upon men suddenly appeared a though from underneath of stood for moment swayed like drunken men others began to run round corner from admiralty square little company of soldier came with fixed bayonet there be shout two of men ran on thomson heard crack of rifle saw one of leap into air collapse other one staggered fell on knee dozen of be there together with hand stretched to sky then thomson be conscious that one of oil clad figure be coming in direction making for step running with swift stealthy gait flash of light gleamed upon fugitive for moment wore hat like helmet only face blackened with grease staring eye be visible came straight for thomson breathing heavily hand up thomson cried man aimed furious blow at thomson who quite unconsciously have drawn revolver from pocket shot through heart watched jump up fall senseless shapeless heap upon bottom of step with queer instinct of bloodthirstiness ran down line of wrecked zeppelin seeking for more victim soldier be coming up in force now however detachment of be marching away prisoner company be stationed around huge craft keeping guard thomson walked back once more towards admiralty sky be still lurid with reflection of many fire roar of gun have diminished for several minute bomb have be thrown with revolver in hand still smoking ran into man whom knew slightly at admiralty thomson by god man exclaimed what be doing with revolver know answered have just shot one of fellow from zeppelin how be thing going there be six zeppelin down in different part couple of dozen aeroplane other replied woolwich be safe house of parliament whitehall heap of report to come in believe have done much damage thomson passed on be lighter now street be thronged with people turned once more towards strand stood for moment in trafalgar square one wing of national gallery be gone golden cross hotel be in flame leaning against union club be fallen aeroplane men woman be rushing everywhere in wild excitement made way down to war office seemed queer to find men at work still in room sent ambrose for orderly received message from headquarters damage to public building property not yet estimated dockyard arsenal safe principal public building untouched only seventeen dead forty injured reported up to five minute ago great damage done to enemy fleet remainder in full retreat many badly damaged zeppelin just down in essex four aeroplane between here romford thomson threw down revolver well muttered to perhaps london will

with pride fortitude stand now more closely than ever in touch with gallant ally too bear mark of battle in heart of country thomson paused to finish breakfast abandoning leading article turned to more particular account loss of life journal went on to say although regrettable be so far a account have reached not large there be thirty one civilian killed hundred two have be admitted into hospital curiously enough only one person bearing arm have suffered regret deeply to announce death of very distinguished young officer captain ronald granet nephew of sir alfred anselman bomb passed through roof of house in sackville street completely shattering apartment in be sitting servant perished with other occupant of building be fortunately for away for night paper slipped from thomson finger looked through window of room across thames exactly opposite to fallen chimney four blackened wall still smouldering be there to remind of great tragedy looked down at paper again there be mistake be judgment of higher court than made way down to war office at little before ten o'clock street be crowded with people there be throng surrounding of place where bomb have be dropped towards pall mall arch people be standing in thousand trying to get near wreck of huge zeppelin completely blocked traffic through st james park thomson paused for moment at top of trafalgar square looked around word of newspaper be indeed true london have scar yet there be nothing in face of people to show fear if anything there be atmosphere around of greater vitality of greater intensity war have come little nearer at last than column of daily press be real thing with even day londoner have rubbed shoulder from cockspur street to nelson monument men be lined up in long queue making way to
