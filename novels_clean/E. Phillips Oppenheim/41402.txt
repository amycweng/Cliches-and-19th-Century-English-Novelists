before usual time in dark corner saw to surprise bruce deville leaning against pillar with folded arm on way to pew passed adelaide fortress seated in chair in nave neither of two have ever seen in church before what have brought there on particular evening never clearly understood be little irony of fate one of impulse be hard to believe be altogether coincidence bishop came early sat by lady naselton side centre of eye looked away from to chancel be strangely nervous be still dimly lit although bell have ceased to ring there be only moment pause however then little space be filled with white robed figure sister voluntary unduly prolonged in instance died away in few soft chord drew long breath of relief everything be going a usual perhaps after night might be fateful one to watched bishop face from first saw glance up a if in surprise at father rich musical voice woke echo of dark little church with first word of service at singing be always wretched frowned catching sideway glance from lady naselton smiled somewhat studying through half closed eyelid decided that country service in abstract did not attract that be little bored be only when father stood up in pulpit looked around in moment two of hushed suspense precedes giving out of text that line of face relaxed settled down with air of interest for be terribly anxious moment knew father state of health remembered few weary pointless word have gone to make morning sermon contrary to usual custom stood there without note of sort scarcely dared to hope that must be able to do justice yet first word of text have scarcely left lip when premonition of what be to come sent strange thrill through nerve wage of sin be death word must give idea of marvellous yet altogether effortless solemnity with word passed from father lip scarcely uttered above whisper yet penetrated to utmost corner of little church be really intense earnestness wonderful knowledge appreciation of true dramatic effect made close book with slow movement of forefinger stand up there amongst deep shadow a pale a surplice hung around pale form yet when spoke voice did not tremble falter word tense with life vibrating with hidden fire penetrated easily to furthest darkest corner of building wage of sin eternal torment of conscience never sleeping never weary be of that went on to speak can scarcely remember so much a single sentence of sermon although effect upon who formed congregation of listener be memory even now thrill from few opening word pregnant a be with dramatic force lit with fire of true eloquence not for one moment did attention of little congregation wander leaf must have be heard to drop in church rustle of pocket handkerchief be perfectly audible sound not even child looked sideways to watch dark ivy waving softly against stained glass window wondered at strange pattern ray of dying sunlight have traced upon bare stone aisle there be something personal something like cry of human sorrow in slow passionate outpouring be by chance confession accusation to be listening be on universality of sin of father spoke with such heart moving emphasis life be like cupboard having many chamber of be open indeed to daylight gaze of men there be others jealously closed locked must make outside beautiful must keep eye of men from penetrating beneath that fair exterior must lock with cunning secret key so that hand save own must lay bare grisly spectre that lurked within yet own knowledge what have grown to call conscience sat in heart mocked sometime great white light swept into hidden place there be tug at heartstrings behold seal have fallen away in church father added slowly doubted whether one must say that within dark place be not suddenly calm tense eloquence became touched with passion pale face gleamed eye be lit with inward fire gesture tone moved to beat of deeper more subtle rhetoric be pleading for whose sin beat about in bosom lay like dark shadow across sweet place of life passionate more passionate grew be pleading for whom listened entranced terrible earnestness passed like electric thrill into heart of of several woman be cry softly men sat there with bowed head face to face with ghost long since buried bruce deville be sitting back in corner with folded arm downcast head adelaide fortress be looking steadfastly up towards pale inspired figure with soft wet eye even bishop be deeply moved be listening to word for part there be great lump in throat sense of terrible reality behind father impassioned word have left pale trembling subtle sense of excitement stole through church when paused for moment before concluding sentence there be something almost like murmur amongst congregation followed by period of breathless suspense in midst of deep hush faint sound attracted seat be on level with open door glanced out man be leaning against porch man in very grievous condition clothes be disordered torn there be great stain on front of coat alone have gazed away from preacher in pulpit towards whilst looked sound have first attracted be repeated low faint moan scarcely louder than whisper passed between lip stood there supporting with hand against

seemed riveted upon pulpit before must leave seat attract one attention have staggered through door into church stood leaning upon vacant chair wild disordered object with blood stain upon hand clothes dark eye red gleaming fiercely beneath wind tossed mass of black hair so fascinated be congregation save only one two stray people have noticed stood amongst shadow only to whom profile appeared against background of open door be able to mark full terrible disorder of person while waited numb with nameless fear preacher voice rang once more through building men woman bowed head before sweet lingering passion of sad word wage of sin be death for thing may pas away save sin sin alone be eternal sin alone must stamp wherever touch with undying everlasting mark retribution be like tide of sea man hand can stay death ride barque upon rolling wave man woman in world whom sin have known ala that there must be so many have looked into marble face have felt touch of pitiless hand cold despair of unloving embrace for there be death spiritual death physical many of who bear trace of past in present of to day have fought grim battle with death death then father word died away upon lip whole congregation knew what have already thrown into agony of terror man have struggled to bottom of aisle sound of shuffling movement deep groan accompanied have drawn many eye towards awful plight stood revealed with pitiless distinctness in open space where be now standing red blood dripped from clothing upon bare stone floor foam be like foam of death frothed at lip stood there focus of horrified eye swaying to fro a though on eve of collapse arm outstretched eye flashing red fire upon thin almost spectral like figure of preacher now leaning over towards from pulpit slight color forced into father cheek by physical effort of impassioned oratory died away to very lip be white a surplice wore yet did not lose nerve falter for moment motioned to mr charlsworth other church warden left place hurried down aisle towards wild tragical looking figure just a reached cry lip have twice declined to utter burst out upon tense breathless silence made convulsive movement forward a though to spring like wild cat upon calm dignified figure looking down upon with unfaltering unflinching gaze juda juda oh god hand thrown wildly out fell to side sank back into arm of one of who have hurried from place at father gesture last cry more awful than anything have ever heard woke hideous echo amongst wormeaten black oak beam before have died away saw adelaide fortress glide like black wraith from seat fall on knee by fainting man side father lifted up arm with deep solemn tremor in tone pronounced benediction then with surplice flying round came swiftly down aisle between little crowd of horrified people fell back at approach sank on one knee by side of prostrate man looked steadfastly into face congregation waited in place alice who be only partly aware of what be going on

shiver of dread looked around have half risen from seat be leaning over front of pew eye be riveted upon thin sallow face be white with sudden excitement saw look up eye met for one terrible moment did not flinch falter for slightly prolonged resting of eye upon eager strained face took more notice of than of other member of congregation alone knew that challenge have be met answered be hard

that part of delicately chosen sentence might leave everlasting mark behind already fame a preacher be spreading many of townspeople be there attracted by presence listened with rare fervid attention a for seemed that must never altogether lose memory of low musical voice never once raised above ordinary pitch yet with word penetrating softly clearly into furthermost corner of great building there be certain wistfulness in manner night gentle pathetic eloquence brought glistening tear into eye of more than one of little throng of listener for spoke of death of leaving behind of earthly thing of death of spiritual death of tie between man woman man god be so different to what be generally expected from preacher with reputation of eloquence so devoid of usual art of oratory yet so sweetly human aesthetically beautiful that when at last with few word in sense valedictory left pulpit low strain of organ grew louder louder slipped from seat groped across close with eye full of blinding
