closed eye be rather long ride said be worn out hope will not mind for can not talk when motoring smoke if plea might one inquire a to exact destination sogrange asked go beyond hitchin up great north road told again house be called high house stand in middle of heath think be loneliest most miserable place be ever built hate be frightened in for reason other suited bernadine be over now little party of three relapsed into silence car driven carefully enough through busy street gradually increased pace a drew clear of suburb peter leaned back in place thinking bernadine be dead nothing else must have convinced so utterly of fact a simple sentence in daily telegraph have be followed up by confirmation brief obituary notice in evening paper curiously enough fact seemed to have drawn certain spice out of even adventure to point indeed to certain monotony in future present enterprise important though might turn out to be be nothing to be proud of woman greedy for gold be selling lover secret before breath be out of body peter turned in cushioned seat to look at without doubt be beautiful to one who understood beautiful in strange colorless feline fashion beauty of soft limb soft movement caressing voice with always promise beyond of more than actual word eye now be closed face be little weary did really rest peter wondered watched rising falling of bosom quivering now then of eyelid have indeed appearance of woman who have suffered car rushed on into darkness behind lay that restless phantasmagoria of light streaming to sky in front blank space peter through half closed eye watched woman by side from moment of entrance into library have summed up in mind with single word be beyond doubt adventuress woman must have proposed thing have proposed who be not of ilk yet for reason behooved to have care in dealing with at instigation have set out upon adventure might well turn out according to fashion that chose yet without bernadine what must do be not woman to carry on work have left behind for love of word have be frank action shameful natural bernadine be dead have realized quickly enough best market for secret in few day time friend must have come must have received nothing told that be foolish to doubt there be not flaw in sequence of event possible reason for suspicion yet lingered at back of brain intrigue be certain be to a breath of body be perfectly willing to believe that death of bernadine must have affected little more than sweeping aside of fly very common sense bade accept story by degree became drowsy suddenly be startled into very wide awake state through half closed eye have seen sogrange draw sheet of paper from pocket gold pencil from chain commence to write in middle of sentence eye be abruptly lifted be looking at baroness peter too turned head also looked at baroness without doubt have be watching of sogrange pencil continued task only traced more character instead seemed to be sketching face presently tore carefully up into small piece destroyed did not even glance towards peter peter understood very well what have happened have be about to send message have found baroness watching peter be fully awake now faint sense of suspicion have deepened into positive foreboding have reckless desire to stop car to descend upon road let secret of bernadine go where must then natural love of adventure blazed up once more moment of weakness have passed thrill be in blood nerve be tightened be ready for what might come seemingly still half asleep yet indeed with sense of intuition observation keenly alert sogrange leaned over from place be lonely country into be coming madame remarked shrugged shoulder indeed be not so lonely here a will think when arrive at destination replied there be house here be hidden by tree there be house near rubbed pane with hand be believe very nearly there said be nearest village afterwards just climb hill about mile along top of be high house name of village sogrange

will pack up belonging come to london be unfortunately added with little sigh very very poor be hope that may find paper of have spoken to valuable sogrange smiled faintly peter must scarcely forbear to exchange single glance woman candor be almost brutal read thought ascend hill continued draw now very near to end of journey there be still one thing must say to think too badly of for what be about to do to bernadine while lived be faithful many time must have told of plan demanded great sum of money must have given willingly lip be sealed because in way loved while lived gave what owed to day be dead do can not concern more to day be free woman take side choose dear madame replied what have proposed to be after quite natural very gracious if one have fear at about matter be a to

pledged to circulate in certain place literature of infamous sort what must say monsieur to copy of secret report of late maneuver franked with name of one of own staff officer what must say went on to list of socialist deputy with amount against name amount paid in hard cash be of importance to madame sogrange answered simply for such information if be genuine must be hard to mention price must not be prepared to pay car came to sudden standstill first impression of two men be that baroness have exaggerated loneliness desolation of place there be nothing mysterious forbidding about plain brownstone house before have stopped window be streaming with light hall door already thrown open disclosed very comfortable hall brilliantly illuminated man servant assisted mistress to alight ushered in in background be other servant baroness glanced at clock about dinner carl asked wait for madame man answered nodded take care of gentleman till descend ordered will not mind added turning

suspicion have passed woman be roman sell secret of bernadine a must sell nevertheless be well always to be prepared there be probably others beside bernadine who have entree here only suspicious circumstance have noticed peter remarked be number of men servant have seen five already be only fair to remember sogrange reminded that baroness told that there be other save men servant here that be spy without master can not see that be dangerous one need however to watch time if see anything suspicious peter said tap table with forefinger personally will admit have have doubt of baroness on whole have come to conclusion that be groundless be not sort of woman to take up vendetta especially unprofitable one be exceedingly dangerous person for impressionable man like sogrange remarked arranging tie butler fetched in very few moment showed into pleasantly furnished library where mixed cocktail for from collection of bottle upon sideboard be quite friendly inclined to be loquacious although spoke with slight foreign accent house belonged to english gentleman from whom honored count have taken furnished be two mile from station mile from village be lonely part there be always people coming going with one work one scarcely noticed be gratified that gentleman found cocktail so excellent perhaps might be permitted high honor of mixing be day of deep sadness gloom one needed to drink something indeed to forget terrible thing have happened count have be good master little impatient sometimes kind hearted news have be shock to then before have expected baroness reappeared wore wonderful gray gown seemed to be made in single piece gown fitted tightly yet gave curious appearance of woman walking without burden of clothes sogrange parisian to finger tip watched with admiring approval laid finger upon arm although be towards peter that eye traveled will take in marquis begged be only formality will allow ourselves entered long low dining room paneled with oak with family portrait of owner of house still left upon wall dinner be served upon round table be laid for four there be profusion of silver very beautiful glass wonderful cluster of orchid marquis a handed hostess to chair glanced towards vacant place be for companion austrian lady explained to night however think that will not come be distant connection of bernadine be much upset leave place see will sit on other side baron finger touched peter arm brushed hand be withdrawn a though with reluctance sank into chair with little sigh be charming of two declared softly help through night of solitude sadness what must do if be alone can not tell must drink with toast if will will make to better acquaintance soup have be offered champagne be served with hors d'oeuvre peter raised glass looked into eye of woman who be leaning so closely towards that soft breath fell upon cheek whispered something in ear for moment perhaps be carried away for moment only then sogrange voice beat of forefinger upon table stiffened into sudden alertness heard motor car draw up outside who can be baroness exclaimed setting glass down abruptly be perhaps fourth guest who arrives sogrange remarked three listened peter sogrange with glass still suspended in air fourth guest baroness repeated madame von estenier be upstairs lying down can not tell who may be lip be parted line of forehead have suddenly appeared eye be turned toward door hard bright then glass have nervously picked up again be holding between finger fell on to tablecloth with little crash yellow wine ran bubbling on to plate scream echoed to roof rang through room be bernadine who stood there in doorway bernadine in long traveling ulster air of one newly arrived from journey three looked at there be not one who spoke baroness after one wild cry be dumb be indeed fortunate bernadine said have a yet see scarcely commenced probably expected be charmed to find so agreeable party awaiting arrival divested of ulster threw across arm of butler who stood behind come continued for man who have just be killed in railway accident find with appetite glass of wine carl know what that toast be drinking of coming interrupted let drink together aimee love to dear let congratulate upon fortitude courage with ignored lying report of death have fear might find alone in darkened room with tear stained eye sal volatile by side be infinitely better gentleman be welcome sogrange lifted glass bowed courteously peter followed suit really sogrange murmured press nowadays becomes more unreliable day be apparent dear von hern that account of death be to say least of exaggerated peter said nothing eye be fixed upon baroness sat in chair quite motionless face have become like face of graven image looked at bernadine eye said nothing glint of expression seemed to have left feature since one wild shriek have remained voiceless encompassed by danger though knew now must be peter found possessed by one thought only be trap into have fallen be woman too deceived bring later news from paris than sogrange proceeded helping to one of dish footman be passing round how did reach coast evening paper stated distinctly that since accident attempt have be made to run train by motor car from chantilly bernadine replied have misfortune to lose servant who be wearing coat who gather from newspaper report be mistaken for be unhurt hired motor car drove to boulogne not best of journey let tell for broke down three time there be steamer there hired fishing boat brought across channel in something under eight hour from coast motored direct here be so anxious added raising eye to see how dear friend dear aimee be bearing terrible news fluttered for moment like bird in trap peter drew little sigh of relief self respect be reinstated have decided that be innocent upon at least must not fall ignominy of having be led into simplest of trap by white faced delilah butler have brought glass raised to lip drained content ghastliness of appearance remained unchanged peter watching knew sign be sick with terror condition throughout france be indeed awful sogrange remarked say too that railway strike be only beginning of worse thing bernadine smiled country dear marquis said be on last leg one know better than that be at present moment honeycombed with sedition anarchical impulse people be rotten for year whole tone of france have be decadent fall must even now be close at hand take gloomy view of country future sogrange declared why must one refuse to face fact bernadine replied one doe not often talk so frankly three be met together evening under somewhat peculiar circumstance day of glory of france be past england have laid out neck for yoke of conqueror be doomed to fall be ripe for great humiliation two gentleman whom have honor to receive a guest concluded filling glass bowing towards in present unfortunate predicament represent precisely position of two country ave caesar peter muttered grimly raising glass to lip bernadine accepted challenge be not ala who may call caesar replied although be certainly who be about to die sogrange turned to man who stood behind chair if might trouble for little dry toast inquired modern very uncomfortable ailment added with sigh one digestion must march with year suppose bernadine smiled toast will have with pleasure marquis said a for indigestion let trouble longer think that can promise immunity from that annoying complaint for rest of life be doing best peter declared leaning back in chair to take away appetite bernadine looked searchingly from one to other of two guest yes admitted be brave men know why must ever have doubted pose be excellent have wish however to see buoyed up by baseless optimism somewhat remarkable chance have delivered into hand be prisoner peter baron de grost have hated day have stood between achievement of of most dearly cherished task always have said to myself that day of reckoning must come have arrived a for marquis de sogrange if personal feeling towards be le violent still represent thing absolutely inimical to interest departure of two men be one thing necessary for successful completion of certain task have in hand at present moment peter pushed away plate have succeeded in destroying appetite count declared now that have gone so far in expounding amiable resolution towards perhaps will go little further explain exactly how in eminently respectable house situated understand in eminently respectable neighborhood with police station within mile dozen so witness a to present whereabouts intend to expedite removal bernadine pointed toward woman who sat facing ask baroness how thing be arranged turned towards fell back in chair with little gasp have fainted bernadine shrugged shoulder butler one of footman who during whole of conversation have stolidly proceeded with duty in obedience to gesture from master took up in arm carried from room fear have come to too bernadine murmured softly may come to brave friend before morning be possible peter answered hand stealing around to hip pocket in meantime what be to prevent hip pocket be empty peter sentence ended abruptly bernadine mocked to prevent shooting in cold blood suppose remarked nothing except servant be too clever one save be allowed to remain under roof with arm in possession pocket be probably picked before have be in place five minute dear baron let assure that escape will not be so easy be always just little inclined to be led away by fair sex best men in world know have shared that failing baroness alone unprotected have attraction eh then something happened to peter have happened to barely dozen time in life lost temper lost rather badly without instant hesitation caught up decanter stood by side flung in host face bernadine only partly avoided by thrusting out arm neck caught forehead blood came streaming over tie collar peter have followed decanter with sudden spring finger be upon bernadine throat thrust head back sogrange sprang to door to lock be too late room seemed full of men servant peter be dragged away still struggling fiercely tie up bernadine gasped swaying in chair tie up do hear carl give brandy swallowed wineglassful of raw spirit eye be red with fury take to gun room ordered three of to of mind will shoot man who let escape peter sogrange be of too wise to expend more of strength in useless struggle suffered to be conducted without resistance across white stone hall down long passage into room at end window fireplace of be blocked up floor be of red flag wall whitewashed only furniture be couple of kitchen chair long table door be of stout oak fitted with double lock sole outlet so far a must see be small round hole at top of roof door be locked behind be alone odd trick to bernadine peter exclaimed hoarsely wiping spot of blood from forehead dear marquis scarcely know how to apologize be not often that lose temper so completely matter seems to be of very little consequence sogrange answered be probably intended destination in case seems to be rather unfortunate expedition of ours be afraid one can not reckon upon men coming back from dead peter declared be often that find morning evening paper mistaken a for woman believe in honestly meant to sell paper of bernadine believe that too will have to face day of reckoning sogrange strolled around room subjecting everywhere to close scrutiny result be hopeless there be method of escape save through door there be certainly something strange about apartment peter remarked be to say least of unusual to have window in roof door of such proportion same think that threat of bernadine be little strained one can not get rid of one enemy nowadays in old fashioned melodramatic way bernadine must know quite well that be not sort of men to walk into trap of one setting just a be quite sure that be not man to risk even scandal by breaking law openly interest sogrange said begin to suspect that too have made plan naturally peter replied once before bernadine set trap for nearly have chance of sending for swim in thames since then one take precaution a matter of course be followed down here by time must imagine that alarm be given if be well be to have telephoned hour ago be really sogrange declared quite agreeable companion dear baron think of everything door be suddenly opened bernadine stood upon threshold behind several of servant will oblige by stepping back into study friend ordered with great pleasure sogrange answered with alacrity have fancy for room can assure once more crossed stone hall entered room into have first be shown on threshold peter stopped short listened seemed to that from somewhere upstairs must hear sound of woman sob turned to bernadine baroness be not unwell trust asked baroness be a well a be likely to be for time bernadine replied grimly be in study now upon table stood telephone instrument bernadine drew small revolver from pocket baron de grost said find that be not quite such fool a thought one be ringing up for on telephone will reply that be well safe that will be home a soon a business here be finished wife be at other end if breathe single word to of approaching end will hear through telephone sound of revolver shot sends to hell dear peter protested find most unpleasant if will excuse think will answer call at will answer a have directed bernadine insisted only remember if speak single ill advised word end will be a have said peter picked up receiver held to ear who be there asked be violet whose voice heard listened for moment to anxious flood of question there be not slightest cause to be alarmed dear said yes be down at high house near st mary bernadine be here seems that report of death be absolutely unfounded danger unprotected why dear violet know how careful always be simply because bernadine used once to live here because baroness be friend spoke to sir john dory over telephone before left escort of dozen police followed be about place now have doubt presence be quite unnecessary will be home before long dear yes perhaps must be a well to send car down one will direct to house high house st mary remember good by peter replaced receiver turned slowly round bernadine be smiling did well to reassure wife even though be pack of lie told remarked peter shrugged shoulder contemptuously dear bernadine said up till now have tried to take seriously be really passing limit must positively ask to reflect little do men who live life that live trust one be be marquis de sogrange here after lifetime of experience likely to leave safety of home in company with lady of whom knew nothing except be companion without precaution do justice to believe person of commonsense know that be a safe in house a must be in own war can not be made in fashion in over policed country like england be too sure bernadine replied there be secret about house have not yet be disclosed to there be mean dear baron of transporting into world where be likely to do much le harm than here mean ready at hand must leave more trace behind than crumbling ash can tell of coal mine from came peter preserved attitude of bland incredulity listen said drawing whistle from pocket be just possible that be in earnest will bet then if like hundred pound that if blow whistle will either have to open door within five minute find house invaded by police one spoke for several moment vein be standing out upon bernadine forehead have have enough of folly cried if refuse to realize position so much worse for blow whistle if will be content peter waited for second bidding raised whistle to lip blew loudly persistently again there be silence bernadine mocked try once more dear baron advised friend be perhaps little hard of hearing try once more when have finished marquis de sogrange will find way once more to gun room conclude that trifling matter of business brought here again peter blew whistle again silence be broken only by bernadine laugh suddenly however that laugh be checked one have turned toward door listening bell be ringing throughout house be front door one of servant exclaimed one moved a though to put matter beyond doubt there be steady knocking to be heard from same direction be telegram late caller bernadine declared hoarsely answer carl if one must speak with baroness be indisposed unable to receive if one desire be here man left room heard withdraw chain from door bernadine wiped sweat from forehead a listened still gripped revolver in hand peter have changed position little be standing now behind high backed chair heard door creak open voice outside presently tramp of heavy footstep peter nodded understandingly be exactly a told said be wise not to bet friend again tramp of foot in hall there be something unmistakable about sound something final terrifying bernadine saw triumph slipping away once more man who have defied so persistently be to taste sweet of victory with roar of fury sprang across room fired revolver twice before sogrange with terrible blow knocked arm upwards sent weapon spinning to ceiling peter struck assailant in mouth blow seemed scarcely to check rolled on floor together arm around one neck be affair of moment peter a lithe a cat be on foot again almost at once with torn collar ugly mark on face there be stranger in room now servant have mostly slipped away during confusion be sir john dory who locked door bernadine struggled slowly to foot be face to face with dozen

such a peter sogrange dory whose nerve be of iron faced one doubting amazed floor beneath rocked billowed like wave of canvas sea window be filled with flash of red light great fissure parted wall picture book case came crashing down beneath shower of masonry be affair of second above shone star around noise like thunder bernadine who alone understood be first to recover stood in midst of hand above head laughing a looked around at strange storm laughing like madman wonderful carl cried oh matchless servant arrest now if will dog of police rout out secret dear baron de grost tuck under arm hurry to downing street be hospitality of high house friend love so well that only ash will leave mouth be open for sentence when be struck whole pillar of marble from one of room above came crashing through buried underneath falling shower of masonry peter escaped by few inch who be left unhurt sprang through yawning wall out into garden sir john sogrange peter three of men one limping badly came
