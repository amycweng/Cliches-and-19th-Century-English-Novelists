great then like flash sudden conviction laid hold of there be great mysterious reason why have lived so long apart from world chapter iii boy must be told be quite eventful night in quiet life whilst three stood looking at one half fearfully full of strange new idea have just occurred to heard latch of garden gate lifted mr cox vicar of porlock instructor in classic followed by fewer than four large limbed broad shouldered porlock men entered made way up steep garden path father in little surprise rose to greet with mr cox shook hand then glanced inquiringly at follower who after touching hat respectfully stood in row looking supremely uncomfortable betraying strong disposition to retire little behind others mr cox proceeded to explain matter be pleased to look upon a deputation said pleasantly waving hand towards others of be spokesman come from porlock working men conservative club father bowed bidding bring forward garden seat requested deputation to be seated then called into house for jane to bring out jug of cider glass decided smile appeared on somewhat wooden face of deputation be vastly interested not little curious when cider have be brought distributed raid made

able to return in time for meeting else must not have troubled a will not be available thought that perhaps might be induced to accept office be what have come to ask father shook head be very kind of to think of said hesitatingly fear that must decline offer politics have lost most of interest for in short think must rather not hope will reconsider mr cox said pleasantly will be very slight tax

form be very formidable undertaking be mr cox urged smiling be principle be same father answered however leave in way if like give until to morrow evening to think matter over in meantime see if ca find one else be afraid ca say more than that deputation thought that nothing must be fairer than nothing more satisfactory except unqualified assent think father imagined that having promised so much must take departure nothing of sort happened perhaps found cider too good perhaps be tired after day work walk from porlock at rate there sat for more than hour taking occasional gulp at cider puffing incessantly at blackened pipe with stolid vacuous look on honest face whilst father mr cox talked little aside in low tone fancied be subject of conversation though strained ear in attempt to catch part of be unsuccessful once twice sound of name reached directly leaned forward dropped voice so must hear no more have always believed however that father be asking advice from mr cox concerning that mr cox be urging to send to university never knew for certain for event be soon to occur swept out of mind minor curiosity at last mr cox rose to go deputation with manifest reluctance did same father courteously accompanied to garden gate shook hand with thanking for visit when returned there be slight sparkle in eye amused smile on lip so monotonous be life that even event a be welcome must tell from manner that be pleased at request have be made to disposed to accept determined to encourage in governor remarked leaning over wall watching retreating form of visitor hope be not going

here no longer that country life be too quiet for must choose other profession soldier can never be be bitterly disappointed not little curious idea have often occurred to swept suddenly into mind with renewed strength father may ask question hesitated did not forbid have heard said down in village one say that must once have be soldier walk hold head like one father what be matter broke off at once for face have become like dead man have sunk heavily on to seat must have sprung to side mother be there before have passed one arm around neck with other motioned to go into house be fault hugh said must ask father question distress leave now turned heavily away went up stair to room about hour afterwards when pushed open window before getting into bed there stole into room together with sweet scent of jessamine climbing rose sound of subdued voice must be told heard father say solemnly god give strength then voice ceased for while still lingered presently began again in more cheerful key moved away got into bed left window open a always did fragment of conversation still reached be sure that need have fear herbert one in part can have slightest idea of hope will will be change now promise must hear nothing of father reply from tone seemed reluctant though wishful then voice dropped again think must have dozed for time suddenly awoke sat up in bed startled for father voice be

always a be doing now shook head slowly hugh boy must be told be duty to tell not to night have gone through enough to day sighed thought of terrible scene on moor of father wild word passionate action asked question when left for night went to bed there be in heart strong sense of approaching trouble tossed about from side to side in bed till sleep became hopeless then rose hastily putting on clothes slipped out of house even outside found warm oppressive sky be black with cloud without moon softening light sea looked sullen uninviting air seemed heavy even when stood on headland after hour climbing there be cool breeze to reward though have thought myself hard in good condition perspiration came streaming from pore in body found panting for breath stood upright tried to look around everything be wrapped in thick pall of darkness have never known so dark night after standing there for moment two grew afraid to move lest must make false step to right of must hear wind moaning amongst pine tree of allercombe wood slightest breeze when in certain direction always seemed to cause many hundred foot below there be roar of sea unusually loud for such quiet night a swept round sharp corner of headland never have stood there before on night with such heavy heart wished that have not come yet be afraid to go darkness have closed in upon till must almost feel knowing that single step in wrong direction might cost life dared not move suddenly heaviness of atmosphere be explained sky above seemed to be rent aside to let out great blaze of vivid light flashed glittering fiercely brilliant right across arc of heaven sinking at last into horizon of sea showed for moment with lurid light green disturbed almost on heel came thunder trembled a listened seemed a if hill be one by one splitting open with great crash around ground on stood shook again lightning be scattered over inky sky giving ghastly peep at section of patch worky landscape below once flashed down conductor of porlock steeple showing little town a distinctly a have ever seen gale sprung up with marvellous suddenness moaning of pine tree became angry shrieking roar of sea far away below became deafening thunder black cloud grey mist came rolling along sometimes enveloping sometimes passing so close above head must feel moisture by stretching out hand must almost have touched now then above storm must hear piteous bleating of mountain sheep a rushed frantically about seeking in vain for shelter bare hillside must not afford for rain be coming down in sheet blinding driving sheet already swollen mountain stream be making heard above din a swept down into porlock valley before storm have even commenced to die away have thrown face downwards on wet grass be praying strange idea have flashed into mind have suddenly become conviction storm have somehow associated in mind with sudden sense of gloomy depression have laid hold of driven out into black night a one ended so must trouble other foretold be strange idea be stranger still what mastery gained over dared not look up lest must still see threatening sky angry see if such have be case be convinced that must have be strongly tempted to have thrown from cliff into arm of certain death when at last summoned up courage to rise gaze fearfully around be very different sight upon eye dwelt so strangely different that at first seemed almost a though hideous storm have be raging so short while ago must surely have be wild nightmare dark line of exmoor hill be betopped with gorgeous bank of rosy coloured cloud sun have just escaped from be shining down from clear sky gilding transforming whole landscape like great magician white cottage of porlock seemed basking in pleasant warmth whilst field between sea seemed to be stretching out smiling refreshed here there scattered about amongst on white sand be long sparkling streak of silver bore witness of violence of rainfall top of pine tree amongst wind be no longer playing strange prank seemed encrusted with glittering mass of diamond shot forth ray in direction strangest of seemed altered aspect of sea stretched away below like great lake with only gentlest ripple disturbing placid surface mighty playground for myriad of dancing sparkling sunbeam to revel disport upon never have seen hill so green sea exquisite deep clear blue everything seemed to speak of peace calm happiness after suffering struck answering chord in heart must have cried out with joy hideous depression seemed rolled away from must breathe freely again spirit leaped up within threw hat into air shouted for joy till allercombe wood rang with echo then turned away strode down narrow winding path suddenly conscious that be stiff wet tired if have known then when how must next stand on bossington point must ever have come down can not tell chapter vi interrupted address imagine long bare looking apartment with white washed wall generally cheerless appearance in one corner of have

statistic hurled mercilessly at by nervous little ex vendor of calico who made point of dropping h can very soon have enough of before long saw father politely stifle yawn piece of delicacy not being upon platform did not think necessary to imitate audience behaved admirably painful effort written on face of most of to appear intelligently interested be quite affecting at exactly proper moment

appropriate term be of order evolved by combination of trim shapely figure good feature complexion plenty of fair hair soft grey eye latter heritage from mother knew equally well how to gleam with

ended first visit to devereux court chapter xiv beginning of danger before month have passed began to feel quite settled at cottage duty though many lay within capacity be such a found pleasure in undertaking be impossible for not to see that sir francis devereux have taken great to others unaccountable fancy to occasionally made such demand upon time found hard to get through work never grudged hour must honestly spare for day prejudice have felt against grew le began to heartily like pity perhaps change in feeling towards arose chiefly from fact that be obviously unhappy man sorrow be embittering father life clouding mine have laid hand with almost equal bitterness upon be not natural for more than twenty year have never looked upon face heard of son whom have loved better than one else in world heir of devereux for knew might have sunk to lowest depth of vice degradation yet for that must bear title if chose take up abode in home where ancestor have lived with honour for many century at very best there be deep blot nothing must ever efface descendant of long race of mighty soldier have be publicly pronounced coward yet day other by inevitable law of nature must become representative of family to stern old soldier knew well that thought be agony longed to reassure comfort a most certainly must have done time be not yet come naturally saw good deal of maud devereux lady olive much more of latter than former for appeared to have taken violent fancy for marian be often at cottage conceit be never amongst failing of course must not help noticing that time chose for coming be on be most likely to be at home generally when returned from day work found marian gossiping over fire if be early indulging in afternoon tea seemed determined to flirt with willing to be amused let have own way be perfectly aware that other be not in earnest particularly took care not to lapse into sentimental stage on whole managed to amuse one very well with maud devereux made little progress in fact feared sometimes that even disliked be always same cold unbending apparently proud seemed impossible to win even smile from more friendly lady olive became more seemed to stand aloof once twice when have found riding by side alone with for minute have fancied that manner be changing little before must be sure of lady olive must bear down upon challenge to race make mocking speech why must matter to must not tell yet always at such time knew that wished lady olive little further away cold disdainful though be minute with be more to than hour with lady olive yet be daughter of man whom hated more than living thing on whom have sworn to be revenged must fail in great object of life one evening when tired dusty stiff after many hour riding walked into marian little drawing room to beg for cup of tea before changing thing have great surprise instead of lady olive maud devereux be leaning back in easy chair opposite sister maud with proud wearied look gone from cold blue eye actually laughing soft pleasant laugh at one of sister queer speech stepped forward eagerly there be actually shade of something very like embarrassment in face a leaned forward held out hand be surprised to see mr arbuthnot said wanted olive thought most likely place to find have seen to day have hugh marian remarked assented silently spoke of something else did not want to talk about lady olive just then for more than hour sat there sipping tea chatting about new school sir francis be building in village weather close approach of cub hunting must scarcely believe that be indeed maud devereux who sat there in easy chair looking so thoroughly at home talking so pleasantly a rule only word have be able to win from be cold monosyllable only look half impatient half contemptuous one at last rose to go walked with to gate be almost dusk felt that under circumstance might offer to walk up to house with felt absolutely timid about proposing what with lady olive must have be matter of course did propose however be not little disappointed at passive indifference with escort be accepted what must have resented from lady olive accepted humbly from side by side walked through park must think of nothing to say to nothing that dared say with lady olive there must have be thousand light nothing to bandy backwards forward what man living must have dared to speak to maud devereux not at rate once spoke carelessly a though for sake of speaking what spell hold mr arbuthnot silent so long penny for thought answered thoughtlessly be worth more miss devereux for be of be thinking that be first time have walked alone with be not lady olive said coldly be so good mr arbuthnot a to reserve such speech for quickened pace little must have bitten tongue out for folly be not angry for long for at gate led from park into ground paused devereux court with lofty battlement huge stack of chimney towered above window burnished sheet of red fire for setting sun be lingering around bathing with last parting ray a though loth to go what grand old place be said half to myself will be sorry to leave turned round quickly there be actually shade of interest in tone be not thinking of going away be mr arbuthnot thought got on so well with uncle ay too well answered bitterly for be thinking of father hers there be great work lie before miss devereux fear that will do little towards down here life be too pleasant altogether dangerously pleasant yet work hard uncle say observed too hard say sometimes look tired to night might well for have ridden over thirty mile without rest must have ridden thirty to have won such glance from sweet blue eye moment pleasure be worth day work said recklessly have have nearly hour opened gate passed through at once with gesture of contempt if can not remember mr arbuthnot be not lady olive such speech only appear ridiculous to think have better go home said coldly looked down tall though be be not far to stoop into slightly flushed face through dusky twilight must see eye sparkling with gleam of indignation be right to say that have better go home nay have better never have started what have come over must find heart throbbing with pleasure to be alone with daughter of man whom hated be treachery to father a thought of wandering about in weary exile rushed into mind sudden shame laid hold of drew up strode along in silence speaking never word until reached gate leading on to lawn then opened raising cap with half mechanical gesture stood aside to let pas good evening mr arbuthnot good evening miss devereux might have be merely fancy seemed to that lingered for second a though expecting to say something else though be gazing fixedly over head knew well that eye be raised to mine stood silent frowning waiting only for to pas on so went without word watched fair stately walking with swift graceful step along gravel path then turned back upon spot where have vanished leaning against low iron gate let face fall upon folded arm of mental torture man can undergo what be there worse than agony of self reproach to be condemned by judgment may seem to comparatively light thing to be condemned by own what escape chance of escape can there be from seemed to a though be arraigned before tribunal of own conscience a clearly a though indeed stood there saw before bowed form unhappy face of poor father looking steadfastly at out of sad blue eye with story of weary suffering life written with deep line into furrowed face then saw standing at window of room in exeter with oath ringing from lip passionate purpose stirring heart last of saw only few minute ago walking by side with stirred pulse bounding heart by side whose father curse be man above others whom must hate for be not lying word have driven herbert devereux from home blasted life more precious to than own at moment passionate longing came upon to stand face to face with man whom have met in moonlight on exmoor tear truth from lying throat mr arbuthnot started violently turned round pale agitated with rage be burning within maud devereux stood before maud with pride gone out from exquisite face warming light of kindly sympathy shining out of glorious eye startled mr arbuthnot must confess that did miss devereux thought be alone have drawn up to full height be looking steadily at determined that by word look must yield to charm of altered manner be now who be proud cold who be eager little nervous have message to deliver to forgot said hurriedly be to ask to dine with to night doe sir francis particularly wish

be lovely see mr arbuthnot want to take half of to sister if mind think have cut yet colour of be so exquisite do like better maud white bronze white of course answered scarcely looking at care for other colour at prefer lady olive went on filling outstretched hand mr arbuthnot did gather correctly from what be saying when came up that dine with to night be to have happiness lady olive answered if hurry off now be afraid will be late then stop moment laughed mr arbuthnot halted resignedly turned round well oh nothing only maud expect to show evening whose taste choose to follow in what respect asked why chrysanthemum of course maud have chosen white have chosen bronze will look out eagerly to see whose colour wear in buttonhole to night if wear white one sha' speak to evening mind warn what nonsense talk olive said maud carelessly with slight flush rising into cheek a if must make slightest possible difference to colour mr arbuthnot prefers in chrysanthemum there be distinct vein of contempt in concluding sentence lady olive noticing looked at in surprise be positive conviction declared with mock seriousness that notwithstanding mr arbuthnot high flown repudiation two have be quarrelling maud devereux turned impatiently away with scornful shrug of shoulder walked slowly towards house lady olive started to follow at gate paused arbuthnot come here want to speak to retraced step of course stood by side well stood on tiptoe whispered quite unnecessary proceeding for maud be dozen yard away mr arbuthnot what have maud be quarrelling about turned round so abruptly that head knocked together moustache brushed cheek mr arbuthnot be fault assured truthfully sure be looking up at with half coquettish altogether inviting smile quite will show how happened asked stooping down till face be very close to hers what colour chrysanthemum be going to wear evening mr arbuthnot asked rather irrelevantly can ask bronze of course well then yes think may show just so that sha' happen again know added with laughing eye so showed just a matter of precaution received for reward not very hard box on ear saucy mock angry backward glance a broke away from hurried after maud then strode across park angry with yet fiercely exultant for knew that maud have be lingering in shrubbery alone have seen must know now if did not before that grief must have read in face when have returned so unexpectedly be none of causing else have never let lip rest for second on lady olive cheek chapter xv fight for life in le than hour be back at devereux court gong be booming through

ran away laughing being somewhat matter of fact young man keenly conscious of a yet unsatisfied hunger finished dinner before commenced to think seriously over unexpected incident then leaned back in chair considered in very few minute have come to conclusion that be about most fortunate thing must have happened have never intended stay here to be permanent one whilst there be now reason why must remain there be several strong one why must go first must attain nearer now by stopping to great object of life on other hand day stayed here remained under fascination of maud devereux presence stood in greater risk of forgetting oath then whilst here have opportunity of meeting rupert devereux uncle man from whom if came at must come father justification father thought of in weary exile heart ached not line have heard from since parting have even least idea in what country of world be if marian left what be there to prevent finding out throwing in lot with together might accomplish what singly might fail in more thought about more liked idea leave devereux must though have grown to love place to feel strange affection for stern old grandfather yet how must go on living here to feel day subtle fascination of maud devereux presence gaining stronger hold upon maud devereux daughter of man who have wrecked father life mine man whom have cursed in heart seemed to almost like treachery towards whom loved so well whose wrong so bitterly resented that glance from blue eye must madden elate that sound of voice must set sens quivering must go must turn back upon for ever take up work of life wherever might lead thing have happened to marian made way clear before crossed over to little drawing room entering without ceremony of knocking found marian mr holdern seated on

mr devereux said emphatically know how to express sympathy for heard of sad affair when be very little boy have heard father say many time that must never believe herbert devereux to be coward hope to god that will succeed in quest hope so echoed fervently marian know nothing of mr holdern need ever answered think have be quite right to keep from there must have be object gained in knowing woman understand thing like men do know anything of rupert devereux asked shook head very little have seen once tall dark man handsome very unlike devereuxs have heard spoken of a sybarite pleasure seeker be seldom in england believe sybarite pleasure seeker thought of wandering at will through country of world steeping sens in luxury that money must buy living at ease in comfort thought of father also wanderer on face of earth seeking comfort pleasure ease at war with world with with joy in present hope for future seeking only for chance to throw life away in miserable quarrel of pettifogging country who must accept sword mr holdern watched in silence while walked up down room for few minute almost beside with compressed passion then walked up to laid hand on shoulder devereux said
