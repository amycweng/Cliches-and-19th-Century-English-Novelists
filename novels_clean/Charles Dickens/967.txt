enough to aspire to hand of lady of fortune have wedded old flame out of mere attachment who in turn have taken for same reason thus two people who can not afford to play card for money sometimes sit down to quiet game for love ill conditioned person who sneer at life matrimonial may perhaps suggest in place that good couple must be better likened to two principal in sparring match who when fortune be low backer scarce will chivalrously set to for mere pleasure of buffeting in one respect indeed comparison must hold good for a adventurous pair of five court will afterwards send round hat trust to bounty of looker on for mean of regaling so mr godfrey nickleby partner honeymoon being over looked out wistfully into world relying in inconsiderable degree upon chance for improvement of

next quarter day then falling from top of monument by accident there came one morning by general post black bordered letter to inform how uncle mr ralph nickleby be dead have left bulk of little property amounting in to five thousand pound sterling a deceased have taken no further notice of nephew in lifetime than sending to eldest boy who have be christened after on desperate speculation silver spoon in morocco case a have not too much to eat with seemed kind of satire upon having be born without useful article of plate in mouth mr godfrey nickleby must at first scarcely believe

gleaned from thence nothing forewarning to shun great world attach to quiet routine of country life ralph elder deduced from often repeated tale two great moral that rich be only true source of happiness power that be lawful just to compass acquisition by mean short of felony 'and reasoned ralph with 'if good came of uncle money when be alive great deal of good came of after be dead inasmuch a father have got now be saving up for be highly virtuous purpose going back to old gentleman good did come of to too for have pleasure of thinking of life long of being envied courted by family

other voice have have poor deyvle ' laugh be taken up by two voice always came in together became general at mr nickleby expense nicholas turned burning hot with rage commanded for moment waited to hear more what heard need not be repeated here suffice that a wine went round heard enough to acquaint with character design of whose conversation overhead to posse with full extent of ralph villainy real reason of own presence being required in london heard more heard sister suffering derided virtuous conduct jeered at brutally misconstrued heard name bandied from mouth to mouth made subject of coarse insolent wager free speech licentious jesting man who have spoken first led conversation indeed almost engrossed being only stimulated from time to time by slight observation from one other of companion to then nicholas addressed when be sufficiently composed to stand before party force word from parched scorching throat 'let have word with sir ' said nicholas sir ' retorted sir mulberry hawk eyeing in disdainful surprise ' said with ' replied nicholas speaking with great difficulty for passion choked ' mysterious stranger upon soul ' exclaimed sir mulberry raising wine glass to lip looking round upon friend step apart with for few minute do refuse ' said nicholas sternly sir mulberry merely paused in act of drinking bade name business leave table nicholas drew card from pocket threw before 'there sir ' said nicholas business will guess ' momentary expression of astonishment not unmixed with confusion appeared in face of sir mulberry a read name subdued in instant tossing card to lord verisopht who sat opposite drew toothpick from glass before very leisurely applied to mouth name address ' said nicholas turning paler a passion kindled will give ' replied sir mulberry there be gentleman in party ' said nicholas looking round scarcely able to make white lip form word will acquaint with name residence of man ' there be dead silence ' be brother of young lady who have

midnight 'you be base spiritless scoundrel ' said nicholas 'and will be proclaimed so to world will know will follow home if walk street till morning ' sir mulberry hand involuntarily closed upon decanter seemed for instant about to launch at head of challenger only filled glass laughed in derision nicholas sat down directly opposite to party summoning waiter paid bill know that person name ' inquired of man in audible voice pointing out sir mulberry a put question sir mulberry laughed again two voice have always spoken together echoed laugh rather feebly 'that gentleman sir ' replied waiter who doubt knew cue answered with just a little respect just a much impertinence a must safely show 'no sir sir ' sir ' cried sir mulberry a man be retiring 'do know that person name ' sir sir will find there ' said sir mulberry throwing nicholas card towards 'and when have made master of put that piece of pasteboard in fire do hear ' man grinned looking doubtfully at nicholas compromised matter by sticking card in chimney glass having done retired nicholas folded arm biting lip sat perfectly quiet sufficiently expressing by manner however firm determination to carry threat of following sir mulberry home into steady execution be evident from tone in younger member of party appeared to remonstrate with friend that objected to course of proceeding urged to comply with request nicholas have made sir mulberry however who be not quite sober who be in sullen dogged state of obstinacy soon silenced representation of weak young friend further seemed a if to save from repetition of to insist on being left alone however might have be young gentleman two who have always spoken together actually rose to go after short interval presently retired leaving friend alone with nicholas will be very readily supposed that to one in condition of nicholas minute appeared to move with leaden wing indeed that progress did not seem more rapid from monotonous ticking of french clock shrill sound of little bell told quarter there sat in old seat on opposite side of room reclined sir mulberry hawk with leg upon cushion handkerchief thrown negligently over knee finishing magnum of claret with utmost coolness indifference thus remained in perfect silence for upwards of hour nicholas must have thought for three hour at least that little bell have only gone four time twice thrice looked angrily impatiently round there be sir mulberry in same attitude putting glass to lip from time to time looking vacantly at wall a if be wholly ignorant of presence of living person at length yawned stretched rose walked coolly to glass having surveyed therein turned round honoured nicholas with long contemptuous stare nicholas stared again with right good will sir mulberry shrugged shoulder smiled slightly rang bell ordered waiter to help on with greatcoat man did so held door open wait ' said sir mulberry be alone again sir mulberry took several turn up down room whistling carelessly time stopped to finish last glass of claret have poured out few minute before walked again put on hat adjusted by glass drew on glove at last walked slowly out nicholas who have be fuming chafing until be nearly wild darted from seat followed so closely that before door have swung upon hinge after sir mulberry passing out stood side by side in street together there be private cabriolet in

be none like be poor creature know that ' 'you be foolish silly creature ' said nicholas cheerfully 'if be what mean grant that why here be dismal face for lady company pretty sister too whom have so often asked about be yorkshire gallantry for shame for shame ' smike brightened up smiled 'when talk of home ' pursued nicholas talk of mine be yours of course if be defined by particular four wall

must call by same good name notwithstanding now for what be present home however alarming expectation may be will terrify by extent magnificence ' so saying nicholas took companion by arm saying great deal more to same purpose pointing out various thing to amuse interest a went along led way to miss la creevy house 'and kate ' said nicholas entering room where sister sat alone 'be faithful friend affectionate fellow traveller whom prepared to receive ' poor smike be bashful awkward frightened enough at first kate advanced towards so kindly said in such sweet voice how anxious have be to see after brother have told how much have to thank for having comforted nicholas so greatly in very trying revers that began to be very doubtful whether must shed tear not became still more flurried however managed to say in broken voice that nicholas be only friend that must lay down life to help kate although be so kind considerate seemed to be so wholly unconscious of distress embarrassment that recovered almost immediately felt quite at home then miss creevy came in to smike have to be presented also miss la creevy be very kind too wonderfully talkative not to smike for must have made uneasy at first to nicholas sister then after time must speak to smike now then asking whether be judge of likeness whether thought that picture in corner be like whether did think must have looked better if have made ten year younger whether did think a matter of general observation that young lady looked better not only in picture out of too than old one with many more small joke facetious remark be delivered with such good humour merriment that smike thought within be nicest lady have ever seen even nicer than mr grudden of mr vincent crummles theatre be nice lady too talked perhaps more certainly louder than miss la creevy at door opened again lady in mourning came in nicholas kissing lady in mourning affectionately calling mother led towards chair from smike have risen when entered room be always kind hearted anxious to help oppressed dear mother ' said nicholas beo will be favourably disposed towards know ' ' be sure dear nicholas replied mr nickleby looking very hard at new friend bending to with something more of majesty than occasion seemed to require ' be sure friend of yours have a indeed naturally ought to have must have of course know great claim upon of course be very great pleasure to to be introduced to anybody take interest in there can be doubt about none at not least in world ' said mr nickleby 'at same time must say nicholas dear a used to say to poor dear papa when must bring gentleman home to dinner there be nothing in house that if have come day before yesterday mean day before yesterday now must have said perhaps year before last must have be better able to entertain ' with remark mr nickleby turned to daughter inquired in audible whisper whether gentleman be going to stop night if be kate dear said mr nickleby ' see that be possible for to sleep anywhere be truth kate stepped gracefully forward without show of annoyance irritation breathed few word into mother ear 'la kate dear ' said mr nickleby shrinking back 'how do tickle one of course understand that love without telling said same to nicholas be very much pleased did tell nicholas dear ' added mr nickleby turning round with air of le reserve than have before assumed 'what friend name be 'his name mother ' replied nicholas smike ' effect of communication be by mean anticipated name be sooner pronounced than mr nickleby dropped upon chair burst into fit of cry be matter exclaimed nicholas running to support 'it so like pyke ' cried mr nickleby beo exactly like pyke oh speak to will be better presently after exhibiting symptom of slow suffocation in stage drinking about tea spoonful of water from full tumbler spilling remainder mr nickleby be better remarked with feeble smile that be very foolish knew be weakness in family ' said mr nickleby beo of course ca be blamed for grandmama kate be exactly same precisely least excitement slightest surprise fainted away directly have heard say often often that when be young lady before be married be turning corner into oxford street one day when ran against own hairdresser who seems be escaping from bear mere suddenness of encounter made faint away directly wait though ' added mr nickleby pausing to consider 'let be sure be right be hairdresser who have escaped from bear be bear who have escaped from hairdresser declare ca remember just now hairdresser be very handsome man know quite gentleman in manner so that have nothing to do with point of story mr nickleby having fallen imperceptibly into one of retrospective mood improved in temper from moment glided by easy change of conversation occasionally into various other anecdote le remarkable for strict application to subject in hand smike be from yorkshire nicholas dear ' said mr nickleby after dinner when have be silent for time 'certainly mother ' replied nicholas see have not forgotten melancholy history o dear ' cried mr nickleby melancholy indeed happen mr smike ever to have dined with grimbles of grimble hall somewhere in north riding do ' said good lady addressing to ' very proud man sir thomas grimble with six grown up most lovely daughter finest park in county bey dear mother ' reasoned nicholas 'do suppose that unfortunate outcast of yorkshire school be likely to receive many card of invitation from nobility gentry in neighbourhood dear know why must be so very extraordinary ' said mr nickleby ' know that when be at school always went at least twice half year to hawkins at taunton vale be much richer than grimbles connected with in marriage so see be not so very unlikely after ' having put down nicholas in triumphant manner mr nickleby be suddenly seized with forgetfulness of smike real name irresistible tendency to call mr slammons circumstance attributed to remarkable similarity of two name in point of sound beginning with s moreover being spelt with m doubt there might be on point there be none a to being most excellent listener circumstance have considerable influence in placing on very best term inducing mr nickleby to express highest opinion of general deportment disposition thus little circle remained on most amicable agreeable footing until monday morning when nicholas withdrew from for short time seriously to reflect upon state of affair to determine if must upon course of life must enable to support who be so entirely dependent upon exertion mr crummles occurred to more than once although kate be acquainted with whole history of connection with gentleman mother be not foresaw thousand fretful objection on part to seeking livelihood upon stage there be graver reason too against returning to mode of life independently of arising out of spare precarious earnings own internal conviction that must never hope to aspire to great distinction even a provincial actor how must carry sister from town to town place to place debar from other associate than with whom must be compelled almost without distinction to mingle 'it wo do ' said nicholas shaking head ' must try something else be much easier to make resolution than to carry into effect with greater experience of world than have acquired for in short trial with sufficient share of headlong rashness precipitation quality not altogether unnatural at time of life with very slender stock of money still more scanty stock of friend what must do 'egad ' said nicholas `` ll try register office again smiled at a walked away with quick step for instant before have be internally blaming own precipitation did not laugh out of intention however for on went picturing to a approached place kind of splendid possibility impossibility too for matter thinking perhaps with good reason very fortunate to be endowed with so buoyant sanguine temperament office looked just same a when have left last indeed with one two exception there seemed to be very same placard in window that have seen before there be same unimpeachable master mistress in want of virtuous servant same virtuous servant in want of unimpeachable master mistress same magnificent estate for investment of capital same enormous quantity of capital to be invested in estate in short same opportunity of sort for people who wanted to

accident not ordinary way of wearing with pleasant smile playing about mouth comical expression of mingled slyness simplicity kind heartedness good humour lighting up jolly old face that nicholas must have be content to have stood there looked at until evening to have forgotten meanwhile that there be such thing a soured mind crabbed countenance to be met with in whole wide world even very remote approach to gratification be not to be made for although seemed quite unconscious of having be subject of observation looked casually at nicholas latter fearful of giving offence resumed scrutiny of window instantly still old gentleman stood there glancing from placard to placard nicholas must not forbear raising eye to face again grafted upon quaintness oddity of appearance be something so indescribably engaging bespeaking so much worth there be so many little light hovering about corner of mouth eye that be not mere amusement positive pleasure delight to look at being case be wonder that old man caught nicholas in fact more than once at such time nicholas coloured looked embarrassed for truth be that have begun to wonder whether stranger must by possibility be looking for clerk

across road to try effect from opposite side of street satisfied that nothing must possibly look better in way mr kenwigs then stepped back again calling through keyhole to morleena to open door vanished into house be seen no longer now considered a abstract circumstance there be more obvious cause reason why mr kenwigs must take trouble of muffling particular knocker than there must have be for muffling knocker of nobleman gentleman resident ten mile off because for greater convenience of numerous lodger street door always stood wide open knocker be never used at first floor second floor third floor have bell of own a to attic one ever called on if anybody wanted parlour be close at hand have to do be to walk straight into while kitchen have separate entrance down area step a question

turned back pretending to be absorbed in account took opportunity of hastily wiping eye when supposed nicholas be looking way whether be that tim account be more than usually intricate that morning whether be that habitual serenity have be little disturbed by recollection so happened that when nicholas returned from executing commission inquired whether mr charles cheeryble be alone in room tim promptly without smallest hesitation replied in affirmative although somebody have passed into room not ten minute before tim took especial particular pride in preventing intrusion on of brother when be engaged with visitor `` ll take letter to at once said nicholas 'if be case with walked to room knocked at door answer knock still answer ca be here ' thought nicholas `` ll lay on table ' so nicholas opened door walked in very quickly turned to walk out again when saw to great astonishment discomfiture young lady upon knee at mr cheeryble foot mr cheeryble beseeching to rise entreating third person who have appearance of young lady female attendant to add persuasion to to induce to do so nicholas stammered out awkward apology be precipitately retiring when young lady turning head little presented to view feature of lovely girl whom have seen at register office on first visit long before glancing from to attendant recognised same clumsy servant who have accompanied then between admiration of young lady beauty confusion surprise of unexpected recognition stood stock still in such bewildered state of surprise embarrassment for moment be quite bereft of power to speak move bey dear ma'be dear young lady cried brother charles in violent agitation 'pray not word beseech entreat implore beg of to rise be not alone a spoke raised young lady who staggered to chair swooned away have fainted sir ' said nicholas darting eagerly forward 'poor dear poor dear cried brother charles 'where be brother ned ned dear brother come here pray ' charles dear fellow ' replied brother hurrying into room be ah what ' 'hush hush not word for life brother ned returned other 'ring for housekeeper dear brother call tim linkinwater here tim linkinwater sir mr nickleby dear sir leave room

'brother ned dear fellow will be surprised know to witness in business hour here be again reminded of presence of nicholas shaking by hand earnestly requested to leave room to send tim linkinwater without instant delay nicholas immediately withdrew on way to counting house met old housekeeper tim linkinwater jostling other in passage hurrying to scene of action with extraordinary speed without waiting to hear message tim linkinwater darted into room presently afterwards nicholas heard door shut locked on inside have abundance of time to ruminate on discovery for tim linkinwater be absent during greater part of hour during whole of time nicholas thought of nothing young lady exceeding beauty what must possibly have brought there why made mystery of more thought of more perplexed more anxious became to know who what be ' must have known among ten thousand thought nicholas with walked up down room recalling face figure of have peculiarly vivid remembrance discarded other subject of reflection dwelt upon alone at length tim linkinwater came back provokingly cool with paper in hand pen in mouth a if nothing have happened 'be quite recovered ' said nicholas impetuously 'who returned tim linkinwater ' repeated nicholas young lady 'what do make mr nickleby ' said tim taking pen out of mouth 'what do make of four hundred twenty seven time three thousand two hundred thirty eight ' returned nicholas 'what do make of question first asked ' 'about young lady ' said tim linkinwater putting on spectacle be sure yes oh be very well ' havery well be ' returned nicholas havery well ' replied mr linkinwater gravely 'will be able to go home today asked nicholas be gone ' said tim 'gone 'yes hope have not far to go ' said nicholas looking earnestly at other 'ay replied immovable tim hope have ' nicholas hazarded one two further remark be evident that tim linkinwater have own reason for evading subject that be determined to afford further information respecting fair unknown who have awakened so much curiosity in breast of young friend nothing daunted by repulse nicholas returned to charge next day emboldened by circumstance of mr linkinwater being in very talkative communicative mood directly resumed theme tim relapsed into state of most provoking taciturnity from answering in monosyllable came to returning answer at save such a be to be inferred from several grave nod shrug only served to whet appetite for intelligence in nicholas have already attained most unreasonable height foiled in attempt be fain to content with watching for young lady next visit here again be disappointed day after day passed did not return looked eagerly at superscription of note letter there be not one among must fancy to be in handwriting on two three occasion be employed on business took to distance have formerly be transacted by tim linkinwater nicholas must not help suspecting that for reason other be sent out of way on purpose that young lady be there in absence nothing transpired however to confirm suspicion tim must not be entrapped into confession admission tending to support in smallest degree mystery disappointment be not absolutely indispensable to growth of love be very often powerful auxiliary 'out of sight out of mind ' be well enough a proverb applicable to case of friendship though absence be not always necessary to hollowness of heart even between friend truth honesty like precious stone be perhaps most easily imitated at distance when counterfeit often pas for real love however be very materially assisted by warm active imagination have long memory will thrive for considerable time on very slight sparing food thus be that often attains most luxuriant growth in separation under circumstance of utmost difficulty thus be that nicholas thinking of nothing unknown young lady from day to day from hour to hour began at last to think that be very desperately in love with never be such ill used persecuted lover a still though loved languished after most orthodox model be only deterred from making confidante of kate by slight consideration of having never in life spoken to object of passion having never set eye upon except on two occasion on of have come gone like flash of lightning a nicholas said in numerous conversation held with like vision of youth beauty much too bright to last ardour devotion remained without reward young lady appeared more so there be great deal of love wasted enough indeed to have set up dozen young gentleman a time go with utmost decency nobody be bit wiser for not even nicholas who on contrary became more dull sentimental lackadaisical day while matter be in state failure of correspondent of brother cheeryble in germany imposed upon tim linkinwater nicholas necessity of going through very long complicated account extending over considerable space of time to get through with greater dispatch tim linkinwater proposed that must remain at counting house for week so until ten o'clock at night to a nothing damped zeal of nicholas in service of kind patron not even romance have seldom business habit cheerfully assented on very first night of later hour at nine exactly there came not young lady servant who being closeted with brother charles for time went away returned next night at same hour on next on next again repeated visit inflamed curiosity of nicholas to very highest pitch tantalised excited beyond bearing unable to fathom mystery without neglecting duty confided whole secret to newman noggs imploring to be on watch next night to follow girl home to set on foot such inquiry relative to name condition history of mistress a must without exciting suspicion to report result to with least possible delay beyond measure proud of commission newman noggs took up post in square on following evening full hour before needful time planting behind pump pulling hat over eye began watch with elaborate appearance of mystery admirably calculated to excite suspicion of beholder indeed diver servant girl who came to draw water sundry little boy who stopped to drink at ladle be almost scared out of sens by apparition of newman noggs looking stealthily round pump with nothing of visible face that wearing expression of meditative ogre punctual to time messenger came again after interview of rather longer duration than usual departed newman have made two appointment with nicholas one for next evening conditional on success one next night following be to be kept under circumstance first night be not at place of meeting certain tavern about way between city golden square on second night be there before nicholas received with open arm right whispered newman down sit down there be dear young man let tell about ' nicholas needed second invitation eagerly inquired what be news 'there be great deal of news ' said newman in flutter of exultation right be anxious know where to begin never mind that keep up spirit be all right ' 'well said nicholas eagerly ' 'yes replied newman 'that be ' 'what be ' said nicholas 'the name name dear fellow ' name bobster ' replied newman 'bobster repeated nicholas indignantly 'that be name said newman ' remember by lobster ' repeated nicholas more emphatically than before must be servant name ' 'no said newman shaking head with great positiveness cecilia bobster ' eh ' returned nicholas muttering two name together over over again in variety of tone to try effect 'well cecilia be pretty name ' havery pretty creature too said newman 'who said nicholas beiss bobster where have seen demanded nicholas mind dear boy retorted noggs clapping on shoulder have seen will see have managed ' bey dear newman cried nicholas grasping hand serious ' be replied newman ' mean word will see tomorrow night consent to hear speak for persuaded be affability goodness sweetness beauty ' know be know must be newman ' said nicholas wringing hand 'you be right returned newman doe live ' cried nicholas have learnt of history have father mother brother sister what did say how came to see be not very much surprised did say how passionately have longed to speak to did tell where have seen did tell how when where how long how often have thought of sweet face came upon in bitterest distress like glimpse of better world did newman did ' poor noggs literally gasped for breath a flood of question rushed upon moved spasmodically in chair at fresh inquiry staring at nicholas meanwhile with most ludicrous expression of perplexity 'no said newman ' did tell ' 'did tell asked nicholas 'about glimpse of better world ' said newman ' did tell who be either where 'd seen said loved to distraction ' 'that be true newman replied nicholas with characteristic vehemence know do ' ' said too that have admired for long time in secret said newman 'yes yes what did say to ' asked nicholas 'blushed ' said newman 'to be sure of course must ' said nicholas approvingly newman then went on to say that young lady be only child that mother be dead that resided with father that have be induced to allow lover secret interview at intercession of servant who have great influence with further related how required much moving great eloquence to bring young lady to pas how be expressly understood that merely afforded nicholas opportunity of declaring passion how by mean pledged to be favourably impressed with attention mystery of visit to brother cheeryble remained wholly unexplained for newman have not alluded to either in preliminary conversation with servant subsequent interview with mistress merely remarking that have be instructed to watch girl home plead young friend cause not saying how far have followed from what point newman hinted that from what have fallen from confidante have be led to suspect that young lady led very miserable unhappy life under strict control of only parent who be of violent brutal temper circumstance thought might in degree account for having sought protection friendship of brother suffering to be prevailed upon to grant promised interview last held to be very logical deduction from premise inasmuch a be natural to suppose that young lady whose present condition be so unenviable must be more than commonly desirous to change appeared on further questioning for be only by very long arduous process that must be got out of newman noggs newman in explanation of shabby appearance have represented a being for certain wise indispensable purpose connected with intrigue in disguise being questioned how have come to exceed commission so far a to procure interview responded that lady appearing willing to grant considered bound in duty gallantry to avail of golden mean of enabling nicholas to prosecute address after possible question have be asked answered twenty time over parted undertaking to meet on following night at half past ten for purpose of fulfilling appointment be for eleven o'clock 'things come about very strangely ' thought nicholas a walked home ' never contemplated anything of kind never dreamt of possibility of to know something of life of one in whom felt such interest to see in street to pas house in lived to meet sometimes in walk to hope that day might come when might be in condition to tell of love be utmost extent of thought now however must be fool indeed to repine at own good fortune still nicholas be dissatisfied there be more in dissatisfaction than mere revulsion of feeling be angry with young lady for being so easily won 'because reasoned nicholas 'it be not a if knew be might have be anybody ' be certainly not pleasant next moment be angry with for entertaining such thought arguing that nothing goodness must dwell in such temple that behaviour of brother sufficiently showed estimation in held 'the fact be be mystery altogether said nicholas be not more satisfactory than previous course of reflection only drove out upon new sea of speculation conjecture where tossed tumbled in great discomfort of mind until clock struck ten hour of meeting drew nigh nicholas have dressed with great care even newman noggs have trimmed up little coat presenting phenomenon of two consecutive button supplementary pin being inserted at tolerably regular interval wore hat too in newest taste with pocket handkerchief in crown twisted end of straggling out behind after fashion of pigtail though must scarcely lay claim to ingenuity of inventing latter decoration inasmuch a be utterly unconscious of being in nervous excited condition rendered quite insensible to everything great object of expedition traversed street in profound silence after walking at round pace for distance arrived in one of gloomy appearance very little frequented near edgeware road 'number twelve ' said newman 'oh replied nicholas looking about 'good street ' said newman 'yes returned nicholas dull ' newman made answer to remark halting abruptly planted nicholas with back to area railing gave to understand that be to wait there without moving hand foot until be satisfactorily ascertained that coast be clear done noggs limped away with great alacrity looking over shoulder instant to make quite certain that nicholas be obeying direction ascending step of house half dozen door off be lost to view after short delay reappeared limping back again halted midway beckoned nicholas to follow 'well said nicholas advancing towards on tiptoe 'all right ' replied newman in high glee ready nobody at home must be better have have ' with fortifying assurance stole past street door on nicholas caught glimpse of brass plate with 'bobster in very large letter stopping at area gate be open signed to young friend to descend 'what devil cried nicholas drawing back 'be to sneak into kitchen a if came after fork 'hush ' replied newman bobster ferocious turk 'd kill box young lady ear doe often ' 'what ' cried nicholas in high wrath mean to tell that man must dare to box ear of such have time to sing praise of mistress just then for newman gave gentle push have nearly precipitated to bottom of area step thinking best to take hint in good part nicholas descended without further remonstrance with countenance bespeaking anything rather than hope rapture of passionate lover newman followed must have followed head first for timely assistance of nicholas taking hand led through stone passage profoundly dark into back kitchen cellar of blackest most pitchy obscurity where stopped 'well said nicholas in discontented whisper 'this be not suppose be ' 'no ' rejoined noggs 'they will be here directly be all right ' be glad to hear ' said nicholas must have thought confess ' exchanged further word there nicholas stood listening to loud breathing of newman noggs imagining that nose seemed to glow like red hot coal even in midst of darkness enshrouded suddenly sound of cautious footstep attracted ear directly afterwards female voice inquired if gentleman be there 'yes replied nicholas turning towards corner from voice proceeded 'who be that ' 'only sir ' replied voice if please ma'be ' gleam of light shone into place presently servant girl appeared bearing light followed by young mistress who seemed to be overwhelmed by modesty confusion at sight of young lady nicholas started changed colour heart beat violently stood rooted to spot at instant almost simultaneously with arrival that of candle there be heard loud furious knocking at street door caused newman noggs to jump up with great agility from beer barrel on have be seated astride to exclaim abruptly with face of ashy paleness 'bobster by lord ' young lady shrieked attendant wrung hand nicholas gazed from one to other in apparent stupefaction newman hurried to fro thrusting hand into pocket successively drawing out lining of one in excess of irresolution be moment confusion crowded into one moment imagination can exaggerate 'leave house for heaven sake have done wrong deserve ' cried young lady 'leave house be ruined undone for ever 'will hear say one word ' cried nicholas 'only one will not detain will hear say one word in explanation of mischance ' nicholas might a well have spoken to wind for young lady with distracted look hurried up stair must have followed newman twisting hand in coat collar dragged towards passage by have entered 'let go newman in devil name ' cried nicholas must speak to will will not leave house without beputation character violence consider ' said newman clinging round with arm hurrying away 'let open door will go a came directly be shut come way here ' overpowered by remonstrance of newman tear prayer of girl tremendous knocking above have never ceased nicholas allowed to be hurried off precisely a mr bobster made entrance by street door noggs made exit by area gate hurried away through several street without stopping speaking at last halted confronted other with blank rueful face mind ' said newman gasping for breath ' be cast down be all right more fortunate next time must be helped did part ' 'excellently replied nicholas taking hand 'excellently like true zealous friend be only mind be not disappointed newman feel just a much indebted to only be wrong lady ' cried newman noggs 'taken in by servant 'newman newman ' said nicholas laying hand upon shoulder 'it be wrong servant too newman under jaw dropped gazed at nicholas with sound eye fixed fast motionless in head ' take to heart ' said nicholas 'it of consequence see care about followed wrong person be ' be whether newman noggs have looked round pump in slanting direction so long that sight became impaired whether finding that there be time to spare have recruited with few drop of something stronger than pump must yield by whatsoever mean have come to pas be mistake nicholas went home to brood upon to meditate upon charm of unknown young lady now a far beyond reach a ever chapter containing romantic passage between mr nickleby gentleman in small clothes next door ever since last momentous conversation with son mr nickleby have begun to display unusual care in adornment of person gradually superadding to staid matronly habiliment have up to time formed ordinary attire variety of embellishment decoration slight perhaps in taken together considered with reference to subject of disclosure of mean importance even black dress assumed something of deadly lively air from jaunty style in be worn eked out a lingering attraction be by prudent disposal here there of certain juvenile ornament of little value have for reason alone escaped general wreck be permitted to slumber peacefully in odd corner of old drawer box where daylight seldom shone mourning garment assumed quite new character from being outward token of respect sorrow for dead became converted into signal of very slaughterous killing design upon living mr nickleby might have be stimulated to proceeding by lofty sense of duty impulse of unquestionable excellence might by time have become impressed with sinfulness of long indulgence in unavailing woe necessity of setting proper example of neatness decorum to blooming daughter consideration of duty responsibility apart change might have taken rise in feeling of purest most disinterested charity gentleman next door have be vilified by nicholas rudely stigmatised a dotard idiot for attack upon understanding mr nickleby be in sort accountable might have felt that be act of good christian to show by mean in power that abused gentleman be one other what better mean must adopt towards so virtuous laudable end than proving to men in own person that passion be most rational reasonable in world just very result of others discreet thinking person might have foreseen from incautiously displaying matured charm without reserve under very eye a be of ardent too susceptible man ' said mr nickleby gravely shaking head nicholas knew what poor dear papa suffered before be engaged when used to hate must have little more feeling will ever forget morning looked scornfully at when offered to carry parasol that night when frowned at be mercy did emigrate very nearly drove to ' whether deceased might not have be better off if have emigrated in bachelor day be question relict did not stop to consider for kate entered room with workbox in stage of reflection much slighter interruption interruption at must have diverted mr nickleby thought into new channel at time dear ' said mr nickleby ' know how be fine warm summer day like with bird singing in direction always put in mind of roast pig with sage onion sauce made

cheerful smile 'no do think so kate ' said mr nickleby with a much gravity a if be question of most imminent thrilling interest 'if say so at once know because be just a well to be correct particularly on point of kind be very curious worth settling while one think about ' kate laughingly replied that be quite convinced a mama still appeared undetermined whether be not absolutely essential that subject must be renewed proposed that must take work into summer house enjoy beauty of afternoon mr nickleby readily assented to summer house repaired without further discussion will

favourable impression not only upon worthy yorkshireman wife upon nicholas also who revolving thing in mind a made best of way home arrived at conclusion that have laid foundation of most agreeable desirable acquaintance 'but be most extraordinary thing about register office fellow ' thought nicholas 'be likely that nephew can know anything about beautiful girl when tim linkinwater gave to

fell to lot of man there be reason to suppose that being in love felt thought differently from other people in like sublime condition did not stop to set on foot inquiry into train of thought state of feeling however went thinking on way home continued to dream on in same strain night for having satisfied that frank cheeryble must have knowledge of acquaintance with mysterious young lady began to occur to that even might never see again upon hypothesis built up very ingenious succession of tormenting idea answered purpose even better than vision of mr frank cheeryble tantalised worried waking sleeping notwithstanding have be said sung to contrary there be well established case of morning having deferred hastened approach by term of hour so for mere gratification of splenetic feeling against unoffending lover sun having in discharge of public duty a book of precedent report invariably risen according to almanac without suffering to be swayed by private consideration so morning came a usual with business hour with mr frank cheeryble with long train of smile welcome from worthy brother more grave clerk like scarcely le hearty reception from mr timothy linkinwater 'that mr frank mr nickleby must have met last night said tim linkinwater getting slowly off stool looking round counting house with back planted against desk a be custom when have anything very particular to

ascended many step ralph quickly reached private sitting room when be rather amazed by confused inexplicable scene in suddenly found there be young lady worker with bonnet without in various attitude expressive of alarm consternation gathered round madame mantalini who be in tear upon one chair others round miss knag who be in opposition tear upon others round mr mantalini who be perhaps most striking figure in whole group for mr mantalini leg be extended at full length upon floor head shoulder be supported by very tall footman who did seem to know what to do with mr mantalini eye be closed face be pale hair be comparatively straight whisker moustache be limp teeth be clenched have little bottle in right hand little tea spoon in left hand arm leg shoulder be stiff powerless yet

distraction be matter here ' said ralph pressing forward at inquiry clamour be increased twenty fold astounding string of such shrill contradiction a 'he poisoned ' have beend for doctor `` 'he dying ' 'he be be only pretending ' with various other cry poured forth with bewildering volubility until madame mantalini be seen to address to ralph when female curiosity to know what must say prevailed a if by general consent dead silence unbroken by single whisper instantaneously succeeded ber nickleby ' said madame mantalini what chance came here know ' here gurgling voice be heard to ejaculate a part of wandering of sick man word sweetness ' nobody heeded except footman who being startled to hear such awful tone proceeding a be from between very finger dropped master head upon floor with pretty loud crash then without effort to lift up gazed upon bystander a if have done something rather clever than otherwise will however continued madame mantalini drying eye speaking with great indignation before before everybody here for first time once for never will supply man extravagance viciousness again have be dupe fool to long enough in future will support if can then may spend what

apothecary have not mixed prussic acid strong enough that must take bottle two to finish work have in hand entered into catalogue of amiable gentleman gallantry deception extravagance infidelity especially last winding up with protest against being supposed to entertain smallest remnant of regard for adducing in proof of altered state of affection circumstance of having poisoned in private le than six time within last fortnight not having once interfered by word deed to save life 'and insist on being separated left to ' said madame mantalini sobbing dare to refuse separation will have one in law can hope will be warning to girl who have seen disgraceful exhibition miss knag who be unquestionably oldest girl in company said with great solemnity that must be warning to so did young lady generally with exception of one two who appeared to entertain doubt whether such whisper must do wrong 'why do say before so many listener said ralph in low voice know be not in earnest ' be in

mr mantalini leered till eye seemed in danger of never coming back to right place again madame mantalini showed sign of softening to do excellent miss knag justice have be mainly instrumental in

considerable interest in well doing have sedulously applied to investigation of little matter connected with gentleman private character have so well elucidated artfully imparted to madame mantalini a to open eye more effectually than closest most philosophical reasoning must have done in series of year to end accidental discovery by miss knag of tender correspondence in madame mantalini be described a 'old 'ordinary have most providentially contributed however notwithstanding firmness madame mantalini wept very piteously a leant upon miss knag signed towards door that young lady other

behaving in such improper manner to clergyman when grew up ah train up ghost child mean ' further reflection on fruitful theme be abruptly cut short by arrival of tim linkinwater mr frank cheeryble in hurry of receiving whom mr nickleby speedily lost sight of everything else be so sorry nicholas be not at home ' said mr nickleby 'kate dear must be nicholas ' beiss nickleby need be ' said frank ' if may venture to say so oppose change in 'then at event will press to stay ' returned mr nickleby ber linkinwater say ten minute can not let go so soon nicholas must be very much vexed be sure kate dear ' in obedience to great number of nod wink frown of extra significance kate added entreaty that visitor must remain be observable that addressed exclusively to tim linkinwater there be besides certain embarrassment in manner although be a far from impairing graceful character a tinge communicated to cheek be from diminishing beauty be obvious at glance even to mr nickleby not being of very speculative character however save under circumstance when speculation must be put into word uttered aloud discreet matron attributed emotion to circumstance of daughter not happening to have best frock on 'though never saw look better certainly reflected at same time having settled question in way being most complacently satisfied that in in other instance conjecture must not fail to be right one mr nickleby dismissed from thought inwardly congratulated on being so shrewd knowing nicholas did not come home did smike reappear circumstance to say truth have great effect upon little party who be in best humour possible indeed there sprung up quite flirtation between miss la creevy tim linkinwater who said thousand jocose facetious thing became by degree quite gallant not to say tender little miss la creevy on part be in high spirit rallied tim on having remained bachelor life with so much success that tim be actually induced to declare that if must get anybody to have did know what might change condition even yet miss la creevy earnestly recommended lady knew who must exactly suit mr linkinwater have very comfortable property of own latter qualification have very little effect upon tim who manfully protested that fortune must be object with that true worth cheerfulness of disposition be what man must look for in wife that if have must find money enough for moderate want of avowal be considered so honourable to tim that mr nickleby miss la creevy must sufficiently extol stimulated by praise tim launched out into several other declaration also manifesting disinterestedness of heart great devotion to fair sex be received with le approbation be done said with comical mixture of jest earnest leading to great amount of laughter made very merry indeed kate be commonly life soul of conversation at home be more silent than usual upon occasion perhaps because tim miss la creevy engrossed so much of keeping aloof from talker sat at window watching shadow a evening closed in enjoying quiet beauty of night seemed to have scarcely le attraction to frank who first lingered near then sat down beside doubt there be great many thing to be said appropriate to summer evening doubt be best said in low voice a being most suitable to peace serenity of hour long pause too at time then earnest word so then interval of silence somehow doe not seem like silence perhaps now then hasty turning away of head drooping of eye towards ground minor circumstance with disinclination to have candle introduced tendency to confuse hour with minute be doubtless mere influence of time a many lovely lip can clearly testify be there slightest reason why mr nickleby must have expressed surprise when candle being at length brought in kate bright eye be unable to bear light obliged to avert face even to leave room for short time because when one have sat in dark so long candle be dazzling nothing can be more strictly natural than such result must be produced a well informed young people know for matter old people know too did know once forget thing sometimes more be pity good lady surprise however did not end here be greatly increased when be discovered that kate have not least appetite for supper discovery so alarming that there be knowing in what unaccountable effort of oratory mr nickleby apprehension might have be vented if general attention have not be attracted at moment by very strange uncommon noise proceeding a pale trembling servant girl affirmed a everybody sense of hearing seemed to affirm also 'right down ' chimney of adjoining room being quite plain to comprehension of present that however extraordinary improbable might appear noise did nevertheless proceed from chimney in question noise be strange compound of various shuffling sliding rumbling struggling sound muffled by chimney still continuing frank cheeryble caught up candle tim linkinwater tongs must have very quickly ascertained cause of disturbance if mr nickleby have not be taken very faint declined being left behind on account produced short remonstrance terminated in proceeding to troubled chamber in body excepting only miss la creevy who a servant girl volunteered confession of having be subject to fit in infancy remained with to give alarm apply restorative in case of extremity advancing to door of mysterious apartment be not little surprised to hear human voice chanting with highly elaborated expression of melancholy in tone of suffocation human voice might have produced from under five six feather bed of best quality once popular air of 'have then failed in truth beautiful maid adore ' on bursting into room without demanding parley be astonishment lessened by discovery that romantic sound certainly proceeded from throat of man up chimney of whom nothing be visible pair of leg be dangling above grate apparently feeling with extreme anxiety for top bar whereon to effect landing sight so unusual unbusiness like a completely paralysed tim linkinwater who after one two gentle pinch at stranger ankle be productive of effect stood clapping tongs together a if be sharpening for assault did nothing else must be drunken fellow ' said frank 'no thief must announce presence thus a said with great indignation raised candle to obtain better view of leg be darting forward to pull down with very little ceremony when mr nickleby

exposed to life a frank cheeryble tim linkinwater looked in irrepressible astonishment first at other then at kate who felt that explanation be necessary who between terror at apparition of leg fear lest owner must be smothered anxiety to give least ridiculous solution of mystery that be capable of bearing be quite unable to utter single word give great pain continued mr nickleby drying eye pain hurt hair of head beg on account hurt hair of head ' must not under existing circumstance have be quite so easy to hurt hair of gentleman head a mr nickleby seemed to imagine inasmuch a part of person be foot up chimney be by mean wide one a time have never left off singing about bankruptcy of beautiful maid in respect of truth now began not only to croak very feebly to kick with great violence a if respiration became task of difficulty frank cheeryble without further hesitation pulled at short worsted with such heartiness a to bring floundering into room with greater precipitation than have quite calculated upon 'oh yes yes said kate directly whole figure of singular visitor appeared in abrupt manner know who be pray be rough with be hurt hope not oh pray see if be hurt ' 'he be not

embellished with large patch of soot sat upon ground with arm folded eyeing spectator in profound silence with very majestic demeanour did not appear to take smallest notice of what mr nickleby said when ceased to speak honoured with long stare inquired if have quite finished ' have nothing more to say ' replied that lady modestly really can not say anything more good ' said old gentleman raising voice 'then bring in bottled lightning clean tumbler corkscrew nobody executing order old gentleman after short pause raised voice again demanded thunder sandwich article not being forthcoming requested to be served with fricassee of boot top goldfish sauce then laughing heartily gratified hearer with very long very loud most melodious bellow still mr nickleby in reply to significant look

laudatory appropriate remark touching general amiability of mr frank cheeryble 'you be quite right mother ' said nicholas 'quite right be fine fellow 'good looking too ' said mr nickleby 'decidedly good looking ' answered nicholas 'what may call nose now dear ' pursued mr nickleby wishing to interest nicholas in subject to utmost ' repeated nicholas ' returned mother style of nose what order of

nonsensical perhaps still will do ' profound astonishment with son regarded during long address gradually increasing a approached climax in way discomposed mr nickleby rather exalted opinion of own cleverness therefore merely stopping to remark with much complacency that have fully expected to be surprised entered on vast quantity of circumstantial evidence of particularly incoherent perplexing
