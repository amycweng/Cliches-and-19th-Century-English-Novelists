that miss tox be lady of what be called limited independence turned to best account possibly mincing gait encouraged belief suggested that clipping step of ordinary compass into two three originated in habit of making most of everything be sure said miss tox with prodigious curtsey that to have honour of being presented to mr dombey be distinction have long sought very little expected at present

sight of one mr chick invaded grave silence ensued on remark with singularly inappropriate air of cobbler there be checking in confusion observed that be undoubtedly own fault if didnt improve such melancholy occasion a present might be better improved must think mr c retorted helpmate after short pause than by introduction of college hornpipe equally unmeaning unfeeling remark of rump te iddity bow wow wowwhich mr chick have indeed indulged in under breath mr chick repeated in tone of withering scorn merely habit dear pleaded mr chick nonsense habit returned wife if youre rational being dont make such ridiculous excuse habit if be to get habit a call of walking on ceiling like fly must hear enough of daresay appeared so probable that habit might be attended with degree of notoriety that

must only be stopped by being looked at very hard indeed mr toot head have appearance of being at once bigger farther off than be quite natural when took paul in arm to carry upstairs paul observed with astonishment that door be in quite different place from in have expected to find almost thought at first that mr toot be going to walk straight up chimney be very kind of mr toot to carry to top of house so tenderly paul told that be mr toot said must do great deal more than if must indeed did more a be for helped paul to undress helped to bed in kindest manner possible then sat down by bedside chuckled very much while mr feeder ba leaning over bottom of bedstead set little bristle on head bolt upright with bony hand then made believe to spar at paul with great science on account of being right again be so uncommonly facetious kind too in mr feeder paul not being able to make up mind whether be best to laugh cry at did at once how mr toot melted away mr feeder changed into mr pipchin paul never thought of asking be at curious to know when saw mr pipchin standing at bottom of bed instead of mr feeder cried out mr pipchin dont tell florence dont tell florence what little paul said mr pipchin coming round to bedside sitting down in chair about said paul said mr pipchin what do think mean to do when grow up mr pipchin inquired paul turning face towards on pillow resting

glad of then told mr pipchin about analysis about being certainly old fashioned took mr pipchins opinion on point whether knew why be what meant mr pipchin denied fact altogether a shortest way of getting out of difficulty paul be far from satisfied with reply looked so searchingly at mr pipchin for truer answer that be obliged to get up look out of window to avoid eye there be certain calm apothecary who attended at establishment when of young gentleman be ill somehow got into room appeared at bedside with mr blimber how came there how long have be there paul didnt know when saw sat up in bed answered apothecary question at full length whispered to that florence be not to know anything about if pleased that have set mind upon coming to party be very chatty with apothecary parted excellent friend lying down again with eye shut heard apothecary say out of room quite long way offor dreamed itthat there be want of vital power what be paul wondered great constitutional weakness a little fellow have set heart on parting with school mate on seventeenth must be better to indulge fancy if grew worse that be glad to hear from mr pipchin that little fellow must go to friend in london on eighteenth that must write to mr dombey when must have gained better knowledge of case before day that there be immediate cause forwhat paul lost that word that little fellow have fine mind be old fashioned boy what old fashion must be paul wondered with palpitating heart be so visibly expressed in so plainly seen by so many people must neither make out trouble long with effort mr pipchin be again beside if have ever be away thought have gone out with doctor be dream perhaps presently bottle glass got into hand magically poured out content for after that have real good jelly mr blimber brought to then be so well that mr pipchin went home at urgent solicitation briggs tozer came to bed poor briggs grumbled terribly about own analysis must hardly have discomposed more if have be chemical process be very good to paul so be tozer so be rest for one looked in before going to bed said how be now dombey cheer up little dombey so forth after briggs have got into bed lay awake for long time still bemoaning analysis saying knew be wrong couldnt have analysed murderer worse andhow must doctor blimber like if pocket money depended on be very easy briggs said to make galley slave of boy half year then score up idle to crib two dinner week out of board then score up greedy that wasnt going to be submitted to believed be oh ah before weak eyed young man performed on gong next morning came upstairs to paul told be to lie still paul very gladly did mr pipchin reappeared little before apothecary little after good young woman whom paul have seen cleaning stove on first morning how long ago seemed now have brought breakfast there be consultation long way off else paul dreamed again then apothecary coming back with doctor mr blimber said yes think doctor blimber may release young gentleman from book just now vacation being so very near at hand by mean said doctor blimber love will inform cornelia if please assuredly said mr blimber apothecary bending down looked closely into paul eye felt head pulse heart with so much interest care that paul said thank sir little friend observed doctor blimber have never complained oh replied apothecary be not likely to complain find greatly better said doctor blimber oh be greatly better sir returned apothecary paul have begun to speculate in own odd way on subject might occupy apothecary mind just at moment so musingly have answered two question of doctor blimber apothecary happening to meet little patient eye a latter set off on mental expedition coming instantly out of abstraction with cheerful smile paul smiled in return abandoned lay in bed day dozing dreaming looking at mr toot got up on next went downstairs lo behold there be something matter with great clock workman on pair of step have taken face off be poking instrument into work by light of candle be great event for paul who sat down on bottom stair watched operation attentively now then glancing at clock face leaning askew against wall hard by feeling little confused by suspicion that be ogling workman on step be very civil a said when observed paul how do do sir paul got into conversation with told hadnt be quite well lately ice being thus broken paul asked multitude of question about chime clock a whether people watched up in lonely church steeple by night to make strike how bell be rung when people died whether be different bell from wedding bell only sounded dismal in fancy of living finding that new acquaintance be not very well informed on subject of curfew bell of ancient day paul gave account of institution also asked a practical man what thought about king alfred idea of measuring time by burning of candle to workman replied that thought must be ruin of clock trade if be to come up again in fine paul looked on until clock have quite recovered familiar aspect resumed sedate inquiry when workman putting away tool in long basket bade good day went away though not before have whispered something on door mat to footman in there be phrase old fashionedfor paul heard what must old fashion be seemed to make people sorry what must be having nothing to learn now thought of frequently though not so often a might have done if have have fewer thing to think of have great many be always thinking day long first there be florence coming to party florence must see that boy be fond of must make happy be great theme let florence once be sure that be gentle good to that have become little favourite among then must always think of time have passed there without being very sorry florence might be happier too for perhaps when came back when came back fifty time day noiseless little foot went up stair to own room a collected book scrap trifle belonged to put together there down to minutest thing for taking home there be shade of coming back on little paul preparation for other reference to grew out of anything thought did except slight one in connexion with sister on contrary have to think of everything familiar to in contemplative mood in wandering about house a being to be parted with hence many thing have to think of day long have to peep into room upstairs think how solitary must be when be gone wonder through how many silent day week month year must continue just a grave undisturbed have to thinkwould other child old fashioned like stray there at time to whom same grotesque distortion of pattern furniture must manifest must anybody tell boy of little dombey who have be there once have to think of portrait on stair always looked earnestly after a went away eyeing over shoulder when passed in company of anyone still seemed to gaze at not at companion have much to think of in association with print hung up in place where in centre of wondering group one figure knew figure with light about headbenignant mild mercifulstood pointing upward at own bedroom window there be crowd of thought mixed with came on one upon like rolling wave where wild bird lived that be always hovering out at sea in troubled weather where cloud rose first began whence wind issued on rushing flight where stopped whether spot where florence have so often sat watched talked about thing must ever be exactly a used to be without whether must ever be same to florence if be in distant place be sitting there alone have to think too of mr toot mr feeder ba of boy of doctor blimber mr blimber miss blimber of home of aunt miss tox of father dombey son walter with poor old uncle who have got money wanted that gruff voiced captain with iron hand besides have number of little visit to pay in course of day to schoolroom to doctor blimbers study to mr blimbers private apartment to miss blimbers to dog for be free of whole house now to range a chose in desire to part with everybody on affectionate

star in day immediately before holiday in short when other young gentleman be labouring for dear life through general resumption of study of whole half year paul be such privileged pupil a have never be seen in house before must hardly believe liberty lasted from hour to hour from day to day little dombey be caressed by everyone doctor blimber be so particular about that requested johnson to retire from dinner table one day for having thoughtlessly spoken to a poor little dombey paul thought rather hard severe though have flushed at moment wondered why johnson must pity be more questionable justice paul thought in doctor from having certainly overheard that great authority give assent on previous evening to proposition stated by mr blimber poor dear little dombey be more old fashioned than ever now be that paul began to think must surely be old fashioned to be very thin light easily tired soon disposed to lie down anywhere rest for couldnt help feeling that be more more habit day at last party day arrived doctor blimber said at breakfast gentleman will resume study on twenty fifth of next month mr toot immediately threw off allegiance put on ring mentioning doctor in casual conversation shortly afterwards spoke of a blimber act of freedom inspired older pupil with admiration envy younger spirit be appalled seemed to marvel that beam fell down crushed not least allusion be made to ceremony of evening at breakfast at dinner there be bustle in house day in course of perambulation paul made acquaintance with various strange bench candlestick met harp in green greatcoat standing on landing outside drawing room door there be something queer too about mr blimbers head at dinner time a if have screwed hair up too tight though miss blimber showed graceful bunch of plaited hair on temple seemed to have own little curl in paper underneath in play bill too for paul read theatre royal over one of sparkling spectacle brighton over other there be grand array of white waistcoat cravat in young gentleman bedroom a evening approached such smell of singed hair that doctor blimber sent up footman with compliment wished to know if house be on fire be only hairdresser curling young gentleman over heating tongs in ardour of business when paul be dressedwhich be very soon done for felt unwell drowsy be not able to stand about very longhe went down into drawing room where found doctor blimber pacing up down room full dressed with dignified unconcerned demeanour a if thought barely possible that one two people might drop in by by shortly afterwards mr blimber appeared looking lovely paul thought attired in such number of skirt that be quite excursion to walk round miss blimber came down soon after mama little squeezed in appearance very charming mr toot mr feeder be next arrival of gentleman brought hat in hand a if lived somewhere else when be announced by butler doctor blimber said ay ay ay god bless soul seemed extremely glad to see mr toot be one blaze of jewellery button felt circumstance so strongly that when have shaken hand with doctor have bowed to mr blimber miss blimber took paul aside said what do think of dombey notwithstanding modest confidence in mr toot appeared to be involved in good deal of uncertainty whether on whole be judicious to button bottom button of waistcoat whether on calm revision of circumstance be best to wear waistband turned up turned down observing that mr feeder be turned up mr toot turned up waistband of next arrival being turned down mr toot turned down difference in point of waistcoat buttoning not only at bottom at top too became so numerous complicated a arrival thickened that mr toot be continually fingering that article of dress a if be performing on instrument appeared to find incessant execution demanded quite bewildering young gentleman tightly cravatted curled pumped with best hat in hand having be at different time announced introduced mr bap dancing master came accompanied by mr bap to whom mr blimber be extremely kind condescending mr bap be very grave gentleman with slow measured manner of speaking before have stood under lamp five minute began to talk to toot who have be silently comparing pump with about what be to do with raw material when came into port in return for drain of gold mr toot to whom question seemed perplexing suggested cook em mr bap did not appear to think must do paul now slipped away from cushioned corner of sofa have be post of observation went downstairs into tea room to be ready for florence whom have not seen for nearly fortnight a have remained at doctor blimbers on previous saturday sunday lest must take cold presently came looking so beautiful in simple ball dress with fresh flower in hand that when knelt down on ground to take paul round neck kiss for there be one there friend young woman waiting to serve out tea must hardly make up mind to let go again to take away bright loving eye from face what be matter floy asked paul almost sure that saw tear there nothing darling nothing returned florence paul touched cheek gently with fingerand be tear why floy said well go home together ill nurse love said florence nurse echoed paul paul couldnt understand what have to do with why two young woman looked on so seriously why florence turned away face for moment then turned back lighted up again with smile floy said paul holding ringlet of dark hair in hand tell dear do think have grown old fashioned sister laughed fondled told no because know say so returned paul want to know what mean floy loud double knock coming at door florence hurrying to table there be more said between paul wondered again when saw friend whisper to florence a if be comforting new arrival put that out of head speedily be sir barnet

egregious chuckle be dombey there immediately put up again without waiting for answer be quite last of mr toot even for before coachman must drive off a suddenly let down other window looking in with precisely similar chuckle said in precisely similar tone of voice be dombey there disappeared precisely a before how florence laughed paul often remembered laughed whenever did so there be much soon

circumstance be not good mr dombey have plainly expressed in glance with have accompanied that reminder that if declined to go might stay at home if chose not in counting house uncle lay under great obligation to mr dombey be of walter own soliciting might have begun in secret to despair of ever winning that gentleman favour might have thought that be now then disposed to put slight upon be hardly just what must have be duty without be still duty with itor walter thought soand duty must be done when mr dombey have looked at told be young that uncle circumstance be not good there have be expression of disdain in face contemptuous disparaging assumption that must be quite content to live idly on reduced old man stung boy generous soul determined to assure mr dombey in so far a be possible to give assurance without expressing in word indeed mistook nature walter have be anxious to show even more cheerfulness activity after west indian interview than have shown before if be possible in one of quick zealous disposition be too young inexperienced to think that possibly very quality in be not agreeable to mr dombey that be stepping stone to good opinion to be elastic hopeful of pleasing under shadow of powerful displeasure whether be right wrong may have beenit may have beenthat great man thought defied in new exposition of honest spirit purposed to bring down well at last at least uncle sol must be told thought walter with sigh a walter be apprehensive that voice might perhaps quaver little that countenance might not be quite a hopeful a must wish to be if

year ago taken chance of what might come of be against uncle wish against plan have formed for there be end of what feel captain cuttle be that have be little mistaken along that so far a improvement in prospect be concerned be better off now than be when first entered dombeys houseperhaps little worse for house may have be kindly inclined towards then certainly be not now turn again whittington muttered disconsolate captain after looking at walter for time ay replied walter laughing turn great many time too captain cuttle im afraid before such fortune a ever turn up again not that complain added in lively animated energetic way have nothing to complain of be provided for can live when leave uncle leave to can leave to one better captain cuttle havent told because despair not to convince

old england behind boy cheerily here captain roared in chorus oh cheerily cheerily oh cheer ly last line reaching quick ear of ardent skipper not quite sober who lodged opposite who instantly sprung out of bed threw up window joined in across street at top of voice produced fine effect when be impossible to sustain concluding note longer skipper bellowed forth terrific ahoy intended in part a friendly greeting in part to show that be not at breathed that done shut down window went to bed again now captain cuttle said walter handing blue coat waistcoat bustling very much if youll come break news to uncle sol ought to have known day upon day ago by right ill leave at door know walk about until afternoon captain however scarcely appeared to relish commission to be by mean confident of power of executing have arranged future life adventure of walter so very differently so entirely to own satisfaction have felicitated so often on sagacity foresight displayed in arrangement have found so complete perfect in part that to suffer to go to piece at once even to assist in breaking up required great effort of resolution captain too found difficult to unload old idea upon subject to take perfectly new cargo on board with rapidity circumstance required without jumbling confounding two consequently instead of putting on coat waistcoat with anything like impetuosity must alone have kept pace with walter mood declined to invest with garment at at present informed walter on serious matter must be allowed to bite nail bit old habit of mine walr said captain time fifty year when see ned cuttle bite nail walr then may know ned cuttle aground illustration thereupon captain put iron hook between teeth a if be hand with air of wisdom profundity be very concentration sublimation of philosophical reflection grave inquiry applied to consideration of subject in various branch there friend of mine murmured captain in absent manner he at present coasting round to whitby must deliver such opinion on subject other must be named a must give parliament six beat em be knocked overboard man said captain twice none worse for be beat in apprenticeship for three week off on about head with ring bolt yet clearer minded man dont walk in spite of respect for captain cuttle walter must not help inwardly rejoicing at absence of sage devoutly hoping that limpid intellect might not be brought to bear on difficulty until be quite settled if be to take show man buoy at nore said captain cuttle in same tone ask opinion of walr hed give opinion be more like buoy than uncle button be there aint man walkscertainly not on two legsthat can come near not near whats name captain cuttle inquired walter determined to be interested in captain friend name bunsby said captain lord might be anything for matter of with mind a exact idea captain attached to concluding piece of praise did not further elucidate did walter seek to draw forth for on beginning to review with vivacity natural to to situation leading point in own affair soon discovered that captain have relapsed into former profound state of mind that while eyed steadfastly from beneath bushy eyebrow evidently saw heard remained immersed in cogitation in fact captain cuttle be labouring with such great design far from being aground soon got off into deepest of water must find bottom to penetration by degree became perfectly plain to captain that there be mistake here that be undoubtedly much more likely to be walter mistake than that if there be really west india scheme afoot be very different one from what walter who be young rash supposed must only be new device for making fortune with unusual celerity if there must be little hitch between em thought captain meaning between walter mr dombey only want word in season from friend of party to set right smooth make taut again captain cuttle deduction from consideration be that a already enjoyed pleasure of knowing mr dombey from having spent very agreeable half hour in company at brighton on morning when borrowed money that a couple of men of world who understood other be mutually disposed to make thing comfortable must easily arrange little difficulty of sort come at real fact friendly thing for to do must be without saying anything about to walter at present just to step up to mr dombeys housesay to servant must ye be so good lad a

too have be aground with captain cuttle be now like happily afloat again finally captain left off biting nail said now walr boy may help on with slop by captain meant coat waistcoat walter little imagined why captain be so particular in arrangement of cravat a to twist pendent end into sort of pigtail pas through massive gold ring with picture of tomb upon neat iron railing tree in memory of deceased friend why captain pulled up shirt collar to utmost limit allowed by irish linen below by so doing decorated with complete pair of blinker why changed shoe put on unparalleled pair of ankle jack only wore on extraordinary occasion captain being at length attired to own complete satisfaction having glanced at from head to foot in shaving glass removed from nail for purpose took up knotted stick said be ready captain walk be more complacent than usual when got out into street walter supposed to be effect of ankle jack took little heed of before have gone very far encountered woman selling flower when captain stopping short a if struck by happy idea made purchase of largest bundle in basket most glorious nosegay fan shaped two foot half round composed of jolliest looking flower blow armed with little token designed for mr dombey captain cuttle walked on with walter until reached instrument maker door before paused youre going in said walter yes returned captain who felt that walter must be got rid of before proceeded further that have better time projected visit somewhat later in day wont forget anything returned captain ill go upon walk at once said walter then will be out of way captain cuttle take good long un lad replied captain calling after walter waved hand in assent went way way be nowhere in particular thought must go out into field where must reflect upon

child who be old friend have always be so grateful to so glad to see since might interest brother in behalf influence fortune for better liked to imagine thismore at moment for pleasure of imagining continued remembrance of than for worldly profit might gain more sober fancy whispered to that if be alive then must be beyond sea forgotten married rich proud happy there be more reason why must remember with interest in such altered state of thing than plaything ever have not so much yet walter so idealised pretty child whom have found wandering in rough street so identified with innocent gratitude of night simplicity truth of expression that blushed for a libeller when argued that must ever grow proud on other hand meditation be of fantastic order that seemed hardly le libellous in to imagine grown woman to think of a anything same artless gentle winning little creature that have be in day of good mr brown in word walter found out that to reason with about florence at be to become very unreasonable indeed that must do better than preserve image in mind a something precious unattainable unchangeable indefiniteindefinite in power of giving pleasure restraining like angel hand

observed for like chinese sage who be said in conference to write certain learned word in air be wholly impossible of pronunciation captain made such wave flourish a nobody without previous knowledge of mystery must have be at likely to understand captain cuttle however becoming cognisant of what have happened relinquished attempt a perceived slender chance now existed of being able to obtain little easy chat with mr dombey before period of walter departure in admitting to with disappointed crestfallen countenance that sol gill must be told that walter must gotaking case for present a

anothers measure how ned cuttle have pointed out that resource in first extremity have brought interview to desired termination on ground captain soothed with thinking that though ned cuttle be forced by pressure of event to stand by almost useless for present ned must fetch up with wet sail in good time carry before under influence of good natured delusion captain cuttle even went so far a to revolve in own bosom while sat looking at walter listening with tear on shirt collar to what related whether might not be at once genteel politic to give mr dombey verbal invitation whenever must meet to come cut mutton in brig place on day of own naming enter on question of young friend prospect over social glass uncertain temper of mr macstinger possibility of setting up rest in passage during

in answer captain cuttle turned out in heap covered boy mouth with hand steady lad said captain dont ye speak word to a yet captain looking at visitor in great consternation gently shouldered into next room after laying injunction upon disappearing for few moment forthwith returned in blue suit holding up hand in token of injunction not yet being taken off captain cuttle walked up to cupboard poured out dram counterpart of handed to messenger captain then stood up in corner against wall a if to forestall possibility of being knocked backwards by communication be to be made to having

boy rob well recommended a told from dombeys house if else must come to hammer take care ned of little midshipman to convey to posterity idea of manner in captain after turning letter over over reading score of time sat down in chair held court martial on subject in own mind must require united genius of great men who discarding own untoward day have determined to go down to posterity have never got there at first captain be too much confounded distressed to think of anything letter even when thought began to glance upon various attendant fact might perhaps a well have occupied with former theme for light reflected on in state of mind captain cuttle having grinder before court one else found great relief to decide generally that be object of suspicion captain so clearly expressed in visage that rob remonstrated oh dont captain cried grinder wonder how can what have done to be looked at like lad said captain cuttle dont sing out afore youre hurt dont commit do havent be committed nothing captain answered rob keep free then said captain impressively ride easy with deep sense of responsibility imposed upon necessity of thoroughly fathoming mysterious affair a became man in relation with party captain cuttle resolved to go down examine premise to keep grinder with considering youth a under arrest at present captain be in doubt whether might not be expedient to handcuff tie ankle together attach weight to leg not being clear a to legality of such formality captain decided merely to hold by shoulder way knock down if made objection however made none consequently got to instrument maker house without being placed under more stringent restraint a shutter be not yet taken down captain first care be to have shop opened when daylight be freely admitted proceeded with aid to further investigation captain first care be to establish in chair in shop a president of solemn tribunal be sitting within to require rob to lie down in bed under

heavy sleeper at first light one towards morning if mr gill have come through shop near daybreak though ever so much on tiptoe im pretty sure must have heard shut door at event on mature consideration of evidence captain cuttle began to think that instrument maker must have vanished of own accord to logical conclusion be assisted by letter addressed to a being undeniably in old man handwriting must seem with great forcing to bear construction that arranged of own will to go so went captain have next to consider where why a there be way whatsoever that saw to solution of first difficulty confined meditation to second remembering old man curious manner farewell have taken of unaccountably fervent at time quite intelligible now terrible apprehension strengthened on captain overpowered by anxiety regret for walter have be driven to commit suicide unequal to wear tear of daily life a have often professed to be shaken a doubt be by uncertainty deferred hope have undergone seemed violently strained misgiving only too probable free from debt with fear for personal liberty seizure of good what else state of madness must have hurried away alone secretly a to carrying apparel with if have really done soand be not even sure of thathe might have done so captain argued to prevent inquiry to distract attention from probable fate to ease very mind that be now revolving possibility such

hopeless set to consider what be to be done next after several new perusal of poor friend letter considered that maintenance of home in old place for walter be primary duty imposed upon therefore

onward where overhanging tree formed aisle arch dim with softened light steeped through leavesone corner of eye be ever on formal head of mr dombey addressed towards feather in bonnet drooping so neglectfully scornfully between much a have seen haughty eyelid droop not least so when face met that now fronting once once only did wary glance release object be when leap over low hedge gallop across field enabled to anticipate carriage coming by road to be standing ready at journey end to hand lady out then then met glance for instant in first surprise when touched in alighting with soft white hand overlooked altogether a before mr skewton be bent on taking charge of mr carker showing beauty of castle be determined to have arm major too must do incorrigible creature who be most barbarous infidel in point of poetry good to be in such company chance arrangement left mr dombey at liberty to escort edith did stalking before through apartment with gentlemanly solemnity darling byegone time mr carker said cleopatra with delicious fortress dear old dungeon delightful place of torture romantic vengeance picturesque assault siege everything make life truly charming how dreadfully have degenerated yes have fallen off deplorably said mr carker peculiarity of conversation be that mr skewton in spite of ecstasy mr carker in spite of urbanity be intent on watching mr

where mr dombey edith be standing alone in centre of room be not interchanging word look standing together arm in arm have appearance of being more divided than if sea have rolled between there be difference even in pride of two removed farther from other than if one have be proudest other humblest specimen of humanity in creation self important unbending formal austere lovely graceful in uncommon degree totally regardless of everything around spurning own attraction with haughty brow lip a if be badge livery hated so unmatched be opposed so forced linked together by chain adverse

cried look here see what be wedded to uncongenial time animal opposed by nature worried one a moral to love cupid took to flight afraid martyrdom have such torment in painted history of suffering nevertheless mr skewton be so charmed by sight to mr carker invoked attention that must not refrain from saying half aloud how sweet how very full of soul be edith overhearing looked round flushed indignant scarlet to hair dearest edith know be admiring said cleopatra tapping almost timidly on back with parasol sweet pet again mr carker saw strife have witnessed so unexpectedly among tree again saw haughty languor indifference come over hide like cloud did not raise eye to with slight peremptory motion of seemed to bid mother come near mr skewton thought expedient to understand hint advancing quickly with two cavalier kept near daughter from time mr carker now having nothing to distract attention began to discourse upon picture to select best point out to mr dombey speaking with usual familiar recognition of mr dombeys greatness rendering homage by adjusting eye glass for finding out right place in catalogue holding stick like service did not so much originate with mr carker in truth a with mr dombey who be apt to assert chieftainship by saying with subdued authority in easy wayfor himhere carker have goodness to assist will smiling gentleman always did with pleasure made tour of picture wall crow nest so forth a be still one little party major be rather in shade being sleepy during process of digestion mr carker became communicative agreeable at first addressed for most part to mr skewton a sensitive lady be in such ecstasy with work of art after first quarter of hour that must hing yawn be such perfect inspiration observed a reason for mark of rapture transferred attention to mr dombey mr dombey said little beyond occasional very true carker indeed carker tacitly encouraged carker to proceed inwardly approved of behaviour very much deeming a well that somebody must talk thinking that remark be a one might say branch of parent establishment might amuse mr granger mr carker who possessed excellent discretion never took liberty of addressing that lady direct seemed to listen though never looked at once twice when be emphatic in peculiar humility twilight smile stole over face not a light a deep black shadow warwick castle being at length pretty well exhausted major very much so to say nothing of mr skewton whose peculiar demonstration of delight have become very frequent indeed carriage be again put in requisition rode to several admired point of view in neighbourhood mr dombey ceremoniously observed of one of that sketch however slight from fair hand of mr granger must be remembrance to of agreeable day though wanted artificial remembrance be sure here mr dombey made of bow must always highly value withers lean having ediths sketch book under arm be immediately called upon by mr skewton to produce same carriage stopped that edith might make drawing mr dombey be to put away among treasure be afraid trouble too much said mr dombey by mean where must wish taken from answered turning to with same enforced attention a before mr dombey with bow cracked starch in cravat must beg to leave to artist must rather chose for said edith suppose then said mr dombey say from here appears good spot for purpose orcarker what do think there happened to be in foreground at little distance grove of tree not unlike in mr carker have made chain of footstep in morning with seat under one tree greatly resembling in general character of situation point where chain have broken might venture to suggest to mr granger said carker that be interestingalmost curiouspoint of view followed direction of riding whip with eye raised quickly to face be second glance have exchanged since introduction must have be exactly like first that expression be plainer will like said edith to mr dombey will be charmed said mr dombey to edith therefore carriage be driven to spot where mr dombey be to be charmed edith without moving from seat opening sketch book with usual proud indifference began to sketch pencil be pointless said stopping turning over pray allow said mr dombey carker will do better a understands thing carker have goodness to see to pencil for mr granger mr carker rode up close to carriage door on mr granger side letting rein fall on horse neck took pencil from hand with smile bow sat in saddle leisurely mending having done so begged to be allowed to hold to hand to a be required thus mr carker with many commendation of mr granger extraordinary skillespecially in treesremainedclose at side looking over drawing a made mr dombey in meantime stood bolt upright in carriage like highly respectable ghost looking on too while cleopatra major dallied a two ancient dove might do be satisfied with will finish little more said edith showing sketch to mr dombey mr dombey begged that might not be touched be perfection be most extraordinary said carker bringing one of red gum to bear upon praise be not prepared for anything so beautiful so unusual altogether might have applied to sketcher no le than to sketch mr carkers manner be openness itselfnot a to mouth alone a to whole spirit so continued to be while drawing be laid aside for mr dombey while sketching material be put up then handed in pencil be received with distant acknowledgment of help without look tightening rein fell back followed carriage again thinking perhaps a rode that even trivial sketch have be made delivered to owner a if have be bargained for bought thinking perhaps that although have assented with such perfect readiness to request haughty face bent over drawing glancing at distant object represented in have be face of proud woman engaged in sordid miserable transaction thinking perhaps of such thing smiling certainly while seemed to look about freely in enjoyment of air exercise keeping always that sharp corner of eye upon carriage stroll among haunted ruin of kenilworth more ride to more point of view most of mr skewton reminded mr dombey edith have already sketched a have seen in looking over drawing brought day expedition to close mr skewton edith be driven to own lodging mr carker be graciously invited by cleopatra to return thither with mr dombey major in evening to

have only to choose accordingly began with piano be same with harp same with singing same with selection of piece that sang played such frigid constrained yet prompt pointed acquiescence with wish imposed upon on one else be sufficiently remarkable to penetrate through mystery of picquet impress on mr carkers keen attention did lose sight of fact that mr dombey be evidently proud of power liked to show nevertheless mr carker played so wellsome game with major with cleopatra whose vigilance of eye in respect of mr dombey edith lynx must have even heightened position in lady mother good grace when on taking leave regretted that must be obliged to return to london next morning cleopatra trusted community of feeling not being met with day that be far from being last time must meet hope so said mr carker with expressive look at couple in distance a drew towards door following major think so mr dombey who have taken stately leave of edith bent made approach to bend over cleopatra couch

little softened a to say so to think so believe hope of may ever have cause to lessen opinion of other lucretia be sure of returned miss tox mr chick coughed a before drew line on carpet with ivory end of parasol miss tox who have experience of fair friend knew that under pressure of slight fatigue vexation be prone to discursive kind of irritability availed herself of pause to change subject pardon dear louisa said miss tox have caught sight of manly form of mr chick in carriage be there said mr chick pray leave there have newspaper must be quite contented for next two hour go on with flower lucretia allow to sit here rest louisa know observed miss tox between friend like approach to ceremony must be out of question therefore therefore miss tox finished sentence not in word action putting on glove again have taken off arming once more with scissors began to snip clip among leaf with microscopic industry florence have returned home also said mr chick after sitting silent for time with head on one side parasol sketching on floor really florence be great deal too old now to continue to lead that solitary life to have be accustomed of course be there can be doubt about must have very little respect indeed for anybody who must advocate different opinion wish might be must not respect can not command feeling to extent a miss tox assented without being particular a to intelligibility of proposition if shes strange girl said mr chick if brother paul can not feel perfectly comfortable in society after sad thing have happened terrible disappointment have be undergone then what be reply that must make effort that be bound to make effort have always be family remarkable for effort paul be at head of family almost only representative of leftfor what be ii be of consequence dearest love remonstrated miss tox mr chick dried eye be for moment overflowing proceeded consequently be more than ever bound to make effort though having done so come upon with sort of shockfor mine be very weak foolish nature be anything blessing be sure often wish heart be marble slab paving stone sweet louisa remonstrated miss tox again still be triumph to to know that be so true to to name of dombey although of course always knew must be only hope said mr chick after pause that may be worthy of name too miss tox filled little green watering pot from jug happening to look up when have done so be so surprised by amount of expression mr chick have conveyed into face be bestowing upon that put little watering pot on table for present sat down near dear louisa said miss tox will be least satisfaction to if venture to observe in reference to remark a humble individual think sweet niece in way most promising what do mean lucretia returned mr chick with increased stateliness of manner to what remark of mine dear do refer being worthy of name love replied miss tox if said mr chick with solemn patience have not expressed with clearness lucretia fault of course be mine there be perhaps reason why must express at except intimacy have subsisted between very much hope lucretiaconfidently hopenothing will occur to disturb because why must do anything else there be reason must be absurd wish to express clearly lucretia therefore to go back to remark must beg to say that be not intended to relate to florence in way indeed returned miss tox said mr chick shortly decisively pardon dear rejoined meek friend can not have understood fear be dull mr chick looked round room over way at plant at bird at watering pot at almost everything within view except miss tox finally dropping glance upon miss tox for moment on way to ground said looking meanwhile with elevated eyebrow at carpet when speak lucretia of being worthy of name speak of brother paul second wife believe have already said in effect if not in very word now use that be intention to marry second wife miss tox left seat in hurry returned to plant clipping among stem leaf with a little favour a barber working at so many pauper head of hair whether will be fully sensible of distinction conferred upon said mr chick in lofty tone be quite question hope may be be bound to think well of one in world hope may be have not be advised with if have be advised with have doubt advice must have be cavalierly received therefore be infinitely better a be much prefer a be miss tox with head bent down still clipped among plant mr chick with energetic shaking of own head from time to time continued to hold forth a if in defiance of somebody if brother paul have consulted with sometimes doesor rather sometimes used to do for will naturally do that more now be circumstance regard a relief from responsibility said mr chick hysterically for thank heaven be not jealous here mr chick again shed tear if brother paul have come to have said louisa what kind of quality must advise to look out for in wife must certainly have answered paul must have family must have beauty must have dignity must have connexion be word must have used might have led to block immediately afterwards said mr chick a if consequence be highly probable must have used must have said paul to marry second time without family to marry without beauty to marry without dignity to marry without connexion there be nobody in world not mad who must dream of daring to entertain such preposterous idea miss tox stopped clipping with head among plant listened attentively perhaps miss tox thought there be hope in exordium warmth of mr chick must have adopted course of argument pursued discreet lady because trust be not fool make claim to be considered person of superior intellectthough believe people have be extraordinary enough to consider so one so little humoured a be must very soon be disabused of such notion trust be not downright fool to tell said mr chick with ineffable disdain that brother paul dombey must ever contemplate possibility of uniting to anybodyi dont care whoshe be more sharp emphatic in short clause than in other part of discoursenot possessing requisite must be to insult what understanding have got a much a if be to be told be born bred elephant may be told next said mr chick with resignation wouldnt surprise at expect in moment silence that ensued miss toxs scissors gave feeble clip two miss toxs face be still invisible miss toxs morning gown be agitated mr chick looked sideways at through intervening plant went on to say in tone of bland conviction a one dwelling on point of fact that hardly required to be stated therefore of course brother paul have done be to be expected of what anybody might have foreseen must do if entered marriage state again confess take rather by surprise however gratifying because when paul went out of town have idea at that must form attachment out of town certainly have attachment when left here however seems to be extremely desirable in point of view have doubt mother be most genteel elegant creature have right whatever to dispute policy of living with be paul affair not mineand a to paul choice have only seen picture yet be beautiful indeed name be beautiful too said mr chick shaking head with energy arranging in chair edith be at once uncommon a strike distinguished consequently lucretia have doubt will be happy to hear that marriage be to take place immediatelyof course will great emphasis again that be delighted with change in condition of brother who have shown great deal of pleasant attention at various time miss tox made verbal answer took up little watering pot with trembling hand looked vacantly round a if considering what article of furniture must be improved by content room door opening at crisis of miss toxs feeling started laughed aloud fell into arm of person entering happily insensible alike of mr chick indignant countenance of major at window over way who have double barrelled eye glass in full action whose face figure be dilated with mephistophelean joy not so expatriated native amazed supporter of miss toxs swooning form who coming straight upstairs with polite inquiry touching miss toxs health in exact pursuance of major malicious instruction have accidentally arrived in very nick of time to catch delicate burden in arm to receive content of little watering pot in shoe of circumstance coupled with consciousness of being closely watched by wrathful major who have threatened usual penalty in regard of bone in skin in case of failure combined to render moving spectacle of mental bodily distress for moment afflicted foreigner remained clasping miss tox to heart with energy of action in remarkable opposition to disconcerted face while poor lady trickled slowly down upon very last sprinkling of little watering pot a if be delicate exotic indeed be might be almost expected to blow while gentle rain descended mr chick at length recovering sufficient presence of mind to interpose commanded to drop miss tox upon sofa withdraw exile promptly obeying applied to promote miss toxs recovery none of gentle concern usually characterises daughter of eve in tending of other none of freemasonry in fainting by be generally bound together in mysterious bond of sisterhood be visible in mr chick demeanour rather like executioner who restores victim to sensation previous to proceeding with torture be wont to do so in good old time for true men wear perpetual mourning did mr chick administer smelling bottle slapping on hand dashing of cold water on face other proved remedy when at length miss tox opened eye gradually became restored to animation consciousness mr chick drew off a from criminal reversing precedent of murdered king of denmark regarded more in anger than in sorrow lucretia said mr chick will not attempt to disguise what feel eye be opened at once wouldnt have believed if saint have told to illustration be foolish to give way to faintness miss tox faltered will be better presently will be better presently lucretia repeated mr chick with exceeding scorn do suppose be blind do imagine be in second childhood lucretia be obliged to miss tox directed imploring helpless kind of look towards friend put handkerchief before face if anyone have told yesterday said mr chick with majesty even hour ago must have be tempted almost believe to strike to earth lucretia tox eye be opened to at once scale here mr chick cast down imaginary pair such a be commonly used in grocer shop have fallen from sight blindness of confidence be past lucretia have be abused played upon evasion be quite out of question now assure oh to what do allude so cruelly love asked miss tox through tear lucretia said mr chick ask own heart must entreat not to address by such familiar term a have just used if please have self respect left though may think otherwise oh louisa cried miss tox how can speak to like how can speak to like retorted mr chick who in default of having particular argument to sustain upon relied principally on such repetition for most withering effect like may well say like indeed miss tox sobbed pitifully idea said mr chick of having basked at brother fireside like serpent wound through almost into confidence lucretia that might in secret entertain design upon dare to aspire to contemplate possibility of uniting to why be idea said mr chick with sarcastic dignity absurdity of almost relief treachery pray louisa urged miss tox say such dreadful thing dreadful thing repeated mr chick dreadful thing be not fact lucretia that have just now be unable to command feeling even before whose eye have so completely closed

interval without symptom of cannibal still observed regular routine of defensive operation never encountered bonnet without previous survey from castle of retreat in meantime during received call from mr toot who wrote to say be out of town own voice began to have strange sound in ear acquired such habit of profound meditation from much polishing stowing away of stock from much sitting behind

brewed stiff glass of grog presently afterwards on pipe filled lighted began to smoke captain cuttle imitating visitor in matter of particular though rapt imperturbable manner of great commander be far above power sat in opposite corner of fireside observing respectfully a if waited for encouragement expression of curiosity on bunsbys part must lead to own affair a mahogany philosopher gave

poor old instrument maker now surprise occurred so overwhelming terrific that captain cuttle unsupported by presence of bunsby must have sunk beneath be lost man from fatal hour how captain even in satisfaction of admitting such guest must have only shut door not locked of negligence be undoubtedly guilty be one of question must for ever remain mere point of speculation vague charge against

still have spontaneous interest in everything belonging to that stopped again a if to discover whether have led mr dombey far enough yet again with chin resting on hand leered at picture carker said mr dombey be sensible that limit service suggested smiling entertainer prefer to say regard observed mr dombey very sensible a said so that be paying handsome flattering compliment to mere business relation consideration for feeling hope disappointment in little instance have just now mentioned be example in point be obliged to carker mr carker bent head slowly very softly rubbed hand a if be afraid by action to disturb current of mr dombeys confidence allusion to be opportune said mr dombey after little hesitation for prepares way to what be beginning to say to reminds that involves absolutely new relation between although may involve more personal confidence on part than have hitherto distinguished with suggested carker bending head again will not say to how honoured be for man like well know how much honour have in power to bestow at pleasure mr dombey said mr dombey passing compliment with august self denial be not quite agreed upon point appear to understand other yet mr dombey have something to learn mr dombey be distinguished by many rare attraction have be accustomed doubt to receive much adulation said smooth sleek watcher of slightest look tone where there be affection duty respect little mistake engendered by such cause be soon set right mr dombeys thought instinctively flew back to face have looked at in wife dressing room when imperious hand be stretched towards door remembering affection duty respect expressed in felt blood rush to own face quite a plainly a watchful eye upon saw there mr dombey went on to say have discussion before mr skewtons death upon cause of dissatisfaction of will have formed general understanding from having be witness of what passed between mr dombey on evening when be at ourat house when so much regretted being present said smiling carker proud a man in position necessarily must be of familiar noticethough give credit for may do anything please without losing casteand honoured a be by early presentation to mr dombey before be made eminent by bearing name almost regretted that night assure have be object of such especial good fortune that man must under possible circumstance regret being distinguished by condescension patronage be moral phenomenon mr dombey must not comprehend therefore responded with considerable accession of dignity indeed why carker fear returned confidential agent mr dombey never very much disposed to regard with favourable interestone in position must not expect that from lady naturally proud whose pride becomes so wellmay not easily forgive innocent part in conversation displeasure be light matter must remember to be visited with before third party carker said mr dombey arrogantly presume that be first consideration oh can there be doubt about replied other with impatience of man admitting notorious incontrovertible fact mr dombey becomes secondary consideration when be in question imagine said mr dombey be that so be so returned carker do know better than anyone that have need to ask then hope carker said mr dombey that regret in acquisition of mr dombeys displeasure may be almost counterbalanced by satisfaction in retaining confidence good opinion have misfortune find returned carker to have incurred that displeasure mr dombey have expressed to mr dombey have expressed various opinion said mr dombey with majestic coldness indifference in participate be not inclined to discus to recall made mr dombey acquainted time since a have already told with certain point of domestic deference submission on felt necessary to insist failed to convince mr dombey of expediency of immediately altering conduct in respect with view to own peace welfare dignity informed mr dombey that if must find necessary to object remonstrate again must express opinion to through confidential agent blended with look carker bent upon be devilish look at picture over head that struck upon like flash of lightning now carker said mr dombey hesitate to say to will carry point be not to be trifled with mr dombey must understand that will be law can not allow of one exception to whole rule of life will have goodness to undertake charge coming from be not unacceptable to hope regret may politely professfor be obliged to on behalf of mr dombey will have goodness be persuaded to discharge a exactly a other commission know said mr carker that have only to command know said mr dombey with majestic indication of assent have only to command be necessary must proceed in mr dombey be lady undoubtedly highly qualified in many respect to to do credit even to choice suggested carker with yawning show of teeth yes if please to adopt form of word said mr dombey in tone of state at present conceive that mr dombey doe that credit to to be entitled there be principle of opposition in mr dombey must be eradicated must be overcome mr dombey doe not appear to understand said mr dombey forcibly that idea of opposition to be monstrous absurd in city know better replied carker with smile from ear to ear know better said mr dombey hope so though indeed be bound to do mr dombey justice of saying however inconsistent may seem with subsequent conduct remains unchanged that on expressing disapprobation determination to with severity on occasion to have referred admonition appeared to produce very powerful effect mr dombey delivered of word with most portentous stateliness wish to have goodness then to inform mr dombey carker from must recall former conversation to remembrance in surprise that have not yet have effect that must insist upon regulating conduct by injunction laid upon in conversation be not satisfied with conduct that be greatly dissatisfied with that will be under very disagreeable necessity of making bearer of yet more unwelcome explicit communication if have not good sense proper feeling to adapt to wish a first mr dombey did believe may add a other lady in place must first mr dombey lived very happily said carker first mr dombey have great good sense said mr dombey in gentlemanly toleration of dead very correct feeling be miss dombey like mother do think said carker swiftly darkly mr dombeys face changed confidential agent eyed keenly have approached painful subject said in soft regretful tone of voice irreconcilable with eager eye pray forgive forget chain of association in interest have pray forgive for said eager eye scanned mr dombeys downcast face none le closely then shot strange triumphant look at picture a appealing to to bear witness how led on again what be coming carker said mr dombey looking here there upon table saying in somewhat altered more hurried voice with paler lip there be occasion for apology mistake association be with matter in hand not with recollection a suppose approve of mr dombeys behaviour towards daughter pardon said mr carker dont quite understand illustration understand then returned mr dombey that may make thatthat will make that if pleasematter of direct objection from to mr dombey will please to tell that show of devotion for daughter be disagreeable to be likely to be noticed be likely to induce people to contrast mr dombey in relation towards daughter with mr dombey in relation towards will have goodness to let mr dombey know plainly that object to that expect to defer immediately to objection mr dombey may be in earnest may be pursuing whim may be opposing object to in case in case if mr dombey be in earnest so much le reluctant must be to desist for will not serve daughter by such display if wife have superfluous gentleness duty over above proper submission to may bestow where plea perhaps will have submission firstcarker said mr dombey checking unusual emotion with have spoken falling into tone more like in be accustomed to assert greatness will have goodness not to omit slur point to consider very important part of instruction mr carker bowed head rising from table standing thoughtfully before fire with hand to smooth chin looked down at mr dombey with evil slyness of monkish carving half human half brute like leering face on old water spout mr dombey recovering composure by degree cooling emotion in sense of having taken high position sat gradually stiffening again looking at parrot a swung to fro in great wedding ring beg pardon said carker after silence suddenly resuming chair drawing opposite to mr dombeys let understand mr dombey be aware of probability of making organ of displeasure yes replied mr dombey have said so yes rejoined carker quickly why why mr dombey repeated not without hesitation because told ay replied carker why did tell see continued with smile softly laying velvet hand a cat might have laid sheathed claw on mr dombeys arm if perfectly understand what be in mind be so much more likely to be useful to have happiness of being effectually employed think do understand have not honour of mr dombeys good opinion in position have reason to expect take fact to be have not got possibly not said mr dombey consequently pursued carker making communication to mr dombey through be sure to be particularly unpalatable to lady appears to said mr dombey with haughty reserve yet with embarrassment that mr dombeys view upon subject form part of a present to carker may be so andpardon medo misconceive said carker when think descry in likely mean of humbling mr dombeys pridei use word a expressive of quality kept within due bound adorns grace lady so distinguished for beauty accomplishmentsand not to say of punishing of reducing to submission so naturally justly require be not accustomed carker a know said mr dombey to give such close reason for course of conduct think proper to adopt will gainsay nothing of if have objection to found upon be indeed

dombey in false position in false position exclaimed carker will be prouddelightedto execute trust must have wished own to have given lady at whose foot must lay humble duty devotionfor be not wifeno new cause of dislike wish from be of course paramount to other consideration on earth besides when mr dombey be converted from little error of judgment incidental must presume to say to novelty of situation will hope that will perceive in slight part take only grainmy removed different sphere give room for little respect for sacrifice of consideration to of will be pleasure privilege to garner up great store day mr dombey seemed at moment again to see with hand stretched out towards door again to hear through mild speech of confidential agent echo of word nothing can make stranger to other than be henceforth shook off fancy did not shake in resolution said certainly no doubt there be nothing more quoth carker drawing chair back to old placefor have taken little breakfast a yetand pausing for answer before sat down nothing said mr dombey will be good enough to observe carker that message to mr dombey with be may be charged admits of reply will be good enough to bring reply mr dombey be informed that doe not become to temporise treat upon matter be at issue between that what say be final mr carker signified understanding of credential fell to breakfast with what appetite

mounting own rode off for city together mr carker be in capital spirit talked much mr dombey received conversation with sovereign air of man who have right to be talked to occasionally condescended to throw in few word to carry on conversation so rode on characteristically enough mr dombey in dignity rode with very long stirrup very loose rein very rarely deigned to look down to see where horse went in consequence of happened that mr dombeys horse while going at round trot stumbled on loose stone threw rolled over lashing out with iron shod foot in struggle to get up kicked mr carker quick

to think of love for of by turn with fear distrust wonder yet florence now began to do so doing of be task imposed upon by very purity of soul a one must not fly from saw father cold obdurate to edith a to hard inflexible unyielding must be asked with starting tear that own dear mother have be made unhappy by such treatment have pined away died then must think how proud stately edith be to everyone with what disdain treated how distantly kept apart from what have said on night when came home quickly must come on florence almost a crime that loved one who be set in opposition to father that father knowing of must think of in solitary room a unnatural child who added wrong to old fault so much wept for of never having won fatherly affection from birth next kind word from edith next kind glance must shake thought again make seem like black ingratitude for who have cheered drooping heart of florence so lonely so hurt be best of comforter thus with gentle nature yearning to feeling for misery of whispering doubt of own duty to florence in wider expanded love by side of edith endured more than when have hoarded up undivided secret in mournful house beautiful mama have never dawned upon one exquisite unhappiness must have far outweighed florence be spared never have least suspicion that edith by tenderness for widened separation from father gave new cause of dislike if florence

believing that have virtue of act of parliament that unless committed by new admission of ownership flaw must be found in such form of conveyance be advantage of new arrangement besides greater seclusion afforded florence admitted of midshipman being restored to usual post of observation also of shop shutter being taken down latter ceremony however little importance unconscious captain

unintelligible thing within man experiencevery odd conjunction of sort a mentioned to friend dombey must not admit criminality of lovely accomplished relative until be perfectly established feeling when deceased person be in point of fact destroyed in devilish horrible manner that position be very painful oneand feeling besides that family have be little to blame in not paying more attention to
