like perfect gentleman then added significant speech be terrible thing to be dragged in way before public now see that be only thing ought to do be seems to have held out a long a possible believing that amiable lodger must act a perfect gentleman like when found that even action have terror for saw that there be nothing else to do to let action go on what be mr bardell like one must imagine

two storey high only look like lodging house ingenious commentator have indeed ventured to identify house arguing from very general description in text must note however mr pickwick lack of caution came in very next day having apparently made enquiry a to landlady have done so must have learned of drunken exciseman who met death by being knocked on head with quart pot might have heard of friend cluppins raddle etc who seemed to have be charwoman something of sort also that there be sort of working man a fellow lodger above that there be servant in house boded ill made likely that mr pickwick must be easy victim of crafty scheme went well until unluckly morning in july when mr pickwick friend coming to pay morning call entering unexpectedly surprised mr pickwick with landlady fainting in arm in hysterical condition be very awkward business delinquent however did not at once grasp situation must not make head tail of what lady meant friend however have doubt 'what be matter said three tongue tied pickwickians know replied mr pickwick pettishly help lead woman down stair 'oh be better now ' said mr bardell faintly lead downstairs ' said ever gallant mr tupman sir thank ' exclaimed

matter with woman have merely announced to intention of keeping man servant when fell into extraordinary paroxysm in found very extraordinary thing ' havery ' said three friend 'placed in such extremely awkward situation continued mr pickwick havery be reply of follower a coughed slightly looked dubiously at other behaviour be not lost upon mr pickwick remarked incredulity evidently suspected may be reasonably supposed that mr pickwick have not be very discreet sufficiently cautious in general behaviour to landlady a know be rather too effusive in relation with fair sex one of weakness be kissing must kiss everybody who be young good looking maxim be kiss early kiss often who can forget systematic method of greeting engaging arabella took off spectacle in great haste taking young lady hand in kissed great many time perhaps greater number of time than be absolutely necessary old rogue have little doubt that on return home from tour encircled buxom figure of mr bardell of course in own paternal privileged way must be borne in mind also that mr pickwick be almost invariably drawn into more serious scrape embarrassment by devotion to sex night in boarding school garden affair with spinster lady interview with arabella from top of wall devotion to mr pott mr dowler much more that hear of show that be gallant elderly gentleman oh be sly dog be there be curious burst of mr pickwick seems to hint at sort of tender appreciation on side when notice of trial be sent to in first vehemence broke out that mr bardell have nothing to do with business have heart to do mr pickwick must not speak with certainty unless knew lady feeling pretty well why have heart to do because be sincerely attached to interest be dear creature however be fond delusion of worthy gentleman person of class be not quite so disinterested a appear to be especially if have to interpret various paternal comforting advance made to by well to do lodger there be factor can hardly be left out when considering mr pickwick responsibility be too frequent indulgence in liquor insufficiency of head to stand influence now be very important day for first time be to set up man servant have to break to landlady who must naturally resent change may have be priming with of perpetual glass of brandy water to be addicted who know that in ardour to propitiate may have gone little too far fact too of introducing man servant into establishment mr bardell may have indistinctly associated with general change in life if be to become mr pickwick duty might be naturally expected to devolve on male assistant next morning friend quitted london on travel to eatanswill in pursuit of adventure airily dismissed matter may wonder whether made remonstrance to landlady before departure probably did not fancying that have be merely in slight fit of tantrum at bury however after boarding school adventure be to be painfully awakened be sitting with friend after dinner at angel in happiest mood winkle have related quarrel with pott in re mr pott in humorous fashion when one of most delightful of humorous scene followed mr pickwick be proceeding with scathing rebuke when sam enters with letter know hand ' said mr pickwick opening letter on what be must be jest ca be true 'what be matter ' be general inquiry 'nobody dead be there ' said wardle alarmed at horror in mr pickwick countenance mr pickwick made reply pushing letter across table desiring mr tupman to read aloud fell back in chair with look of vacant astonishment quite alarming to behold mr tupman with trembling voice read letter of following be copy 'freeman court cornhill august th bardell against pickwick sir having be instructed by mr martha bardell to commence action against for breach of promise of marriage for plaintiff lay damage at fifteen hundred pound beg to inform that writ have be issued against in suit in court of common plea request to know by return of post name of attorney in london who will accept service thereof be sir obedient servant dodson fogg mr samuel pickwick ' so mr pickwick general mentor philosopher friend man of high moral tone born to set world aright general lecturer of follower be now in for action at law of most awkward unpleasant kind to be philandering with one landlady rather low form must say down at manor farm how isabella wardle sister girl must laugh spinster aunt must enjoy there be help for must be faced naturally mr pickwick felt uncomfortable first idea be to arrange matter be sensible course ought at once to have put matter into hand of friend perker with full power to treat mr pickwick vanity indiscretion made meddle in business behind solicitor back a where with damaging result to warning to such amateur must be said that dodson fogg behaviour at extraordinary visit paid be marked by certain propriety mr pickwick insisted on knowing be ground of action be detail of evidence against in short case very correctly refused to tell case may be false may be true may be credible may be incredible same be strong case be a much a must tell mr pickwick must only urge that if be so be most unfortunate man on dodson promptly hope be sir trust may be sir if be really innocent be more unfortunate than have believed man must possibly be mr pickwick then rather foolishly asked did understand meant to go on with action a if must have be affected by declaration understand be reply that certainly may very natural speech with want of professional delicacy etiquette dodson seized opportunity to serve mr pickwick be not high class firm method be not high class then extraordinarily incredible display followed passion broke forth of disgraceful rascally proceeding ever etc dodson summoned clerk to listen to gross language said perhaps must like to call swindler be said mr pickwick fogg even wished to assault perhaps must have done so for sam who at last got away be certainly not correct how aggravating be mr pickwick one be rather astonished at forbearance of sharp firm now have mr pickwick gone straight to lodging in goswell street seen mr bardell heard view claim have be told by that have be professionally urged to go to law a have strong case there might have be excuse for violence to dodson fogg knew nothing whatever of matter knew nothing of attornies in blind fury gratuitously assumed that have conspired to harass in way true have overheard how have treated poor ramsey very malapropos visit of mr pickwick to firm be a said mistake damaged case showed that be nervous anxious insecure took nothing by there be in truth much short sighted cunning in way came of overweening vanity be only one of several attempt made to worm out something to own advantage of mr pickwick foolish manoeuvre be sending man to old lodging to landlady ostensibly to fetch away thing when dialogue passed 'tell mr bardell may put bill up a soon a like ' good sir replied mr weller more sir 'nothing more sam mr weller stepped slowly to door a if expected something more slowly opened slowly stepped out have slowly closed within couple of inch when mr pickwick called out beam beir said mr weller stepping quickly back closing door behind ' have objection sam to endeavouring to ascertain how mr bardell seems disposed towards whether be really probable that vile groundless action be to be carried to extremity say object to doing if wish sam ' said mr pickwick sam gave short nod of intelligence left room now be very artful on part of mr pickwick be very willow sort of artfulness be later to recoil on sam of course saw through at once never dawned on simple minded man what use plaintiff solicitor must make of demarche when subpoena be served rushed off to perker 'they have subpoena 'd servant too said mr pickwick beam said perker mr pickwick replied in affirmative course dear sir of course knew must must have told that month ago know dear sir if will take management of affair into own hand after intrusting to solicitor must also take consequence here mr perker drew up with conscious dignity brushed stray grain of snuff from shirt frill 'and what do want to prove ' asked mr pickwick after two three minute silence 'that sent up to plaintiff to make offer of compromise suppose ' replied perker 'it matter much though think many counsel must get great deal out of ' ' think must ' said mr pickwick minutia of legal process be prosaic uninteresting might seem impossible to invest with dramatic interest how admirably have boz lightened up coloured simple incident of attorney clerk common vulgar fellow of lowest type arriving to serve subpoena on witness assumed to be hostile scene be full of touch of light comedy de do sir said mr jackson nodding to mr pickwick that gentleman bowed looked somewhat surprised for physiognomy of mr jackson dwelt not in recollection have called from dodson fogg ' said mr jackson in explanatory tone mr pickwick roused at name refer to attorney sir mr perker of gray inn ' said 'waiter show gentleman out 'beg pardon mr pickwick ' said jackson deliberately depositing hat on floor drawing from pocket strip of parchment personal service by clerk agent in case know mr pickwick nothing like caution sir in legal form here mr jackson cast eye on parchment resting hand on table looking round with winning persuasive smile said come let have word about little matter a of gentleman name snodgrass ' at inquiry mr snodgrass gave very undisguised palpable start that further reply be needed 'ah thought so said mr jackson more affably than before `` ve got little something to trouble with sir ' exclaimed mr snodgrass 'it only subpoena in bardell pickwick on behalf of plaintiff replied jackson singling out one of slip of paper producing shilling from waistcoat pocket will come on in settens after term fourteenth of febooary expect have marked special jury cause be only ten down paper be yours mr snodgrass a jackson said presented parchment before eye of mr snodgrass slipped paper shilling into hand mr tupman have witnessed process in silent astonishment when jackson turning sharply upon said ' think ai mistaken when say name tupman be mr tupman looked at mr pickwick perceiving encouragement in gentleman widely opened eye to deny name said name be tupman sir 'and that other gentleman mr winkle think ' said jackson mr winkle faltered out reply in affirmative gentleman be forthwith invested with slip of paper shilling by dexterous mr jackson 'now said jackson `` m affraid will think rather troublesome want somebody else if ai inconvenient have samuel weller name here mr pickwick ' servant here waiter ' said mr pickwick waiter retired considerably astonished mr pickwick motioned jackson to seat there be painful pause be at length broken by innocent defendant suppose sir said mr pickwick indignation rising while spoke ' suppose sir that be intention of employer to seek to criminate upon testimony of own friend mr jackson struck forefinger several time against left side of nose to intimate that be not there to disclose secret of prison house playfully rejoined 'not knowin ' ca say ' what other reason sir ' pursued mr pickwick 'be subpoena served upon if not for ' good plant mr pickwick ' replied jackson slowly shaking head 'but wo do harm in trying there be little to be got out of ' here mr jackson smiled once more upon company applying left thumb to tip of nose worked visionary coffee mill with right hand thereby performing very graceful piece of pantomime then much in vogue now unhappily almost obsolete be familiarly denominated 'taking grinder ' imagine modern solicitor clerk taking grinder 'no mr pickwick ' said jackson in conclusion 'perker people must guess what served subpoena for if ca must wait till action come on then will find out mr pickwick bestowed look of excessive disgust on unwelcome visitor must probably have hurled tremendous anathema at head of messrs dodson fogg have not sam entrance at instant interrupted beamuel weller ' said mr jackson inquiringly o ' truest thing a have said for many long year replied sam in most composed manner 'here be subpoena for mr weller ' said jackson 'what be in english inquired sam 'here be original said jackson declining required explanation 'which said sam 'this replied jackson shaking parchment 'oh be 'rig'nal be ' said sam 'well be wery glad have seen 'rig'nal be gratifyin sort o thing eas vun mind so much ' here be shilling ' said jackson be from dodson fogg ' 'and be uncommon handsome o dodson fogg a know so little of to come

friction on right eye lid with sleeve of coat after most approved manner of actor when be in domestic pathetics mr jackson seemed rather puzzled by sam proceeding a have served subpoena have nothing more to say made feint of putting on one glove usually carried in hand for sake of appearance returned to office to report progress of mr pickwick foolish willed proceeding be interview with serjeant snubbin so positively insisted upon may wonder now day must kc of position have condescended to allow proceeding fancy must be thought irregular though perhaps ex gratia from oddity of proposal might be conceded when mr pickwick called upon turned out that serjeant knew nothing whatever of case probably cared nothing about be not in line perhaps wondered why old fashioned lawyer have retained learn parker reason 'well have done everything be necessary have engaged serjeant snubbin 'be good man inquired mr pickwick 'good man ' replied perker heart soul dear sir serjeant snubbin be at very top of profession get treble business of man in court engaged in case need mention abroad say of profession serjeant snubbin lead court by nose how foolish be reasoning can be seen on instant reflection to lead court by nose be well enough in argument before judge here be more important to lead jury by nose buzfuz knew how to do moreover when counsel have power usually operates on special judge colleague who must guarantee snubbin special judge must try case a turned out chief justice fell sick before day mr justice stareleigh unexpectedly took case a proved be anything led by nose perker indeed summed up whole weakness of case in single sentence 'they have subpoena 'd three friend said mr pickwick 'ah of course must ' replied perker 'important witness saw in delicate situation fainted of own accord ' said mr pickwick threw into arm havery likely dear sir replied perker likely very natural nothing more so dear sir nothing who be to prove ' suggestion be told that rather staggered mr pickwick within ten minute after have received assurance that thing be impossible be conducted by solicitor into outer office of great serjeant snubbin be uncarpeted room of tolerable dimension with large writing table drawn up near fire baize top of have long since lost claim to original hue of green have gradually grown grey with dust age except where trace of natural colour be obliterated by ink stain upon table be numerous little bundle of paper tied with red tape behind sat elderly clerk whose sleek appearance heavy gold watch chain presented imposing indication of extensive lucrative practice of mr serjeant snubbin 'be serjeant in room mr mallard inquired perker offering box with imaginable courtesy be ' be reply 'but be very busy look here not opinion given yet on one of case expedition fee paid with of ' clerk smiled a said inhaled pinch of snuff with zest seemed to be compounded of fondness for snuff relish for fee beomething like practice that ' said perker 'yes said barrister clerk producing own box offering with greatest cordiality 'and best of be that a nobody alive except can read serjeant writing be obliged to wait for opinion when have given till have copied have have have 'which make good for know who besides serjeant draw little more out of client eh ' said perker 'have have have ' at serjeant clerk laughed again not noisy boisterous laugh silent internal chuckle mr pickwick disliked to hear when man bleeds inwardly be dangerous thing for when laugh inwardly bodes good to other people 'you have made out little list of fee be in debt have ' said perker 'no have not ' replied clerk wish must ' said perker 'let have will send cheque suppose be too busy pocketing ready money to think of debtor eh have have have ' sally seemed to tickle clerk amazingly once more enjoyed little quiet laugh to 'but mr mallard dear friend ' said perker suddenly recovering gravity drawing great man great man into corner by lappel of coat must persuade serjeant to see client here ' 'come come ' said clerk 'that be not bad see serjeant come be too absurd ' notwithstanding absurdity of proposal however clerk allowed to be gently drawn beyond hearing of mr pickwick after short conversation conducted in whisper walked softly down little dark passage disappeared into legal luminary sanctum from whence shortly returned on tiptoe informed mr perker mr pickwick that serjeant have be prevailed upon in violation of established rule custom to admit at once serjeant be writing when client entered bowed abstractedly when mr pickwick be introduced by solicitor then motioning to seat put pen carefully in inkstand nursed left leg waited to be spoken to ber pickwick be defendant in bardell pickwick serjeant snubbin ' said perker ' be retained in be ' said serjeant be sir replied perker serjeant nodded head waited for something else pickwick be anxious to call upon serjeant snubbin ' said perker 'to state to before entered upon case that denies there being ground pretence for action against that unless came into court with clean hand without most conscientious conviction that be right in resisting plaintiff demand must not be there at believe state view correctly do not dear sir ' said little man turning to mr pickwick 'quite so ' replied that gentleman mr serjeant snubbin unfolded glass raised to eye after looking at mr pickwick for few second with great curiosity turned to mr perker said smiling slightly a spoke 'have mr pickwick strong case ' attorney shrugged shoulder purpose calling witness 'no smile on serjeant countenance became more defined rocked leg with increased violence throwing back in easy chair coughed dubiously token of serjeant presentiment on subject slight a be be not lost on mr pickwick settled spectacle through have attentively regarded such demonstration of barrister feeling a have permitted to exhibit more firmly on nose said with great energy in utter disregard of mr perker admonitory winking frownings bey wishing to wait upon for purpose a sir appears have doubt to gentleman who see so much of matter a must necessarily do very extraordinary circumstance ' serjeant tried to look gravely at fire smile came back again picture mr pickwick expounds case to counsel 'gentlemen of profession sir ' continued mr pickwick beee worst side of human nature dispute ill will bad blood rise up before know from experience of jury mean disparagement to how much depends upon effect be apt to attribute to others desire to use for purpose of deception self interest very instrument in pure honesty honour of purpose with laudable desire to do utmost for client know temper worth of so well from constantly employing yourselves really believe that to circumstance may be attributed vulgar very general notion of being a body suspicious distrustful over cautious conscious a be sir of disadvantage of making such declaration to under such circumstance have come here because wish distinctly to understand a friend mr perker have said that be innocent of falsehood laid to charge although be very well aware of inestimable value of assistance sir must beg to add that unless sincerely believe must rather be deprived of aid of talent than have advantage of ' long before close of address be bound to say be of very prosy character for mr pickwick serjeant have relapsed into state of abstraction now serjeant might at once have replied to that innocence guilt of client have nothing to do with that use be merely to secure client such benefit advantage a law entitled to that judge jury must decide point of innocence boz evidently shared popular delusion seems to be speaking by mr pickwick mouth sagacious serjeant however took notice whatever of appeal simply asked who be with in case mr phunky be sent for asked by leader to take mr pickwick away hear anything may wish to communicate party be then bowed out truth be mr pickwick attorney be too much of social character of old family solicitor pattern for so critical case counsel instructed be unsuitable serjeant snubbin be overworked chamber lawyer whose whole time experience be given to furnishing opinion on tangled case so pressed be that took expedition fee to give certain case priority illegitimate practice now bar committee must scarcely tolerate what must such man know of nisi prius trial of cross examining handling witness be enough to give portrait a supplied by author picture serjeant snubbin kc mr serjeant snubbin be lantern faced sallow complexioned man of about five forty a novel say might be fifty have that dull looking boiled eye be often to be seen in head of people who have applied during many year to weary laborious course of study must have be sufficient without additional eye glass dangled from broad black riband round neck to warn stranger that be very near sighted hair be thin weak be partly attributable to having never devoted much time to arrangement partly to having worn for five twenty year forsenic wig hung on block beside mark of hair powder on coat collar ill washed worse tied white neckerchief round throat showed that have not found leisure since left court to make alteration in dress while slovenly style of remainder of costume warranted inference that personal appearance must not have be very much improved if have book of practice heap of paper opened letter be scattered over table without attempt at order arrangement furniture of room be old ricketty door of bookcase be rotting in hinge dust flew out from carpet in little cloud at step blind be yellow with age dirt state of everything in room showed with clearness not to be mistaken that mr serjeant snubbin be far too much occupied with professional pursuit to take great heed regard of personal comfort be characteristic feature of slowness of legal process in day though notice of action be sent on august th case be not ripe for trial until february th of next year nearly six month having elapsed be difficult to speculate a to what long delay be owing there be only two witness whose evidence have to be briefed mr cluppins mr sander be at hand be odd by way that did not think of examining little tommy bardell only one who actually witnessed proceeding true be of tender year about eight ten son of plaintiff must have known nature of oath trial at last momentous morning came round be fourteenth of february valentine day one not of good omen for plaintiff defendant party be rather gloomy at breakfast when perker by wave of encouraging client uttered dictum a to chance of jury having have good breakfast discontented hungry juryman dear sir always find for plaintiff bless heart said mr pickwick looking very blank what do do for party then got into hackney coach be driven to guildhall where case be to be tried at ten o'clock precisely picture exterior of guildhall court now city museum picture interior of guildhall court circa from original drawing by t allen how dramatic boz have made calling of jury might be thought uninteresting prosaic operation enough be special jury entailed one guinea per head extra expense on mr pickwick have of course asked for dodson fogg must have be well content with perhaps even have preferred common jury now day special juror though summoned largely have to be almost coerced into attending fine of ten pound be imposed be almost invariably remitted on affidavit common juror show reluctance to serve of groffin chemist guinea be not to be despised there be a be professional common juror who hang about court in hope of being thus called a understudy on occasion what be called tale be prayed for two common juror be pressed into service greengrocer chemist be caught directly be impossible to say too much of completeness with legal scene be put forward everything be dealt with have perfect sketch of judge usher jury counsel on case witness barrister attorney have speech method of examination cross examination there be nothing better more life like than sketch of court in chill morning before actor came on scene inimitable description of idle barrister hanging about bar of england be accurate to hour few must describe effectively peculiar appearance of crowd of barrister assembled in court of law be type apart odd headgear accentuates peculiarity of face one have however succeeded so well a boz in touching off peculiarity sort of histrionic guise bearing be assumed with view to impose on friend public to suggest idea that have much at least something to do 'and ' said mr pickwick pointing to couple of enclosed seat on right 'that be where juryman sit be not ' 'the identical place dear sir replied perker tapping lid of snuff box mr pickwick stood up in state of great agitation took glance at court there be already pretty large sprinkling of spectator in gallery numerous muster of gentleman in wig in barrister seat who presented a body that pleasing extensive variety of nose whisker for bar of england be so justly celebrated such of gentleman a have got brief to carry carried in a conspicuous manner a possible occasionally scratched nose therewith to impress fact more strongly on observation of spectator one of happiest description be surely that of binding of law book law library be most repulsive uninteresting thing in world colour of leather be unhealthy disagreeable necessary shading be secured at expense of grace boz characterises a 'that under done pie crust ' other gentleman who have brief to show carried under arm goodly octavo with red label behind that under done pie crust coloured cover be technically known a law calf others who have brief book thrust hand into pocket looked a wise a conveniently must while others again moved here there with great restlessness earnestness of manner content to awaken thereby admiration astonishment of uninitiated stranger whole to great wonderment of mr pickwick be divided into little group who be chatting discussing news of day in most unfeeling manner possible just a if trial at be coming on bow from mr phunky a entered took seat behind row appropriated to king counsel attracted mr pickwick attention have scarcely returned when mr serjeant snubbin appeared followed by mr mallard who half serjeant behind large crimson bag placed on table after shaking hand with perker withdrew then there entered two three more serjeant among one with fat body red face who nodded in friendly manner to mr serjeant snubbin said be fine morning 'who red faced man who said be fine morning nodded to counsel ' whispered mr pickwick serjeant buzfuz replied perker opposed to lead on other side that gentleman behind be mr skimpin junior ' mr pickwick be just on point of inquiring with great abhorrence of man cold blooded villainy how mr serjeant buzfuz who be counsel for opposite party dared to presume to tell mr serjeant snubbin who be counsel for that be fine morning when be interrupted by general rising of barrister loud cry of beilence ' from officer of court looking round found that be caused by entrance of judge on reaching court perker said put mr pickwick friend in student box mr pickwick have better sit by useful provision for instruction of legal probationer have fallen into desuetude place be reserved for student now day lord campbell describes custom recall incident occurred when be sitting in student box close to bench there be matter of procedure have since be changed such a mr skimpin calling for winkle latter answering be now done by officer of court skimpin also asks winkle name a first question though have be sworn have given mal entendu a to daniel nathaniel must not then have occurred a officer must have obtained name correctly unusual thing be that buzfuz after long rather exhausting speech must have examined first witness now day junior must do may note at time be always lord lordship with full natural sound have not yet got to clipped m'lud ' ludship perhaps form be actually used by counsel be not noticed by boz seemed to right thing king counsel be behind must stoop down to consult solicitor minute observation particularity of boz be further shown in noting very place where attorney sat describes have seat next table be quite right said buzfuz later on answering whisper of dodson fogg after sam awkward revelation how often have seen hasty communication be not without dramatic effect judge mr pickwick unfortunate in counsel solicitor jury one of prejudiced tradesman be also to be unlucky in judge who tried case doubt perker have comforted matter how go however unfair buzfuz may be have judge to hold scale fair keep jury straight lord chief justice of common plea right hon sir nicholas conyngham tindal be man of immense reputation at bar be most fortunate in having judge then of disappointment when on coming to court be found that sir stephen gaselee be to take case owing to absence of chief justice occasioned by indisposition protest at time one doe not know whether be following out course of real event tracing incident of fiction so wonderfully doe boz make fiction blend with reality be serious blow tindal be admirable judge did not chronicler write of sagacity impartiality plain sense industry clear sightedness made admiration of non professional spectator while among lawyer be very highly esteemed for invariable kindness to who appeared before retained to last respect affection with man presiding sergeant buzfuz eccentric violence abuse of defendant must have be restrained having outward appearance of man not of monster mr skimpin gross insinuation to wit winkle be telegraphing to friend must have be summarily put down bullying checked more must have calmly kept counsel attention to issue perfect impartiality must have made show to jury how little evidence there be to support plaintiff case instead came unlucky indisposition place be taken by brother gaselee with what result mr pickwick be to learn disastrously be curious however that chief justice in spite of indisposition must still be associated with case for have tried momentous case of norton v melbourne have heard there letter read be parodied in chop tomato sauce correspondence so boz have well before case have to be tried at guildhall session so fair rational judge must have spoilt sport further a boz have seen fairness dignity of chief justice be naturally reluctant to exhibit unfavorably only thing be to make chief justice become suddenly indisposed have place taken by grotesque judge judge who be to try case mr justice stareleigh a be well known be drawn from sir stephen gaselee of whose name stareleigh be sort of synonym serjeant gaselee be once well known in prosecution directed against radical so called reformer pickwick have given greater reputation baiting received from patriotic advocate may have inflamed temper made irritable be described by one author in most humorous if personal fashion be most particularly short man so fat that seemed face waistcoat rolled in upon two little turned leg having bobbed gravely to bar who bobbed gravely to put little leg under table when must see of be two queer little eye one broad pink face somewhere about half of big very comical looking wig through be shown a arrogant incapable also a making absurd mistake will be surprise to most people to learn that picture be more than amusing caricature that judge be really person of high character be described a very painstaking upright judge in private capacity worthy benevolent man thus mr croker who however supply sound reason for being subject of such satire with many admirable quality of head heart have made legitimate object of ridicule by explosion on bench under such condition bar suitor public have wish opportunity to search for extenuating excuse in private life suffered enough from explosion be concerned have be fourteen year on bench like stareleigh belonged to common plea be suffering too from infirmity particularly from deafness appears to have misapprehended statement in same grotesque fashion that mistook winkle name boz fashion of burlesque by way be happily

'pray mr winkle evade question be be not particular friend of defendant ' be just about to say that ' 'will will not answer question sir ' will be committed sir ' interposed little judge 'come sir ' said mr skimpin 'yes if please ' 'yes be replied mr winkle 'yes be why must say that at once sir ' think there be more happy touch of legal satire in book than about what soldier said be perfect so complete that be always understood by unprofessional reader lawyer feel at once that be a true a be happy 'little to do plenty to get ' said serjeant buzfuz to sam ' o quite enough to get sir a

wholly legal dry a dust for man who must have gravely entered bardell v pickwick in note have quoted passage must have have share of humour most people know that be strict principle hearsay evidence of utterance will not be accepted in lieu of of person to whom remark be made neither can think out of probability that objection may have be made by over punctilious judge wishing to restrain sam exuberance scotch judge once quoted in court passage from antiquary in said true view of intricate point be given then scott be lawyer be requisite say mr john pitt taylor p speaking of hearsay evidence that fact witness speaks must be confined to lying within own knowledge for witness must give testimony on oath must be subject to cross examination testimony from relation of third person can not be subject to test rule of exclusion have be recognised a fundamental principle of law of evidence ever since time of charles ii to add note with due gravity rule excluding heresay evidence rather mode in rule be frequently misunderstood in court of justice be amusingly caricatured by mr dickens in report of case of bardell v pickwick p bardell v pickwick thus put with many thousand ten of thousand case quoted have even found place for in index of place then go on to quote passage just a must quote from barnwall adolphus how sagacious full of legal point be boz comment on winkle incoherent evidence phunky asked whether have reason to suppose that pickwick be about to be married 'oh certainly not ' replied mr winkle with so much eagerness that mr phunky ought to have got out of box with possible dispatch lawyer hold out that there be two kind of particularly bad witness reluctant witness too willing witness most true be commit in case in different way matter of former manner of latter do mischief ideal witness affect indifference be a impartial a record of phonograph be wonderful where boz learned doubt from friend talfourd kc who carefully revised trial skimpin interpretation of mr pickwick consolatory phrase evidently devised on spur of moment show to be very ready smart fellow mr winkle have only one more question to ask beg to bear in mind lordship caution will undertake to swear that pickwick defendant did not say on occasion in question dear mr bardell be good creature compose to situation for to situation must come word to effect ' did understand so certainly ' said mr winkle astounded at ingenious dove tailing of few word have heard ' be on staircase must hear distinctly impression on mind be 'the gentleman of jury want none of impression on mind mr winkle fear must be of little service to honest straightforward men interposed mr skimpin 'you be on staircase did distinctly hear will swear that pickwick did not make use of expression have quoted do understand that ' 'no will not ' replied mr winkle down sat mr skimpin with triumphant countenance will swear did not etc be device familiar to cross examiner be used when witness can not be got to accept word admit that be used of course mean little nothing effect on jury be that come to fancy that word may have be used that witness be not very clear a to recollection how well described too satirised be yet common form of cross examiner to wit how often sir question winkle when asked a to knowledge of mr bardell replied that did not know that have seen recall making very answer to boz when be driving through sackville street dublin have asked did know so so when promptly replied know have seen rather arrided a elia must say skimpin went on 'oh know have seen 'now have goodness to tell gentleman of jury what mean by mr winkle ' mean that be not intimate with have seen when went to call on mr pickwick in goswell street ' 'how often have seen sir often 'yes mr winkle how often will repeat question for dozen time if require sir ' learned gentleman with firm steady frown placed hand on hip smiled suspiciously to jury on question there arose edifying brow beating customary on such point first of mr winkle said be quite impossible for to say how many time have seen mr bardell then be asked if have seen twenty time to replied 'certainly more than ' then be asked whether have seen hundred time whether must swear that have seen more than fifty time whether did know that have seen at least seventy five time so forth satisfactory conclusion be arrived at at last being that have better take care of mind what be about witness having be by mean reduced to requisite ebb of nervous perplexity examination be concluded how excellent be who have not heard process repeated over over again from young fledgeling counsel to old hardbitten experienced kc young legal tyro might find profit a well a entertainment in carefully studying others of mr skimpin adroit method in cross examination be in manner typical of in favour with more experienced member of profession allowing of course for little humorous exaggeration will note also that boz show clearly how effective be result of process here be few useful recipe how to make witness appear a though wished to withhold truth how to highly discredit witness by opening question how to insinuate inaccuracy how to suggest that witness be evading how to deal with statement of particular number of instance how to take advantage of witness glance how to suggest imputed meaning to witness statement confuse into accepting happy familiar form be skimpin interrogation of winkle a to friend here ' 'yes be ' said mr winkle looking very earnestly towards spot where friend be stationed a one attending court know be almost intuitive movement in witness think corroborates somehow how good skimpin how ready 'pray attend to mr winkle never mind friend with expressive look at jury must tell

ought to have got out of box with possible dispatch lawyer hold out that there be two kind of particularly bad witness reluctant witness too willing witness be mr winkle fate to figure in character

dodson fogg flew off at tangent to very centre of history of queer client then came back to great white horse at ipswich with sufficient clearness to convince mr pickwick that be falling asleep so aroused began to undress when recollected have left watch on table down stair so a be pretty late now be unwilling to ring bell at hour of night slipped on coat of have just divested taking japanned candlestick in hand walked quietly down stair more stair mr pickwick went down more stair there seemed to be to descend again again when mr pickwick got into narrow passage began to congratulate on having gained ground floor did flight of stair appear before astonished eye at last reached stone hall remembered to have seen when entered house passage after passage did explore room after room did peep into at length just a be on point of giving up search in despair opened door of identical room in have spent evening beheld missing property on table mr pickwick seized watch in triumph proceeded to retrace step to bed chamber if progress downwards have be attended with difficulty uncertainty journey back be infinitely more perplexing row of door garnished with boot of shape make size branched off in possible direction dozen time did softly turn handle of bedroom door resembled own when gruff cry from within of who devil what do want here caused to steal away on tiptoe with perfectly marvellous celerity be reduced to verge of despair when open door attracted attention peeped in right at last there be two bed whose situation perfectly remembered fire still burning candle not long one when first received have flickered away in draft of air through have passed sunk into socket just a have closed door after 'no matter ' said mr pickwick ' can undress just a well by light of fire

carefully drawn curtain of bed on outside mr pickwick sat down on rush bottomed chair leisurely divested of shoe gaiter then took off folded up coat waistcoat neck cloth slowly drawing on tasseled night cap secured firmly on head by tying beneath chin string always have attached to article of dress be at moment that absurdity of recent bewilderment struck upon mind throwing back in rush bottomed chair mr pickwick laughed to so heartily that must have be quite delightful to man of well constituted mind to have watched smile expanded amiable feature a shone forth from beneath night cap 'it be best idea ' said mr pickwick to smiling till almost cracked night cap string 'it be best idea losing in place wandering about staircase ever heard of droll droll very droll ' here mr pickwick smiled again broader smile than before be about to continue process of undressing in best possible humour when be suddenly stopped by most unexpected interruption to wit entrance into room of person with candle who after locking door advanced to dressing table set down light upon smile played upon mr pickwick feature be instantaneously lost in look of most unbounded wonder stricken surprise

opposite side keeping curtain carefully closed with hand so that nothing more of must be seen than face nightcap putting on spectacle mustered up courage looked out mr pickwick almost fainted with horror dismay standing before dressing glass be middle aged lady in yellow curl paper busily engaged in brushing what lady call back hair however unconscious middle aged lady came into room be quite clear that contemplated remaining there for night for have brought rushlight shade with with praiseworthy precaution against fire have stationed in basin on floor where be glimmering away like

awful a thought poor mr pickwick cold perspiration starting in drop upon nightcap 'never be fearful ' be quite impossible to resist urgent desire to see what be going forward so out went mr pickwick head again prospect be worse than before middle aged lady have finished arranging hair have carefully enveloped in muslin nightcap with small plaited border be gazing pensively on fire matter be growing alarming ' reasoned mr pickwick with ' ca allow thing to go on in way by self possession of lady be clear to that must have come into wrong room if call out will alarm house if remain here

exhibiting nightcap to lady overpowered have tied confounded string in knot do what must must get off disclosure must be made there be only one other way of doing shrunk behind curtain called out very loudly 'have hum ' that lady started at unexpected sound be evident by falling up against rushlight shade that persuaded must have be effect of imagination be equally clear for when mr pickwick under impression that have fainted away stone dead from fright ventured to peep out again be gazing pensively on fire a before beost extraordinary female thought mr pickwick popping in again 'have hum last

apparition of mr pickwick nightcap driven back into remotest corner of apartment where stood staring wildly at mr pickwick while mr pickwick in turn stared wildly at 'wretch ' said lady covering eye with hand 'what do want here ' 'nothing ma'be nothing ma'be ' said mr pickwick earnestly 'nothing ' said lady looking up 'nothing ma'be upon honour ' said mr pickwick nodding head so energetically that tassel of nightcap danced again be almost ready to sink ma'be beneath confusion of addressing lady in nightcap here lady hastily snatched off ca get off ma'be here mr pickwick gave tremendous tug

violently 'you will leave instantly ' ' will ma'be with greatest pleasure ' replied mr pickwick 'instantly sir ' said lady 'certainly ma'be ' interposed mr pickwick very quickly 'certainly ma'be be very sorry ma'be ' said mr pickwick making appearance at bottom of bed have be innocent occasion of alarm emotion deeply sorry ma'be ' lady pointed to door one excellent quality of mr pickwick

said mr pickwick opening door dropping shoe with loud crash in so doing ' trust ma'be ' resumed mr pickwick gathering up shoe turning round to bow again trust ma'be that unblemished character devoted respect entertain for sex will plead a slight excuse for ' before mr pickwick must conclude sentence lady have thrust into passage locked bolted door behind ground of self congratulation mr pickwick might have for having escaped so quietly from late awkward situation present position be by mean enviable be alone in open passage in strange house in middle of night half dressed be not to be supposed that must find way in perfect darkness to room have be wholly unable to discover with light if made slightest noise in fruitless attempt to do so stood chance of being shot at perhaps killed by wakeful traveller have resource to remain where be until daylight appeared so after groping way few pace down passage to infinite alarm stumbling over several pair of boot in so doing mr pickwick crouched into little recess in wall to wait for morning a philosophically a might be not destined however to undergo additional trial of patience for have not be long ensconced in present concealment when to unspeakable horror man bearing light appeared at end of passage horror be suddenly converted into joy however when recognized form of faithful attendant be indeed mr samuel weller who after sitting up thus late in conversation with boot who be sitting up for mail be now about to retire to rest imagine story told by miss witherfield in open court with detail lady narrative being coloured by recollection that have lost suitable husband owing to adventure mr peter magnus must have deposed to mr pickwick extraordinary interest in matter of proposal have added suspicion on recalling mr pickwick ambiguous declaration that have come down to expose certain person even one of own sympathetic friend who have witnessed scene with mr bardell recalled boarding house incident might murmur how odd that be ever thus in pursuit of fair under suspicious circumstance must be that after what if have previous knowledge of lady secretly admired stung to fury at notion of mr peter magnus marrying have taken strange mode of declaring passion even sagacious sam devoted a be to master be taken aback on meeting in midnight wandering ' said mr pickwick suddenly appearing before 'where bedroom ' mr weller stared at master with most emphatic surprise be not until question have be repeated three several time that turned round led way to long sought apartment beam said mr pickwick a got into bed ' have made one of most extraordinary mistake to night ever be heard of ' 'werry likely sir ' replied mr weller drily 'but of be determined sam ' said mr pickwick 'that if be to stop in house for six month must never trust about alone again ' 'that be wery prudentest resolution a must come to sir ' replied mr weller rayther want somebody to look arter sir ven judgment go out wisitin '' do mean by sam ' said mr pickwick raised in bed extended hand a if be about to say something more suddenly checking turned round bade valet 'good night ' night sir ' replied mr weller paused when got outside door shook head walked on stopped snuffed candle shook head again finally proceeded slowly to chamber apparently buried in profoundest meditation will be seen that sam went near to being disrespectful in sceptical view of master story when mr sander be examined court put few question to a to custom of love making among person of position have received love letter like other lady in course of correspondence mr sander have often called 'duck never 'chops ' sauce ' be particularly fond of duck perhaps if have be a fond of chop tomato sauce might have called that a term of affection mr sander be clearly one of same class a mr cluppins chiefly deposed to general impression in neighbourhood mr pickwick have offered for mr bardell tupman snodgrass sam be also examined being friend of defendant be from outset assumed to be hostile treated accordingly may be doubted however whether be permissible to treat own witness in rough fashion until at least have shown overt sign of hostility either by reserve obvious determination to let a little a possible be extracted from in such case be usual to apply to court for sanction to deal with by severity of cross examination when sam entered witness box serjeant addressed believe be in service of mr pickwick defendant in case speak up if please mr weller sam have not have time to say anything so admonition might seem superfluous be well known device sam have be briefed to serjeant a rather dangerous witness somewhat too wide awake be necessary therefore to be short summary with thus conveyed to jury that sam be one whom must address in curt way who by low uncertain accent might try to hide truth sam however disconcerted plan by prompt ready answer mean to speak up sir sam a know clearly brought out dodson fogg damaging assurance to mr bardell that cost must be charged to personally when plaintiff case be closed thing did not look particularly bright for mr pickwick have be shown on evidence of own friend that have be surprised with landlady in arm that have be corresponding with on most familiar term at least serjeant buzfuz have made appear so language that almost amounted to proposal have be overheard finally have be revealed that defendant have be caught in lady bedroom at inn at midnight to answer strong case be absolutely essential grieve to say be not forthcoming defendant case when listen to defence set up for mr pickwick have to lament that worthy gentleman be not better served by legal adviser on other side shrewd dodson fogg have done admirably for client be sharp clever attornies having thundering overpowering leader smart exceedingly smart junior one of wide awake brisk fellow who really conduct case will take silk in few year gentleman must cross examine in capital style address jury in language of own by glance shrug remark addressed to witness intended for jury a knew perfectly well style bearing speech form admirable epitome of art device of smart counsel there be common form skimpin have at finger end a listen feel how admirably directed be to work on jury perker plan of campaign a announced to mr pickwick be poor one enough showed how desperate thought case be have only one course to adopt dear sir said cross examine witness trust to snubbin eloquence throw dust in eye of judge ourselves on jury brave word nothing of programme be carried out cross examination of witness be tamely attempted snubbin eloquence be not displayed beyond mildly praising client good character a for throwing dust in eye of judge have seen mr justice stareleigh be much too wide awake for while throwing on jury be disastrous there be several other line of defence more up to date solicitor must not have overlooked le scrupulous man must have made searching enquiry into mr bardell history character client perhaps must not have sanctioned course perker be even absurd enough to talk of casa a though be italian word ca sa be short for writ of capias ad satisfaciendum gave warrant to officer to seize good there be various kind of machinery what affected mr pickwick be capias ad satisfaciendum to enforce attendance at court ca sa also came after judgment giving authority to imprison defendant till claim be satisfied appearance of such great gun a two serjeant be accounted for by curious rule that serjeant only be permitted to lead in case read in court of common plea strange monopoly recall that other one in court of arch where advocate judge used to exchange place decide on case in perhaps have be advocate illiberal unaccountable restriction have be swept away with court very unusual indeed at time be appearance of lawyer of serjeant snubbin class in court there be well known story how when charles butler made appearance on special occasion bar crowded in to hear have think to get gown for occasion one be sorry to think that there be serjeant now though at irish bar there be one solitary survivor serjeant hemphill gone too be coif other paraphernalia with abolition of separate court be found superfluous like to hear of serjeant parry serjeant ballantine serjeant warren talford four literary men having made initial blunder perker did not even instruct good smart ready junior chose instead incapable phunky who really brought out that fatal piece of evidence from winkle did for case altogether have business a boz tell junior be told have be just called be to say have be only eight year at bar snubbin have never heard of little judge in court also said that never have pleasure of hearing gentleman name before sneer must not have ventured on to counsel in good practice snubbin remark be amusing sarcastic now day barrister who have be at bar eight year must not be considered a just called for if have be passed over for time be likely never to make figure rude unbecoming sneer of snubbin little judge seem amazing in present code of legal manner everything at time however be much more in rough coarser be first case poor creature be thus described although infant barrister be full grown man have very nervous manner painful hesitation in speech did not appear to be natural defect seemed rather result of timidity arising from consciousness of being kept down by want of mean interest connection impudence a case might be be overawed by serjeant profoundly courteous to attorney have not have pleasure of seeing before mr phunky ' said serjeant snubbin with haughty condescension mr phunky bowed have have pleasure of seeing serjeant of envying too with poor man envy for eight year quarter be with in case understand ' said serjeant if mr phunky have be rich man must have instantly sent for clerk to remind if have be wise one must have applied fore finger to forehead endeavoured to recollect whether in multiplicity of engagement have undertaken one not a be rich wise in sense at event turned red bowed 'have read paper mr phunky ' inquired serjeant here again mr phunky must have professed to have forgotten about merit of case a have read such paper a have be laid before in course of action have thought of nothing else waking sleeping throughout two month during have be retained a mr serjeant snubbin junior turned deeper red bowed again 'this be mr pickwick ' said serjeant waving pen in direction in gentleman be standing mr phunky bowed to mr pickwick with reverence first client must ever awaken again inclined head towards leader will take mr pickwick away ' said serjeant 'and hear anything mr pickwick may wish to communicate will have consultation of course ' with hint that have be interrupted quite long enough mr serjeant snubbin who have be gradually growing more more abstracted applied glass to eye for instant bowed slightly round be once more deeply immersed in case before arose out of interminable law suit originating in act of individual deceased century so ago who have stopped up pathway leading from place nobody ever came from to other place nobody ever went to with pair case be literally given away perker must have secured man like present mr gill mr charles matthew might have broken down witness laughed case out of court may speculate why did perker make foolish selection a to snubbin there be excuse a be custom serjeant only must lead in court of common plea for choice of phunky perker stupidity alone be responsible under condition serjeant snubbin conduct of case handling of witness be truly inefficient lost opportunity for helping client led in quiet gentlemanly almost indifferent way first opportunity came in examining mr cluppins a have seen have deposed to hearing when door be on jar mr pickwick make speech mr bardell have taken to be proposal now here be moment to show ambiguity that mr pickwick be speaking of servant might have be brought out that sam be actually engaged that day that have met on stair etc snubbin declined to ask single question saying that mr pickwick admitted accuracy of statement be beside matter serjeant need not have impeached accuracy when phunky came to winkle inexperience of tyro be shown at once again here be moment to have extracted from witness full explanation of mr pickwick ambiguous speech to mr bardell must have brought out a clear a light of day that mr pickwick be speaking of engagement of valet have shown that valet be to be engaged very morning must have be impossible to resist explanation thing be not thought of from also must have be drawn vast deal favourable to mr pickwick such a disgust annoyance at mr bardell behaviour wish to be rid of complaint of conduct there be only foolish question a to mr pickwick being elderly man of fatherly way topic must by mean negative presumption of matrimony nothing must excuse rashness of putting general question a to mr pickwick behaviour towards female adroit counsel must run risk of encountering too conscientious witness such a winkle proved to be who must let cat out of bag a have seen awkward question settled mr pickwick business snubbin have held out a elderly benevolent being treating female met a daughter never dreaming of matrimony when lo whole fabric be overthrown in instant by luckless winkle admission amid profound silence of whole court mr winkle faltered out that trifling circumstance of suspicion be mr pickwick being found in lady sleeping apartment at midnight have terminated believed in breaking off projected marriage of lady have led knew to whole party being forcibly carried before magistrate thus be defendant suddenly revealed a pecksniffian lothario pretence of philanthrophy after be shewn in true colour be impossible not to associate with scene with mr bardell there be important legal point one might have expected must have occurred to so eminent chamber counsel a serjeant snubbin to prove breach of promise must always be shown that defendant have be given opportunity of officially refusing to fulfil must have be put to in black white will marry must have answered will not something to effect in default of defendant might plead true gave promise stand unbroken for never required to act upon now in mr pickwick case actually occurred a have seen left town morning after imputed proposal while be away within month notice of action be sent to up to time have not heard word of dodson fogg of legal proceeding may be urged that mr bardell may have written formulating demand that be not case be evident from mr pickwick behaviour did not dream of such thing must have be disturbed by have consulted friend about have be so high opinion of mr bardell must have be shattered for did not say on seeing dodson fogg letter must do have heart to do only thing make against theory be reply to peter magnus who asked have ever proposed when answered vehemently never possibly recalling mr bardell may however have written to pleading letter reminding of what have said to declaring deep seated affection for inviting to carry out what have offered mr pickwick must have replied in one of amiable letter couched in rather general term perhaps calling dear creature putting aside whole business there matter probably dropped for time have little doubt good woman up to last really believed that elderly lodger intended to make offer of hand that on return from travel must resume business much elated by prospect most naturally too have told friend neighbour of approaching advancement mr sander specially deposed to have always said believed that pickwick must marry mr bardell knew that mr bardell being engaged to pickwick be current topic of conversation in neighbourhood after fainting in july have be told by mr mudberry kept mangle mr bunkin clear starched did not see either mr mudberry mr bunkin in court notwithstanding speculation still doe not appear that pickwick made legal official refusal to execute promise a must be sufficient to support statement of what be now called summons plaint to wit that plaintiff being able willing to marry defendant defendant refused etc there be matter on hand of skilful counsel might have affected mr bardell friend mr burnand f c b be first to push home at trial mr saunders cross examined by serjeant snubbin have to admit that friend have admirer certain baker in neighbourhood who be supposed to have matrimonial design pressed on matter thus deposed have heard pickwick ask little boy how must like to have father did not know that mr bardell be at time keeping company with baker did know that baker be then single man be now married must swear that mr bardell be not very fond of baker must think that baker be not very fond of mr bardell must have married somebody else thought mr bardell fainted away on morning in july because pickwick asked to name day knew that witness fainted away stone dead when mr saunders asked to name day believed everybody a called lady must do same under similar circumstance heard pickwick ask boy question about marble upon oath did not know difference between alley tor commoney by court during period of keeping company with mr sander have received love letter like other lady in course of correspondence mr sander have often called 'duck never 'chops yet 'tomata sauce ' be particularly fond of duck perhaps if have be a fond of chop tomata sauce might have called that a term of affection what point too serjeant snubbin missed here must not have quoted old verse how must have convulsed court a poured out apropos for tommy pat cake pat cake baker man bake cake a quick a can knead bake a fast a can be put in oven for tommy now find that serjeant made use of topic in speech might have surely urged that wily experienced widow be eager for husband having be thrown over by baker stung by mortification resolved a be to rehabilitate prepare plant for unsuspecting lodger a sir henry irving say in play like widow know too much f c b a have said have treated baker theme developed regularly in amusing operetta pickwick little epitome given of snubbin speech show how weak be topic that in fact considered that there be defence serjeant snubbin then addressed jury on behalf of defendant very long very emphatic address delivered in bestowed highest possible eulogium on conduct character of mr pickwick attempted to show that letter have be exhibited merely related to mr pickwick dinner to preparation for receiving in apartment on return from country excursion be sufficient to add in general term that did best must for mr pickwick best a everybody know on infallible authority of old adage must do more be more than speaking in mitigation of damage mr phunky made speech be just a well a might have damaged case a witness have be called on side for same reason court have not pleasure of hearing skimpin who must doubt have torn defendant case to tatter charge verdict regular formula be judge begin to read note make running comment a go along have first gentleman statement of mr cluppins tell c of course come a friend of plaintiff naturally take favourable view of case if be satisfied with statement be for gentleman to consider what value will attach to then come to question of damage be entirely matter for must take into account position in life of defendant what plaintiff have lost by default on other hand must be reasonable in amount if believe promise have be clearly established must give substantial though not excessive damage on scale sufficient to repay plaintiff for wrong on other hand must seem to doubtful whether promise have be made will give defendant benefit of doubt be question entirely for not for on whole case will ask yourselves whether promise such a must satisfy reasonable men have be supported by sufficient evidence if so plaintiff be entitled to damage on other hand if be not proved to satisfaction will find for defendant mr justice stareleigh however a be told then summed up in old established most approved form read a much of note a must decypher on so short notice made running comment on evidence a went along if mr bardell be right be perfectly clear that mr pickwick be wrong if thought evidence of mr cluppins worthy of credence must believe if did why must'nt if be satisfied that breach of promise have be committed must find for plaintiff with such damage a thought proper if on other hand appeared to that promise of marriage have ever be given must find for defendant with damage at such be lucid direction be really not in least exaggeration must fancy acute judge of time such a mr justice day mr justice bigham after trying case turning round in seat to charge jury here gentleman must tell have claimed on one side that promise of marriage be made broken on other hand defendant denies having ever given promise question will have to deal with be what be promise when be given in other word when did defendant propose to lady on part of plaintiff be said to have be done at interview in goswell street two friend of plaintiff mr cluppins think turning over note yes cluppins sander declare positively that overheard language of proposal further mr pickwick friend be called to prove that lady be in arm fainting be extraordinary that not one of three gentleman must have deposed to statement have offered explanation of situation one witness indeed say that heard defendant remonstrate with plaintiff on hysterical behaviour ask to consider that if one must come in what must be said now be not language of ardent suitor who must rather wish than otherwise such endearing familiarity must continue though think need seriously accept reading learned counsel mr skimpin put on phrase used on other hand word dear creature be distinctly heard there be one little incident judge might go on must not pas by be not without significance witness deposed that defendant be noted for kindness to plaintiff little boy that be constantly giving present once be heard to say to patting on head must like to have father ' now addressed to child of tender year doe seem odd sort of speech of course will be contended that reference be to probability of mother marrying one other than defendant if be case seems to rather indelicate reckless speech then must be said seems inconsistent with amiable benevolent character given to defendant to day on other hand if be referring to will appear natural proper enough there be to be added that when child have reported remark to mother of course did must most reasonably begin to found hope upon then what follows gentleman defendant be found holding lady in arm becomes so demonstrative in attention that very child come to rescue be inexperienced in thing may be innocent done with purest intention may not gentleman of jury be men of world be for to put proper construction on will have noted gentleman curious feature of case none of witness be in room when imputed proposal be made yet cluppins weller defendant three friend heard what defendant said suggests that must have be very pressing if not agitated one of witness winkle think yes winkle actually deposes to hearing word dear creature compose ' like added be afraid someone might come in very reasonable fear gentleman well grounded for several person did come in must seem with awkward result for defendant gentleman confess that what most of weighs with in case be remarkable avowal wrung from reluctant witness of defendant being surprised at midnight in lady bed chamber being taken after serious riot before magistrate came on a saw did on a surprise true doe not bear on question of promise of breach still seems matter can not wholly shut out from consideration startled a did to find sort of travelling philanthropist a defendant pickwick hold out to be on whose mildly benevolent feature nature seems to have stamped rectitude high principle living life of hypocrisy taking part in midnight invasion daylight riot be one of own friend who tell sad story be for to consider whether plaintiff be here also in pursuit of yet disreputable game holding out marriage a bait seem to speak strongly feel must be impossible to withdraw from consideration may reasonably ask yourselves of what pickwick be afraid why did dread presence of witness be simply beguiling lady a attempted to beguile lady at ipswich without beeaning business ' a phrase run must say plaintiff have rather reasonable ground for assuming that defendant did mean business be for gentleman not for then have man weller statement sort of humorous stage servant not unamusing of course entirely devoted to master interest think need attach importance to what said of solicitor for plaintiff when be at bar gentleman attornies did much worse thing than jury consulted for only few minute perhaps however be only discussing amount of damage be certainly moderate laid at pound though have dodson fogg advice prevailed must have be double only by way be further proof of amiable mr bardell moderation secret tendre for genial lodger considering that mr pickwick be ' gentleman further gentleman of mean mr bardell be humble lodging house keeper sum seems hardly commensurate dodson fogg doubt expected pound anxious quarter of hour elapsed jury came back judge be fetched in mr pickwick put on spectacle gazed at foreman with agitated countenance quickly beating heart 'gentlemen said individual in black 'be agreed upon verdict ' 'we be ' replied foreman find for plaintiff gentleman for defendant 'for plaintiff what damage gentleman beeven hundred fifty pound mr pickwick took off spectacle carefully wiped glass folded into case put in pocket then having drawn on glove with great nicety stared at foreman while mechanically followed mr perker blue bag out of court stopped in side room while perker paid court fee here mr pickwick be joined by friend here too encountered messrs dodson fogg rubbing hand with token of outward satisfaction gentleman said mr pickwick 'well sir ' said dodson for self partner 'you imagine will get cost gentleman ' said mr pickwick fogg said thought rather probable dodson smiled said 'd try 'you may try try try again messrs dodson fogg ' said mr pickwick vehemently 'but not one farthing of cost damage do ever get from if spend rest of existence in debtor prison ' have ' laughed dodson 'you will think better of before next term mr pickwick ' will soon see about

have recognised poor chance perhaps have required security for cost client must not have given however idea did not occur to anybody since law be changed plaintiff defendant may be examined in such

boz be always vehement against abuse of law generous ardour sometimes led to exaggerated wholesale statement be scarcely well founded be found in degree even in sweeping attack in bleak house be so vivid so persuasive in picture that there be appeal unreasoning fury of mr pickwick be specially shown in case of jingle whom pursued with animosity be almost frantic one must think be public enemy be hunting down for public good poor jingle have really done nothing so monstrous after have chaffed dr slammer run off with spinster aunt nothing so uncommon in day have be consigned to fleet for non payment of debt there showed penitence other sign of good heart one serious offence be passing off a naval officer under assumed name have crossed mr pickwick have ridiculed have contemptuously sent message to tuppy when dared to play practical joke on persecutor infamy passed beyond bound here be key to mr pickwick nature lack of homage respect be offence against morality so with dodson fogg have settled in mind that condescending visit to gentleman with little explanation remonstrance must completely disarm fury on advance being rejected be extraordinary here boz show a ever doe profound most logical treatment of human character never go astray being guided by happy true instinct mr pickwick have grown to be most inflated of men flattered followed submitted to with greatest deference ordering people about doing what pleased must not stand slightest opposition one be to contradict one to question even stocking speckled others even when be clearly wrong be affront to hint at have much in common with great man mr gladstone who be political pickwick of time be overbearing arrogant unrestrained be afraid vindictive dodson fogg be associated with great mortification of life must not forgive very sight of roused hatred having to pay ransom stung to fury be most natural yet unexpected popular genial sir frank lockwood be almost first to put forward plea in abatement of prejudice for firm showed that be not much below usual type of middle class solicitor what did be in ordinary course with mr pickwick be most forbearing even indulgent there be one rather doubtful passage even here offer extenuation be treatment of poor ramsey at first sight seems very bad indeed 'there be such game with fogg here mornin '' said man in brown coat jack be upstairs sorting paper two be gone to stamp office fogg be down here opening letter when chap issued writ against at camberwell know came in what be name again 'ramsey ' said clerk who have spoken to mr pickwick 'ah ramsey precious seedy looking customer 'well sir ' say old fogg looking at very fierce know way sir have come to settle ' 'yes have sir ' said ramsey putting hand in pocket bringing out money debt two pound ten cost three pound five here be sir ' sighed like brick a lugged out money done up in bit of blotting paper old fogg looked first at money then at then coughed in rum way so knew something be coming 'you know there be declaration filed increase cost materially suppose ' said fogg 'you say that sir ' said ramsey starting back 'the time be only out last night sir ' ' do say though ' said fogg bey clerk just gone to file have mr jackson gone to file declaration in bullman ramsey mr wick of course said yes then fogg coughed again looked at ramsey bey god ' said ramsey 'and here have nearly driven mad scraping money together to purpose ' 'none at said fogg coolly have better go back scrape more together bring here in time ' ca get by god ' said ramsey striking desk with fist ' bully sir ' said fogg getting into passion on purpose ' be not bullying sir ' said ramsey 'you be ' said fogg 'get out sir get out of office sir come back sir when know how to behave ' well ramsey tried to speak fogg must let so put money in pocket sneaked out door be scarcely shut when old fogg turned round to with sweet smile on face drew declaration out of coat pocket wick say fogg 'take cab go down

may a well get can out of mr wick be christian act to do mr wick for with large family small income will be better for good lesson against getting into debt wo mr wick wo ' smiled so goodnaturedly a went away that be delightful to see be capital man of business ' said wick in tone of deepest admiration 'capital be ' other three cordially subscribed to opinion anecdote afforded most unlimited satisfaction men here sir ' whispered mr weller to master nice notion of fun have sir ' sir f lockwood by way offer one of most amusing proof conceivable of convincing power of pickwick be constantly taking out of world of fiction into of daily living life speaks of cruel trick played upon unfortunate ramsey who came to pay bill of cost be told that be out of date have be swelled by subsequent proceeding affidavit have be sworn after left house wick clerk be sent off to swear then sir frank add after be merely given a statement of wick on whose testimony not much reliance can be placed a though wick be living witness erect upon two leg whom have be examining in court must however be recollected that be exparte story wick a sir f lockwood hint may have coloured up to amuse brother truth be poor helpless debtor who fall into hand of legal shark money lender have trick also will often do employ if can further let be considered before ramsey paid visit affidavit have be prepared be actually in fogg pocket such affidavit must not be allowed for in cost unless necessary to case so that fogg statement that have be filed be very near truth perker be playing same game of hide seek with unfortunate one watty who be trying to see learn something about case be always put off with excuse falsehood that perker be out though be within then perker be honourable man boz let know through sam how case reached dodson fogg speaks of kind generous people o ' perfession set clerk to work to find out little dispute among neighbour acquaintance a want settlin ' by mean of law suit system however can not be checked speculative attorney even in time still flourish be really not question whether mr pickwick must indict for conspiracy because acted a solicitor against whether must bring action against on own account through mr pickwick behaviour to have be outrageous chose to assume quite gratuitously that be not mr bardell who got up case that have worked on for own nefarious end nothing must be more absurd landlady be eager enough to protect own interest female friend worked on loss of so valuable lodger incident must have entailed inflamed more can see from sam interview with that be at last though at first reluctant determined to have right mr pickwick acting on assumption addressed firm from first to last in most scurrilous language called robber swindler brace of pettifogging scoundrel shocking ungentlemanly term what be worse actionable yet pair received abuse with infinite good temper restraint merely securing witness who must listen threatening speaker with legal penalty why did not take course well have to suspend proceeding until mr bardell action be settled when on receiving cost be desirous to part in good humour mr pickwick be so furious at being invited to shake hand with that again broke out with coarse abuse robber robber calling after down stair why did not take action on perhaps be afraid a mr pickwick have shewn doughty unyielding fighter going to prison rather than pay perhaps thought might get better of again have very little evidence a to what be scale of fee in use in day be of course far lower than be now after allowance even for lower cost of living to day fee to counsel alone must have absorbed considerably more than dodson fogg whole bill of cost nice point be must mr pickwick irregular interview with serjeant snubbin be considered something in way of consultation here be counsel solicitor client serjeant gave up portion of valuable time further junior counsel be summoned specially from chamber to supply advice opinion mr pickwick ought surely to have to pay for whim bill of cost that shark of attornies sent in be astonishingly moderate for writ service of subpoena hunting up evidence consultation fee to counsel fee for day retainer etc sum of pound be be asked imagine messrs lewis lewis sending in such demand at end of trial have taken nearly year to get ready in time must hardly be done under pound perker by way told client that on payment of cost of plaintiff defendent into hand of shark must get release with much indulgence attornies allowed to leave prison on bare undertaking to pay be not clear why must pay own cost to not to perker be not paid for sometime mr pickwick own cost must have be small have witness perker must not have made hand of fancy must have got off for ninety pound hundred pound there be however fee of special jury so must have to pay say pound cognovit perker have be shown be not very brilliant solicitor view on trial be somewhat cloudy when be urging client to leave fleet threw out equally shadowy ill informed notion a to what might be done in way of punishing nefarious solicitor dodson fogg freeman court shark great charge be that have got cognovit undertaking to pay cost out of mr bardell own client mr pickwick refused to pay why must not poor woman have blabbed to sam careless natural assurance of theirs that must be content to get from mr pickwick thing many firm must do perker here see regular conspiracy can not undertake to say whether wording of cognovit nature of ostensible consideration proof can get together about whole conduct of suit will be sufficient to justify indictment for conspiracy be impossible to understand bit of legal jargon wording of cognovit one must speculate on without seeing nature of ostensible consideration be not far to seek being work labour done for plaintiff again supposing have promised to get solely from mr pickwick sam revelation of in open court reception with laughter showed what be thought of so of two course be to adopt proof may get together about whole conduct of suit whole conduct be perfectly regular so judge thought so did jury case be proved by pickwick own friend a know however firm took step to obtain satisfaction there can not be slightest doubt that must have recovered damage doubt if mr pickwick must have gone to fleet for second time rather than pay perker suspicion a to cognovit obtained by dodson fogg be shrewd certain enough though must not have seen document suspicion be well warranted by state of law became instrument in hand of grasping attorney by client be made to sign acknowledgment offering defence to supposed action say for cost brought against judgment be then marked offered great temptation to unscrupulous mr bardell doubt signed with light heart not knowing what be doing being told that be merely matter of form various enactment attempted to protect client one being passed four five year before trial bardell v pickwick requiring cognovit to be regularly filed within twenty one day more than ten year later be required that client signing thing must have force in law unless be represented by solicitor matter a know be compromised with dodson fogg so there be need to scrutinize cognovit doubt perker be enabled to put pressure on firm by hinting at such proceeding damage pound be certainly moderate must not have be reduced by court on application to set aside a excessive good woman be quite at ease being doubt certain that mr pickwick at last must give in must even enjoy society of friend make celebrated junketting to spaniard firm took view grew tired of waiting be sagacious enough to see that arrest of client be about best method of putting pressure on mr pickwick in connection may be noted that jackson over zeal in transaction might have led to action against employer for arrested not only mr bardell friend mr sander mr cluppins prison gate be actually shut on safe sound said bailiff here be at last said jackson right tight true mr bardell put under hand in appealing letter to mr pickwick that business be from very first fomented encouraged brought about by men be not much for view only occurs to when operation have completely failed recoiled on own head with such disastrous result firm business be to persuade that have good case jury verdict proved that have have mr pickwick given in paid must have have scruple one can not at same time admire ingenuity of author in bringing such nemesis on dodson fogg be told continue in business from realise large income in be universally considered among sharpest of sharp at last interview at perker when cost be paid one might have expected mr pickwick to behave with certain disdainful dignity be beaten have paid over stake must afford to treat enemy with contempt not so partner held out olive branch by alluding to way have passed by unmannerly attack on beg to assure sir bear ill will vindictive feeling for sentiment thought proper to express of in office other partner said hope think quite so ill of etc be rather gentlemanly becoming one offered hand mr pickwick broke out in perfect fury have assumed tone of forgiveness be excess of impudence have be victim of plot conspiracy have imprisoned robbed be insolent familiarity at last said be well matched pair of mean rascally pettifogging robber sentence repeated three time word robber shouted after many time over stair sharping attornies why real sharping firm must have forced from client advance of fee cash out of pocket have made give bill of sale on lease good have fairly stripped of everything before case began of damage have got must have seen little cognovit be extracted from mr bardell be acknowledgement a have seen entitled to enter up judgment just a if trial have taken place in oxford great dictionary read quaintly to find mr bardell cognovit quoted a illustration of legal meaning turnkey on arrest have told sam that have be brought to fleet on cognovit for cost sam imparted news to job trotter sent off hot foot to perker in montague place outcast be able to tell seems got cognovit out of for amount of cost directly after trial boz on occasion give happy glimpse of solicitor life mr perker have dinner party that day be certified by light in drawing room window sound of improved grand piano improveable cabinet voice issuing therefrom rather overpowering smell of meat prevaded step entry in fact couple of very good country agency happening to come up to town at same time agreeable little party have be got together to meet comprising mr snick life office secretary mr prosee eminent counsel three solicitor one commissioner of bankrupt special pleader from temple small eyed peremptory young gentleman pupil who have written lively book about law of demise with vast quantity of marginal note reference several other eminent distinguished personage from society little mr perker detached on clerk being announced in whisper repairing to dining room there found mr lowten job trotter looking very dim shadowy by light of kitchen candle gentleman who condescended to appear in plush short cotton for quarterly stipend have with becoming contempt for clerk thing appertaining to 'the office ' placed upon table lowten ' said little mr perker shutting door 'what be matter important letter come in parcel be there ' do not seem to be present can never pas by russell square without calling up scene note too component of legal dinner poor sir f lockwood used to declare that relished prosee eminent counsel more than one of boz legal circle yet five word be know of sir frank have imagination like of must read between line rather between word here be prominent member of bar be kc triton among minnow therefore heading table listened to with reverence a told of judge possibly of old stareleigh last exhibition of petulance with be high time for to go etc if have not silk why did not perker retain instead of incapable phunky whom did not ask on occasion gave chap good chance destroyed whole case catch letting put leg under mahogany among guest be that small eyed peremptory young gentleman special pleader pupil what capital sketch have boz given of have written lively book about law of demise with vast quantity of marginal note reference have come with teacher who be doubt highly deferental to mr prosee enough peremptory young gentleman may have partly tackled great man on point of practice good country agency must have gone home delighted with evening mr prosee may be brought into somewhat closer communication with case at perker dinner gentleman have gone up to drawing room when perker be called down to hear news of mr bardell arrest mr prosee be left expatiating to circle on beautiful point when perker returned how likely that must tell of extraordinary client who have preferred to go to prison rather than pay cost of suit here must go on be drollest sequel ever heard c odd unusual thing mr prosee must say plaintiff defendant in jail together never heard like there must be much laughter at novel situation thus cognovit must come up mr prosee gravely say nothing will be done till act of parliament be passed client must be protected by fresh solicitor on young author of treatise on demise must have something to say in best fashion for cognovit might be taken to be sort of demise doubt mr prosee if suggestion must work a take sir etc release from fleet circumstance connected with mr pickwick release from fleet show adroitness ability of dodson in high degree will be recollected that when job rushed with news to perker gentleman clerk broke out into raptuous admiration lowten ' said little mr perker shutting door 'what be matter important letter come in parcel be there ' 'no sir ' replied lowten 'this be messenger from mr pickwick sir ' pickwick eh ' said little man turning quickly to job 'well what be ' 'dodson fogg have taken mr bardell in execution for cost sir ' said job 'no exclaimed perker putting hand in pocket reclining against sideboard 'yes said job 'it seems got cognovit out of for amount of 'em directly after trial jove ' said perker taking hand out of pocket striking knuckle of right against palm of left emphatically 'those be cleverest scamp ever have anything to do with ' sharpest practitioner ever knew sir ' observed lowten ' echoed perker 'there be knowing where to have ' havery true sir there be not ' replied lowten then master man pondered for few second with animated countenance a if be reflecting upon one of most beautiful ingenious discovery that intellect of man have ever made when have in measure recovered from trance of admiration job trotter discharged of rest of commission perker nodded head thoughtfully pulled out watch now to superficial seemed to be evaded by art of firm in getting cognovit out of be ordinary vulgar stroke anyone must have done policy went far deeper perker be acute enough to recognize there be object in putting mr bardell into fleet must no more get cost out of than must get out of mr pickwick have nothing few stick of furniture worth say pound astute fellow saw what pressure must be put on benevolent nature of mr pickwick who must not endure that respectable woman must be exposed to contamination of debtor prison sagacity be to be justified on very next day too be curious however that mention be made of mr bardell release of course took place before mr pickwick here again dodson fogg behaved very fairly for allowed mr pickwick to be released without receiving payment simply on understanding by perker a turned out indeed be not paid for week process by mr pickwick be got into fleet be complicated enough habeas corpus appearing before functionary etc be odd that in case of person of lower degree seemed not to be necessary hear of in sam instance while mr bardell be taken straight from spaniard to prison door be not even formally arrested by bailiff though be in attendance sat afar off at hampstead taking drink on box during drive might be said to have be arbitrarily taken to prison by jackson without legal warrant have not business be compromised other astute firm of attorney might have found subject for action against dodson fogg of humorous incident connected with case be old weller firm persuasion mr pickwick be to stand trial a though be indicted for criminal offence find always astray a to when be to be tried etc be most natural impression among lower class who be not very clear a to distinction between civil criminal process being most familiar with latter in same spirit be humorous suggestion of securing alibi a best method of getting mr pickwick off o sammy sammy vy wor there alleybi such be trial in pickwick be there writer now living may be asked who must furnish picture a one so full of reality true humour of one of modern court of justice answer must be that must be idle to look for such person there be thousand who must supply minute drawing in not single detail must be omitted piercing to essence happy generalization knowledge of true point of character must be sought in vain footnote so confused be chronology of pickwick that be difficult to fix exact date of trial boz writing ten year after event seems to have got little confused uncertain a to exact year of trial first fixed opening of story in on coming to compromising incident in goswell street occurred only few week later changed year to then jingle anachronism of french revolution of july suggested that new date must not do so be next adopted did not end matter for in erratum be directed to change date back again to so now stand trial therefore really took place on april seven year after trial monopoly be taken away from serjeant namely in then capriciously given back to finally abolished in have heard from daughter of mr chapman original publisher of pickwick that talfourd revised directed trial on one occasion boz be dining with when proof be brought in with legal mistake noted by talfourd boz left table put right
