benevolent because be never cut be not of course to be seen in boy a in old man nevertheless in seraphic creature with haymaking rake be clearly to be discerned rudiment of patriarch with list shoe patriarch be name many people delighted to give various old lady in neighbourhood spoke of a last of patriarch so grey so slow so quiet so impassionate so very bumpy in head patriarch be word for have be accosted in street respectfully solicited to become patriarch for painter for sculptor with so much importunity in that must appear to be beyond fine art to remember point of patriarch to invent one philanthropist of sex have asked who be on being informed old christopher casby formerly town agent to lord decimus tite barnacle have cried in rapture of disappointment oh why with head be not benefactor to specie oh why with head be not father to orphan friend to friendless with head however remained old christopher casby proclaimed by common report rich in house property with head now sat in silent parlour indeed must be height of unreason to expect to be sitting there without head arthur clennam moved to attract attention grey eyebrow turned towards beg pardon said clennam fear did not hear announced sir did not did wish to see sir wished to pay respect mr casby seemed feather disappointed by last word having perhaps prepared for visitor wishing to pay something else have pleasure sir proceeded take chair if please have pleasure of knowing ah truly yes think have believe be not mistaken in supposing that be acquainted with feature think address gentleman of whose return to country be informed by mr flintwinch be present visitor really mr clennam other mr casby mr clennam be glad to see how have be since met without thinking worth while to explain that in

of head a shed patriarchal light upon be older mr clennam said christopher casby be not younger said clennam after wise remark felt that be scarcely shining with brilliancy became aware that be nervous respected father said mr casby be more be grieved to hear mr clennam be grieved arthur replied in usual way that felt infinitely obliged to there be time said mr casby when parent be not on friendly term there be little family misunderstanding among respected mother be rather jealous of son maybe when say son mean worthy self worthy self smooth face have bloom upon like ripe wall fruit what with blooming face that head blue eye seemed to be delivering sentiment of rare wisdom virtue in like manner physiognomical expression seemed to teem with benignity nobody must have said where wisdom be where virtue be where benignity be seemed to be somewhere about time however pursued mr casby be past gone past gone do pleasure of making visit to respected mother occasionally of admiring fortitude strength of mind with bear trial bear trial when made one of little repetition sitting with hand crossed before did with head on one side gentle smile a if have something in thought too sweetly profound to be put into word a if denied pleasure of uttering lest must soar too high meekness therefore preferred to be unmeaning have heard that be kind enough on one of occasion said arthur catching at opportunity a drifted past to mention little dorrit to mother little dorrit thats seamstress who be mentioned to by small tenant of mine yes yes dorrit thats name ah yes yes call little dorrit road in direction nothing came of cross cut led further daughter flora said mr casby a may have heard probably mr clennam be married established in life several year ago have misfortune to lose husband when have be married few month resides with again will be glad to see if will permit to let know that be here by mean returned clennam must have preferred request if kindness have not anticipated upon mr casby rose up in list shoe with slow heavy step be of elephantine build made for door have long wide skirted bottle green coat on bottle green pair of trouser bottle green waistcoat patriarch be not dressed in bottle green broadcloth yet clothes looked patriarchal have scarcely left room allowed ticking to become audible again when quick hand turned latchkey in house door opened shut immediately afterwards quick eager short dark man came into room with so much way upon that be within foot of clennam before must stop halloa said clennam saw reason why must not say halloa too whats matter said short dark man have not heard that anything be matter returned clennam wheres mr casby asked short dark man looking about will be here directly if want want said short dark man dont elicited word two of explanation from clennam during delivery of short dark man held breath looked at be dressed in black rusty iron grey have jet black bead of eye scrubby little black chin wiry black hair striking out from head in prong like fork hair pin complexion be very dingy by nature very dirty by art compound of nature art have dirty hand dirty broken nail looked a if have be in coal be in perspiration snorted sniffed puffed blew like little labouring steam engine oh said when arthur told how came to be there very well thats right if must ask for pancks will be so good a to say that pancks be come in so with snort puff worked out by door now in old day at home certain audacious doubt respecting last of patriarch be afloat in air have by forgotten mean come in contact with arthur sensorium be aware of mote speck of suspicion in atmosphere of time seen through medium christopher casby be mere inn signpost without inn invitation to rest be thankful when there be place to put up at nothing whatever to be thankful for knew that of speck even represented christopher a capable of harbouring design in head a being crafty impostor other mote there be showed a heavy selfish drifting booby who having stumbled in course of unwieldy jostling against other men on discovery to get through life with ease credit have to hold tongue keep bald part of head well polished leave hair alone have have just cunning enough to seize idea stick to be said that being town agent to lord decimus tite barnacle be referable not to having least business capacity to looking so supremely benignant that nobody must suppose property screwed jobbed under man also that for similar reason now got more money out of own wretched letting unquestioned than anybody with le nobby le shining crown must possibly have done in word be represented clennam called to mind alone in ticking parlour that many people select model much a painter just now mentioned select theirs whereas in royal academy evil old ruffian of dog stealer will annually be found embodying cardinal virtue on account of eyelash chin leg thereby planting thorn of confusion in breast of more observant student of nature so in great social exhibition accessory be often accepted in lieu of internal character calling thing to mind ranging mr pancks in row with arthur clennam leaned day to opinion without quite deciding on that last of patriarch be drifting booby aforesaid with one idea of keeping bald part of head highly polished that much a unwieldy ship in thames river may sometimes be seen heavily driving with tide broadside on stern first in own way in way of everything else though making great show of navigation when of sudden little coaly steam tug will bear down upon take in tow bustle off with similarly cumbrous patriarch have be taken in tow by snorting pancks be now following in wake of dingy little craft return of mr casby with daughter flora put end to meditation clennams eye sooner fell upon subject of old passion than shivered broke to piece most men will be found sufficiently true to to be true to old idea be proof of inconstant mind exactly opposite when idea will not bear close comparison with reality contrast be fatal shock to such be clennams case in youth have ardently loved woman have heaped upon locked up wealth of affection imagination that wealth have be in desert home like robinson crusoes money exchangeable with one lying idle in dark to rust until poured out for ever since memorable time though have until night of arrival a completely dismissed from association with present future a if have be dead might easily have be for anything knew have kept old fancy of past unchanged in old sacred place now after last of patriarch coolly walked into parlour saying in effect be good enough to throw down dance upon be flora flora always tall have grown to be very broad too short of breath be not much flora whom have left lily have become peony be not much flora who have seemed enchanting in said thought be diffuse silly be much flora who have be spoiled artless long ago be determined to be spoiled artless now be fatal blow be flora be sure giggled flora tossing head with caricature of girlish manner such a mummer might have presented at own funeral if have lived died in classical antiquity be ashamed to see mr clennam be mere fright know hell find fearfully changed be actually old woman shocking to be found out really shocking assured that be just what have expected that time have not stood still with oh with gentleman so different really look so amazingly well that have right to say anything of kind while a to know oh cried flora with little scream be dreadful patriarch apparently not yet understanding own part in drama under representation glowed with vacant serenity if talk of not having changed said flora who whatever said never once came to full stop look at papa be not papa precisely what be when went away isnt cruel unnatural of papa to be such reproach to own child if go on in way much longer people who dont know will begin to suppose that be papa mama must be long time hence arthur considered oh mr clennam insincerest of creature said flora perceive already have not lost old way of paying compliment old way when used to pretend to be so sentimentally struck know at least dont mean that oh dont know what mean here flora tittered confusedly gave one of old glance patriarch a if now began to perceive that part in piece be to get off stage a soon a might be rose went to door by pancks have worked out hailing that tug by name received answer from little dock beyond be towed out of sight directly mustnt think of going yet said flora arthur have looked at hat being in ludicrous dismay not knowing what to do must never be so unkind a to think of going arthur mean mr arthur suppose mr clennam must be far more proper be sure dont know what be saying without word about dear old day gone for ever when come to think of dare say must be much better not to speak of highly probable that have much more agreeable engagement pray let be last person in world to interfere with though there be time be running into nonsense again be possible that flora must have be chatterer in day referred to must there have be anything like present disjointed volubility in fascination have captivated indeed have little doubt said flora running on with astonishing speed pointing conversation with nothing comma very few of that be married to chinese lady being in china so long being in business naturally desirous to settle extend connection nothing be more likely than that must propose to chinese lady nothing be more natural be sure than that chinese lady must accept think very well off too only hope shes not pagodian dissenter be not returned arthur smiling in spite of married to lady flora oh good gracious hope never kept bachelor so long on account tittered flora of course never did why must pray dont answer dont know where im running to oh do tell something about chinese lady whether eye be really so long narrow always putting in mind of mother of pearl fish at card do really wear tail down back plaited too be only men when pull hair so very tight off forehead dont hurt why do stick little bell over bridge temple hat thing dont really do flora gave of old glance instantly went on again a if have spoken in reply for time then true really do good gracious arthur pray excuse old habit mr clennam far more proper what country to live in for so long time with so many lantern umbrella too how very dark wet climate ought to be doubt actually be sum of money must be made by two trade where everybody carry hang everywhere little shoe too foot screwed back in infancy be quite surprising what traveller be in ridiculous distress clennam received of old glance without in least knowing what to do with dear dear said flora only to think of change at home arthur can not overcome seems so natural mr clennam far more proper since became familiar with chinese custom language be persuaded speak like native if not better for be always quick clever though immensely difficult doubt be sure tea chest alone must kill if tried such change arthur be doing again seems so natural most improper a one must have believed who must have ever imagined mr finching when cant imagine be that married name asked arthur struck in midst of by certain warmth of heart expressed in tone when referred however oddly to youthful relation in have stood to one finching finching oh yes isnt dreadful name a mr f said when proposed to did seven time handsomely consented must say to be what used to call on liking twelve month after wasnt answerable for couldnt help must excellent man not at like excellent man flora have at last talked out of breath for one moment one moment for recovered breath in act of raising minute corner of pocket handkerchief to eye a tribute to ghost of departed mr f began again one must dispute arthur mr clennam that quite right must be formally friendly to under altered circumstance indeed couldnt be anything else at least suppose not ought to know cant help recalling that there be time when thing be very different dear mr finching arthur began struck by good tone again oh not that nasty ugly name say flora flora assure flora be happy in seeing once more in finding that like have not forgotten old foolish dream when saw before in light of youth hope dont seem so pouted flora take very coolly however know be disappointed in suppose chinese lady mandarinesses if call so be cause perhaps be cause just a likely clennam entreated dont say that oh must know said flora in positive tone what nonsense not to know be not what expected know very well in midst of rapidity have found that out with quick perception of cleverer woman inconsistent profoundly unreasonable way in instantly went on nevertheless to interweave long abandoned boy girl relation with present interview made clennam feel a if be light headed one remark said flora giving conversation without slightest notice to great terror of clennam tone of love quarrel wish to make one explanation wish to offer when mama came made scene of with papa when be called down into little breakfast room where be looking at one with mama parasol between seated on two chair like mad bull what be to do dear mr finching urged clennam so long ago so long concluded be worth while seriously to cant arthur returned flora be denounced a heartless by whole society of china without setting right when have opportunity of doing so must be very well aware that there be paul virginia have to be returned be returned without note comment not that mean to say must have written to watched a be if have only come back with red wafer on cover must have known that meant come to pekin nankeen whats third place barefoot dear mr finching be not to blame never blamed be too young too dependent helpless to do anything accept separation pray think how long ago gently remonstrated arthur one more remark proceeded flora with unslackened volubility wish to make one more explanation wish to offer for five day have cold in head from cry passed entirely in back drawing room there be back drawing room still on first floor still at back of house to confirm word when dreary period have passed lull succeeded year rolled on mr f became acquainted with at mutual friend be attention called next day soon began to call three evening week to send in little thing for supper be not love on mr f part be adoration mr f proposed with full approval of papa what must hing said arthur with cheerfulest readiness what did let old friend assure of full conviction that did quite right one last remark proceeded flora rejecting commonplace life with wave of hand wish to make one last explanation wish to offer there be time ere mr f first paid attention incapable of being mistaken be past be not to be dear mr clennam no longer wear golden chain be free trust may be happy here be papa who be always tiresome putting in nose everywhere where be not wanted with word with hasty gesture fraught with timid caution gesture have clennams eye be familiar with in old time poor flora left at eighteen year of age long long way behind again came to full stop at last rather left about half of herself at eighteen year of age behind grafted rest on to relict of late mr f thus making moral mermaid of herself once boy lover contemplated with feeling wherein sense of sorrowful sense of comical be curiously blended for example a if there be secret understanding between herself clennam of most thrilling nature a if first of train of post chaise four extending way to scotland be at moment round corner a if couldnt wouldnt have walked into parish church with under shade of family umbrella with patriarchal blessing on head perfect concurrence of mankind flora comforted soul with agony of mysterious signalling expressing dread of discovery with sensation of becoming more more light headed minute clennam saw relict of late mr f enjoying in most wonderful manner by putting in old place going through old performance now when stage be dusty when scenery be faded when youthful actor be dead when orchestra be empty when light be out still through grotesque revival of what remembered a having once be prettily natural to must not feel that revived at sight of that there be tender memory in patriarch insisted on staying to dinner flora signalled yes clennam so wished must have done more than stay to dinner so heartily wished must have found flora have be that never have be that thought least atonement must make for disappointment almost felt ashamed of be to give up to family desire therefore stayed to dinner pancks dined with pancks steamed out of little dock at quarter before six bore straight down for patriarch who happened to be then driving in inane manner through stagnant account of bleeding heart yard pancks instantly made fast to hauled out bleeding heart yard said pancks with puff snort troublesome property dont pay badly rent be very hard to get there have more trouble with one place than with place belonging to just a big ship in tow get credit with most spectator of being powerful object so patriarch usually seemed to have said pancks said for indeed returned clennam upon whom impression be so efficiently made by mere gleam of polished head that spoke ship instead of tug people be so poor there cant say know snorted pancks taking one of dirty hand out of rusty iron grey pocket to bite nail if must find turning bead of eye upon employer whether theyre poor not say be say that when man say he rich youre generally sure isnt besides if be poor cant help youd be poor if didnt get rent true enough said arthur youre not going to keep open house for poor of london pursued pancks youre not going to lodge em for nothing youre not going to open gate wide let em come free not if know aint mr casby shook head in placid benignant generality if man take room of at crown week when week come round hasnt got half crown say to man why have got room then if havent got one thing why have got other what have be done with money what do mean by be up to thats what say to man of sort if didnt say more shame for mr pancks here made singular startling noise produced by strong blowing effort in region of nose unattended by result that acoustic one have extent of such property about east north east here believe said clennam doubtful of two to address oh pretty well said pancks youre not particular to east north east point of compass will do for what want be good investment quick return take where can find aint nice a to situation not there be fourth most original figure in patriarchal tent who also appeared before dinner be amazing little old woman with face like staring wooden doll too cheap for expression stiff yellow wig perched unevenly on top of head a if child who owned doll have driven tack through anywhere so that only got fastened on remarkable thing in little old woman be that same child seemed to have damaged face in two three place with blunt instrument in nature of spoon countenance particularly tip of nose presenting phenomenon of several dint generally answering to bowl of article further remarkable thing in little old woman be that have name mr f aunt broke upon visitor view under following circumstance flora said when first dish be being put on table perhaps mr clennam might not have heard that mr f have left legacy clennam in return implied hope that mr f have endowed wife whom adored with greater part of worldly substance if not with flora said oh yes didnt mean that mr f have made beautiful will have left a separate legacy aunt then went out of room to fetch legacy on return rather triumphantly presented mr f aunt major characteristic discoverable by stranger in mr f aunt be extreme severity grim taciturnity sometimes interrupted by propensity to offer remark in deep warning voice being totally uncalled for by anything said by anybody traceable to association of idea confounded terrified mind mr f aunt may have thrown in observation on system of own may have be ingenious even subtle key to be wanted neatly served well cooked dinner for everything about patriarchal household promoted quiet digestion began with soup fried sol butter boat of shrimp sauce dish of potato conversation still turned on receipt of rent mr f aunt after regarding company for ten minute with malevolent gaze delivered following fearful remark when lived at henley barness gander be stole by tinker mr pancks courageously nodded head said right maam effect of mysterious communication upon clennam be absolutely to frighten circumstance invested old lady with peculiar terror though be always staring never acknowledged that saw individual polite attentive stranger must desire say to consult inclination on subject of potato expressive action must be hopelessly lost upon what must do man must say mr f aunt will permit man retired from spoon a clennam did cowed baffled there be mutton steak apple pie nothing in remotest way connected with gander dinner went on like disenchanted feast a truly be once upon time clennam have sat at table taking heed of anything flora now principal heed took of flora be to observe against will that be very fond of porter that combined great deal of sherry with sentiment that if be little overgrown be upon substantial ground last of patriarch have always be mighty eater disposed of immense quantity of solid food with benignity of good soul who be feeding one else mr pancks who be always in hurry who referred at interval to little dirty notebook kept beside perhaps containing name of defaulter meant to look up by way of dessert took in victual much a if be coaling with good deal of noise good deal of dropping about puff snort occasionally a if be nearly ready to steam away through dinner flora combined present appetite for eating drinking with past appetite for romantic love in way that made clennam afraid to lift eye from plate since must not look towards without receiving glance of mysterious meaning warning a if be engaged in plot mr f aunt sat silently defying with aspect of greatest bitterness until removal of cloth appearance of decanter when originated observation struck into conversation like clock without consulting anybody flora have just said mr clennam will give glass of port for mr f aunt monument near london bridge that lady instantly proclaimed be put up arter great fire of london great fire of london be not fire in uncle george workshop be burned down mr pancks with former courage said indeed maam right appearing to be incensed by imaginary contradiction other ill usage mr f aunt instead of relapsing into silence made following additional proclamation hate fool imparted to sentiment in almost solomonic so extremely injurious personal character by levelling straight at visitor head that became necessary to lead mr f aunt from room be quietly done by flora mr f aunt offering resistance inquiring on way out what come there for then with implacable animosity when flora returned explained that legacy be clever old lady be sometimes little singular took dislike peculiarity of flora seemed to be proud rather than otherwise a flora good nature shone in case clennam have fault to find with old lady for eliciting now that be relieved from terror of presence took glass two of wine in peace foreseeing then that pancks must shortly get under weigh that patriarch must go to sleep pleaded necessity of visiting mother asked mr pancks in direction be going citywards sir said pancks will walk together said arthur quite agreeable said pancks meanwhile flora be murmuring in rapid snatch for ear that there be time that past be yawning gulf however that golden chain no longer bound that revered memory of late mr f that must be at home to morrow at past one that decree of fate be beyond recall that considered nothing so improbable a that ever walked on north west side of gray inn garden at exactly four oclock in afternoon tried at parting to give hand in frankness to existing flora not vanished flora mermaid flora wouldnt have couldnt have be wholly destitute of power of separating from bygone character left house miserably enough so much more light headed than ever that if have not be good fortune to be towed away might for first quarter of hour have drifted anywhere when began to come to in cooler air absence of flora found pancks at full speed cropping such scanty pasturage of nail a must find snorting at interval in conjunction with one hand in pocket roughened

gone in hour if moonlight ever fell upon be only to put few patch on doleful cloak make look more wretched star to be sure coldly watched when night smoke be clear enough bad weather stood by with rare fidelity must alike find rain hail frost thaw lingering in dismal enclosure when have vanished from other place a to snow must see there for week long after have changed from yellow to black slowly weeping away grimy life place have other adherent a to street noise rumbling of wheel in lane merely rushed in at gateway in going past rushed out again making listening mistress affery feel a

clennams room made greatest change that ever broke dead monotony of spot in two long narrow window fire shone sullenly day sullenly night on rare occasion flashed up passionately a did for most part be suppressed like preyed upon evenly slowly during many hour of short winter day however when be dusk there early in afternoon changing distortion of herself in wheeled chair of mr flintwinch with wry neck of mistress affery coming going must be thrown upon house wall be over gateway must hover there like shadow from great magic lantern a room ridden invalid settled for night must gradually disappear mistress afferys magnified shadow always flitting about last until finally glided away into air a though be off upon witch excursion then solitary light must burn unchangingly until burned

traveller to be on great high road have wonderful divergency only time will show whither traveller be bound on wintry afternoon at twilight mr flintwinch having be heavy day dreamed dream thought be in kitchen getting kettle ready for tea be warming with foot upon fender skirt of gown tucked up before collapsed fire in middle of grate bordered on hand by deep cold black ravine thought that a sat thus musing upon question whether life be not for people rather dull invention be frightened by sudden noise behind thought that have be similarly frightened once last week that noise be of mysterious kind sound of rustling of three four quick beat like rapid step while shock tremble be communicated to heart a if step have shaken floor even a if have be touched by awful hand thought that revived within certain old fear of hers that house be haunted that flew up kitchen stair without knowing how got up to be nearer company mistress affery thought that on reaching hall saw door of liege lord office standing open room empty that went to ripped up window in little room by street door to connect palpitating heart through glass with living thing beyond outside haunted house that then saw on wall over gateway shadow of two clever one in conversation above then went upstairs with shoe in hand partly to be near clever one a match for most ghost partly to hear what be talking about none of nonsense with said mr flintwinch wont take from mr flintwinch dreamed that stood behind door be just ajar most distinctly heard husband say bold word flintwinch returned mr clennam in usual strong low voice there be demon of anger in guard against dont care whether there one dozen said mr flintwinch forcibly suggesting in tone that higher number be nearer mark if there be fifty must say none of nonsense with wont take from id make em say whether liked not what have done wrathful man strong voice asked done said mr flintwinch dropped down upon if mean remonstrated with dont put word into mouth that dont mean said jeremiah sticking to figurative expression with tenacious impenetrable obstinacy mean dropped down upon remonstrated with began again because wont have cried jeremiah dropped down upon dropped down upon then ill conditioned man jeremiah chuckled at having forced to adopt phrase for having be needlessly significant to arthur that morning have right to complain of a almost breach of confidence did not mean have interposed contradictory jeremiah flinging back concession did mean suppose must leave to speak in soliloquy if choose replied after pause seemed angry one be useless addressing to rash headstrong old man who have set purpose not to hear now wont take that from said jeremiah have such purpose have told did mean do wish to know why meant rash headstrong old woman after only restore own word said struggling with indignation yes be why then because hadnt cleared father to ought to have done because before went into tantrum about who be hold there flintwinch cried out in changed voice may go word too far old man seemed to think so there be pause have altered position in room when spoke again more mildly be going to tell why be because before took own part thought ought to have taken part of arthur father arthur father have particular love for arthur father served arthur father uncle in house when arthur father be not much above be poorer a far a pocket went when uncle might a soon have left heir a have left starved in parlour starved in kitchen be principal difference in position there be not much more than flight of breakneck stair between never took to in time dont know that ever took to greatly at time be undecided irresolute chap who have everything orphan life scared out of when be young when brought home here wife uncle have named for didnt need to look at twice be good looking woman at time to know whod be master have stood of own strength ever since stand of own strength now dont lean against dead a call lean against dead have mind to do if have submitted growled jeremiah thats why drop down upon cant forget didnt submit suppose be astonished that must consider worth while to have justice done to arthur father hey doesnt matter whether answer not because know be know be come then ill tell how be may be bit of oddity in point of temper be temper cant let anybody have entirely own way be determined woman clever woman when see purpose before nothing will turn from who know that better than hing will turn from flintwinch when have justified to myself add justified to said be most determined woman on face of earth meant to say so if be determined to justify object entertain of course youll do man justify by authority of book cried with stern emphasis appearing from sound followed to strike dead weight of arm upon table never mind that returned jeremiah calmly wont enter into question at present however may be carry out purpose make everything go down before now wont go down before have be faithful to useful to be attached to cant consent wont consent never did consent never will consent to be lost in swallow up everybody else welcome peculiarity of temper be maam that wont be swallowed up alive perhaps have originally be mainspring of understanding between descrying thus much of force of character in mr flintwinch perhaps mr clennam have deemed alliance with worth while enough more than enough of subject said gloomily unless drop down upon again returned persistent flintwinch then must expect to hear of again mistress affery dreamed that figure of lord here began walking up down room a if to cool spleen that ran away that a did not issue forth when have stood listening trembling in shadowy little time crept up stair again impelled a before by ghost curiosity once more cowered outside door please to light candle flintwinch mr clennam be saying apparently wishing to draw back into usual tone be nearly time for tea little dorrit be coming will find in dark mr flintwinch lighted candle briskly said a put down upon table what be going to do with little dorrit be to come to work here for ever to come to tea here for ever to come backwards forward here in same way for ever how can talk about for ever to maimed creature like be not cut down like grass of field be not shorn by scythe many year ago since when have be lying here waiting to be gathered into barn ay ay since have be lying here not near dead nothing like number of child young people blooming woman strong men what not have be cut down carried still here be see not much changed after time mine may be long one yet when say for ever mean though be not poetical through time mr flintwinch gave explanation with great calmness calmly waited for answer so long a little dorrit be quiet industrious stand in need of slight help can give deserves so long suppose unless withdraws of own act will continue to come here being spared nothing more than said flintwinch stroking mouth chin what must there be more than what must there be more than that ejaculated in sternly wondering way mr flintwinch dreamed that for space of minute two remained looking at other with candle between that somehow derived impression that looked at other fixedly do happen to know mr clennam afferys liege lord then demanded in much lower voice with amount of expression seemed quite out of proportion to simple purpose of word where life must now must like to know said jeremiah with pounce a if have sprung upon if cared to know must know already must not have asked day then dont care to know mr flintwinch having expelled long significant breath said with former emphasis for have accidentally mind found out wherever life said mr clennam speaking in one unmodulated hard voice separating word a distinctly a if be reading off from separate bit of metal that took up one by one have made secret of will always keep secret from after perhaps must rather not have known fact how said jeremiah said with twist a if word have come out of in own wry shape flintwinch said mistress partner flashing into sudden energy made start why do goad look round room if be compensation for long confinement within narrow limit not that complain of being afflicted know never complain of if be compensation to for long confinement to room while be shut up from pleasant change be also shut up from knowledge of thing may prefer to avoid knowing why must of men grudge that belief dont grudge to returned jeremiah then say more say more let little dorrit keep secret from do keep from also let come go unobserved unquestioned let suffer let have what alleviation belongs to condition be so much that torment like evil spirit asked question thats have answered so say more say more here sound of wheeled chair be heard upon floor afferys bell rang with hasty jerk more afraid of husband at moment than of mysterious sound in kitchen affery crept away a lightly a quickly a must descended kitchen stair almost a rapidly a have ascended resumed seat before fire tucked up skirt again finally threw apron over head then bell rang once more then once more then kept on ringing in despite of importunate summons affery still sat behind apron recovering breath at last mr flintwinch came shuffling down staircase into hall muttering calling affery woman way affery still remaining behind apron came stumbling down kitchen stair candle in hand sidled up to twitched apron off roused oh jeremiah cried affery waking what start gave what have be doing woman inquired jeremiah youve be rung for fifty time oh jeremiah said mistress affery have be dreaming reminded of former achievement in way mr flintwinch held candle to head a if have idea of lighting up for illumination of kitchen dont know tea time demanded with vicious grin giving one of leg of mistress afferys chair kick jeremiah tea time dont know whats come to got dreadful turn jeremiah before went off dreaming think must be that yoogh sleepy head said mr flintwinch what be talking about strange noise jeremiah curious movement in kitchen here just here jeremiah held up light looked at blackened ceiling held down light looked at damp stone floor turned round with light looked about at spotted blotched wall rat cat water drain said jeremiah mistress affery negatived with shake of head jeremiah have felt before have felt up stair once on staircase a be going from room to ours in night rustle sort of trembling touch behind affery woman said mr flintwinch grimly after advancing nose to lady lip a test for detection of spirituous liquor if dont get tea pretty quick old woman youll become sensible of rustle touch thatll send flying to other end of kitchen prediction stimulated mr flintwinch to bestir to hasten up stair to mr clennams chamber for that now began to entertain settled conviction that there be something wrong in gloomy house henceforth be never at peace in after daylight departed never went up down stair in dark without having apron over head lest must see something what with ghostly apprehension singular dream mr flintwinch fell that evening into haunted state of mind from may be long before present narrative descries trace of recovery in vagueness indistinctness of new experience perception a everything about be mysterious to herself began to be mysterious to others became a difficult to be made out to anybodys satisfaction a found house everything in difficult to make out to own have not yet finished preparing mr clennams tea when soft knock came to door always announced little dorrit mistress affery looked on at little dorrit taking off homely bonnet in hall at mr flintwinch scraping jaw contemplating in silence a expecting wonderful consequence to ensue must frighten out of five wit blow three to piece after tea there came knock at door announcing arthur mistress affery went down to let in said on entering affery be glad want to ask question affery immediately replied for goodness sake dont ask nothing arthur be frightened out of one half of life dreamed out of other dont ask nothing dont know be what be what immediately started away from came near more mistress affery having taste for reading sufficient light for needlework in subdued room supposing to have inclination now sat night in dimness from have momentarily emerged on evening of arthur clennams return occupied with crowd of wild speculation suspicion respecting mistress husband noise in house when ferocious devotional exercise be engaged in speculation must distract mistress afferys eye towards door a if expected dark form to appear at propitious moment make party one too many otherwise affery never said did anything to attract attention of two clever one towards in marked degree except on certain occasion generally at about quiet hour towards bed time when must suddenly dart out of dim corner whisper with face of terror to mr flintwinch reading paper near mr clennams little table there jeremiah now

mr meagles a much satisfaction a barnacle genealogy have done cloud clennam have never seen upon face before morning frequently overcast again there be same shadow of uneasy observation of on comely face of wife more than once twice when pet caressed dog appeared to clennam that father be unhappy in seeing do in one particular instance when gowan stood on other side of dog bent head at same time arthur fancied that saw tear rise to mr meagless eye a hurried out of room be fact too fancied further that pet be not insensible to little incident that tried with more delicate affection than usual

entirely preoccupied that although lover stood quiet for what thought be long time twice thrice retired came back again to former spot still did not move so in end made up mind to go on seem to come upon casually in passing speak to place be quiet now never be time to speak to walked on did not appear to hear step until be close upon when said miss dorrit started fell back from with expression in

to disparage station above thing to divest of idea that supposed hers to be superior gave little comfort miss amy then stammered have have for long time age seem to revolving age heart cherished wish to say something to may say little dorrit involuntarily started from side again with faintest shadow of former look conquering that went on at great speed half across bridge without replying may miss

unusual apparition be followed by bonnet then perceived that first bonnet be on head of mr f aunt that second bonnet be on head of flora who seemed to have propelled legacy up steep ascent with considerable difficulty though not altogether enraptured at sight of visitor clennam lost time in opening counting house door extricating from workshop rescue be rendered more necessary by mr f aunt already stumbling over impediment menacing steam power a institution with stony reticule carried good gracious arthur must say mr clennam far more proper climb have have to get up here how ever to get down again without fire escape mr f aunt slipping through step bruised over in machinery foundry way too only think never told thus flora out of breath meanwhile mr f aunt rubbed esteemed instep with umbrella vindictively glared most unkind never to have come back to see since day though naturally be not to be expected that there must be attraction at house be much more pleasantly engaged thats pretty certain be fair dark blue eye black wonder not that expect that must be anything perfect contrast to in particular for be disappointment a very well know be quite right to be devoted doubt though what be saying arthur never mind hardly know good gracious by time have placed chair for in counting house a flora dropped into hers bestowed old look upon to think of doyce clennam who doyce can be said flora delightful man doubt married perhaps perhaps daughter now have really then one understands partnership see dont tell anything about for know have claim to ask question golden chain that once be forged being snapped very proper flora put hand tenderly on gave of youthful glance dear arthur force of habit mr clennam way more delicate adapted to existing circumstance must beg to be excused for taking liberty of intrusion thought might so far presume upon old time for ever faded never more to bloom a to call with mr f aunt to congratulate offer best wish great deal superior to china not to be denied much nearer though higher up be very happy to see said clennam thank flora very much for kind remembrance more than can say at rate returned flora for might have be dead buried twenty distinct time over doubt must have be before have genuinely remembered anything like in spite of one last remark wish to make one last explanation wish to offer dear mr finching arthur remonstrated in alarm oh not that disagreeable name say flora flora be worth troubling afresh to enter into explanation assure none be needed be satisfied be perfectly satisfied diversion be occasioned here by mr f aunt making following inexorable awful statement there mile stone on dover road with such mortal hostility towards human race did discharge missile that clennam be quite at loss how to defend rather a have be already perplexed in mind by honour of visit from venerable lady when be plain held in utmost abhorrence must not look at with disconcertment a sat breathing bitterness scorn staring league away flora however received remark a if have be of most apposite agreeable nature approvingly observing aloud mr f aunt have great deal of spirit stimulated either by compliment by burning indignation that illustrious woman then added let meet if can with rigid movement of stony reticule appendage of great size of fossil appearance indicated that clennam be unfortunate person at whom challenge be hurled one last remark resumed flora be going to say wish to make one last explanation wish to offer mr f aunt must not have intruded on business hour mr f having be in business though wine trade still business be equally business call what will business habit be just same a witness mr f who have slipper always on mat at ten minute before six in afternoon boot inside fender at ten minute before eight in morning to moment in weather light dark must not therefore have intruded without motive being kindly meant may be hoped will be kindly taken

mr clennam until word be out such be habit of time for ever fled so true be that oft in stilly night ere slumber chain have bound people fond memory brings light of other day around people very polite more polite than true be afraid for to go into machinery business without so much a sending line card to papa dont say though there be time be past stern reality have now gracious never mind doe not look like must confess even flora comma seemed to have fled on occasion be so much more disjointed voluble than in preceding interview though indeed hurried on nothing else be to be expected why must be expected if not to be expected why must be be far from blaming one when mama papa worried to death severed golden bowl mean bond dare say know what mean if dont dont lose much care just a little will venture to add when severed golden bond bound threw into fit of cry on sofa nearly choked at least everything be changed in giving hand to mr f know did so with eye open be so very unsettled in such low spirit that have distractedly alluded to river if not oil of something from chemist did for best good flora settled that before be quite right perfectly clear think so returned flora for take very coolly if hadnt known to be china must have guessed polar region dear mr clennam be right however can not blame a to doyce clennam papa property being about here heard from pancks for never must have heard one word about be satisfied dont say that what nonsense not to say arthur doyce clennam easier le trying to than mr clennam when know know too cant deny do deny must soon have made friendly visit ah said flora tossing head dare say gave of old look however when pancks told made up mind that mr f aunt must come call because when papa be before happened to mention name to to say that be interested in said at moment good gracious why not have here then when there anything to do instead of putting out when say observed clennam by time pretty well bewildered do mean mr f goodness arthur doyce clennam really easier to with old remembrance who ever heard of mr f aunt doing needlework going out by day going out by day do speak of little dorrit why yes of course returned flora of strangest name ever heard strangest like place down in country with turnpike favourite pony puppy bird something from seed shop to be put in garden flower pot come up speckled then flora said arthur with sudden interest in conversation mr casby be so kind a to mention little dorrit to be what did say oh know what papa be rejoined flora how aggravatingly sits looking beautiful turning thumb over over one till make one giddy if one keep one eye upon said when be talking of dont know who began subject arthur doyce clennam be sure wasnt at least hope not really must excuse confessing more on point certainly said arthur by mean be very ready pouted flora coming to sudden stop in captivating bashfulness must admit papa said have spoken of in earnest way said what have told thats thats said arthur little disappointed except when pancks told of having embarked in business with difficulty persuaded that be really said to mr f aunt then must come ask if must be agreeable to party that must be engaged at house when required for know often go to mama know mama have very touchy temper arthur doyce clennam never might have married mr f might have be at hour be running into nonsense be very kind of flora to think of poor flora rejoined with plain sincerity became better than youngest glance that be glad thought so said with so much heart that clennam must have given great deal to buy old character of on spot throw mermaid away for ever think flora said that employment can give little dorrit kindness can show yes will said flora quickly be sure of will be great assistance support to feel have right to tell know of for acquired knowledge confidentially under circumstance bind to silence have interest in little creature respect for can not express to life have be one of such trial devotion such quiet goodness a can scarcely imagine can hardly think of far le speak of without feeling moved let that feeling represent what must tell commit to friendliness with thanks once more put out hand frankly to poor flora once more poor flora couldnt accept frankly found worth nothing openly must make old intrigue mystery of a much to own enjoyment a to dismay covered with corner of shawl a took then looking towards glass front of counting house seeing two figure approaching cried with infinite relish papa hush arthur for mercy sake tottered back to chair with amazing imitation of being in danger of swooning in dread surprise maidenly flutter of spirit patriarch meanwhile came inanely beaming towards counting house in wake of pancks pancks opened door for towed in retired to own mooring in corner heard from flora said patriarch with benevolent smile that be coming to call coming to call being out thought id come also thought id come also benign wisdom infused into declaration not of profound by mean of blue eye shining head long white hair be most impressive seemed worth putting down among noblest sentiment enunciated by best of men also when said to clennam seating in proffered chair be in new business mr clennam wish well sir wish well seemed to have done benevolent wonder mr finching have be telling sir said arthur after making acknowledgment relict of late mr f meanwhile protesting with gesture against use of respectable name that hope occasionally to employ young needlewoman recommended to mother for have be thanking patriarch turning head in lumbering way towards pancks that assistant put up note book in have be absorbed took in tow didnt recommend know said pancks how must knew nothing about didnt name be mentioned to passed on thats what did well said clennam a justifies recommendation be much same thing be glad turn out well said pancks have be fault if have turned out ill credit not yours a be blame have be yours a might have be gave guarantee knew nothing about be not acquainted then said arthur hazarding random question with of family acquainted with of family returned pancks how must be acquainted with of family never

in general way what being reference mean eye be look at tenant down yard here theyd be reference for one if youd let em what must be good of letting satisfaction to be done by two men instead of one one enough person who cant pay get person who cant pay to guarantee that can pay like person with two wooden leg getting person with two wooden leg to guarantee that have got two natural leg dont make of able to do walking match four wooden leg be more troublesome to than two when dont want mr pancks concluded by blowing off steam of momentary silence that ensued be broken by mr f aunt who have be sitting upright in cataleptic state since last public remark now underwent violent twitch calculated to produce startling effect on nerve of uninitiated with deadliest animosity observed cant make head brain out of brass knob with nothing in couldnt do when uncle george be living much le when he dead mr pancks be not slow to reply with usual calmness indeed maam bless soul im surprised to hear despite presence of mind however speech of mr f aunt produced depressing effect on little assembly firstly because be impossible to disguise clennams unoffending head be particular temple of reason depreciated secondly because nobody ever knew on occasion whose uncle george be referred to what spectral presence might be invoked under appellation therefore flora said though still not without certain boastfulness triumph in legacy that mr f aunt be very lively to day thought have better go mr f aunt proved so lively a to take suggestion in unexpected dudgeon declare that must not go adding with several injurious expression that if too evidently meaning clennam wanted to get rid of let chuck out of winder urgently expressing desire to see perform ceremony in dilemma mr pancks whose resource appeared equal to emergency in patriarchal water slipped on hat slipped out at counting house door slipped in again moment afterwards with artificial freshness upon a if have be in country for week why bless heart maam said mr pancks rubbing up hair in great astonishment be that how do do maam be looking charming to day be delighted to see favour with arm maam well have little walk together if youll with company so escorted mr f aunt down private staircase of counting house with great gallantry success patriarchal mr casby then rose with air of having done blandly followed leaving daughter a followed in turn to remark to former lover in distracted whisper very much enjoyed that have drained cup of life to dreg further to hint mysteriously that late mr f be at bottom of alone again clennam became prey to old doubt in reference to mother little dorrit revolved old thought suspicion be in mind blending with duty be mechanically discharging when shadow on paper caused to look up for cause cause be mr pancks with hat thrown back upon ear a if wiry prong of hair have darted up like spring cast off with jet black bead of eye inquisitively sharp with finger of right hand in mouth that might bite nail with finger of left hand in reserve in pocket for course mr pancks cast shadow through glass upon book paper mr pancks asked with little inquiring twist of head if might come in again clennam replied with nod of head in affirmative mr pancks worked way in came alongside desk made fast by leaning arm upon started conversation with puff snort mr f aunt be appeased hope said clennam right sir said pancks be so unfortunate a to have awakened strong animosity in breast of lady said clennam do know why doe know why said pancks suppose not suppose not said pancks took out note book opened shut dropped into hat be beside on desk looked in at a lay at bottom of hat with great appearance of consideration mr clennam then began be in want of information sir connected with firm asked clennam said pancks with what then mr pancks be to say assuming that want of yes sir yes want of said pancks if can persuade to furnish b c d da de di do dictionary order dorrit thats name sir mr pancks blew off peculiar noise again fell to at right hand nail arthur looked searchingly at returned look dont understand mr pancks thats name want to know about what do want

with object to may be extraordinary together returned pancks may be out of ordinary course yet be business in short be business be man of business what business have in present world except to stick to business business with former doubt whether dry hard personage be quite in earnest clennam again turned eye attentively upon face be a scrubby dingy a ever a eager quick a ever must see nothing lurking in be at expressive of latent mockery have seemed to strike upon ear in voice now said pancks to put business on own footing not proprietor do refer to mr casby a proprietor pancks nodded proprietor put case say at proprietor hear name name of young person mr clennam want to serve say name first mentioned to proprietor by plornish in yard say go to plornish say ask plornish a matter of

with prong of hair sticking up over head breath coming going very hard short busy pancks fell back step in tug metaphor took turn astern a if to show dingy hull complete then forged head again directed quick glance by turn into hat where note book be into clennams face mr pancks not to trespass on ground of mystery will be a plain with a can let ask two question first right said pancks holding up dirty forefinger with broken nail see whats motive exactly motive said pancks good nothing to do with proprietor not stateable at present ridiculous to state at present good desiring to serve young person name of dorrit said pancks with forefinger still up a caution better admit motive to be good secondly lastly what do want to know mr pancks fished up note book before question be put buttoning with care in inner breast pocket looking straight at clennam time replied with pause puff want supplementary information of sort clennam must not withhold smile a panting little steam tug so useful to unwieldy ship casby waited on watched a if be seeking opportunity of running in rifling of wanted before must resist manoeuvre though there be that in mr panckss eagerness too awakened many wondering speculation in mind after little consideration resolved to supply mr pancks with such leading information a be in power to impart well knowing that mr pancks if failed in present research be pretty sure to find other mean of getting therefore first requesting mr pancks to remember voluntary declaration that proprietor have part in disclosure that own intention be good two declaration coaly little gentleman with greatest ardour repeated openly told that a to dorrit lineage former place of habitation have information to communicate that knowledge of family did not extend beyond fact that appeared to be now reduced to five member namely to two brother of whom one be single one widower with three child age of whole family made known to mr pancks a nearly a must guess at finally described to position of father of marshalsea course of time event through have become invested with character to mr pancks snorting blowing in more more portentous manner a became more interested listened with great attention appearing to derive most agreeable sensation from painfullest part of narrative particularly to be quite charmed by account of william dorrits long imprisonment in conclusion mr pancks said arthur have to say have reason beyond personal regard for speaking a little a can of dorrit family particularly at mother house mr pancks nodded for knowing a much a can so devoted man of business a be eh for mr pancks have suddenly made that blowing effort with unusual force nothing said pancks so devoted man of business a have perfect understanding of fair bargain wish to make fair bargain with that will enlighten concerning dorrit family when have in power a have enlightened may not give very flattering idea of business habit failed to make term beforehand continued clennam prefer to make point of honour have seen so much business done on sharp principle to tell truth mr pancks be tired of mr pancks laughed bargain sir said will find stick to after that stood little while looking at clennam biting ten nail round evidently while fixed in mind what have be told went over carefully before mean of supplying gap in memory must be no longer at

demanding own arrears rooting to spot throughout remainder of day mr panckss be up to what did mean by sounded over yard mr pancks wouldnt hear of excuse wouldnt hear of complaint wouldnt hear of repair wouldnt hear of anything unconditional money down perspiring puffing darting about in eccentric direction becoming hotter dingier moment lashed tide of yard into most agitated turbid state have not settled down into calm water again full two hour after have be seen fuming away on horizon at top of step there be several small assemblage of bleeding heart at popular point of meeting in yard night among whom be universally agreed that mr pancks be hard man to have to do with that be much to be regretted so be that gentleman like mr casby must put rent in hand never know in true light for said bleeding heart if gentleman with head of hair eye took rent into own hand maam there must be none of worriting wearing thing must be very different at identical evening hour minute patriarch who have floated serenely through yard in forenoon before harrying began with express design of getting up trustfulness in shining bump silken lock at identical hour minute that first rate humbug of

opened room door for readmission followed in with such exceedingly bald pretence of not having be out at that father might have observed without being very suspicious in affable unconsciousness however took heed plornish after little conversation in blended former duty a collegian with present privilege a humble outside friend qualified again by low estate a plasterer took leave making tour of prison before left looking on at game of skittle with mixed feeling of old inhabitant who have private reason for believing that might be destiny to come back again early in morning little dorrit

be quite attached to dog observed clennam quite so assented partner more attached to dog than be to man mean mr mean mr gowan most decidedly said daniel doyce there be gap in conversation clennam devoted to winding up watch perhaps be little hasty in judgment said judgment be supposing general case of course said doyce be so liable to be influenced by many consideration almost without knowing be unfair that be necessary to keep guard upon for instance mr gowan quietly said doyce upon whom utterance of name almost always devolved be young handsome easy quick have talent have seen good deal of various kind of life might be difficult to give unselfish reason for being prepossessed against not difficult for think clennam returned partner see bringing present anxiety fear future sorrow into old friend house see wearing deeper line into old friend face nearer draw to oftener look at face of daughter in short see with net about pretty affectionate creature whom will never make happy dont know said clennam almost in tone of man in pain that will not make happy dont know returned partner that earth will last hundred year think highly probable well well said clennam must be hopeful must at least try to be if not generous in case have opportunity of being just will not disparage gentleman because be successful in address to beautiful object of ambition will not question natural right to bestow love on one whom find worthy of maybe friend said doyce maybe also that be too young petted too confiding inexperienced to discriminate well that said clennam must be far beyond power of correction daniel doyce shook head gravely rejoined fear so therefore in word said clennam must make up mind that be not worthy of to say ill of mr gowan must be poor thing to gratify prejudice against resolve for part not to depreciate be not quite so sure of myself therefore reserve privilege of objecting to returned other if be not sure of be sure of clennam know what upright man be how much to be respected good night friend partner shook hand in saying a if there have be something serious at bottom of conversation separated by time have visited family on several occasion have always observed that even passing allusion to mr henry gowan when be not among brought back cloud have obscured mr meagless sunshine on morning of chance encounter at ferry if clennam have ever admitted forbidden passion into breast period might have be period of real trial under actual circumstance doubtless be nothing nothing equally if heart have given entertainment to prohibited guest silent fighting of way through mental condition of period might have be little meritorious in constant effort not to be betrayed into new phase of besetting sin of experience pursuit of selfish object by low small mean to hold instead to high principle of honour generosity there might have be little merit in resolution not even to avoid mr meagless house lest in selfish sparing of must bring slight distress upon daughter through making cause of estrangement believed father must regret there might have be little merit in modest truthfulness of always keeping in view greater equality of mr gowans year greater attraction of person manner there might have be little merit in doing much more in perfectly unaffected way with manful composed constancy while pain within peculiar a life history be very sharp there might have be quiet strength of character after resolution have made of course must have such merit a state of mind be nobody nobody mr gowan made concern of whether be nobody somebody preserved perfect serenity of manner on occasion a if possibility of clennams presuming to have debated great question be too distant ridiculous to be imagined have always affability to bestow on clennam ease to treat with might of in supposititious case of not having taken that sagacious course have be very uncomfortable element in state of mind quite regret be not with yesterday

be finest creature said gowan so fresh so green trust in such wonderful thing here be one of many little rough point have tendency to grate on clennams hearing put aside by merely repeating that have high regard for mr doyce be charming to see mooning along to time of life laying down nothing by way picking up nothing by way be delightful warms man so unspoilt so simple such good soul upon life mr clennam one feel desperately worldly wicked in comparison with innocent creature speak for let add without including be genuine also thank for compliment said clennam ill at ease be too hope so so

gowan laughing afresh be darling fellow even poor little clarence born idiot of family be most agreeable most endearing blockhead by jupiter with kind of cleverness in too must astonish must very much

everybody everything still will probably not be in time school for gentleman very dangerous unsatisfactory expensive school to people who pay to keep pupil there be afraid said clennam shaking head ah be terrible fellow returned gowan airily can understand how have frightened that little donkey clarence most estimable of moon calf really love nearly out of wit enough of of rest of want to present to mother mr clennam pray do favour to give opportunity in nobody state of mind there be nothing clennam must have desired le must have be more at loss how to avoid mother life in most primitive manner down in dreary red brick dungeon at hampton court said gowan if must make own appointment suggest own day for permitting to take there to dinner must be bored must be charmed really thats state of case what must clennam say after retiring character included great deal be simple in best sense because unpractised unused in simplicity modesty must only say that be happy to place at mr gowans

of injury perhaps of little straitness irregularity in matter of wage have grown neglectful of person morose in mind now beholding in clennam one of degraded body of oppressor received with ignominy

gentle melancholy upon occasioned by son being reduced to court swinish public a follower of low art instead of asserting birthright putting ring through nose a acknowledged barnacle headed conversation at dinner on evil day be then that clennam learned for first time what little pivot great world go round upon if john barnacle said mr gowan after degeneracy of time have be fully ascertained if john barnacle have abandoned most unfortunate idea of conciliating mob must have be well think country must have be preserved old lady with high nose assented added that if augustus stiltstalking have in general way ordered cavalry out with instruction to charge thought country must have be preserved noble refrigerator assented added that if william barnacle tudor stiltstalking when came over to one formed ever memorable coalition have boldly muzzled newspaper rendered penal for editor person to presume to discus conduct of appointed authority abroad at home thought country must have be preserved be agreed that country word for barnacle stiltstalkings wanted preserving how came to want preserving be not so clear be only clear that question be about john barnacle augustus stiltstalking william barnacle tudor stiltstalking tom dick harry barnacle stiltstalking because there be nobody else mob be feature of conversation impressed clennam a man not used to very disagreeably making doubt if be quite right to sit there silently hearing great nation narrowed to such little bound remembering however that in parliamentary debate whether on life of nation body life of soul question be usually about between john barnacle augustus stiltstalking william barnacle tudor stiltstalking tom dick harry barnacle stiltstalking nobody else said nothing on part of mob bethinking that mob be used to mr henry gowan seemed to have malicious pleasure in playing off three talker against other in seeing clennam startled by what said having a supreme contempt for class have thrown off a for class have not taken on have personal disquiet in anything that passed healthy state of mind appeared even to derive gratification from clennams position of embarrassment isolation among good company if clennam have be in condition with nobody be incessantly contending must have suspected must have struggled with suspicion a meanness even while sat at table in course of couple of hour noble refrigerator at time le than hundred year behind period got about five century in arrears delivered solemn political oracle appropriate to epoch finished by freezing cup of tea for own drinking retiring at lowest temperature then mr gowan who have be accustomed in day of vacant arm chair beside to to summon state to retain devoted slave one by one for short audience a mark of especial favour invited clennam with turn of fan to approach presence obeyed took tripod recently vacated by lord lancaster stiltstalking mr clennam said mr gowan apart from happiness have in becoming known to though in odiously inconvenient place mere barrack there be subject on be dying to speak to be subject in connection with son first have believe pleasure of cultivating acquaintance clennam inclined head a generally suitable reply to what did not yet quite understand first said mr gowan now be really pretty in nobody difficulty must have found very difficult to answer very difficult indeed to smile say who oh know returned flame of henry unfortunate fancy there if be point of honour must originate name miss mickle miggles miss meagles said clennam be very beautiful men be so often mistaken on point returned mr gowan shaking head that candidly confess to feel anything sure of even now though be something to have henry corroborated with so much gravity emphasis picked people up at rome think phrase must have given nobody mortal offence clennam replied excuse doubt if understand expression picked people up said mr gowan tapping stick of closed fan large green one used a hand screen on little table came upon found out stumbled against people yes miggles people really can not say said clennam where friend mr meagles first presented mr henry gowan to daughter be pretty sure picked up at rome never mind where somewhere now be entirely between be very plebeian really maam returned clennam be so undoubtedly plebeian myself feel qualified to judge very neat said mr gowan coolly unfurling screen very happy from infer that secretly think manner equal to look clennam after moment stiffness bowed thats comforting hope may be right did henry tell have travelled with travelled with friend mr meagles wife daughter during month nobody heart might have be wrung by remembrance really comforting because must have have large experience of see mr clennam thing have be going on for long time find improvement in therefore to have opportunity of speaking to one so well informed about a be immense relief to quite boon quite blessing be sure pardon returned clennam be not in mr henry gowans confidence be far from being so well informed a suppose to be mistake make position very delicate one word on topic have ever passed between mr henry gowan mr gowan glanced at other end of room where son be playing ecarte on sofa with old lady who be for charge of cavalry not in confidence said mr gowan word have passed between can imagine there be unexpressed confidence mr clennam a have be together intimately among people can not doubt that confidence of sort exists in present case perhaps have heard have suffered keenest distress of mind from henry having taken to pursuit well shrugging shoulder very respectable pursuit dare say artist be a artist quite superior person still never yet in family have gone beyond amateur be pardonable weakness to feel little a mr gowan broke off to heave sigh clennam however resolute to be magnanimous must not keep down thought that there be mighty little danger of family ever going beyond amateur even a be henry mother resumed be self willed resolute a people naturally strain nerve to catch can entertain very little hope mr clennam that thing will be broken off apprehend girl fortune will be very small henry might have done much better there be scarcely anything to compensate for connection still act for if find improvement within short time see other course than to resign make best of people be infinitely obliged to for what have told a shrugged shoulder clennam stiffly bowed again with uneasy flush upon face hesitation in manner then said in still lower tone than have adopted yet mr gowan scarcely know how to acquit of what feel to be duty yet must ask for kind consideration in attempting to discharge misconception on part very great misconception if may venture to call so seems to require setting right have supposed mr meagles family to strain nerve think said nerve repeated mr gowan looking at in calm obstinacy with green fan between face fire to secure mr henry gowan lady placidly assented now be so far said arthur from being case know mr meagles to be unhappy in matter to have interposed reasonable obstacle with hope of putting end to mr gowan shut up great green fan tapped on arm with tapped smiling lip why of course said just what mean arthur watched face for explanation of what did mean be really serious mr clennam dont see arthur did not see said so why dont know son dont know that be exactly way to hold said mr gowan contemptuously miggles people know at least a well a oh shrewd people mr clennam evidently people of business believe miggles belonged to bank ought to have be very profitable bank if have much to do with management be very well done indeed beg entreat maam arthur interposed oh mr clennam can really be so credulous made painful impression upon to hear talking in haughty tone to see patting contemptuous lip with fan that said very earnestly believe maam be unjust perfectly groundless suspicion suspicion repeated mr gowan not suspicion mr clennam certainty be very knowingly done indeed seems to have taken in completely laughed again sat tapping lip with fan tossing head a if added dont tell know such people will do anything for honour of such alliance at opportune moment card be thrown up mr henry gowan came across room saying mother if can spare mr clennam for time have long way to go getting late mr clennam thereupon rose a have choice to do mr gowan showed to last same look same tapped contemptuous lip have have portentously long audience of mother said gowan a door closed upon fervently hope have not bored not at said clennam have little open phaeton for journey be soon in on road home gowan driving lighted cigar clennam declined one do what must fell into mood of abstraction that gowan said again be very much afraid mother have bored to roused to answer not at soon relapsed again in state of mind rendered nobody uneasy thoughtfulness must have turned principally on man at side must have thought of morning when first saw rooting out stone with heel must have asked doe jerk out of path in same careless cruel way must have thought have introduction to mother be brought about by because knew what must say that must thus place position before rival loftily warn off without reposing word of confidence in must have thought even if there be such design a have brought there to play with repressed emotion torment current of meditation must have be stayed sometimes by rush of shame bearing remonstrance to from own open nature representing that to shelter such suspicion even for passing moment be not to hold high unenvious course have resolved to keep at time striving within must have be hardest looking up catching gowans eye must have started a if have done injury then looking at dark road uncertain object must have gradually trailed off again into thinking where be driving wonder on darker road of life how will be with with in obscure distance thinking of must have be troubled anew with reproachful misgiving that be not even loyal to to dislike that in being so easily prejudiced against be le deserving of than at first be evidently out of spirit said gowan be very much afraid mother must have bored dreadfully believe not at said clennam nothing nothing chapter five twenty frequently recurring doubt whether mr panckss desire to collect information relative to dorrit family must have possible bearing on misgiving have imparted to mother on return from long exile caused arthur clennam much uneasiness at period what mr pancks already knew about dorrit family what more really wanted to find out why must trouble busy head about at be question often perplexed mr pancks be not man to waste time trouble in research prompted by idle curiosity that have specific object clennam must not doubt whether attainment of object by mr panckss industry might bring to light in untimely way secret reason have induced mother to take little dorrit by hand be serious speculation not that ever wavered in desire determination to repair wrong have be done in father time must wrong come to light be reparable shadow of supposed act of injustice have hung over since father death be so vague

duty on earth restitution on earth action on earth first a first steep step upward strait be gate narrow be way far straiter narrower than broad high road paved with vain profession vain repetition mote from other men eye liberal delivery of others to judgment cheap material costing absolutely nothing be not selfish fear hesitation rendered uneasy mistrust lest pancks might not observe part of understanding between making discovery might take course upon without imparting to on other hand when recalled conversation with pancks little reason have to suppose that there be likelihood of strange personage being on track at there be time when wondered that made so much of labouring in sea a bark labour in cross sea tossed about came to haven removal of little dorrit from customary association did not mend matter be so much out so much in own room that began to miss to find blank in place have written to to inquire if be better have written back very gratefully earnestly telling

rather trying to people who look on to mere outsider know clennam still pet happiness unhappiness be quite life death question with may be excused hope for making much of at event might have be borne by tattycoram now dont think so do indeed think so returned clennam in most emphatic recognition of very moderate expectation sir said mr meagles shaking head ruefully couldnt stand chafing firing of

of cold mountain sitting perishing in frost with people unless know something about beforehand not very hard to divine whose friend mr gowan be whose friend inquired father pa be sorry to say returned miss fanny who have by time succeeded in goading into state of much ill usage grievance be often at great pain to do believe to be friend of very objectionable unpleasant person who with total absence of delicacy experience might have led to expect from insulted outraged feeling in so public wilful manner on occasion to be understood among that will not more pointedly allude amy child said mr

sun saw at calais having now got channel between john chivery began to feel safe to find that foreign air be lighter to breathe than air of england on again by heavy french road for paris having now quite recovered equanimity mr dorrit in snug corner fell to castle building a rode along be evident that have very large castle in hand day long be running tower up taking tower down adding wing here putting on battlement there looking to wall strengthening defence giving ornamental touch to interior making in respect superb castle of preoccupied face so clearly denoted pursuit in be engaged that

countryman le brun must have known though have made that english traveller subject of special physiognomical treatise arrived at paris resting there three day mr dorrit strolled much about street alone looking in at shop window particularly jeweller window ultimately went into most famous jeweller said wanted to buy little gift for lady be charming little woman to whom said sprightly little woman dressed in perfect taste who came out of green velvet bower to attend upon from posting up dainty little book of account one must hardly suppose to be ruled for entry of article more commercial than kiss at dainty little shining desk looked in like sweetmeat for example then said little woman what specie of gift did monsieur desire love gift mr dorrit smiled said eh well perhaps what did know be always possible sex being so charming must show most willingly said little woman flattered enchanted to show many pardon to begin with must have great goodness to observe that there be love gift there be nuptial gift for example ravishing ear ring necklace so superb to correspond be what one called love gift brooch ring of beauty so gracious celestial be what one called with permission of monsieur nuptial gift perhaps must be good arrangement mr dorrit hinted smiling to purchase to present love gift first to finish with nuptial offering ah heaven said little woman laying tip of finger of two little hand against other must be generous indeed must be special gallantry without doubt lady so crushed with gift must find irresistible mr dorrit be not sure of for example sprightly little woman be very sure of said so mr dorrit bought gift of sort paid handsomely for a strolled back to hotel afterwards carried head high having plainly got up castle now to much loftier altitude

be later than most traveller must like to be for finding outside wall of rome when mr dorrits carriage still on last wearisome stage rattled over solitary campagna savage herdsman fierce looking peasant who have chequered way while light lasted have gone down with sun left wilderness blank at turn of road pale flare on horizon like exhalation from ruin sown land showed that city be yet far off poor relief be rare short lived carriage dipped down again into hollow of black dry sea for long time there be nothing visible save petrified swell gloomy sky mr dorrit though have castle building to engage mind must not be quite easy in desolate place be far more curious in swerve of carriage cry of postilion than have be since quitted valet on box evidently quaked courier in rumble be not altogether comfortable in mind a often a mr dorrit let down glass looked back at be very often saw smoking john chivery out be true still generally standing up while looking about like man who have

procession came mechanically chaunting by with indistinct show of dirty vestment lurid torch swinging censer great cross borne before priest be ugly priest by torchlight of lowering aspect with overhanging brow a eye met of mr dorrit looking bareheaded out of carriage lip moving a chaunted seemed to threaten important traveller likewise action of hand be in fact manner of returning traveller salutation seemed to come in aid of menace so thought mr dorrit made fanciful by weariness of building travelling a priest drifted past procession straggled away taking dead along with upon so different way went mr dorrits company too soon with coach load of luxury from two great capital of europe be like goth reversed beating at gate of rome mr dorrit be not expected by own people night

endeavoured with might to rid of that must not fly from assurance now have that blandois whatever right name be one of worst of character greatly augmented burden of anxiety though disappearance must be accounted for to morrow fact that mother have be in communication with man must remain unalterable that communication have be of secret kind that have be submissive to afraid of hoped might be known to one beyond yet knowing how must separate from old vague fear how believe that there be nothing evil in such relation resolution not to enter on question with knowledge of indomitable character enhanced sense of helplessness be like oppression of dream to believe that shame exposure be impending over father memory to be shut out a by brazen wall from possibility of coming to aid

than did when turned unyielding face to in gloomy room light of day discovery shining on consideration roused to take more decided course of action confident in rectitude of purpose impelled by sense of overhanging danger closing in around resolved if mother must still admit of approach to make desperate appeal to affery if must be brought to become communicative to do what lay in to break spell of secrecy enshrouded house might shake off paralysis of hour passed over head made more acutely sensible be result of day anxiety be decision put in practice when day closed in first disappointment on arriving at house be to find door open mr flintwinch smoking pipe on step if circumstance have be commonly favourable mistress affery must have opened door to knock circumstance being uncommonly unfavourable door stood open mr flintwinch be smoking pipe on step good evening said arthur good evening said mr flintwinch smoke came crookedly out of mr flintwinchs mouth a if circulated through whole of wry figure came back by wry throat before coming forth to mingle with smoke from crooked chimney mist from crooked river have news said arthur have news said jeremiah mean of foreign man arthur explained mean of foreign man said jeremiah looked so grim a stood askew with knot of cravat under ear that thought passed into clennams mind not for first time by many must flintwinch for purpose of own have got rid of blandois must have be secret safety be at issue be small bent perhaps not actively strong yet be a tough a old yew tree a crusty a old jackdaw man coming behind much younger more vigorous man having will to put end to relenting might do pretty surely in solitary place at late hour while in morbid condition of thought thought drifted over main one be always in clennams mind mr flintwinch regarding opposite house over gateway with neck twisted one eye shut up stood smoking with vicious expression upon more a if be trying to bite off stem of pipe than a if be enjoying yet be enjoying in own way youll be able to take likeness next time call arthur must think said mr flintwinch drily a stooped to knock ash out rather conscious confused arthur asked pardon if have stared at unpolitely mind run so much upon matter said that lose hah yet dont see returned mr flintwinch quite at leisure why must trouble arthur said mr flintwinch very shortly decidedly much a if be of canine race snapped at arthur hand be nothing to see placard about be nothing to to see mother name residence hawked up down in such association dont see returned mr flintwinch scraping horny cheek that need signify much to ill tell do see arthur glancing up at window see light of fire candle in mother room have to do with why sir read by said mr flintwinch screwing at that if advisable a proverb say be to let sleeping dog lie just a advisable perhaps to let missing dog lie let em be generally turn up soon enough mr flintwinch turned short round when have made remark went into dark hall clennam stood there following with eye a dipped for light in phosphorus box in little room at side got one after three four dip lighted dim lamp against wall while clennam be pursuing probability rather a if be being shown to by invisible hand than a if be conjuring up of mr flintwinchs way mean of doing darker deed removing trace by of black avenue of shadow that lay around now sir said testy jeremiah will be agreeable to walk up stair mother be alone suppose not alone said mr flintwinch mr casby daughter be with came in while be smoking stayed behind to have smoke out be second disappointment arthur made remark upon repaired to mother room where mr casby flora have be taking tea anchovy paste hot buttered toast relic of delicacy be not yet removed either from table from scorched countenance of affery who with kitchen toasting fork still in hand looked like sort of allegorical personage except have considerable advantage over general run of such personage in point of significant emblematical purpose flora have spread bonnet shawl upon bed with care indicative of intention to stay time mr casby too be beaming near hob with benevolent knob shining a if warm butter of toast be exuding through patriarchal skull with face a ruddy a if colouring matter of anchovy paste be mantling in patriarchal visage seeing a exchanged usual salutation clennam decided to speak to mother without postponement have long be customary a never changed room for who have anything to say to apart to wheel to desk where sat usually with back of chair turned towards rest of room person who talked with seated in corner on stool be always set in place for purpose except that be long since mother son have spoken together without intervention of third person be ordinary matter of course within experience of visitor for mr clennam to be asked with word of apology for interruption if must be spoken with on matter of business on replying in affirmative to be wheeled into position described therefore when arthur now made such apology request moved to desk seated on stool mr finching merely began to talk louder faster a delicate hint that must overhear nothing mr casby stroked long white lock with sleepy calmness mother have heard something to day feel persuaded dont know think must know of antecedent of man saw here know nothing of antecedent of man saw here arthur spoke aloud have lowered own voice rejected that advance towards confidence a rejected other spoke in usual key in usual stern voice have received on circuitous information have come to direct asked exactly a before if be there to tell what be thought right that must know what be have be prisoner in french gaol answered with composure must think that very likely in gaol for criminal mother on accusation of murder started at word look expressed natural horror yet still spoke aloud when demanded who told so man who be fellow prisoner that man antecedent suppose be not known to before told though man be yes case flintwinchs in respect of other man dare say resemblance be not so exact though a informant became known to through letter from correspondent with whom have deposited money how doe that part of parallel stand arthur have choice to say that informant have not become known to through agency of such credential indeed of credential at mr clennams attentive frown expanded by degree into severe look of triumph retorted with emphasis take care how judge others then say to arthur for good take care how judge emphasis have be derived from eye quite a much a from stress laid upon word continued to look at if when entered house have have latent hope of prevailing in least with now looked out of heart mother will hing to assist nothing will entrust with confidence charge explanation will take counsel with will not let come near how can ask separated from affair be not act be how can consistently ask question know that left to flintwinch that occupies place glancing at jeremiah clennam saw in very gaiter that attention be closely directed to though stood leaning against wall scraping jaw pretended to listen to flora a held forth in most distracting manner on chaos of subject in mackerel mr f aunt in swing have become entangled with cockchafer wine trade prisoner in french gaol on accusation of murder repeated mr clennam steadily going over what son have said that be know of from fellow prisoner in substance be fellow prisoner accomplice murderer too of course give better account of than of friend be needle to ask will supply rest of here with something new to talk about casby arthur tell stay mother stay stay interrupted hastily for have not entered imagination that must openly proclaim what have told what now said with displeasure what more beg to excuse mr casby too mr finching for one other moment with mother have laid hand upon chair must otherwise have wheeled round with touch of foot upon ground be still face to face looked at a ran over possibility of result have not intended must not foresee being influenced by cavallettos disclosure becoming matter of notoriety hurriedly arrived at conclusion that have best not be talked about though perhaps be guided by more distinct reason than that have taken for granted that mother must reserve to herself partner what now said again impatiently what be did not mean mother that must repeat what have communicated think have better not repeat do make that condition with well yes observe then be who make secret said holding up hand not be arthur who bring here doubt suspicion entreaty for explanation be arthur who bring secret here what be to do think where man have be what have be what can be to whole world may know if care to know be nothing to now let go yielded to imperious elated look turned chair back to place from have wheeled in doing so saw elation in face of mr flintwinch most assuredly be not inspired by flora turning of intelligence of whole attempt design against did even more than mother fixedness firmness to convince that effort with be idle nothing remained appeal to old friend affery even to get very doubtful preliminary stage of making appeal seemed one of least promising of human undertaking be so completely under thrall of two clever one be so systematically kept in sight by one other of be so afraid to go about house besides opportunity of speaking to alone appeared to be forestalled over above mistress affery by mean be not very difficult to guess through sharp argument of liege lord have acquired lively conviction of hazard of saying anything under circumstance that have remained time in corner guarding from approach with symbolical instrument of hers so that when word two have be addressed to by flora even by bottle green patriarch have warded off conversation with toasting fork like dumb woman after several abortive attempt to get affery to look at while cleared table washed tea service arthur thought of expedient flora might originate to whom therefore whispered must say must like to go through house now poor flora being always in fluctuating expectation of time when clennam must renew boyhood be madly in love with again received whisper with utmost delight not only a rendered precious by mysterious character a preparing way for tender interview in must declare state of affection immediately began to work out hint ah dear poor old room said flora glancing round look just a ever mr clennam be touched to see except for being smokier be to be expected with time must expect reconcile ourselves to being whether like not a be sure have have to do if not exactly smokier dreadfully stouter be same worse to think of day when papa used to bring here least of girl perfect mass of chilblain to be stuck upon chair with foot on rail stare at arthur pray excuse mr clennam least of boy in frightfullest of frill jacket ere yet mr f appeared misty shadow on horizon paying attention like well known spectre of place in germany beginning with b be moral lesson inculcating that path in life be similar to path down in north of england where get coal make iron thing gravelled with ash having paid tribute of sigh to instability of human existence flora hurried on with purpose not at time proceeded worst enemy must have said be cheerful house for that be never made to be always highly impressive fond memory recall occasion in youth ere yet judgment be mature when arthur confirmed habit mr clennam took down into unused kitchen eminent for mouldiness proposed to secrete there for life feed on what must hide from meal when be not at home for holiday on dry bread in disgrace at halcyon period too frequently occurred must be inconvenient asking too much to beg to be permitted to revive scene walk through house mr clennam who responded with constrained grace to mr finchings good nature in being there at though visit before arthur unexpected arrival be undoubtedly act of pure good nature self gratification intimated that house be open to flora rose looked to arthur for escort certainly said aloud affery will light dare say affery be excusing with dont ask nothing of arthur when mr flintwinch stopped with why not affery whats matter with woman why not jade thus expostulated with came unwillingly out of corner resigned toasting fork into one of husband hand took candlestick offered from other go before fool said jeremiah be going up down mr finching flora answered down then go before down affery said jeremiah do properly ill come rolling down banister tumbling over affery headed exploring party jeremiah closed have intention of leaving clennam looking back seeing following three stair behind in coolest most methodical manner exclaimed in low voice be there getting rid of flora reassured mind by replying promptly why though not exactly proper arthur thing couldnt think of before younger man stranger still dont mind if so particularly wish provided youll have goodness not to take too tight wanting heart to explain that be not at what meant arthur extended supporting arm round flora figure oh goodness said be very obedient indeed really extremely honourable gentlemanly in be sure still at same time if must like

settled determination of purpose give impression that will not be much disposed to adopt course have made up mind to take if disapproval of must render unwilling to discharge such business a necessitates be sorry for must seek other aid will represent to at once to argue against with be useless good sir answered mr rugg shrugging shoulder good sir since business be to be done by hand let be done by mine such be principle in case of rugg bawkins such be principle in most case clennam then proceeded to state to mr rugg fixed resolution told mr rugg that partner be man of great simplicity integrity that in meant to do be guided above thing by knowledge of partner character respect for feeling explained that partner be then absent on enterprise of importance that particularly behoved publicly to accept blame of what have rashly done publicly to exonerate partner from participation in responsibility of lest successful conduct of enterprise must be endangered by slightest suspicion wrongly attaching to partner honour credit in country told mr rugg to clear partner morally to fullest extent publicly unreservedly to declare that arthur clennam of firm have of own sole act even expressly against partner caution embarked resource in swindle have lately perished be only real atonement within power be better atonement to particular man than must be to many men be

stoppage of house until pleasure must be known partner communicated with humbly submitting to direction if through consideration for partner innocence affair must ever be got into such train a that business must be profitably resumed present downfall overcome then own share in must revert to partner a only reparation must make to in money value for distress loss have unhappily brought upon at a small salary a must live upon must ask to be allowed to serve business a faithful clerk though mr rugg saw plainly there be preventing from being done still wryness of face uneasiness of limb so sorely required propitiation of protest that made one offer objection sir said argue point with will carry out view sir under protest mr rugg then stated not without prolixity head of protest be in effect because whole town might say whole country be in first madness of late discovery resentment against victim must be very strong who have not be deluded being certain to wax exceedingly wroth with for not having be a wise a be who have be deluded being certain to find excuse reason for of be equally certain to see that other sufferer be wholly devoid not to mention great probability of individual sufferer persuading to violent indignation for example of other sufferer never must have put in way of suffering because declaration a clennams made at time must certainly draw down upon storm of animosity rendering impossible to calculate on forbearance in creditor on unanimity among exposing solitary target to straggling cross fire might bring down from dozen quarter at once to clennam merely replied that granting whole protest nothing in lessened force must lessen force of voluntary public exoneration of partner therefore once for requested mr ruggs immediate aid in getting business despatched upon mr rugg fell to work arthur retaining property to clothes book little loose money placed small private banker account with paper of business disclosure be made storm raged

appetite why then must must partake of refreshment without appetite im going to have tea in own apartment if not liberty please to come take cup can bring tray here in two minute feeling that young john must impose that trouble on if refused also feeling anxious to show that bore in mind elder mr chiverys entreaty younger mr chiverys apology arthur rose expressed willingness to take cup of tea in mr john apartment young john locked door for a went out slided key into pocket with great dexterity led way to own residence be at top of house nearest to gateway be room to clennam have hurried on day when enriched family have left prison for ever where have lifted insensible from floor foresaw where be going a soon a foot touched staircase room be so far changed that be papered now have be repainted be far more comfortably furnished must recall just a have seen in single glance when raised from ground carried down to carriage young john looked hard at biting finger see recollect room mr clennam recollect well heaven bless oblivious of tea young john continued to bite finger to look at visitor a long a visitor continued to glance about room finally made start at teapot gustily rattled quantity of tea into from canister set off for common kitchen to fill with hot water room be so eloquent to clennam in changed circumstance of return to miserable marshalsea spoke to so mournfully of of loss of that must have gone hard with to resist even though have not be alone alone did not try have hand on insensible wall a tenderly a if have be that touched pronounced name in low voice stood at window looking over prison parapet with grim spiked border breathed benediction through summer haze towards distant land where be rich prosperous young john be time absent when came back showed that have be outside by bringing with fresh butter in cabbage leaf thin slice of boiled ham in cabbage leaf little basket of water cress salad herb when be arranged upon table to satisfaction sat down to tea clennam tried to do honour to meal unavailingly ham sickened bread seemed to turn to sand in mouth must force nothing upon cup of tea try little something green said young john handing basket took sprig so of water cress tried again bread turned to heavier sand than before ham though be good enough of seemed to blow faint simoom of ham through whole marshalsea try little more something green sir said young john again handed basket be so like handing green meat into cage of dull imprisoned bird john have so evidently brought little basket a handful of fresh relief from stale hot paving stone brick of jail that clennam said with smile be very kind of to think of putting between wire can not even get down to day a if difficulty be contagious young john soon pushed away own plate fell to folding cabbage leaf have contained ham when have folded into number of layer one over so that be small in palm of hand began to flatten between hand to eye clennam attentively wonder at length said compressing green packet with force that if not worth while to take care of for own sake not worth doing for one el truly returned arthur with sigh smile dont know for whose mr clennam said john warmly be surprised that gentleman who be capable of straightforwardness that be capable of must be capable of mean action of making such answer mr clennam be surprised that gentleman who be capable of having heart of own must be capable of heartlessness of treating mine in way be astonished at sir really truly be astonished having got upon foot to emphasise concluding word young john sat down again fell to rolling green packet on right leg never taking eye off clennam surveying with fixed look of indignant reproach have got over sir said john have conquered knowing that must be conquered have come to resolution to think more about shouldnt have given mind to again hope if to prison have not be brought in hour unfortunate for day in agitation young john adopted mother powerful construction of sentence when first came upon sir in lodge day more a if upas tree have be made capture of than private defendant such mingled stream of feeling broke loose again within that everything be for first few minute swept away before be going round round in vortex got out of struggled got out of if be last word have to speak against vortex with utmost power strove out of came argued that if have be rude apology be due apology without question of demeaning did make now when ive be so wishful to show that one thought be next to being holy one with go before others now after dodge when ever so gently hint at throw back upon for sir said young john be so base a to deny that dodge do thrown back upon have amazement arthur gazed at like one lost only saying what be what do mean john john being in state of mind in nothing must seem to be more impossible to certain class of people than giving of answer went ahead blindly hadnt john declared hadnt never have audaciousness to think be sure that be anything lost hadnt why must say hadnt if ever have hope that be possible to be so blest not after word passed not even if barrier insurmountable have not be raised be that reason why be to have memory why be to have thought why be to have sacred spot anything what can mean cried arthur very well to trample on sir john went on scouring very prairie of wild word if person can make up mind to be guilty of action very well to trample on there may be that couldnt be trampled upon if wasnt there that doesnt make gentlemanly that doesnt make honourable that doesnt justify throwing person back upon after have struggled strived out of like butterfly world may sneer at turnkey he man when isnt woman among female criminal he expected to be ridiculous a incoherence of talk be there be yet truthfulness in young john simple sentimental character sense of being wounded in very tender respect expressed in burning face in agitation of voice manner arthur must have be cruel to disregard turned thought back to starting point of unknown injury in meantime young john having rolled green packet pretty round cut carefully into three piece laid on plate a if be particular delicacy seems to just possible said arthur when have retraced conversation to water cress back again that have made reference to miss dorrit be just possible sir returned john chivery dont understand hope may not be so unlucky a to make think mean to offend again for never have meant to offend yet when say dont understand sir said young john will have perfidy to deny that know long have known felt towards miss dorrit call not presumption of love adoration sacrifice indeed john will not have perfidy if know why must suspect of be at loss to think did ever hear from mr chivery mother went to see once sir returned john shortly never heard of such thing did can imagine why sir returned john shortly cant imagine why will tell be solicitous to promote miss dorrits happiness if must have supposed that miss dorrit returned affection poor john chivery turned crimson to tip of ear miss dorrit never did sir wish to be honourable true so far a in humble way can must scorn to pretend for moment that ever did that ever led to believe did even that be ever to be expected in cool reason that must must be far above in respect at time a likewise added john similarly be gen teel family chivalrous feeling towards belonged to made so very respectable in spite of small stature rather weak leg very weak hair poetical temperament that goliath might have sat in place demanding le consideration at arthur hand speak john said with cordial admiration like man well sir returned john brushing hand across eye then wish youd do same be quick with unexpected retort again made arthur regard with wondering expression of face leastways said john stretching hand across tea tray if too strong remark withdrawn why not why not when say to mr clennam take care of yourself for one el sake why not be open though turnkey why did get room knew youd like best why did carry up thing not that found em heavy dont mention em on account far from why have cultivated in manner have done since morning on ground of own merit theyre very great ive doubt at not on ground of anothers merit have have weight have have far more weight with then why not speak free unaffectedly john said clennam be so good fellow have so true respect for character that if have appeared to be le sensible than really be of fact that kind service have rendered to day be attributable to having be trusted by miss dorrit a friend confess to be fault ask forgiveness oh why not john repeated with returning scorn why not speak free declare to returned arthur that understand look at consider trouble have be in be likely must wilfully add to other self reproach that of being ungrateful treacherous to understand john incredulous face slowly softened into face of doubt rose backed into garret window of room beckoned arthur to come there stood looking at thoughtfully mr clennam do mean to say that dont know what john lord said young john appealing with gasp to spike on wall say what clennam looked at spike looked at john looked at spike looked at john say what what be more exclaimed young john surveying in doleful maze appears to mean do see window sir of course see window see room why of course see room that wall opposite that yard down below have be witness of from day to day from night to night from week to week from month to month for how often have seen miss dorrit here when have not seen witness of what said clennam of miss dorrits love for whom said john touched with back of hand upon breast backed to chair sat down on with pale face holding arm shaking head at if have dealt clennam heavy blow instead of laying light touch upon effect must not have be to shake more stood amazed eye looking at john lip parted seeming now then to form word without uttering hand dropped at side whole appearance that of man who have be awakened from sleep stupefied by intelligence beyond full comprehension at length said aloud ah groaned young john did what must to muster smile returned fancy be completely mistaken mistaken sir said young john completely mistaken on subject mr clennam dont tell so on other if like for dont set up to be penetrating character be well aware of own deficiency mistaken on point have caused more smart in breast than flight of savage arrow must have done mistaken on point almost sent into grave a sometimes wished must if grave must only have be made compatible with tobacco business father mother feeling mistaken on point even at present moment make take out pocket handkerchief like great girl a people say though be sure dont know why great girl must be term of reproach for rightly constituted male mind love em great small dont tell so dont tell so still highly respectable at bottom though absurd enough upon surface young john took out pocket handkerchief with genuine absence of display concealment be only to be seen in man with great deal of good in when take out pocket handkerchief for purpose of wiping eye having dried indulged in harmless luxury of sob sniff put up again touch be still in influence so like blow arthur must not get many word together to close subject with assured john chivery when have returned handkerchief to pocket that did honour to disinterestedness to fidelity of remembrance of miss dorrit a to impression on mind of have just relieved here john interposed said impression certainty a to that might perhaps speak of at time must say more now feeling low spirited weary must go back to room with john leave come out more that night john assented crept back in shadow of wall to own lodging feeling of blow be still so strong upon that when dirty old woman be gone whom found sitting on stair outside door waiting to make bed who gave to understand while doing that have received instruction from mr chivery not old un young un sat down in faded arm chair pressing head between hand a if have be stunned little dorrit love more bewildering to than misery far consider improbability have be accustomed to call child dear child to invite confidence by dwelling upon difference in respective age to speak of a one who be turning old yet might not have thought old something reminded that have not thought so until rose have floated away upon river have two letter among other paper in box took out read there seemed to be sound in like sound of sweet voice fell upon ear with many tone of tenderness be not insusceptible of new meaning now be that quiet desolation of answer no made to night in very room that night when have be shown dawn of altered fortune when other word have passed between have be destined to remember in humiliation prisoner rushed into mind consider improbability have preponderating tendency when considered to become fainter there be curious inquiry of own heart concurrently became stronger in reluctance have felt to believe that loved one in desire to set question at rest in half formed consciousness have have that there must be kind of nobleness in helping love for one be there suppressed something on own side that have hushed a arose have ever whispered to that must not think of thing a loving that must not take advantage of gratitude that must keep experience in remembrance a warning reproof that must regard such youthful hope a having passed away a friend dead daughter have passed away that must be steady in saying to that time have gone by be too saddened

terrific manner stony reticule be a rigid a if have be petrified by gorgon head have got at moment inside with imposing attribute mr f aunt publicly seated on step of marshal official residence have be for two three hour in question great boon to younger inhabitant of borough whose sally of humour have considerably flushed by resenting at point of umbrella from time to time painfully aware miss dorrit be sure said flora to propose adjournment to place to one so far removed by fortune so courted caressed by best society must ever appear intruding even if not pie shop far below present sphere back parlour though civil man if for sake of arthur can not overcome more improper now than ever late doyce clennam one last remark might wish to make one last explanation might wish to offer perhaps good nature might excuse under pretence of three kidney one humble place of conversation rightly interpreting rather obscure speech little dorrit returned that be quite at flora disposition flora accordingly led way across road to pie shop in question mr f aunt stalking across in rear putting in way of being run over with perseverance worthy of better cause when three kidney one be to be blind to conversation be set before on three little tin platter kidney one ornamented with hole at top into civil man poured hot gravy out of spouted can a if be feeding three lamp flora took out pocket handkerchief if fancy fair dream began have ever pictured that when arthur can not overcome pray excuse be restored to freedom even pie a far from flaky a present so deficient in kidney a to be in respect like minced nutmeg might not prove unacceptable if offered by hand of true regard such vision have for ever fled be cancelled being aware that tender relation be in contemplation beg to state heartily wish well to find fault with not least may be withering to know that ere hand of time have made much le slim than formerly dreadfully red on slightest exertion particularly after eating well know when take form of rash might have be be not through interruption of parent mental torpor succeeded until mysterious clue be held by mr f still must not be ungenerous to heartily wish well to little dorrit took hand thanked for old kindness call not kindness returned flora giving honest kiss for always be best dearest little thing that ever be if may take liberty even in money point of view saving being conscience though must add much more agreeable than mine ever be to for though not hope more burdened than other people yet have always found far readier to make one uncomfortable than comfortable evidently taking greater pleasure in doing be wandering one hope wish to express ere yet closing scene draw in be that do trust for sake of old time old sincerity that arthur will know didnt desert in misfortune came backwards forward constantly to ask if must do anything for sat in pie shop where very civilly fetched something warm in tumbler from hotel really very nice hour after hour to keep company over way without knowing flora really have tear in eye now showed to great advantage over above said flora earnestly beg a dearest thing that ever be if youll still excuse familiarity from one who move in very different circle to let arthur understand dont know after whether wasnt nonsense between though pleasant at time trying too certainly mr f did work change spell being broken nothing must be expected to take place without weaving afresh various circumstance have combined to prevent of perhaps not least powerful be that be not to be be not prepared to say that if have be agreeable to arthur have brought about naturally in first instance must not have be very glad being of lively disposition moped at home where papa undoubtedly be most aggravating of sex not improved since having be cut down by hand of incendiary into something of never saw counterpart in life jealousy be not character ill will though many fault without having be able closely to follow mr finching through labyrinth little dorrit understood purpose cordially accepted trust withered chaplet dear said flora with great enjoyment be then perished column be crumbled pyramid be standing upside down upon whats name call not giddiness call not weakness call not folly must now retire into privacy look upon ash of departed joy more taking further liberty of paying for pastry have formed humble pretext of interview will for ever say adieu mr f aunt who have eaten pie with great solemnity who have be elaborating grievous scheme of injury in mind since first assumption of public position on marshal step took present opportunity of addressing following sibyllic apostrophe to relict of late nephew bring forard ill chuck out o winder flora tried in vain to soothe excellent woman by explaining that be going home to dinner mr f aunt persisted in replying bring forard ill chuck out o winder having reiterated demand immense number of time with sustained glare of defiance at little dorrit mr f aunt folded arm sat down in corner of pie shop parlour steadfastly refusing to budge until such time a must have be brought forard chucking portion of destiny accomplished in condition of thing flora confided to little dorrit that have not seen mr f aunt so full of life character for week that must find necessary to remain there hour perhaps until inexorable old lady must be softened that must manage best alone parted therefore in friendliest manner with kindest feeling on side mr f aunt holding out like grim fortress flora becoming in need of refreshment messenger be despatched to hotel for tumbler already glanced at be afterwards replenished with aid of content newspaper skimming of cream of pie stock flora got through remainder of day in perfect good humour though occasionally embarrassed by consequence of idle rumour circulated among credulous infant of neighbourhood to effect that old lady have sold to pie shop to be made up be then sitting in pie shop parlour declining to complete contract attracted so many young person of sex when shade of evening began to fall occasioned so much interruption to business that merchant became very pressing in proposal that mr f aunt must be removed conveyance be accordingly brought to door by joint effort of merchant flora remarkable woman be at last induced to enter though not without even then putting head out of window demanding to have brought forard for purpose originally mentioned a be observed at time to direct baleful glance towards marshalsea have be supposed that admirably consistent female intended by arthur clennam however be mere speculation who person be who for satisfaction of mr f aunt mind ought to have be brought forward never be brought forward will never be positively known
