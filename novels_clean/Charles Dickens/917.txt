powerful for to surmount joe for part be great deal too happy to inquire very curiously into matter dolly being yet too tremulous to walk without assistance went forward very slowly in mind very pleasantly until maypole light be near at hand twinkling cheerful welcome when dolly stopped suddenly with half scream exclaimed 'the letter 'what letter ' cried joe be carrying have in hand bracelet

presence of mind readiness of speech for be so eminently distinguished above other men mr varden expressed sympathy for daughter distress by scolding roundly for being so late honest locksmith divided between condoling with kissing dolly shaking hand heartily with joe whom must not sufficiently praise thank in reference to latter point old john be far from agreeing with friend for besides that by mean approved of adventurous spirit in abstract occurred to that if son heir have be seriously damaged in scuffle consequence must assuredly have be expensive inconvenient might perhaps have proved detrimental to maypole business wherefore because looked with favourable eye upon young girl rather considered that whole female sex be kind of nonsensical mistake on part of nature took occasion to retire shake head in private at boiler inspired by silent oracle be moved to give joe various stealthy nudge with elbow a parental reproof gentle admonition to mind own business not make fool of joe however took down lantern lighted arming with stout stick asked whether hugh be in stable 'he lying asleep before kitchen fire sir ' said mr willet 'what do want for ' want to come with to look after

opined that if did ought to be ashamed of such sentiment being more consistent so argued with benighted mussulman wild islander than with stanch protestant arguing from imperfect state of moral mr varden further opined that have never studied manual hugh admitting that never have moreover that must read mr varden declared with much severity that ought to be even more ashamed of than before

order that might not grow faint for want of sustenance might have decent halting place halfway house between dinner supper few savoury trifle in shape of great rasher of broiled ham being well cured

whether people by dint of sitting together in same place same relative position doing exactly same thing for great many year acquire sixth sense unknown power of influencing other serf in stead be question for philosophy to settle certain be that old john willet mr parkes mr cobb be one firmly of opinion that be very jolly companion rather choice spirit than otherwise that looked at other now then a if there be perpetual interchange of idea going on among that man considered neighbour by mean silent that of nodded occasionally when caught eye of a if must say 'you have expressed extremely

come to knot neither of companion be aware of circumstance until met with one of impediment be obliged to try again 'johnny dropped off ' said mr parkes in whisper 'fast a top ' said mr cobb of said more until mr willet came to knot one of surpassing obduracy bade fair to throw into convulsion got over at last without waking by effort quite superhuman 'he sleep uncommon hard said mr cobb mr parkes who be possibly hard sleeper replied with disdain 'not bit on ' directed eye towards handbill pasted over chimney piece be decorated at top with woodcut representing youth of tender year running away very fast with bundle over shoulder at end of stick to carry out idea finger post milestone beside mr cobb likewise turned eye in same direction surveyed placard a if be first time have

offering reward of five pound to person person who must pack up return safely to maypole at chigwell lodge in of majesty jail until such time a father must come claim in advertisement mr willet have obstinately persisted despite advice entreaty of friend in describing son a 'young boy ' furthermore a being from eighteen inch to couple of foot shorter than really be two circumstance perhaps accounted in degree for never having be productive of other effect than transmission to chigwell at various time at vast expense of five forty runaway varying from six year old to twelve mr cobb mr parkes looked mysteriously at composition at other at old john from time have pasted up with own hand mr willet have never by word sign alluded to subject encouraged one else to do so nobody have least notion what thought opinion be connected with whether remembered forgot whether have idea that event have ever taken place therefore even while slept one ventured to refer to in presence for such sufficient reason chosen friend be silent now mr willet have got by time into complication of knot that be perfectly clear must wake die chose former alternative opened eye come in five minute said john ' will have supper without ' antecedent of pronoun have be mentioned for last time at eight o'clock parkes cobb being used to style of conversation replied without difficulty that to be sure solomon be very late wondered what have happened to detain 'he blown away suppose ' said parkes be enough to carry man of figure off leg easy too do hear blow great gun indeed there will be many crash in forest to night reckon many broken branch upon ground to morrow ' 'it wo break anything in maypole take sir ' returned old john 'let try give leave what be ' 'the wind cried parkes howling like

tumult out of door shout repeated that with shrillness energy denoted that came from person in great distress terror looked at other turned pale held breath man stirred be in emergency mr willet displayed something of strength of mind plenitude of mental resource rendered admiration of friend neighbour after looking at messrs parkes cobb for time in silence clapped two hand to cheek sent forth roar made glass dance rafter ring long sustained discordant bellow rolled onward with wind startling echo made night hundred time more boisterous deep loud dismal bray sounded like human gong

perspiration stood in bead upon face knee knocked together limb trembled power of articulation be quite gone there stood panting for breath gazing on with such livid ashy look that be infected with fear though ignorant of occasion reflecting dismayed horror stricken visage stared back again without venturing to question until old john willet in fit of temporary insanity made dive at cravat seizing by portion of dress shook to fro until very teeth appeared to rattle in head 'tell be matter sir ' said john 'or will kill tell be matter sir in second will have head under biler how dare look like be anybody following of do mean say something will be death of will ' mr willet in frenzy be so near keeping word to very letter solomon daisy eye already beginning to roll in alarming manner certain guttural sound a of choking man to issue from throat that two bystander recovering in degree plucked off victim by main force placed little clerk of chigwell in chair directing fearful gaze round room implored in faint voice to give drink above to lock house door close bar shutter of room without moment loss of time latter request did not tend to reassure hearer to fill with most comfortable sensation complied with however with greatest expedition having handed bumper of brandy water nearly boiling hot waited to hear what might have to tell johnny ' said solomon shaking by hand parkes oh tommy cobb why did leave house to night on nineteenth of march of night in year on nineteenth of march ' drew closer to fire parkes who be nearest to door started looked over shoulder mr willet with great indignation inquired what devil meant by then said 'god forgive glanced over own shoulder came little nearer left here to night ' said solomon daisy little thought what day of

leave church came upon at once that be nineteenth of march came upon with kind of shock a if hand have struck thought upon forehead at very same moment heard voice outside tower rising from among graf here old john precipitately interrupted speaker begged that if mr parkes who be seated opposite to be staring directly over head saw anything must have goodness to mention mr parkes apologised remarked that be only listening to mr willet angrily retorted that listening with kind of expression in face be not agreeable that if must look like other people have better put pocket handkerchief over head mr parkes with great submission pledged to do so if again required john willet turning to solomon desired to proceed after waiting until violent gust of wind rain seemed to shake even that sturdy house to foundation have passed away little man complied tell that be fancy that be other sound mistook for tell of heard wind whistle through arch of church heard steeple strain creak heard

followed in dream came upon unawares then died off seeming to pas quite round church see much in ' said john drawing long breath looking round like man who felt relieved 'perhaps not ' returned friend 'but be not ' 'what more do mean to say sir be to come ' asked john pausing in act of wiping face upon apron 'what be going to tell of next 'what saw ' beaw echoed three bending forward 'when opened church door to come out ' said little man with expression of face bore ample testimony to sincerity of conviction opened church door to come out did suddenly for wanted to get shut again before gust of wind came up there crossed so close that by stretching out finger must have touched something in likeness of man be bare headed to storm turned face without stopping fixed eye on mine be ghost spirit ' three cried together in excess of emotion for fell back trembling in chair waved hand a if entreating to question further answer be lost on old john willet who happened to be seated close beside 'who ' cried parkes tom cobb looking eagerly by turn at solomon daisy at mr willet 'who be ' 'gentlemen said mr willet after long pause need ask likeness of murdered man be nineteenth of march ' profound silence ensued 'if will take advice ' said john 'we have better one keep secret such tale must not be liked at warren let keep to ourselves for present time at event may get into trouble solomon may lose place whether be really a say whether be be matter right wrong nobody must believe a to probability think ' said mr willet eyeing corner of room in manner showed that like other philosopher be not quite easy in theory 'that ghost a have be man of sense in lifetime must be out walking in such weather only know must if be one ' heretical doctrine be strongly opposed by other three who quoted great many precedent to show that bad weather be very time for such appearance mr parkes who have have ghost in family by mother side argued matter with so much ingenuity force of illustration that john be only saved from having to retract opinion by opportune appearance of supper to applied with dreadful relish even solomon daisy by dint of elevating influence of fire light brandy good company so far recovered a to handle knife fork in highly creditable manner to display capacity of eating drinking such a banished fear of having sustained lasting injury from fright supper done crowded round fire again a be common on such occasion propounded manner of leading question calculated to surround story with new horror surprise solomon daisy notwithstanding temptation adhered so steadily to original account repeated so often with such slight variation with such solemn asseveration of truth reality that hearer be with good reason more astonished than at first a took john willet view of matter in regard to propriety of not bruiting tale abroad unless spirit must appear to again in case must be necessary to take immediate counsel with clergyman be solemnly resolved that must be hushed up kept quiet a most men like to have secret to tell may exalt own importance arrived at conclusion with perfect unanimity a be by time growing late be long past usual hour of separating crony parted for night solomon daisy with fresh candle in lantern repaired homewards under escort of long phil parkes mr cobb who be rather more nervous than mr willet after seeing to door returned to collect thought with assistance of boiler to listen to storm of wind rain have not yet abated one jot of fury chapter before old john have looked at boiler quite twenty minute got idea into focus brought to bear upon solomon daisy story more thought of more impressed became with sense of own wisdom desire mr haredale must be impressed with likewise at length to end that might sustain principal important character in affair might have start of solomon two friend through whose mean knew adventure with variety of exaggeration must be known to at least score of people most likely to mr haredale by breakfast time to morrow determined to repair to warren before going to bed landlord ' thought john a took candle in hand setting down in corner out of wind way opened

whispering about of here tale will anger be good to have confidence with gentleman of natur set one right besides halloa there hugh hugh hal loa ' when have repeated shout dozen time startled pigeon from slumber door in one of ruinous old building opened rough voice demanded what be amiss now that man must even have sleep in quiet 'what have sleep enough growler that be not to be knocked up for once ' said john 'no replied voice a speaker yawned shook 'not half enough ' ' know how can sleep with wind bellowsing roaring about making tile fly like pack of card said john 'but matter for wrap up in something come here for must go a far a warren with look sharp about ' hugh with much low growling muttering went back into lair presently reappeared carrying lantern cudgel enveloped from head to foot in old frowzy slouching horse cloth mr willet received figure at back door ushered into bar while wrapped in sundry greatcoat cape so tied knotted face in shawl handkerchief how breathed be mystery 'you take man out of door at near midnight in such weather without putting heart into do master ' said hugh 'yes do sir returned mr willet ' put heart a call into when have brought safe home again standing steady on leg of so much consequence so hold that light up if please go on step two before to show way hugh obeyed with very indifferent grace longing glance at bottle old john laying strict injunction on cook to keep door locked in absence to open to nobody on pain of dismissal followed into blustering darkness out of door way be wet dismal night so black that if mr willet have be own pilot must have walked into deep horsepond within few hundred yard of own house must certainly have terminated career in ignoble sphere of action hugh who have sight a keen a hawk apart from endowment must have found way blindfold to place within dozen mile dragged old john along quite deaf to remonstrance took own course without slightest reference to notice of master so made head against wind a best must hugh crushing wet grass beneath heavy tread stalking on after ordinary savage fashion john willet following at arm length picking step looking about now for bog ditch now for such stray ghost a might be wandering abroad with look of a much dismay uneasiness a immovable face be capable of expressing at length stood upon broad gravel walk before warren house building be profoundly dark none be moving near save from one solitary turret chamber however there shone ray of light towards speck of comfort in cold cheerless silent scene mr willet bade pilot lead 'the old room ' said john looking timidly upward ber reuben own apartment god be with wonder brother like to sit there so late at night on night too 'why where else must sit ' asked hugh holding lantern to breast to keep candle from wind while trimmed with finger snug enough ' benug said john indignantly 'you have comfortable idea of snugness have sir do know what be done in room ruffian ' what be worse for ' cried hugh looking into john fat face 'does keep out rain snow wind le for be le warm dry because man be killed there have have have never believe master one man be such matter a come to ' mr willet fixed dull eye on follower began by specie of inspiration to think just barely possible that be something of dangerous character that might be advisable to get rid of one of day be too prudent to say anything with journey home before therefore turned to iron gate before brief dialogue have passed pulled handle of bell that hung beside turret in light appeared being at one corner of building only divided from path by one of garden walk upon gate opened mr haredale threw up window directly demanded who be there 'begging pardon sir ' said john ' knew sat up late made bold to come round having word to say to ' 'willet be not ' 'of maypole at service sir ' mr haredale closed window withdrew presently appeared at door in bottom of turret coming across garden walk unlocked gate let in 'you be late visitor willet what be matter 'nothing to speak of sir ' said john 'an idle tale thought ought to know of nothing more 'let man go forward with lantern give hand stair be crooked narrow gently with light friend swing like censer hugh who have already reached turret held more steadily ascended first turning round from time to time to shed light downward on step mr haredale following

that be riding to death chapter mr dennis having despatched piece of business without personal hurt inconvenience having now retired into tranquil respectability of private life resolved to solace with hour so of female society with amiable purpose in mind bent step towards house where dolly miss haredale be still confined whither miss miggs have also be removed by order of mr simon tappertit a walked along street with leather glove clasped behind face indicative of cheerful thought pleasant calculation mr dennis might have be likened unto farmer ruminating among crop enjoying by

be personally referred to in prosperous ripening for gibbet have never considered so much pet favourite child of destiny loved that lady so well with such calm virtuous reliance in life a to being

than set off against evidence might identify a member of crowd that charge of companionship might be made against by who be in danger must certainly go for nought that if trivial indiscretion on part

happy saving for one circumstance to wit forcible detention of dolly miss haredale in house almost adjoining own be stumbling block for if be discovered released must by testimony have in power to give place in situation of great jeopardy to set at liberty first extorting from oath of secrecy silence be thing not to be thought of be more perhaps with eye to danger lurked in quarter than from abstract love of conversation with sex that hangman quickening step now hastened into society cursing amorous nature of hugh mr tappertit with great heartiness at step took when entered miserable room

great personal sacrifice for common good at point mr dennis looked so very full of meaning gave singularly expressive twitch to face a request to to come still nearer to that abandoned little art gave whole undivided attention 'when be simmuns here say ' quoth dennis in ear 'not since yesterday morning then only for few minute not day day before ' know meant along to carry off one ' said dennis indicating dolly by slightest possible jerk of head 'and to hand over to somebody else miss miggs who have fallen into terrible state of grief when first part of sentence be spoken recovered little at

a wengeance begged gentleman must say no more whatever said wishing to do duty by mankind even by a have ever be bitterest enemy must not listen to with stopped ear shook head from side to side to intimate to mr dennis that though talked until have breath left be a deaf a adder here sugar stick ' said mr dennis view same a mine will only be quiet slip away at right time can have house clear to morrow be out of trouble stop though there be other other sir asked miggs still with finger in ear head shaking obstinately 'why tallest one yonder ' said dennis a stroked chin added in undertone to something about not crossing muster gashford miss miggs replied still being profoundly deaf that if miss haredale stood in way at might make quite easy on score a have gathered from what passed between hugh mr tappertit when be last there that be to be removed alone not by by somebody else to morrow night mr dennis opened eye very wide at piece of information whistled once considered once finally slapped head once nodded once a if have got clue to mysterious removal so dismissed then imparted design concerning dolly to miss miggs who be taken more deaf than before when began so remained through notable scheme be mr dennis be immediately to seek out from among rioter daring young fellow have one in eye said who terrified by threat must hold out to alarmed by capture of so many who be better worse than must gladly avail of help to get abroad out of harm way with plunder even though journey be incumbered by unwilling companion indeed unwilling companion being beautiful girl must probably be additional inducement temptation person found proposed to bring there on ensuing night when tall one be taken off miss miggs have purposely retired then that dolly must be gagged muffled in cloak carried in handy conveyance down to river side where there be abundant mean of getting smuggled snugly off in small craft of doubtful character question asked with regard to expense of removal must say at rough calculation two three silver tea coffee pot with something additional for drink such a muffineer toast rack must more than cover article of plate of kind having be buried by rioter in several lonely part of london particularly a knew in st james square though easy of access be little frequented after dark have convenient piece of water in midst needful fund be close at hand must be have upon shortest notice with regard to dolly gentleman must exercise own discretion must be bound to hing to take away keep away other arrangement disposition must rest entirely with if miss miggs have have hearing doubt must have be greatly shocked by indelicacy of young female going away with stranger by night for moral feeling a have said be of tenderest kind directly mr dennis ceased to speak reminded that have only wasted breath then went on to say still with finger in ear that nothing le than severe practical lesson must save locksmith daughter from utter ruin that felt a be moral obligation sacred duty to family to wish that one must devise one for reformation miss miggs remarked very justly a abstract sentiment happened to occur to at moment that dared to say locksmith wife must murmur repine if be ever by forcible abduction otherwise to lose child that seldom knew in world be best for such being sinful imperfect nature very few arrived at clear understanding having brought conversation to satisfactory end parted dennis to pursue design take walk about farm miss miggs to launch when left into burst of mental anguish gave to understand be occasioned by certain tender thing have have presumption audacity to say little dolly heart be quite melted indeed said did so much to soothe outraged feeling of miss miggs looked so beautiful while doing so that if young maid have not have ample vent for surpassing spite in knowledge of mischief be brewing must have scratched feature on spot chapter next day emma haredale dolly miggs remained cooped up together in what have now be prison for so many day without seeing person hearing sound murmured conversation in outer room of men who kept watch over there appeared to be more of fellow than there have be hitherto must no longer hear voice of woman have before plainly distinguished new excitement too seemed to prevail among for there be much stealthy going in out constant questioning of who be newly arrived have previously be quite reckless in behaviour often making great uproar quarrelling among fighting dancing singing be now very subdued silent conversing almost in whisper stealing in out with soft stealthy tread very different from boisterous trampling in arrival departure have hitherto be announced to trembling captive whether change be occasioned by presence among of person of authority in rank by other cause be unable to decide sometimes thought be in part attributable to there being sick man in chamber for last night there have be shuffling of foot a though burden be brought in afterwards moaning noise have mean of ascertaining truth for question entreaty on part only provoked storm of execration something worse be too happy to be left alone unassailed by threat admiration to risk even that comfort by voluntary communication with who held in durance be sufficiently evident to emma to locksmith poor little daughter that dolly be great object of attraction so soon a must have leisure to indulge in softer passion hugh mr tappertit must certainly fall to blow for sake in latter case be not very difficult to see whose prize must become with old horror of man revived deepened into degree of aversion abhorrence language can describe with thousand old recollection regret cause of distress anxiety fear besetting on side poor dolly varden sweet blooming buxom dolly began to hang head fade droop like beautiful flower colour fled from cheek courage forsook gentle heart failed unmindful of provoking caprice forgetful of conquest inconstancy with winning little vanity quite gone nestled livelong day in emma haredale bosom sometimes calling on dear old grey haired father sometimes on mother sometimes even on old home pined slowly away like

given supernatural strength that felt quite happiness to have for champion be only comfort derived at first from miggs presence society for young lady displayed such resignation long suffering so much meek endurance under trial breathed in chaste discourse spirit of such holy confidence resignation devout belief that must happen for best that emma felt courage strengthened by bright example never doubting that everything said be true that like be torn from loved agonised by doubt apprehension a to poor dolly be roused at first by seeing one who came from home when heard under what circumstance have left into whose hand father have fallen wept more bitterly than ever refused comfort miss miggs be at trouble to reprove for state of mind to entreat to take example by herself who said be now receiving back with interest tenfold amount of subscription to red brick dwelling house in article of peace of mind quiet conscience while on serious topic miss miggs considered duty to try hand at conversion of miss haredale for whose improvement launched into polemical address of length in course whereof likened unto chosen missionary that young lady to cannibal in darkness indeed returned so often to subject so frequently called upon to take lesson from at same time vaunting a be rioting in huge unworthiness abundant excess of sin that in course of short time became in small chamber

being unbroken by so much a creaking of board at first miss miggs wondered greatly in own mind who sick person might be arriving on second thought at conclusion that be part of scheme on foot artful device soon to be employed with great success opined for miss haredale comfort that must be misguided papist who have be wounded happy supposition encouraged to say under breath 'ally looyer several time possible ' said emma with indignation 'that who have seen men committing outrage have told of who have fallen into hand like can exult in cruelty 'personal consideration miss ' rejoined miggs into nothing afore noble cause ally looyer ally looyer ally looyer good gentleman seemed from shrill pertinacity with miss miggs repeated form of acclamation that be calling same through keyhole of
