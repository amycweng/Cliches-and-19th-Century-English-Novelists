of time that couldnt say of began say kettle did ought to know kettle began full five minute by little waxy faced dutch clock in corner before cricket uttered chirp a if clock hadnt finished striking convulsive little haymaker at top of jerking away right left with scythe in front of moorish palace hadnt mowed down acre of imaginary grass before cricket joined in at why be not naturally positive one know that wouldnt set own opinion against opinion of mr peerybingle unless be quite sure on account nothing must induce be question of fact fact be that kettle began at least five minute before cricket gave sign of being in existence contradict ill say ten let narrate exactly how happened must have proceeded to do so in very first word for plain considerationif be to tell story must begin at beginning how be possible to begin at beginning without beginning at kettle appeared a if there be sort of match trial of skill must understand between kettle cricket be led to how came about mr peerybingle going out into raw twilight clicking over wet stone in pair of patten worked innumerable rough impression of first proposition in euclid about yardmrs peerybingle filled kettle at water butt presently returning le patten good deal le for be tall mr peerybingle be short set kettle on fire in doing lost temper mislaid for instant for water being uncomfortably cold in slippy slushy sleety sort of state wherein seems to penetrate through kind of substance patten ring includedhad laid hold of mr peerybingles toe even splashed leg when rather plume ourselves with reason too upon leg keep particularly neat in point of stocking find for moment hard to bear besides kettle be aggravating obstinate wouldnt allow to be adjusted on top bar wouldnt hear of accommodating kindly to knob of coal must lean forward with drunken air dribble very idiot of kettle on hearth be quarrelsome hissed spluttered morosely at fire to sum up lid resisting mr peerybingles finger first of turned topsy turvy then with ingenious pertinacity deserving of better cause dived sideways indown to very bottom of kettle hull of royal george have never made monstrous resistance to coming out of water lid of kettle employed against mr peerybingle before got up again looked sullen pig headed enough even then carrying handle with air of defiance cocking spout pertly mockingly at mr peerybingle a if said wont boil nothing will induce mr peerybingle with restored good humour dusted chubby little hand against other sat down before kettle laughing meantime jolly blaze uprose fell flashing gleaming on little haymaker at top of dutch clock until one might have thought stood stock still before moorish palace nothing be in motion flame be on move however have spasm two to second right regular suffering when clock be going to strike be frightful to behold when cuckoo looked out of trap door in palace gave note six time shook time like spectral voiceor like something wiry plucking at leg be not until violent commotion whirring noise among weight rope below have quite subsided that terrified haymaker became again be startled without reason for rattling bony skeleton of clock be very disconcerting in operation wonder very much how set of men most of how dutchman can have have liking to invent there be popular belief that dutchman love broad case much clothing for own lower self might know better than to leave clock so very lank unprotected surely now be observe that kettle began to spend evening now be that kettle growing mellow musical began to have irrepressible gurglings in throat to indulge in short vocal snort checked in bud a if hadnt quite made up mind yet to be good company now be that after two three such vain attempt to stifle convivial sentiment threw off moroseness reserve burst into stream of song so cosy hilarious a never maudlin nightingale yet formed least idea of so plain too bless might have understood like bookbetter than book must name perhaps with warm breath gushing forth in light cloud merrily gracefully ascended few foot then hung about chimney corner a own domestic heaven trolled song with strong energy of cheerfulness that iron body hummed stirred upon fire lid recently rebellious lidsuch be influence of bright exampleperformed sort of jig clattered like deaf dumb young cymbal have never known use of twin brother that song of kettle be song of invitation welcome to somebody out of door to somebody at moment coming on towards snug small home crisp fire there be doubt mr peerybingle knew perfectly a sat musing before hearth dark night sang kettle rotten leaf be lying by way above be mist darkness below be mire clay there only one relief in sad murky air dont know that be one for nothing glare of deep angry crimson where sun wind together set brand upon cloud for being guilty of such weather widest open country be long dull streak of black there hoar frost on finger post thaw upon track ice isnt water water isnt free couldnt say that anything be what ought to be he coming coming coming here if like cricket did chime in with chirrup chirrup chirrup of such magnitude by way of chorus with voice so astoundingly disproportionate to size a compared with kettle size couldnt see that if have then there burst like overcharged gun if have fallen victim on spot chirruped little body into fifty piece must have seemed natural inevitable consequence for have expressly laboured kettle have have last of solo performance persevered with undiminished ardour cricket took first fiddle kept good heaven how chirped shrill sharp piercing voice resounded through house seemed to twinkle in outer darkness like star there be indescribable little trill tremble in at loudest suggested being carried off leg made to leap again by own intense enthusiasm yet went very well together cricket kettle burden of song be still same louder louder louder still sang in emulation fair little listenerfor fair be young though something of what be called dumpling shape dont object to thatlighted candle glanced at haymaker on top of clock who be getting in pretty average crop of minute looked out of window where saw nothing owing to darkness own face imaged in glass opinion be so must yours have be that might have looked long way seen nothing half so agreeable when came back sat down in former seat cricket kettle be still keeping up with perfect fury of competition kettle weak side clearly being that didnt know when be beat there be excitement of race about chirp chirp chirp cricket mile ahead hum hum hummm kettle making play in distance like great top chirp chirp chirp cricket round corner hum hum hummm kettle sticking to in own way idea of giving in chirp chirp chirp cricket fresher than ever hum hum hummm kettle slow steady chirp chirp chirp cricket going in to finish hum hum hummm kettle not to be finished until at last got so jumbled together in hurry skurry helter skelter of match that whether kettle chirped cricket hummed cricket chirped kettle hummed chirped hummed must have taken clearer head than yours mine to have decided with anything like certainty of there be doubt that kettle cricket at one same moment by power of amalgamation best known to sent fireside song of comfort streaming into ray of candle shone out through window long way down lane light bursting on certain person who on instant approached towards through gloom expressed whole thing to literally in twinkling cried welcome home old fellow welcome home boy end attained kettle being dead beat boiled over be taken off fire mr peerybingle then went running to door where what with wheel of cart tramp of horse voice of man tearing in out of excited dog surprising mysterious appearance of baby there be soon very whats name to pay where baby came from how mr peerybingle got hold of in flash of time dont know live baby there be in mr peerybingles arm pretty tolerable amount of pride seemed to have in when
