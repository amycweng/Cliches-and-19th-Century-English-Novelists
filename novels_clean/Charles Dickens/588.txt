with mighty gratification glancing up at old clock begin to read aloud picture proceeding of club mr pickwicks face while tale be being read must have attracted attention of dullest man alive complacent motion of head forefinger a gently beat time corrected air with imaginary punctuation smile mantled on feature at jocose passage sly look stole around to observe effect calm manner in shut eye listened when there be little piece of description changing expression with acted dialogue to agony that deaf gentleman must know what be about extraordinary anxiety to correct reader when hesitated at word in manuscript substituted wrong one be alike worthy of remark when at last endeavouring to communicate with deaf gentleman by mean of finger alphabet with constructed such word a be unknown in civilised savage language took up slate wrote in large text one word in line question howdoyoulikeitwhen did handing over table awaited reply with countenance only brightened improved by
