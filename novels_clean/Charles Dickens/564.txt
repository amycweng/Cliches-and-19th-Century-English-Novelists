of article a be discovered from time to time that immovable waiter have forgotten let flying waiter cleave air a might be always reproached on return by immovable waiter for bringing fog with being out of breath at conclusion of repast by time flying waiter be severely blown immovable waiter gathered up tablecloth under arm with grand air having sternly not to say with indignation looked on at flying waiter while set clean glass round directed valedictory glance towards mr grewgious conveying let be clearly understood between that reward be mine nil be claim of slave pushed flying waiter before out of room be like highly finished miniature painting representing lord of circumlocution department commandership in chief of sort government be quite edifying little picture to be hung on line in national gallery a fog have be proximate cause of sumptuous repast so fog served for general sauce to hear out door clerk sneezing wheezing beating foot on gravel be zest far surpassing doctor kitchener to bid with shiver unfortunate flying waiter shut door before have opened be condiment of profounder flavour than harvey here let be noticed parenthetically that leg of young man in application to door evinced finest sense of touch always preceding tray with something of angling air about by second always lingering after tray have disappeared like macbeth leg when accompanying off stage with reluctance to assassination of duncan host have gone below to cellar have brought up bottle of ruby straw coloured golden drink have ripened long ago in land where fog be have since lain slumbering in shade sparkling tingling after so long nap pushed at cork to help corkscrew like prisoner helping rioter to force gate danced out gaily if p j t in seventeen forty seven in other year of period drank such winesthen for certainty p j t be pretty jolly too externally mr grewgious showed sign of being mellowed by glowing vintage instead of drinking might have be poured over in high dried snuff form run to waste for light shade caused to flicker over face be manner influenced in wooden way have observant eye for edwin when at end of dinner motioned edwin back to own easy chair in fireside corner edwin sank luxuriously into after very brief remonstrance mr grewgious a turned seat round towards fire too smoothed head face might have be seen looking at visitor between smoothing finger bazzard said mr grewgious suddenly turning to follow sir returned bazzard who have done work of consuming meat drink in workmanlike manner though mostly in speechlessness drink to bazzard mr edwin success to mr bazzard success to mr bazzard echoed edwin with totally unfounded appearance of enthusiasm with unspoken addition what in wonder may pursued mr grewgiousi be not at liberty to be definitemaymy conversational power be so very limited that know will not come well out of thismayit ought to be put imaginatively have imaginationmaythe thorn of anxiety be a nearly mark a be likely to getmay come out at last mr bazzard with frowning smile at fire put hand into tangled lock a if thorn of anxiety be there then into waistcoat a if be there then into pocket a if be there in movement be closely followed by eye of edwin a if young gentleman expected to see thorn in action be not produced however mr bazzard merely said follow sir thank be going said mr grewgious jingling glass on table with one hand bending aside under cover of other to whisper to edwin to drink to ward put bazzard first mightnt like else be said with mysterious wink what must have be wink if in mr grewgiouss hand must have be quick enough so edwin winked responsively without least idea what meant by doing so now said mr grewgious devote bumper to fair fascinating miss rosa bazzard fair fascinating miss rosa follow sir said bazzard pledge so do said edwin lord bless cried mr grewgious breaking blank silence of course ensued though why pause must come upon when have performed small social rite not directly inducive of self examination mental despondency who can tell be particularly angular man yet fancy if may use word not having morsel of fancy must draw picture of true lover state of mind to night let follow sir said bazzard have picture mr edwin will correct where wrong resumed mr grewgious will throw in few touch from life dare say be wrong in many particular want many touch from life for be born chip have soft sympathy soft experience well hazard guess that true lover mind be completely permeated by beloved object of affection hazard guess that dear name be precious to can not be heard repeated without emotion be preserved sacred if have distinguishing appellation of fondness for be reserved for be not for common ear name that must be privilege to call by being alone with own bright self must be liberty coldness insensibility almost breach of good faith to flaunt elsewhere be wonderful to see mr grewgious sitting bolt upright with hand on knee continuously chopping discourse out of much a charity boy with very good memory might get catechism said evincing correspondent emotion unless in certain occasional little tingling perceptible at end of nose picture mr grewgious proceeded go on to represent under correction from mr edwin true lover a ever impatient to be in presence vicinity of beloved object of affection a caring very little for case in other society a constantly seeking that if be to say seeking that a bird seek nest must make as of myself because must trench upon what understand to be poetry be so far from trenching upon poetry at time never to knowledge got within ten thousand mile of be besides totally unacquainted with habit of bird except bird of staple inn who seek nest on ledge in gutter pipe chimneypot not constructed for by beneficent hand of nature beg therefore to be understood a foregoing bird nest picture doe represent true lover a having existence separable from of beloved object of affection a living at once doubled life halved life if clearly express what mean by that be for reason that having conversational power can not express what mean that having meaning mean what fail to express to best of belief be not case edwin have turned red turned white a certain point of picture came into light now sat looking at fire bit lip speculation of angular man resumed mr grewgious still sitting speaking exactly a before be probably erroneous on so globular topic figure to myself subject a before to mr edwin correction that there can be coolness lassitude doubt indifference no half fire half smoke state of mind in real lover pray be at near mark in picture a abrupt in conclusion a in commencement progress jerked inquiry at edwin stopped when one might have supposed in middle of oration must say sir stammered edwin a refer question to yes said mr grewgious refer to a authority must say then sir edwin went on embarrassed that picture have drawn be generally correct submit that perhaps may be rather hard upon unlucky lover likely so assented mr grewgious likely so be hard man in grain may not show said edwin feel may not there stopped so long to find rest of sentence that mr grewgious rendered difficulty thousand time greater by unexpectedly striking in with to be sure may not after that sat silent silence of mr bazzard being occasioned by slumber responsibility be very great though said mr grewgious at length with eye on fire edwin nodded assent with eye on fire let be sure that trifle with one said mr grewgious with with other edwin bit lip again still sat looking at fire must not make plaything of treasure woe betide if doe let take well to heart said mr grewgious though said thing in short sentence much a supposititious charity boy just now referred to might have repeated verse two from book of proverb there be something dreamy for so literal man in way in now shook right forefinger at live coal in grate again fell silent not for long a sat upright stiff in chair suddenly rapped knee like carved image of queer joss other coming out of reverie said must finish bottle mr edwin let help ill help bazzard too though be asleep mightnt like else helped helped drained glass stood bottom upward on table a though have just caught bluebottle in now mr edwin proceeded wiping mouth hand upon handkerchief to little piece of business received from other day certified copy of miss rosa father will knew content before received from a matter of business must have sent to mr jasper for miss rosa wishing to come straight to in preference received quite safely sir must have acknowledged receipt said mr grewgious business being business world over however did not meant to have acknowledged when first came in evening sir not business like acknowledgment returned mr grewgious however let that pas now in document have observed few word of kindly allusion to being left to to discharge little trust confided to in conversation at such time a in discretion may think best yes sir mr edwin came into mind just now when be looking at fire must in discretion acquit myself of trust at better time than present favour with attention minute took bunch of key from pocket singled out by candle light key wanted then with candle in hand went to bureau escritoire unlocked touched spring of little secret drawer took from ordinary ring case made for single ring with in hand returned to chair a held up for young man to see hand trembled mr edwin rose of diamond ruby delicately set in gold be ring belonging to miss rosa mother be removed from dead hand in

living dead be going to to make last irrevocable preparation for marriage take with young man took little case placed in breast if anything must be amiss if anything must be even slightly wrong between if must have secret consciousness that be committing to step for higher reason than because have long be accustomed to look forward to then said mr grewgious charge once more by living by dead

neville why do ask ask retorted jasper because be last person in company be not to be found not to be found cried neville aghast stay stay said mr crisparkle permit jasper mr neville be confounded collect thought be of great importance that must collect thought attend to will try sir seem mad left jasper last night with edwin drood yes at what hour be at twelve oclock asked neville with hand to confused head appealing to jasper quite right said mr crisparkle hour mr jasper have already named to went down to river together undoubtedly to see action of wind there what followed how long did stay there about ten minute must say not more then walked together to house took leave of at door did say that be going down to river again no said that be going straight back bystander looked at one at mr crisparkle to whom mr jasper who have be intensely watching neville said in low distinct suspicious voice what be stain upon dress eye be turned towards blood upon clothes here be same stain upon stick said jasper taking from hand of man who held know stick to be carried last night what doe mean in name of god say what mean neville urged mr crisparkle that man said neville pointing out late adversary have struggle for stick just now may see same mark on sir what be to suppose when found molested by eight people must dream of true reason when must give none at admitted that have thought discreet to be silent that struggle have taken place yet very men who have seen looked darkly at smear bright cold air have already dried must return neville said mr crisparkle of course will be glad to come back to clear of course sir mr landless will walk at side minor canon continued looking around come neville set forth on walk back others with one exception straggled after at various distance jasper walked on other side of neville never quitted that position be silent while mr crisparkle more than once repeated former question while neville repeated former answer also while hazarded explanatory conjecture be obstinately silent because mr crisparkles manner directly appealed to to take part in discussion appeal must move fixed face when drew near to city be suggested by minor canon that might do well in calling on mayor at once assented with stern nod spake word until stood in mr sapseas parlour mr sapsea being informed by mr crisparkle of circumstance under desired to make voluntary statement before mr jasper broke silence by declaring that placed whole reliance humanly speaking on mr sapseas penetration there be conceivable reason why nephew must have suddenly absconded unless mr sapsea must suggest one then must defer there be intelligible likelihood of having returned to river be accidentally drowned in dark unless must appear likely to mr sapsea then again must defer washed hand a clean a must of horrible suspicion unless must appear to mr sapsea that such be inseparable from last companion before disappearance not on good term with previously then once more must defer own state of mind being distracted with doubt labouring under dismal apprehension be not to be safely trusted mr sapseas be mr sapsea expressed opinion that case have dark look in short here eye rested full on nevilles countenance un english complexion having made grand point wandered into denser haze maze of nonsense than even mayor might have be expected to disport in came out of with brilliant discovery that to take life of fellow creature be to take something didnt belong to wavered whether must at once issue warrant for committal of neville landless to jail under circumstance of grave suspicion might have gone so far a to do for indignant protest of minor canon who undertook for young man remaining in own house being produced by own hand whenever demanded mr jasper then understood mr sapsea to suggest that river must be dragged that bank must be rigidly examined that particular of disappearance must be sent to outlying place to london placard advertisement must be widely circulated imploring edwin drood if for unknown reason have withdrawn from uncle home society to take pity on loving kinsman sore bereavement distress somehow inform that be yet alive mr sapsea be perfectly understood for be exactly meaning though have said nothing about measure be taken towards end immediately must be difficult to determine be more oppressed with horror amazement neville landless john jasper that jasper position forced to be active while nevilles forced to be passive there must have be nothing to choose between be bowed down broken with earliest light of next morning men be at work upon river other menmost of whom volunteered for servicewere examining bank livelong day search went on upon river with barge pole drag net upon muddy

day dawned trace of edwin drood revisited light of sun day again search went on now in barge boat now ashore among osier tramping amidst mud stake jagged stone in low lying place where solitary watermark signal of strange shape showed like spectre john jasper worked toiled to purpose for still trace of edwin drood revisited light of sun setting watch for night again so that vigilant eye must be kept on change of tide went home exhausted unkempt disordered bedaubed with mud have dried upon with much of clothing torn to rag have just dropped into easy chair when mr grewgious stood before be strange news said mr grewgious strange fearful news jasper have merely lifted up heavy eye to say now dropped again a drooped worn out over one side of easy chair mr grewgious smoothed head face stood looking at fire how be ward asked jasper after time in faint fatigued voice poor little thing may imagine condition have seen sister inquired jasper a before whose curtness of counter question cool slow manner in a put mr grewgious moved eye from fire to companion face might at other time have be exasperating in depression exhaustion jasper merely opened eye to say suspected young man do suspect asked mr grewgious dont know what to think can not make up mind said mr grewgious a spoke of a suspected young man thought have made up mindi have just left miss landless illustration mr grewgious have suspicion what be state defiance of suspicion unbounded faith in brother poor thing however pursued mr grewgious be not of came to speak be of ward have communication to make will surprise at least have surprised jasper with groaning sigh turned wearily in chair will put off till to morrow said mr grewgious mind warn that think will surprise more attention concentration came into john jasper eye a caught sight of mr grewgious smoothing head again again looking at fire now with compressed determined mouth what be demanded jasper becoming upright in chair to be sure said mr grewgious provokingly slowly internally a kept eye on fire might have known sooner gave opening be exceedingly angular man that never occurred to took for granted what be demanded jasper once more mr grewgious alternately opening shutting palm of hand a warmed at fire looking fixedly at sideways never changing action look in followed went on to reply young couple lost youth miss rosa ward though so long betrothed so long recognising betrothal so near being married mr grewgious saw staring white face two quivering white lip in easy chair saw two muddy hand gripping side for hand might have thought have never seen face young couple came gradually to discovery made on side pretty equally think that must be happier better in present future life a affectionate friend say rather a brother sister than a husband wife mr grewgious saw lead coloured face in easy chair on surface dreadful starting drop bubble a if of steel young couple formed at healthy resolution of interchanging discovery openly sensibly tenderly met for purpose after innocent generous talk agreed to dissolve existing intended relation for ever ever mr grewgious saw ghastly figure rise open mouthed from easy chair lift outspread hand towards head one of young couple that one nephew fearful however that in tenderness of affection for must be bitterly disappointed by so wide departure from projected life forbore to tell secret for few day left to be disclosed by when must come down to speak to must be gone speak to be gone mr grewgious saw ghastly figure throw back head clutch hair with hand turn with writhing action from have now said have to say except young couple parted firmly though not without tear sorrow on evening when last saw together mr grewgious heard terrible shriek saw ghastly figure sitting standing saw nothing heap of torn miry clothes upon floor not changing action even then opened shut palm of hand a warmed looked down at chapter xvi devoted when john jasper recovered from fit swoon found being tended by mr mr tope whom visitor have summoned for purpose visitor wooden of aspect sat stiffly in chair with hand upon knee watching recovery there youve come to nicely now sir said tearful mr tope be thoroughly worn out wonder man said mr grewgious with usual air of repeating lesson can not have rest broken mind cruelly tormented body overtaxed by fatigue without being thoroughly worn out fear have alarmed jasper apologised faintly when be helped into easy chair not at thank answered mr grewgious be too considerate not at thank answered mr grewgious again must take wine sir said mr tope jelly have ready for that wouldnt put lip to at noon though warned what must come of know not breakfasted must have wing of roast fowl have be put back twenty time if be put back once will all be on table in five minute good gentleman belike will stop see take good gentleman replied with snort might mean yes anything nothing mr tope must have found highly mystifying that attention be divided by service of table will take something with said jasper a cloth be laid couldnt get morsel down throat thank answered mr grewgious jasper ate drank almost voraciously combined with hurry in mode of doing be evident indifference to taste of what took suggesting that ate drank to fortify against other failure of spirit far more than to gratify palate mr grewgious in meantime sat upright with expression in face hard kind of imperturbably polite protest over a though must have said in reply to invitation to discourse couldnt originate faintest approach to observation on subject thank do know said jasper when have pushed away plate glass have sat meditating for few minute do know find crumb of comfort in communication with have so much amazed do returned mr grewgious pretty plainly adding unspoken clause dont thank after recovering from shock of piece of news of dear boy so entirely unexpected so destructive of castle have built for after having have time to think of yes will be glad to pick up crumb said mr grewgious dryly be there not be thereif deceive tell so shorten painis there not be there hope that finding in new position becoming sensitively alive to awkward burden of explanation in quarter other with must load avoided awkwardness took to flight thing might be said mr grewgious pondering such thing have be have read of case in people rather than face seven day wonder have to account for to idle impertinent have taken away be long unheard of believe such thing have happened said mr grewgious pondering still when have must have suspicion pursued jasper eagerly following new track that dear lost boy have withheld anything from memost of such leading matter a gleam of light be there for in whole black sky when supposed that intended wife be here marriage close at hand how must entertain possibility of voluntarily leaving place in manner must be so unaccountable capricious cruel now know what have told be there little chink through day pierce supposing to have disappeared of own act be not disappearance more accountable le cruel fact of having just parted from ward be in sort of reason for going away doe not make mysterious departure le cruel to be true relief of cruelty to mr grewgious must not assent to even a to continued jasper still pursuing new track with ardour a did so brightening with hope knew that be coming to knew that be intrusted to tell what have told if doing so have awakened new train of thought in perplexed mind reasonably follows that from same premise might have foreseen inference must draw grant that did foresee even cruelty to meand who be ijohn jasper music master vanishes once more mr grewgious must not assent to have have distrust terrible distrust have be said jasper disclosure overpowering a be at firstshowing that own dear boy have have great disappointing reservation from who so fondly loved kindles hope within extinguish when state admit to be reasonable hope begin to believe possible here clasped hand that may have disappeared from among of own accord that may yet be alive well mr crisparkle came in at moment to whom mr jasper repeated begin to believe possible that may have disappeared of own accord may yet be alive well mr crisparkle taking seat inquiring why so mr jasper repeated argument have just set forth if have be le plausible than be good minor canon mind must have be in state of preparation to receive a exculpatory of unfortunate pupil too did really attach great importance to lost young man having be so immediately before disappearance placed in new embarrassing relation towards one acquainted with project affair fact seemed to to present question in new light stated to mr sapsea when waited on said jasper a really have done that there be quarrel difference between two young men at last meeting know that first meeting be unfortunately very far from amicable went smoothly quietly when be last together at house dear boy be not in usual spirit be depressedi noticed thatand be bound henceforth to dwell upon circumstance more now that know there be special reason for being depressed reason moreover may possibly have induced to absent pray to heaven may turn out so exclaimed mr crisparkle pray to heaven may turn out so repeated jasper knowand mr grewgious must now know likewisethat took great prepossession against mr neville landless arising out of furious conduct on first occasion know came to extremely apprehensive on dear boy behalf of mad violence know that even entered in diary showed entry to that have dark foreboding against mr grewgious ought to be possessed of whole case will not through suppression of mine be informed of part of kept in ignorance of part of wish to be good enough to understand that communication have made to have hopefully influenced mind in spite of having be before mysterious occurrence took place profoundly impressed against young landless fairness troubled minor canon much felt that be not a open in own dealing charged against reproachfully that have suppressed so far two point of second strong outbreak of temper against edwin drood on part of neville of passion of jealousy having to own certain knowledge flamed up in nevilles breast against be convinced of nevilles innocence of part in ugly disappearance yet so many little circumstance combined so wofully against that dreaded to add two more to cumulative weight be among truest of men have be balancing in mind much to distress whether volunteering to tell two fragment of truth at time must not be tantamount to piecing together of falsehood in place of truth however here be model before hesitated no longer addressing mr grewgious a one placed in authority by revelation have brought to bear on mystery surpassingly angular mr grewgious became when found in unexpected position mr crisparkle bore testimony to mr jasper strict sense of justice expressing absolute confidence in complete clearance of pupil from least taint of suspicion sooner later avowed that confidence in young gentleman have be formed in spite of confidential knowledge that temper be of hottest fiercest that be directly incensed against mr jasper nephew by circumstance of romantically supposing to be enamoured of same young lady sanguine reaction manifest in mr jasper be proof even against unlooked for declaration turned paler repeated that must cling to hope have derived from mr grewgious that if trace of dear boy be found leading to dreadful inference that have be made away with must cherish unto last stretch of possibility idea that might have absconded of own wild will now fell out that mr crisparkle going away from conference still very uneasy in mind very much troubled on behalf of young man whom held a kind of prisoner in own house took memorable night walk walked to cloisterham weir often did so consequently there be nothing remarkable in footstep tending way preoccupation of mind so hindered from planning walk taking heed of object passed that first consciousness of being near weir be derived from sound of falling water close at hand how did come here be first thought a stopped why did come here be second then stood intently listening to water familiar passage in reading about airy tongue syllable men name rose so unbidden to ear that put from with hand a if be tangible be starlight weir be full two mile above spot to young men have repaired to watch storm search have be made up here for tide have be running strongly down at time of night of christmas eve likeliest place for discovery of body if fatal accident have happened under such circumstance layboth when tide ebbed when flowed againbetween that spot sea water came over weir with usual sound on cold starlight night little must be seen of yet mr crisparkle have strange idea that something unusual hung about place reasoned with be where be put to proof sense did address sense reported anything unusual there listened again sense of hearing again checked water coming over weir with usual sound on cold starlight night knowing very well that mystery with mind be occupied might of give place haunted air strained hawk eye of for correction of sight got closer to weir peered at well known post timber nothing in least unusual be remotely shadowed forth resolved that must come back early in morning weir ran through broken sleep night be back again at sunrise be bright frosty morning whole composition before when stood where have stood last night be clearly discernible in minutest detail have surveyed closely for minute be about to withdraw eye when be attracted keenly to one spot turned back upon weir looked far away at sky at earth then looked again at one spot caught sight again immediately concentrated vision upon must not lose now though be speck in landscape fascinated sight hand began plucking off coat for struck that at spota corner of weirsomething glistened did not

cloisterham to be always black always of great virtue always calling everybody else massa missie according to sex always reading tract of obscurest meaning in broken english always accurately understanding in purest mother tongue have nearly brought mr crisparkles grey hair with sorrow to grave original expression be mr sapseas have repeatedly said must have mr crisparkles life have repeatedly said must have everybodys life become in effect last man have be brought down to cloisterham from london by eminent philanthropist why because philanthropist have expressly declared owe to fellow creature that must be in word of bentham where be cause of greatest danger to smallest number dropping shot from blunderbuss of blunderheadedness might not have hit in vital place have to stand

rearranged possession on very afternoon of disappearance watch found at weir be challenged by jeweller a one have wound set for edwin drood at twenty minute past two on same afternoon have run down before being cast into water be jeweller positive opinion that have never be re wound must justify hypothesis that watch be taken from not long after left mr jasper house at midnight in company with last person seen with that have be thrown away after being retained hour why thrown away if have be murdered so artfully disfigured concealed a that murderer hoped identification to be impossible except from something that wore assuredly murderer must seek to remove from body most lasting best known most easily recognisable thing upon thing must be watch shirt pin a to opportunity of casting into river if be object of suspicion be easy for have be seen by many person wandering about on side of cityindeed on side of itin miserable seemingly half distracted manner a to choice of spot obviously such criminating evidence have better take chance of being found anywhere rather than upon in possession concerning reconciliatory nature of appointed meeting between two young men very little must be made of in young landlesss favour for distinctly appeared that meeting originated not with with mr crisparkle that have be urged on by mr crisparkle who must say how unwillingly in what ill conditioned mood enforced pupil have gone to more case be looked into weaker became in point even broad suggestion that lost young man have absconded be rendered additionally improbable on showing of young lady from whom have so lately parted for what did say with great earnestness sorrow when interrogated that have expressly enthusiastically planned with that must await arrival of guardian mr grewgious yet be observed disappeared before gentleman appeared on suspicion thus urged supported neville be detained re detained search be pressed on hand jasper laboured night day nothing more be found no discovery being made proved lost man to be dead at length became necessary to release person suspected of having made away with be set at large then consequence ensued mr crisparkle have too well foreseen neville must leave place for place shunned cast out even have not be so dear old china shepherdess must have worried to death with fear for son with general trepidation occasioned by having inmate even have that not be so authority to minor canon deferred officially must have settled point mr crisparkle quoth dean human justice may err must act according to light day of taking sanctuary be past young man must not take sanctuary with mean that must leave house sir mr crisparkle returned prudent dean claim authority in house merely confer with on painful necessity find under of depriving young man of great advantage of counsel instruction be very lamentable sir mr crisparkle represented very much so dean assented if be necessity mr crisparkle faltered a unfortunately find to be returned dean mr crisparkle bowed submissively be hard to prejudge case sir be sensible just so perfectly a say mr crisparkle interposed dean nodding head smoothly there be nothing else to be done doubt doubt there be alternative a good sense have discovered be entirely satisfied of perfect innocence sir nevertheless e ell said dean in more confidential tone slightly glancing around must not say so generally not generally enough of suspicion attache to tono think must not say so generally mr crisparkle bowed again doe not become perhaps pursued dean to be partisan not partisan clergy keep heart warm head cool hold judicious middle course hope object sir to having stated in public emphatically that will reappear here whenever new suspicion may be awakened new circumstance may come to light in extraordinary matter not at returned dean yet do know dont think with very nice neat emphasis on two word dont think must state emphatically state ye e e emphatically o o think not in point of fact mr crisparkle keeping heart warm head cool clergy need hing emphatically so minor canon row knew neville landless more went whithersoever must must with blight upon name fame be not until then that john jasper silently resumed place in choir haggard red eyed hope plainly have deserted sanguine mood be gone worst misgiving have come back day two afterwards while unrobing took diary from pocket of coat turned leaf with impressive look without one spoken word handed entry to mr crisparkle to read dear boy be murdered discovery of watch shirt pin convinces that be murdered that night that jewellery be taken from to prevent identification by mean delusive hope have founded on separation from betrothed wife give to wind perish before fatal discovery now swear record oath on page nevermore will discus mystery with human creature until clue to in hand never will relax in secrecy in search will fasten crime of murder of dear dead boy upon murderer that devote to destruction chapter xvii philanthropy professional unprofessional full half year have come gone mr crisparkle sat in waiting room in london chief office of haven of philanthropy until must have audience of mr honeythunder in college day of athletic exercise mr crisparkle have known professor of noble art of fisticuffs have attended two three of gloved gathering have now opportunity of observing that a to phrenological formation of back of head professing philanthropist be uncommonly like pugilist in development of organ constitute attend propensity to pitch into fellow creature philanthropist be remarkably favoured there be several professor passing in out with exactly aggressive air upon of being ready for turn up with novice who might happen to be on hand that mr crisparkle well remembered in circle of fancy preparation be in progress for moral little mill somewhere on rural circuit other professor be backing that heavy weight a good for such such speech making hit so very much after manner of sporting publican that intended resolution might have be round in official manager of display much celebrated for platform tactic mr crisparkle recognised in suit of black counterpart of deceased benefactor of specie eminent public character once known to fame a frosty faced fogo who in day of yore superintended formation of magic circle with rope stake there be only three condition of resemblance wanting between professor firstly philanthropist be in very bad training much too fleshy presenting in face figure superabundance of what be known to pugilistic expert a suet pudding secondly philanthropist have not good temper of pugilist used worse language thirdly fighting code stood in great need of revision a empowering not only to bore man to rope to bore to confines of distraction also to hit when be down hit anywhere anyhow kick stamp upon gouge maul behind back without mercy in last particular professor of noble art be much nobler than professor of philanthropy mr crisparkle be so completely lost in musing on similarity dissimilarity at same time watching crowd came went by always a seemed on errand of antagonistically snatching something from somebody never giving anything to anybody that name be called before heard on at length responding be shown by miserably shabby underpaid stipendiary philanthropist who must hardly have done worse if have taken service with declared enemy of human race to mr honeythunders room sir said mr honeythunder in tremendous voice like schoolmaster issuing order to boy of whom have bad opinion sit down mr crisparkle seated mr honeythunder having signed remaining few score of few thousand circular calling upon corresponding number of family without mean to come forward stump up instantly be philanthropist go to devil shabby stipendiary philanthropist highly disinterested if in earnest gathered into basket walked off with now mr crisparkle said mr honeythunder turning chair half round towards when be alone squaring arm with hand on knee brow knitted a if added be going to make short work of now mr crisparkle entertain different view sir of sanctity of human life do returned minor canon do sir might ask said minor canon what be view on subject that human life be thing to be held sacred sir might ask pursued minor canon a before what suppose to be view on subject by george sir returned philanthropist squaring arm still more a frowned on mr crisparkle be best known to readily admitted began by saying that took different view know therefore must not say so must have set up view a mine pray what view have set up a mine here be manand young man said mr honeythunder a if made matter infinitely worse must have easily borne loss of old one swept off face of earth by deed of violence what do call murder said minor canon what do call doer of deed sir murderer said minor canon be glad to hear admit so much sir retorted mr honeythunder in most offensive manner candidly tell that didnt expect here lowered heavily at mr crisparkle again be so good a to explain what mean by very unjustifiable expression dont sit here sir returned philanthropist raising voice to roar to be browbeaten a only other person present one can possibly know that better than do returned minor canon very quietly interrupt explanation murder proceeded mr honeythunder in kind of boisterous reverie with platform folding of arm platform nod of abhorrent reflection after short sentiment of word bloodshed abel cain hold term with cain repudiate with shudder red hand when be offered instead of instantly leaping into chair cheering hoarse a brotherhood in public meeting assembled must infallibly have done on cue mr crisparkle merely reversed quiet crossing of leg said mildly dont let interrupt explanationwhen begin commandment say murder murder sir proceeded mr honeythunder platformally pausing a if took mr crisparkle to task for having distinctly asserted that said may do little murder then leave off also say will bear false witness observed mr crisparkle enough bellowed mr honeythunder with solemnity severity must have brought house down at meeting e e nough late ward being now of age being released from trust can not contemplate without thrill of horror there be account have undertaken to accept on behalf there be statement of balance have undertaken to receive can not receive too soon let tell sir wish that a man minor canon be better employed with nod better employed with nod bet ter em ployed with three nod added up mr crisparkle rose little heated in face with perfect command of mr honeythunder said taking up paper referred to being better worse employed than be at present be matter of taste opinion might think better employed in enrolling member of society ay indeed sir retorted mr honeythunder shaking head in threatening manner must have be better for if have done that long ago think otherwise said mr honeythunder shaking head again might think one of profession better employed in devoting to discovery punishment of guilt than in leaving duty to be undertaken by layman may regard profession from point of view teach that first duty be towards who be in necessity tribulation who be desolate oppressed said mr crisparkle however a have quite clearly satisfied that be part of profession to make profession say more of owe to mr neville to mr nevilles sister in much lower degree to myself to say to that know be in full possession understanding of mr nevilles mind heart at time of occurrence without in least colouring concealing what be to be deplored in required to be corrected feel certain that tale be true feeling that certainty befriend a long a certainty will last will befriend if consideration must shake in resolve must be so ashamed of myself for meanness that man good opinionno womansso gained must compensate for loss of own good fellow manly fellow be so modest too there be more self assertion in minor canon than in schoolboy who have stood in breezy playing field keeping wicket be simply staunchly true to duty alike in large case in small so true soul ever be so true soul ever be ever be ever will be there be nothing little to really great in spirit then who do make out did deed asked mr honeythunder turning on abruptly heaven forbid said mr crisparkle that in desire to clear one man must lightly criminate accuse one tcha ejaculated mr honeythunder with great disgust for be by mean principle on philanthropic brotherhood usually proceeded sir be not disinterested witness must bear in mind how be interested one inquired mr crisparkle smiling innocently at loss to imagine there be certain stipend sir paid to for pupil may have warped judgment bit said mr honeythunder coarsely perhaps expect to retain still mr crisparkle returned enlightened do mean that too well sir returned professional philanthropist getting up thrusting hand down into trouser pocket dont go about measuring people for cap if people find have about that fit em can put em on wear em if like thats look out not mine mr crisparkle eyed with just indignation took to task thus mr honeythunder hoped when came in here might be under necessity of commenting on introduction of platform manner platform manuvres among decent forbearance of private life have given such specimen of must be fit subject for if remained silent respecting be detestable dont suit dare say sir be repeated mr crisparkle without noticing interruption detestable violate equally justice must belong to christian restraint must belong to gentleman assume great crime to have be committed by one whom acquainted with attendant circumstance having numerous reason on side devoutly believe to be innocent of because differ from on vital point what be platform

yourself for must blush quoting figure know to be a wilfully onesided a statement of complicated account must be creditor side debtor debtor side creditor therefore be mr honeythunder consider platform sufficiently bad example sufficiently bad school even in public life hold carried into private life becomes unendurable nuisance be strong word sir exclaimed philanthropist hope so said mr crisparkle good morning walked out of haven at great rate soon fell into regular brisk pace soon have smile upon face a went along wondering what china shepherdess must have said if have seen pounding
