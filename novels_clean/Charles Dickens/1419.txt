probably case with most reading matter except when be of highly beneficial kind for posterity be thrown off in few moment of leisure by superior poetic genius who scorn to take prose pain must be admitted however that barbox by mean hurried heart being in work of good nature revelled in there be joy too be true joy to of sometimes sitting by listening to phoebe a picked out more more discourse from musical instrument a natural taste ear refined daily upon first discovery besides being pleasure be occupation in course of week consumed hour resulted that dreaded birthday be close upon before
