servant appropriated to last be small room with sofa bed have communication with landing place other door that conducted to bedroom be to occupy on side of fireplace be cupboard without lock flush with wall covered with same dull brown paper examined cupboard only hook to suspend female dress nothing else sounded wall evidently solid outer wall of building having finished survey of apartment warmed few moment lighted cigar then still accompanied by f went forth to complete reconnoitre in landing place there be door be closed firmly sir said servant in surprise unlocked door with others when first came can not have got locked from inside for be before have finished sentence door of then be touching opened quietly of looked at other single instant same thought seized human agency might be detected here rushed in first servant followed small blank dreary room without furniture few empty box hamper in corner small window shutter closed not even fireplace other door that by have entered no carpet on floor floor seemed very old uneven worm eaten mended here there a be shown by whiter patch on wood living being visible place in living being must have hidden a stood gazing round door by have entered closed a quietly a have before opened be imprisoned for first time felt creep of undefinable horror not so servant why dont think to trap sir must break trumpery door with kick of foot try first if will open to hand said shaking off vague apprehension have seized while open shutter see what be without unbarred shutter window looked on little back yard have before described there be ledge without nothing sheer descent man getting out of window must have found footing till have fallen on stone below f meanwhile be vainly attempting to open door now turned round to asked permission to use force must here state in justice to servant far from evincing superstitious terror nerve composure even gayety amidst circumstance so extraordinary compelled admiration made congratulate on having secured companion in way fitted to occasion willingly gave permission required though be remarkably strong man force be a idle a milder effort door did not even shake to stoutest kick breathless panting desisted then tried door equally in vain a ceased from effort again that creep of horror came over time be more cold stubborn felt a if strange ghastly exhalation be rising from chink of rugged floor filling atmosphere with venomous influence hostile to human life door now very slowly quietly opened a of own accord precipitated into landing place saw large pale light a large a human figure shapeless unsubstantial move before ascend stair led from landing into attic followed light servant followed entered to right of landing small garret of door stood open entered in same instant light then collapsed into small globule exceedingly brilliant vivid rested moment on bed in corner quivered vanished approached bed examined half tester such a be commonly found in attic devoted to servant on drawer stood near perceived old faded silk kerchief with needle still left in rent half repaired kerchief be covered with dust probably have belonged to old woman who have last died in house might have be sleeping room have sufficient curiosity to open drawer there be few odds end of female dress two letter tied round with narrow ribbon of faded yellow took liberty to posse of letter found nothing else in room worth noticing did light reappear distinctly heard a turned to go pattering footfall on floor just before went through other attic in four footfall still preceding nothing to be seen nothing footfall heard have letter in hand just a be descending stair distinctly felt wrist seized faint soft effort made to draw letter from clasp only held more tightly effort ceased regained bedchamber appropriated to then remarked that dog have not followed when have left be thrusting close to fire trembling be impatient to examine letter while read servant opened little box in have deposited weapon have ordered to bring took out placed on table close at bed head then occupied in soothing dog who however seemed to heed very little letter be short be dated date exactly thirty five year ago be evidently from lover to mistress husband to young wife not only term of expression distinct reference to former voyage indicated writer to have be seafarer spelling handwriting be of man imperfectly educated still language be forcible in expression of endearment there be kind of rough wild love here there be dark unintelligible hint at secret not of love secret that seemed of crime ought to love other be one of sentence remember for how one else must execrate if be known again dont let one be in same room with at night talk in sleep again whats done cant be undone tell there nothing against unless dead must come to life here be interlined in better handwriting female do at end of letter latest in date same female hand have written word lost at sea th of june same day a put down letter began to muse over content fearing however that train of thought into fell might unsteady nerve fully determined to keep mind in fit state to cope with whatever of marvellous advancing night might bring forth roused laid letter on table stirred up fire be still bright cheering opened volume of macaulay read quietly enough till about half past eleven then threw dressed upon bed told servant might retire to own room must keep awake bade leave open door between two room thus alone kept two candle burning on table by bed head placed watch beside weapon calmly resumed macaulay opposite to fire burned clear on hearth rug seemingly asleep lay dog in about twenty minute felt exceedingly cold air pas by cheek like sudden draught fancied door to right communicating with landing place must have got open be closed then turned glance to left saw flame of candle violently swayed a by wind at same moment watch beside revolver softly slid from table softly softly visible hand be gone sprang up seizing revolver with one hand dagger with other be not willing that weapon must share fate of watch thus armed looked round floor sign of watch three slow loud distinct knock be now heard at bed head servant called out be that sir be on guard dog now roused sat on haunch ear moving quickly backward forward kept eye fixed on with look so strange that concentred attention on slowly rose hair bristling stood perfectly rigid with same wild stare have time however to examine dog presently servant emerged from room if ever saw horror in human face be then must not have recognized have met in street so altered be lineament passed by quickly saying in whisper seemed scarcely to come from lip run run be after gained door to landing pulled open rushed forth followed into landing involuntarily calling to stop without heeding bounded down stair clinging to baluster taking several step at time heard where stood street door open heard again clap to be left alone in haunted house be for moment remained undecided whether not to follow servant pride curiosity alike forbade so dastardly flight re entered room closing door after proceeded cautiously into interior chamber encountered nothing to justify servant terror again carefully examined wall to see if there be concealed door must find trace of one not even seam in dull brown paper with room be hung how then have thing whatever be have so scared obtained ingres except through own chamber returned to room shut locked door opened upon interior one stood on hearth expectant prepared now perceived that dog have slunk into angle of wall be pressing close against a if literally striving to force way into approached animal spoke to poor brute be evidently beside with terror showed teeth slaver dropping from jaw must certainly have bitten if have touched did not seem to recognize have seen at zological garden rabbit fascinated by serpent cowering in corner may form idea of anguish dog exhibited finding effort to soothe animal in vain fearing that bite might be a venomous in state a if in madness of hydrophobia left alone placed weapon on table beside fire seated recommenced macaulay perhaps in order not to appear seeking credit for courage rather coolness reader may conceive exaggerate may be pardoned if pause to indulge in one two egotistical remark a hold presence of mind what be called courage to be precisely proportioned to familiarity with circumstance lead to so must say have be long sufficiently familiar with experiment appertain to marvellous have witnessed many very extraordinary phenomenon in various part of world phenomenon must be totally disbelieved if stated ascribed to supernatural agency now theory be that supernatural be impossible what be called supernatural be only something in law of nature of have be hitherto ignorant therefore if ghost rise before have not right to say so then supernatural be possible rather so then apparition of ghost be contrary to received opinion within law of nature namely not supernatural now in have hitherto witnessed indeed in wonder amateur of mystery in age record a fact material living agency be always required on continent will find still magician who assert that can raise spirit assume for moment that assert truly still living material form of magician be present be material agency by from constitutional peculiarity certain strange phenomenon be represented to natural sens accept again a truthful tale of spirit manifestation in america musical other sound writing on paper produced by discernible hand article of furniture moved without apparent human agency actual sight touch of hand to body seem to belong still there must be found medium living being with constitutional peculiarity capable of obtaining sign in fine in such marvel supposing even that there be imposture there must be human being like ourselves by whom through whom effect presented to human being be produced be so with now familiar phenomenon of mesmerism electro biology mind of person operated on be affected through material living agent supposing true that mesmerized patient can respond to will pass of mesmerizer hundred mile distant be response occasioned by material being may be through material fluid call electric call call what will have power of traversing space passing obstacle that material effect be communicated from one to other hence have hitherto witnessed expected to witness in strange house believed to be occasioned through agency medium a mortal a myself idea necessarily prevented awe with who regard a supernatural thing be not within ordinary operation of nature might have be impressed by adventure of memorable night a then be conjecture that be presented must be presented to sens must originate in human being gifted by constitution with power so to present having motive so to do felt interest in theory in way be rather philosophical than superstitious can sincerely say be in a tranquil temper for observation a practical experimentalist must be in awaiting effect of rare though perhaps perilous chemical combination of course more kept mind detached from fancy more temper fitted for observation must be obtained therefore riveted eye thought on strong daylight sense in page of macaulay now became aware that something interposed between page light page be overshadowed looked up saw what will find very difficult perhaps impossible to describe be darkness shaping out of air in very undefined outline can not say be of human form yet have more of resemblance to human form rather shadow than anything else a stood wholly apart distinct from air light around dimension seemed gigantic summit nearly touched ceiling while gazed feeling of intense cold seized iceberg before must not more have chilled must cold of iceberg have be more purely physical feel convinced that be not cold caused by fear a continued to gaze thought can not say with precision distinguished two eye looking down on from height one moment seemed to distinguish clearly next seemed gone two ray of pale blue light frequently shot through darkness a from height on half believed half doubted that have encountered eye strove to speak voice utterly failed must only think to be fear be not fear strove to rise in vain felt a if weighed down by irresistible force indeed impression be that of immense overwhelming power opposed to volition that sense of utter inadequacy to cope with force beyond men one may feel physically in storm at sea in conflagration when confronting terrible wild beast rather perhaps shark of ocean felt morally opposed to will be will a far superior to strength a storm fire shark be superior in material force to force of men now a impression grew on now came at last horror horror to degree that word can convey still retained pride if not courage in own mind said be horror be not fear unless fear can not be harmed reason reject thing be illusion fear with violent effort succeeded at last in stretching out hand towards weapon on table a did so on arm shoulder received strange shock arm fell to side powerless now to add to horror light began slowly to wane from candle be not a be extinguished flame seemed very gradually withdrawn be same with fire light be extracted from fuel in few minute room be in utter darkness dread came over to be thus in dark with dark thing whose power be so intensely felt brought reaction of nerve in fact terror have reached that climax that sens must have deserted must have burst through spell did burst through found voice though voice be shriek remember broke forth with word like fear soul doe not fear at same time found strength to rise still in profound gloom rushed to one of window tore aside curtain flung open shutter first thought be light when saw moon high clear calm felt joy almost compensated for previous terror there be moon there be also light from gas lamp in deserted slumberous street turned to look back into room moon penetrated shadow very palely partially still there be light dark thing might be be gone except must yet see dim shadow seemed shadow of shade against opposite wall eye now rested on table from under table be without cloth cover old mahogany round table rose hand visible a far a wrist be hand seemingly a much of flesh blood a own hand of aged person lean wrinkled small too woman hand hand very softly closed on two letter lay on table hand letter vanished then came same three loud measured knock have heard at bed head before extraordinary drama have commenced a sound slowly ceased felt whole room vibrate sensibly at far end rose a from floor spark globule like bubble of light many colored green yellow fire red azure up down to fro hither thither a tiny will o wisp spark moved slow swift at own caprice chair a in drawing room below be now advanced from wall without apparent agency placed at opposite side of table suddenly a forth from chair grew shape woman shape be distinct a shape of life ghastly a shape of death face be that of youth with strange mournful beauty throat shoulder be bare rest of form in loose robe of cloudy white began sleeking long yellow hair fell over shoulder eye be not turned toward to door seemed listening watching waiting shadow of shade in background grew darker again thought beheld eye gleaming out from summit of shadow eye fixed upon shape a if from door though did not open grew out shape equally distinct equally ghastly man shape young man be in dress of last century rather in likeness of such dress for male shape female though defined be evidently unsubstantial impalpable simulacrum phantasm there be something incongruous grotesque yet fearful in contrast between elaborate finery courtly precision of old fashioned garb with ruffle lace buckle corpse like aspect ghost like stillness of flitting wearer just a male shape approached female dark shadow darted from wall three for moment wrapped in darkness when pale light returned two phantom be a if in grasp of shadow towered between there be blood stain on breast of female phantom male be leaning on phantom sword blood seemed trickling fast from ruffle from lace darkness of intermediate shadow swallowed up be gone again bubble of light shot sailed undulated growing thicker thicker more wildly confused in movement closet door to right of fireplace now opened from aperture came form of woman aged in hand held letter very letter over have seen hand close behind heard footstep turned round a if to listen then opened letter seemed to read over shoulder saw livid face face a of man long drowned bloated bleached seaweed tangled in dripping hair at foot lay form a of corpse beside corpse cowered child miserable squalid child with famine in cheek fear in eye a looked in old woman face wrinkle line vanished became face of youth hard eyed stony still youth shadow darted forth darkened over phantom a have darkened over last nothing now be left shadow on eye be intently fixed till again eye grew out of shadow malignant serpent eye bubble of light again rose fell in disordered irregular turbulent maze mingled with wan moonlight now from globule a from shell of egg monstrous thing burst out air grew filled with larv so bloodless so hideous that can in way describe except to remind reader of swarming life solar microscope brings before eye in drop of water thing transparent supple agile chasing other devouring other form like naught ever beheld by naked eye a shape be without symmetry so movement be without order in very vagrancy there be sport came round round thicker faster swifter swarming over head crawling over right arm be outstretched in involuntary command against evil being sometimes felt touched not by invisible hand touched once felt clutch a of cold soft finger at throat be still equally conscious that if gave way to fear must be in bodily peril concentred faculty in single focus of resisting stubborn will turned sight from shadow above from strange serpent eye eye have now become distinctly visible for there though in naught else around be aware that there be will will of intense creative working evil might crush down own pale atmosphere in room began now to redden a if in air of near conflagration larv grew lurid a thing live in fire again room vibrated again be heard three measured knock again thing be swallowed up in darkness of dark shadow a if out of darkness have come into darkness all returned a gloom receded shadow be wholly gone slowly a have be withdrawn flame grew again into candle on table again into fuel in grate whole room came once more calmly healthfully into sight two door be still closed door communicating with servant room still locked in corner of wall into have convulsively niched lay dog called to movement approached animal be dead eye protruded tongue out of mouth froth gathered round jaw took in arm brought to fire felt acute grief for loss of poor favorite acute reproach accused myself of death imagined have died of fright what be surprise on finding that neck be actually broken actually twisted out of vertebr have be done in dark must not have be done by hand human a mine must there not have be human agency while in room good cause to suspect can not tell can not do more than state fact fairly reader may draw own inference surprising circumstance watch be restored to table from have be so mysteriously withdrawn have stopped at very moment be so withdrawn despite skill of watchmaker have ever gone since be will go in strange erratic way for few hour then come to dead stop be worthless nothing more chanced for rest of night indeed have long to wait before dawn broke not till be broad daylight did quit haunted house before did so revisited little blind room in servant have be for time imprisoned have strong impression for must not account that from room have originated mechanism of phenomenon if may use term have be experienced in chamber though entered now in clear day with sun peering through filmy window still felt a stood on floor creep of horror have first experienced there night before have be so aggravated by what have passed in own chamber must not indeed bear to stay more than minute within wall descended stair again heard footfall before when opened street door thought must distinguish very low laugh gained own home expecting to find runaway servant there have not presented did hear more of for three day when received letter from dated from liverpool to effect honored sir humbly entreat pardon though can scarcely hope that will think deserve unless heaven forbid saw what did feel that will be year before can recover a to being fit for service be out of question be therefore going to brother in law at ship sail to morrow perhaps long voyage may set up hing now start tremble fancy be behind humbly beg honored sir to order clothes wage be due to to be sent to mother at walworth john know address letter ended with additional apology somewhat incoherent explanatory detail a to effect have be under writer charge flight may perhaps warrant suspicion that man wished to go to australia have be somehow other fraudulently mixed up with event of night say nothing in refutation of conjecture rather suggest a one must seem to many person most probable solution of improbable occurrence own theory remained unshaken returned in evening to house to bring away in hack cab thing have left there with poor dog body in task be not disturbed did incident worth note befall except still on ascending descending stair heard same footfall in advance on leaving house went to mr j s be at home returned key told that curiosity be sufficiently gratified be about to relate quickly what have passed when stopped said though with much politeness that have no longer interest in mystery none have ever solved determined at least to tell of two letter have read a well a of extraordinary manner in have disappeared then inquired if thought have be addressed to woman who have died in house if there be anything in early history must possibly confirm dark suspicion to letter gave rise mr j seemed startled after musing few moment answered know little of woman earlier history except a before told that family be known to mine revive vague reminiscence to prejudice will make inquiry inform of result still even if must admit popular superstition that person who have be either perpetrator victim of dark crime in life must revisit a restless spirit scene in crime have be committed must observe that house be infested by strange sight sound before old woman died smile what must say must say be convinced if must get to bottom of mystery must find living human agency what believe be imposture for what object not imposture in ordinary sense of word if suddenly be to sink into deep sleep from must not awake in deep sleep must answer question with accuracy must not pretend to when awake tell what money have in pocket nay describe very thought be not necessarily imposture more than be necessarily supernatural must be unconsciously to myself under mesmeric influence conveyed to from distance by human being who have acquired power over by previous rapport granting mesmerism so far carried to be fact be right must infer from that mesmerizer might produce extraordinary effect others have witnessed over inanimate object fill air with sight sound impress sens with belief in never having be en rapport with person acting on what be commonly called mesmerism must not do there may be power akin to mesmerism superior to power that in old day be called magic that power may extend to inanimate object of matter say if so must not be against nature only rare power in nature might be given to constitution with certain peculiarity cultivated by practice to extraordinary degree that power might extend over dead be over certain thought memory that dead may still retain compel not that ought properly to be called soul be far beyond human reach rather phantom of what have be most earth stained on earth to make apparent to sens be very ancient though obsolete theory upon will hazard opinion conceive power must be supernatural let illustrate what mean from experiment paracelsus describes a not difficult

ill to poor man piano fortes many of doubtless with additional key on contrary know to be sort of man that durst stake life upon must have worked engine in case of necessity although rather of fattest for such fiery trial of virtue how stood case virtue be in request on arrival of fire engine morality have devolved wholly on insurance office being case have right to gratify taste have left tea be to have nothing in return contend that most virtuous man under premise stated be entitled to make luxury of fire to hiss a must other performance that raised expectation in public mind afterwards disappointed again to cite great authority what say stagyrite in fifth book think be of metaphysics describes what call ie perfect thief a to mr howship in work of on indigestion make scruple to talk with admiration of certain ulcer have seen style beautiful ulcer now will man pretend abstractly considered thief must appear to aristotle perfect character that mr howship must be enamored of ulcer aristotle be well known be so very moral character not content with writing nichomachan ethic in one volume octavo also wrote system called magna moralia big ethic now be impossible that man who composes ethic at big little must admire thief per se a to mr howship be well known that make war upon ulcer without suffering to be seduced by charm endeavor to banish from county of middlesex truth be that however objectionable per se yet relatively to others of class thief ulcer may have infinite degree of merit be imperfection be true to be imperfect being essence very greatness of imperfection becomes perfection spartam nactus e hanc exorna thief like autolycus mr barrington grim phagednic ulcer superbly defined running regularly through natural stage may no le justly be regarded a ideal after kind than most faultless moss rose amongst flower in progress from bud to bright consummate flower amongst human flower most magnificent young female apparelled in pomp of womanhood thus not only ideal of inkstand may be imagined a mr coleridge demonstrated in celebrated correspondence with mr blackwood in by way there be not so much because inkstand be laudable sort of

to a inventor of murder father of art cain must have be man of first rate genius cain be men of genius tubal cain invented tube think such thing be originality genius of artist art be then in infancy work must be criticised with recollection of fact even tubals work must probably be little approved at day in sheffield therefore of cain cain senior mean be disparagement to say that performance be so so milton however be supposed to have thought differently by way of relating case must seem to have be rather pet murder with for retouches with apparent anxiety for picturesque effect whereat inly

anything mutton bone however be chiefly pleased with improvement a implies that milton be amateur a to shakespeare there never be better a description of murdered duke of gloucester in henry vi of duncan banquos etc sufficiently prof foundation of art having be once laid be pitiable to see how slumbered without improvement for age in fact will now be obliged to leap over murder sacred profane a utterly unworthy of notice until long after christian era greece even in age of pericles produced murder of slightest merit rome have too little originality of genius in of art to succeed where model failed in fact latin language sink under very idea of murder man be murdered how will sound in latin interfectus est interemptus est simply express homicide hence christian latinity of middle age be obliged to introduce new word such a feebleness of classic conception never ascended to murdratus est say sublimer dialect of gothic age meantime jewish school of murder kept alive whatever be yet known in art gradually transferred to western world indeed jewish school be always respectable even in dark age a case of hugh of lincoln show be honored with approbation of chaucer on occasion of performance from same school put into mouth of lady abbess recurring however for one moment to classical antiquity can not think that catiline clodius of coterie must have made first rate artist be on account to be regretted that priggism of cicero robbed country of only chance have for distinction in line a subject of murder person must have answered better than lord how must have howled with panic if have heard cethegus under bed must have be truly diverting to have listened to satisfied be gentleman that must have preferred utile of creeping into closet even into cloaca to honestum of facing bold artist to come now to dark age by that speak with precision mean par excellence tenth century time immediately before after age ought naturally to be favorable to art of murder a be to church architecture to stained glass etc accordingly about latter end of period there arose great character in art mean old man of mountain be shining light indeed need not tell that very word assassin be deduced from so keen amateur be that on one occasion when own life be attempted by favorite assassin be so much pleased with talent shown that notwithstanding failure of artist created duke upon spot with remainder to female line settled pension on for three life assassination be branch of art demand separate notice will devote entire lecture to meantime will only observe how odd be that branch of art have flourished by fit never rain pours own age can boast of fine specimen about two century ago there be most brilliant constellation of murder in class need hardly say that allude especially to five splendid work assassination of william of orange of henry iv of france of duke of buckingham will find excellently described in letter published by mr elli of british museum of gustavus adolphus of wallenstein king of sweden assassination by by be doubted by many writer harte amongst others be wrong be murdered consider murder unique in excellence for be murdered at noonday on field of battle feature of original conception occurs in other work of art that remember indeed of assassination may be studied with profit by advanced connoisseur be of exemplaria of one may say nocturna versata manu versate diurne especially nocturna in assassination of prince statesman there be nothing to excite wonder important change often depend on death from eminence on stand be peculiarly exposed to aim of artist who happens to be possessed by craving for scenical effect there be class of assassination have prevailed from early period of seventeenth century really doe surprise mean assassination of philosopher for gentleman be fact that philosopher of eminence for two last century have either be murdered at least be very near insomuch that if man call philosopher never have life attempted rest assured there be nothing in against locke philosophy in particular think unanswerable objection if needed although carried throat about with in world for seventy two

to cause of good taste by murdering old arid adust metaphysician there be room for display a man must not possibly look more like mummy when dead than have done alive thus gentleman have traced connection between philosophy art until insensibly find have wandered into own era will not take pain to characterize apart from preceded for in fact have distinct character seventeenth eighteenth century together with so much of nineteenth a have yet seen jointly compose augustan age of murder finest work of seventeenth century be unquestionably murder of sir edmondbury godfrey have entire approbation at same time must be observed that quantity of murder be not great in century at least amongst own artist perhaps be attributable to want of enlightened patronage sint mcenates non deerunt

art in pure style such a nobody need be ashamed to own a candid connoisseur will admit candid observe say for great allowance must be made in case artist can ever be sure of carrying through own fine preconception awkward disturbance will arise people will not submit to have throat cut quietly will run will kick will bite whilst portrait painter often have to complain of too much torpor in subject artist in line be generally embarrassed by too much animation at same time however disagreeable to artist tendency in murder to excite irritate subject be certainly one of advantage to world in

mannheim have absolutely fought six twenty round with accomplished english boxer merely upon inspiration so greatly be natural genius exalted sublimed by genial presence of murderer really gentleman when one hears of such thing a becomes duty perhaps little to soften extreme asperity with most men speak of murder to hear people talk must suppose that disadvantage inconvenience be on side of being

philanthropic character who undertakes to instruct people in branch of knowledge gratis at little hazard to however throw out only in way of speculation to future moralist declaring in mean time own private conviction very few men commit murder upon philanthropic patriotic principle repeating what have already said once at least a to majority of murderer be very incorrect character with respect to williams murder sublimest most entire in excellence that ever be committed will not allow to speak incidentally nothing le than entire lecture even entire course of lecture must suffice to expound merit one curious fact connected with case will mention because seems to imply that blaze of genius absolutely dazzled eye of criminal justice remember doubt not that instrument with executed first great work murder of marrs be ship carpenter mallet knife now mallet belonged to old swede one john peterson bore initial instrument williams left behind in marrs house fell into hand of magistrate now gentleman be fact that publication of circumstance of initial led immediately to apprehension of williams if made earlier must have prevented second great work murder of williamsons took place precisely twelve day after magistrate kept back fact from public for entire twelve day until second work be accomplished that finished published apparently feeling that williams have now done enough for fame that glory be at length placed beyond reach of accident a to mr thurtells case know not what to say naturally have disposition to think highly of predecessor in chair of society acknowledge that lecture be unexceptionable speaking ingenuously do really think that principal performance a artist have be much overrated admit at first be carried away by general enthusiasm on morning when murder be made known in london there be fullest meeting of amateur have ever known since day of williams old bedridden connoisseur who have got into peevish way of sneering complaining that there be nothing doing now hobbled down to clubroom such hilarity such benign expression of general satisfaction have rarely witnessed on side saw people shaking hand congratulating other forming dinner party for evening nothing be to be heard triumphant challenge of well will do be right thing be satisfied at last in midst of remember grew silent on hearing old cynical amateur l s laudator temporis acti stumping along with wooden leg entered room with usual scowl a advanced continued to growl stutter whole way not original idea in whole piece mere plagiarism base plagiarism from hint threw out besides style be a hard a albert durer a coarse a fuseli many thought that be mere jealousy general waspishness confess when first glow of enthusiasm have subsided have found most judicious critic to agree that there be something falsetto in style of thurtell fact be be member of society naturally gave friendly bias to judgment person be universally familiar to cockney gave with whole london public temporary popularity that pretension be not capable of supporting for opinionum commenta delet dy natur judicia confirmat there be however unfinished design of thurtells for murder of man with pair of dumbbell admired greatly be mere outline that never completed to mind seemed way superior to chief work remember that there be great regret expressed by amateur that sketch must have be left in unfinished state there can not agree with for fragment first bold outline of original artist have often felicity about be apt to vanish in management of detail case of mkeands consider far beyond vaunted performance of thurtell indeed above praise bearing relation in fact to immortal work of williams neid bear to iliad be now time must say few word about principle of murder not with view to regulate practice judgment a to old woman mob of newspaper reader be pleased with anything provided be bloody enough mind of sensibility requires something more first then let speak of kind of person who be adapted to purpose of murderer secondly of place where thirdly of time when other little circumstance a to person suppose be evident that ought to be good man because if be not might by possibility be contemplating murder at very time such diamond cut diamond tussle though pleasant enough where nothing better be stirring be really not what critic can allow to call murder must mention people name name who have be murdered by other people in dark lane so far seemed correct enough on looking further into matter public have become aware that murdered party be at moment planning to rob murderer at least possibly to murder if have be strong enough whenever be case may be thought to be case farewell to genuine effect of art for final purpose of murder considered a fine art be precisely same a of tragedy in aristotle account of namely to cleanse heart by mean of pity terror now terror there may be how can there be pity for one tiger destroyed by tiger be also evident that person selected ought not to be public character for instance judicious artist must have attempted to murder abraham newland for case be everybody read so much about abraham newland so few people ever saw that there be fixed belief that be abstract idea remember once when happened to mention have dined at coffee house in company with abraham newland everybody looked scornfully at a though have pretended to have played at billiards with prester john to have have affair of honor with pope by way pope must be very improper person to murder for have virtual ubiquity a father of christendom like cuckoo be so often heard never seen that suspect most people regard also a abstract idea where indeed public character be in habit of giving dinner with delicacy of season case be very different person be satisfied that be abstract idea therefore there can be impropriety in murdering only that murder will fall into class of assassination have not yet treated thirdly subject chosen ought to be in good health for be absolutely barbarous to murder sick person who be usually quite unable to bear on principle cockney ought to be chosen who be above twenty five for after age be sure to be dyspeptic at least if man will hunt in warren ought to murder couple at one time if cockney chosen must be tailor will of course think duty on old established equation to murder eighteen here in
