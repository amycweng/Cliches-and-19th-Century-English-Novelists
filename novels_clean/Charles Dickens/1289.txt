challenge that man that a must give reason for admitted that have not even known name until heard called appeared be not done on ground already explained that wish to avoid reviving unwholesome memory of murderer also because detailed account of long trial be by mean indispensable to narrative will confine closely to such incident in ten day night during jury be kept together a directly bear on own curious personal experience be in not in murderer seek to interest reader be to not to page of newgate calendar beg attention be chosen foreman of jury on second morning of trial after evidence have be taken for two hour heard church clock strike happening to cast eye over brother juryman found inexplicable difficulty in counting counted several time yet always with same difficulty in short made

drawn across door on night of second day not being disposed to lie down seeing mr harker sitting on bed went sat beside offered pinch of snuff a mr harkers hand touched mine in taking from box peculiar shiver crossed said who be following mr harkers eye looking along room saw again figure expectedthe second of two men who have gone down piccadilly rose advanced few step then stopped looked round at mr harker be quite unconcerned laughed said in pleasant way thought for moment have thirteenth juryman without bed see be moonlight making revelation to mr harker inviting to take walk with to end of room watched what figure did stood for few moment by bedside of of eleven brother juryman close to pillow always went to right hand side of bed always passed out crossing foot of next bed seemed from action of head merely to look down pensively at recumbent figure took notice of of bed be that nearest to mr harkers seemed to go out where moonlight came in through high window a by arial flight of stair next morning at breakfast appeared that everybody present have dreamed of murdered man last night except mr harker now felt a convinced that second man who have gone down piccadilly be murdered man so to speak a if have be borne into comprehension by immediate testimony even took place in manner for be not at all prepared on fifth day of trial when case for prosecution be drawing to close miniature of murdered man missing from bedroom upon discovery of deed afterwards found in hiding place where murderer have be seen digging be put in evidence having be identified by witness under examination be handed up to bench thence handed down to be inspected by jury a officer in black gown be making way with across to figure of second man who have gone down piccadilly impetuously started from crowd caught miniature from officer gave to with own hand at same time saying in low hollow tonebefore saw miniature be in locketi be younger then face be not then drained of blood also came between brother juryman to whom must have given miniature between brother juryman to whom must have given so passed on through whole of number back into possession not one of however detected at table generally when be shut up together in mr harkers custody have from first naturally discussed day proceeding good deal on fifth day case for prosecution being closed having that side of question in completed shape before discussion be more animated serious among number be vestrymanthe densest idiot have ever seen at largewho met plainest evidence with most preposterous objection who be sided with by two flabby parochial parasite three impanelled from district so delivered over to fever that ought to have be upon own trial for five hundred murder when mischievous blockhead be at loudest be towards midnight while of be already preparing for bed again saw murdered man stood grimly behind beckoning to on going towards striking into conversation immediately retired be beginning of separate series of appearance confined to long room in be confined whenever knot of brother juryman laid head together saw head of murdered man among theirs whenever comparison of note be going against must solemnly irresistibly beckon to will be borne in mind down to production of miniature on fifth day of trial have never seen appearance in court three change occurred now that entered on case for defence two of will mention together first figure be now in court continually never there addressed to always to person who be speaking at time for instance throat of murdered man have be cut straight across in opening speech for defence be suggested that deceased might have cut own throat at very moment figure with throat in dreadful condition referred to have concealed before stood at speaker elbow motioning across across windpipe now with right hand now with left vigorously suggesting to speaker impossibility of such wound having be self inflicted by hand for instance witness to character woman deposed to prisoner being most amiable of mankind figure at instant stood on floor before looking full in face pointing out prisoner evil countenance with extended arm outstretched finger third change now to be added impressed strongly a most marked striking of theorise upon accurately state there leave although appearance be not perceived by whom addressed coming close to such person be invariably attended by trepidation disturbance on part seemed to a if be prevented by law to be not amenable from fully revealing to others yet a if must invisibly dumbly darkly overshadow mind when leading counsel for defence suggested that hypothesis of suicide figure stood at learned gentleman elbow frightfully sawing at severed throat be undeniable that counsel faltered in speech lost for few second thread of ingenious discourse wiped forehead with handkerchief turned extremely pale when witness to character be confronted by appearance eye most certainly did follow direction of pointed finger rest in great hesitation trouble upon prisoner face two additional illustration will suffice on eighth day of trial after pause be day made early in afternoon for few minute rest refreshment came back into court with rest of jury little time before return of judge standing up in box looking about thought figure be not there until chancing to raise eye to gallery saw bending forward leaning over very decent woman a if to assure whether judge have resumed seat not immediately afterwards that woman screamed fainted be carried out so with venerable sagacious patient judge who conducted trial when case be over settled paper to sum up murdered man entering by judge door advanced to lordship desk looked eagerly over shoulder at page of note be turning change came over lordship face hand stopped peculiar shiver knew so well passed over faltered excuse gentleman for few moment be somewhat oppressed by vitiated air did not recover until have drunk glass of water through monotony of six of interminable ten daysthe same judge others on bench same murderer in dock same lawyer at table same tone of question answer rising to roof of court same scratching of judge pen same usher going in out same light kindled at same hour when there have be natural light of day same foggy curtain outside great window when be foggy same rain pattering dripping when be rainy same footmark of turnkey prisoner day after day on same sawdust same key locking unlocking same heavy doorsthrough wearisome monotony made feel a if have be foreman of jury for vast period of time piccadilly have flourished coevally with babylon murdered man never lost one trace of distinctness in eye be at moment le distinct than anybody else must not omit a matter of fact that never once saw appearance call by name of murdered man look at murderer again again wondered why doe not never did did look at after production of miniature until last closing minute of trial arrived retired to consider at seven minute before ten at night idiotic vestryman two parochial parasite gave so much trouble that twice returned into court to beg to have certain extract from judge note re read nine of have not smallest doubt about passage believe have one in court dunder headed triumvirate having idea obstruction disputed for very reason at length prevailed finally jury returned into court at ten minute past twelve murdered man at time stood directly opposite jury box on other side of court a took place eye rested on with great attention seemed satisfied slowly shook great gray veil carried on arm for first time over head whole form a gave in verdict guilty veil collapsed be gone place be empty murderer being asked by judge according to usage whether have anything to say before sentence of death must be passed upon indistinctly muttered something be described in leading newspaper of following day a few rambling incoherent half audible word in be understood to complain that have not have
