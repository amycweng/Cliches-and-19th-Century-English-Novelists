through slice by silently holding up to others admiration now thenwhich stimulated to new exertion to night joe several time invited by display of fast diminishing slice to enter upon usual friendly competition found time with yellow mug of tea on one knee untouched bread butter on other at last desperately considered that thing contemplated must be done that have best be done in least improbable manner consistent with circumstance took advantage of moment when joe have just looked at got bread butter down leg joe be evidently made uncomfortable by what supposed to be loss of appetite took thoughtful bite out of slice didnt seem to enjoy turned about in mouth much longer than usual pondering over good deal after gulped down like pill be about to take bite have just got head on one side

of deepest spirit have ever encountered biddy first triumph in new office be to solve difficulty have completely vanquished have tried hard at have made nothing of thus be again again again sister have traced upon slate character looked like curious t then with utmost eagerness have called attention to a something particularly wanted have in vain tried everything producible began with t from tar to toast tub at length have come into head that sign looked like hammer on lustily calling that word in sister ear have begun to hammer on table have expressed qualified assent thereupon have brought in hammer one after without avail then bethought of crutch shape being much same borrowed one in village displayed to sister with considerable confidence shook head to extent when be shown that be terrified lest in weak shattered state must dislocate neck when sister found that biddy be very quick to understand mysterious sign reappeared on slate biddy looked thoughtfully at heard explanation looked thoughtfully at sister looked thoughtfully at joe who be always represented on slate by initial letter ran into forge followed by joe why of course cried biddy with exultant face dont see orlick without doubt have lost name must only signify by hammer told why wanted to come into kitchen slowly laid down hammer wiped brow with arm took wipe at with apron came slouching out with curious loose vagabond bend in knee strongly distinguished confess that expected to see sister denounce be disappointed by different result manifested greatest anxiety to be on good term with be evidently much pleased by being at length produced motioned that must have given something to drink watched countenance a if be particularly wishful to be assured that took kindly to reception showed possible desire to conciliate there be air of humble propitiation in did such a have seen pervade bearing of child towards hard master after day day rarely passed without drawing hammer on slate without orlicks slouching in standing doggedly before a if knew more than did what to make of chapter xvii now fell into regular routine of apprenticeship life be varied beyond limit of village marsh by more remarkable circumstance than arrival of birthday paying visit to miss havisham found miss sarah pocket still on duty at gate found miss havisham just a have left spoke of estella in very same way if not in very same word interview lasted few minute gave guinea when be going told to come again on next birthday may mention at once that became annual custom tried to decline taking guinea on first occasion with better effect than causing to ask very angrily if expected more then after took so unchanging be dull old house yellow light in darkened room faded spectre in chair by dressing table glass felt a if stopping of clock have stopped time in mysterious place while everything else outside grew older stood still daylight never entered house a to thought remembrance of more than a to actual fact bewildered under influence continued at heart to hate trade to be ashamed of home imperceptibly became conscious of change in biddy however shoe came up at heel hair grew bright neat hand be always clean be not beautifulshe be common must not be like estellabut be pleasant wholesome sweet tempered have not be with more than year remember being newly out of mourning at time struck when observed to myself one evening that have curiously thoughtful attentive eye eye be very pretty very good came of lifting up own eye from task be poring atwriting passage from book to improve in two way at once by sort of stratagemand seeing biddy observant of what be about laid down pen biddy stopped in needlework without laying down biddy said how do manage be very stupid be very clever what be that manage dont know returned biddy smiling managed whole domestic life wonderfully too did not mean that though made what did mean more surprising how do manage biddy said to learn everything that learn always to keep up with be beginning to be rather vain of knowledge for spent birthday guinea on set aside greater part of pocket money for similar investment though have doubt now that little knew be extremely dear at price might a well ask said biddy how manage because when come in from forge of night one can see turning to at never turn to at biddy suppose must catch like cough said biddy quietly went on with sewing pursuing idea a leaned back in wooden chair looked at biddy sewing away with head on one side began to think rather extraordinary girl for called to mind now that be equally accomplished in term of trade name of different sort of work various tool in short knew biddy knew theoretically be already a good blacksmith a better be one of biddy said who make most of chance never have chance before came here see how improved be biddy looked at for instant went on with sewing be first teacher though wasnt said a sewed biddy exclaimed in amazement why be cry be not said biddy looking up laughing what put in head what must have put in head glistening of tear a dropped on work sat silent recalling what drudge have be until mr wopsles great aunt successfully overcame that bad habit of living so highly desirable to be got rid of by people recalled hopeless circumstance by have be surrounded in miserable little shop miserable little noisy evening school with miserable old bundle of incompetence always to be dragged shouldered reflected that even in untoward time there must have be latent in biddy what be now developing for in first uneasiness discontent have turned to for help a matter of course biddy sat quietly sewing shedding more tear while looked at thought about occurred to that perhaps have not be sufficiently grateful to biddy might have be too reserved must have patronised more though did not use that precise word in meditation with confidence yes biddy observed when have done turning over be first teacher at time when little thought of ever being together like in kitchen ah poor thing replied biddy be like self forgetfulness to transfer remark to sister to get up be busy about making more comfortable thats sadly true well said must talk together little more a used to do must consult little more a used to do let have quiet walk on marsh next sunday biddy long chat sister be never left alone now joe more than readily undertook care of on sunday afternoon biddy went out together be summer time lovely weather when have passed village church churchyard be out on marsh began to see sail of ship a sailed on began to combine miss havisham estella with prospect in usual way when came to river side sat down on bank with water rippling at foot making more quiet than must have be without sound resolved that be good time place for admission of biddy into inner confidence biddy said after binding to secrecy want to be gentleman o wouldnt if be returned dont think must answer biddy said with severity have particular reason for wanting to be gentleman know best pip dont think be happier a be biddy exclaimed impatiently be not at all happy a be be disgusted with calling with life have never taken to since be bound dont be absurd be absurd said biddy quietly raising eyebrow be sorry for didnt mean to be only want to do well to be comfortable well then understand once for never will can be comfortableor anything miserablethere biddyunless can lead very different sort of life from life lead now thats pity said biddy shaking head with sorrowful air now too have so often thought pity in singular kind of quarrel with be always carrying on be half inclined to shed tear of vexation distress when biddy gave utterance to sentiment own told be right knew be much to be regretted still be not to be helped if must have settled down said to biddy plucking up short grass within reach much a have once upon time pulled feeling out of hair kicked into brewery wallif must have settled down be half a fond of forge a be when be little know must have be much better for joe must have wanted nothing then joe must perhaps have gone partner when be out of time might even have grown up to keep company with might have sat on very bank on fine sunday quite different people must have be good enough for shouldnt biddy biddy sighed a looked at ship sailing on returned for answer yes be not over particular scarcely sounded flattering knew meant well instead of said plucking up more grass chewing blade two see how be going on dissatisfied uncomfortable andwhat must signify to being coarse common if nobody have told so biddy turned face suddenly towards mine looked far more attentively at than have looked at sailing ship be very true very polite thing to say remarked directing eye to ship again who said be disconcerted for have broken away without quite seeing where be going to be not to be shuffled off now however answered beautiful young lady at miss havishams shes more beautiful than anybody ever be admire dreadfully want to be gentleman on account having made lunatic confession began to throw torn up grass into river a if have thought of following do want to be gentleman to spite to gain over biddy quietly asked after pause dont know moodily answered because if be to spite biddy pursued must thinkbut know might be better more independently done by caring nothing for word if be to gain over must thinkbut know be not worth gaining over exactly what have thought many time exactly what be perfectly manifest to at moment how must poor dazed village lad avoid that wonderful inconsistency into best wisest of men fall day may be quite true said to biddy admire dreadfully in short turned over on face when came to got good grasp on hair on side of head wrenched well while knowing madness of heart to be so very mad misplaced be quite conscious must have served face right if have lifted up by hair knocked against pebble a punishment for belonging to idiot biddy be wisest of girl tried to reason more with put hand be comfortable hand though roughened by work upon hand one after gently took out of hair then softly patted shoulder in soothing way while with face upon sleeve cried littleexactly a have done in brewery yardand felt vaguely convinced that be very much ill used by somebody by everybody cant say be glad of one thing said biddy be that have felt must give confidence pip be glad of thing be that of course know may depend upon keeping always so far deserving if first teacher dear poor one so much in need of being taught have be teacher at present time think know what lesson must set must be hard one to learn have got beyond of use now so with quiet sigh for biddy rose from bank said with fresh pleasant change of voice will walk little farther go home biddy cried getting up putting arm round neck giving kiss will always tell everything till youre gentleman said biddy know never will be so thats always not that have occasion to tell anything for know everything knowas told at home other night ah said biddy quite in whisper a looked away at ship then repeated with former pleasant change will walk little farther go home said to biddy must walk little farther did so summer afternoon toned down into summer evening be very beautiful began to consider whether be not more naturally wholesomely situated after in circumstance than playing beggar neighbour by candle light in room with stopped clock being despised by estella thought must be very good for if must get out of head with rest of remembrance fancy must go to work determined to relish what have to do stick to make best of asked question whether did not surely know that if estella be beside at moment instead of biddy must make miserable be obliged to admit that did know for certainty said to myself pip what fool be talked good deal a walked biddy said seemed right biddy be never insulting capricious biddy to day somebody else to morrow must have derived only pain pleasure from giving pain must far rather have wounded own breast than mine how must be then did not like much better of two biddy said when be walking homeward wish must put right wish must said biddy if must only get to fall in love with youyou dont mind speaking so openly to old acquaintance oh dear not at said biddy dont mind if must only get to do must be thing for never will see said biddy did not appear quite so unlikely to that evening a must have done if have discussed few hour before therefore observed be not quite sure of biddy said be said decisively in heart believed to be right yet took rather ill too that must be so positive on point when came near churchyard have to cross embankment get over stile near sluice gate there started up from gate

evening before go away biddy said more handsomely forgiving soon exchanged affectionate good night with joe went up to bed when got into little room sat down took long look at a mean little room must soon be parted from raised above for ever be furnished with fresh young remembrance too even at same moment fell into much same confused division of mind between better room to be going a have be in so often between forge miss havishams biddy estella sun have be shining brightly day on roof of attic room be warm a put window open stood looking out saw joe come slowly forth at dark door below take turn two in air then saw biddy come bring pipe light for never smoked so late seemed to hint to that wanted comforting for reason other presently stood at door immediately beneath smoking pipe biddy stood there too quietly talking to knew that talked of for heard name mentioned in endearing tone by of more than once must not have listened for more if must have heard more so drew away from window sat down in one chair by bedside feeling very sorrowful strange that first night of bright fortune must be loneliest have ever known looking towards open window saw light wreath from joes pipe floating there fancied be like blessing from joenot obtruded on paraded before pervading air shared together put light out crept into bed be uneasy bed now never slept old sound sleep in more chapter xix morning made considerable difference in general prospect of life brightened so much that scarcely seemed same what lay heaviest on mind be consideration that six day intervened between day of departure for must not divest myself of misgiving that something might happen to london in meanwhile that when got there must be either greatly deteriorated clean gone joe biddy be very sympathetic pleasant when spoke of approaching separation only referred to when did after breakfast joe brought out indenture from press in best parlour put in fire felt be free with novelty of emancipation on went to church with joe thought perhaps clergyman wouldnt have read that about rich man kingdom of heaven if have known all after early dinner strolled out alone purposing to finish off marsh at once get done with a passed church felt a have felt during service in morning sublime compassion for poor creature who be destined to go there sunday after sunday life through to lie obscurely at last among low green mound promised must do something for one of day formed plan in outline for bestowing dinner of roast beef plum pudding pint of ale gallon of condescension upon everybody in village if have often thought before with something allied to shame of companionship with fugitive whom have once seen limping among graf be thought on sunday when place recalled wretch ragged shivering with felon iron badge comfort be that happened long time ago that have doubtless be transported long way off that be dead to might be veritably dead into bargain no more low wet ground more dike sluice more of grazing cattlethough seemed in dull manner to wear more respectful air now to face round in order that might stare a long a possible at possessor of such great expectationsfarewell monotonous acquaintance of childhood henceforth be for london greatness not for smith work in general for made exultant way to old battery lying down there to consider question whether miss havisham intended for estella fell asleep when awoke be much surprised to find joe sitting beside smoking pipe greeted with cheerful smile on opening eye said a being last time pip thought id foller joe be very glad did so thankee pip may be sure dear joe went on after have shaken hand that will never forget pip said joe in comfortable tone im sure of ay ay old chap bless be only necessary to get well round in man mind to be certain on took bit of time to get well round change come so oncommon plump didnt somehow be not best pleased with joes being so mightily secure of must have liked to have betrayed emotion to have said doe credit pip something of sort therefore made remark on joes first head merely saying a to second that tidings have indeed come suddenly that have always wanted to be gentleman have often often speculated on must do if be one have though said joe astonishing pity now joe said that did not get on little more when have lesson here isnt well dont know returned joe im so awful dull im only master of own trade be always pity a be so awful dull more of pity now than wasthis day twelvemonthdont see what have meant be that when came into property be able to do something for joe must have be much more agreeable if have be better qualified for rise in station be so perfectly innocent of meaning however that thought must mention to biddy in preference so when have walked home have have tea took biddy into little garden by side of lane after throwing out in general way for elevation of spirit must never forget said have favour to ask of be biddy said that will not omit opportunity of helping joe on little how helping on asked biddy with steady sort of glance well joe be dear good fellowin fact think be dearest fellow ever livedbut be rather backward in thing for instance biddy in learning manner although be looking at biddy a spoke although opened eye very wide when have spoken did not look at o manner wont manner do then asked biddy plucking black currant leaf dear biddy do very well here o do very well here interrupted biddy looking closely at leaf in hand hear outbut if be to remove joe into higher sphere a will hope to remove when fully come into property must hardly do justice dont think know that asked biddy be such very provoking question for have never in most distant manner occurred to that said snappishly biddy what do mean biddy having rubbed leaf to piece between handsand smell of black currant bush have ever since recalled to that evening in little garden by side of lanesaid have never considered that may be proud proud repeated with disdainful emphasis o there be many kind of pride said biddy looking full at shaking head pride be not of one kind well what be stopping for said not of one kind resumed biddy may be too proud to let one take out of place that be competent to fill fill well with respect to tell truth think be though sound bold in to say so for must know far better than do now biddy said be very sorry to see in did not expect to see in be envious biddy grudging be dissatisfied on account of rise in fortune cant help showing if have heart to think so returned biddy say so say so over over again if have heart to think so if have heart to be so mean biddy said in virtuous superior tone dont put off upon be very sorry to see aits bad side of human nature did intend to ask to use little opportunity might have after be gone of improving dear joe after ask nothing be extremely sorry to see in biddy repeated aits bad side of human nature whether scold approve of returned poor biddy may equally depend upon trying to do lie in power here at time opinion take away of will make difference in remembrance of yet gentleman must not be unjust said biddy turning away head again warmly repeated that be bad side of human nature in sentiment waiving application have since seen reason to think be right walked down little path away from biddy biddy went into house went out at garden gate took dejected stroll until supper time again feeling very sorrowful strange that second night of bright fortune must be a lonely unsatisfactory a first morning once more brightened view extended clemency to biddy dropped subject

strayed in showed where to lay hand during whole interval went to bottom of staircase heard footstep saw light pas above heard ceaseless low cry before left next day there be revival of difference between estella be ever revived on similar occasion there be four similar occasion to best of remembrance did miss havishams manner towards estella in anywise change except believed to have something like fear infused among former characteristic be impossible to turn leaf of life without putting bentley drummles name upon must very gladly on certain occasion when finch be assembled in force when

indiscriminate contradiction finally promotion of good feeling be declared to have gone ahead at amazing rate tell lightly be light thing to for can not adequately express what pain gave to think that estella must show favour to contemptible clumsy sulky booby so very far below average to present moment believe to have be referable to pure fire of generosity disinterestedness in love for must not endure thought of stooping to hound doubt must have be miserable whomsoever have favoured worthier object must have caused different kind degree of distress be easy for to find out did soon find out

time passed mill pond bank herbert be pulling pair of oar in going returning saw blind towards east come down herbert be rarely there le frequently than three time in week never brought single word of intelligence be at alarming still knew that there be cause for alarm must not get rid of notion of being watched once received be haunting idea how many undesigning person suspected of watching must be hard to calculate in short be always full of fear for rash man who be in hiding herbert have sometimes said to that found pleasant to stand at one of window after dark when tide be running down to think that be flowing with everything bore towards clara thought with dread that be flowing towards magwitch that black mark on surface might be pursuer going swiftly silently surely to take chapter xlvii week passed without bringing change waited for wemmick made sign if have never known out of little britain have never enjoyed privilege of being on familiar footing at castle might have doubted not so for moment knowing a did worldly affair began to wear gloomy appearance be pressed for money by more than one creditor even began to know want of money mean of ready money in own pocket to relieve by converting easily spared article of jewelery into cash have quite determined that must be heartless fraud to take more money from patron in existing state of uncertain thought plan therefore have sent unopened pocket book by herbert to hold in own keeping felt kind of satisfactionwhether be false kind true hardly knowin not having profited by generosity since revelation of a time wore on impression settled heavily upon that estella be married fearful of having confirmed though be conviction avoided newspaper begged herbert to whom have confided circumstance of last

thinking of long after have ascended to cloud in large watch case still must not make out be still thinking of when came out of theatre hour afterwards found waiting for near door how do do said shaking hand with a turned down street together saw that saw saw mr pip returned yes of course saw who else be there who else be strangest thing said mr wopsle drifting into lost look again yet must swear to becoming alarmed entreated mr wopsle to explain meaning whether must have noticed at first for being there said mr wopsle going on in same lost way cant be positive yet think must

for if have ever be out of thought for few moment together since hiding have begun be in very moment when be closest to to think must be so unconscious off guard after care be a if have shut avenue of hundred door to keep out then have found at elbow must not doubt that be there because be there that however slight appearance of danger there might be about danger be always near active put such question to mr wopsle a when did man come in must not tell that saw over shoulder saw man be not until have seen for time that began to identify have from first vaguely associated with known a somehow belonging to in old village time how be dressed prosperously not noticeably otherwise thought in black be face at disfigured believed not believed not too for although in brooding state have taken no

refreshment after fatigue of evening parted be between twelve one oclock when reached temple gate be shut one be near when went in went home herbert have come in held very serious council by fire there be nothing to be done saving to communicate to wemmick what have night found out to remind that waited for hint a thought might compromise if went too often to castle made communication by

client went to gerrard street three together in hackney coach a soon a got there dinner be served although must not have thought of making in place most distant reference by so much a look to wemmicks walworth sentiment yet must have have objection to catching eye now then in friendly way be not to be done turned eye on mr jagger whenever raised from table be a dry distant to a if there be twin
