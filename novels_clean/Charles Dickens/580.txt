roguish twinkle in sparkling eye must have made way to far le susceptible bosom than of nathaniel pipkin there be such joyous sound in merry laugh that sternest misanthrope must have smiled to hear even old lobbs in very height of ferocity must resist coaxing of pretty daughter when cousin kate arch impudent looking bewitching little person made dead set upon old man together a to say truth very often did must have refused nothing even have asked for portion of countless inexhaustible treasure be hidden from light in iron safe 'nathaniel pipkin heart beat high within when saw enticing little couple hundred yard before one summer evening in very field in have many time strolled about till night time pondered on beauty of maria lobbs though have often thought then how briskly must walk up to maria lobbs tell of passion if must only meet felt now that be unexpectedly before blood in body mounting to face manifestly to great detriment of leg deprived of usual portion trembled beneath when stopped to gather hedge flower listen to bird nathaniel pipkin stopped too pretended to be absorbed in meditation a indeed really be for be thinking what on earth must ever do when turned back a

permitted to rise accepted lover of maria lobbs upon merry laughter of miss lobbs rang through calm evening air without seeming to disturb though have such pleasant sound wicked little cousin laughed more immoderately than before nathaniel pipkin blushed deeper than ever at length maria lobbs being more strenuously urged by love worn little man turned away head whispered cousin to say at event kate did say that felt much honoured by mr pipkin address that hand heart be at father disposal that nobody must be insensible to mr pipkin merit a be said with much gravity a nathaniel pipkin walked home with maria lobbs struggled for kiss at parting went to bed happy man dreamed night long of softening old lobbs opening strong box marrying maria next day nathaniel pipkin saw old lobbs go out upon old gray pony after great many sign at window from wicked little cousin object meaning of must by mean understand bony apprentice with thin leg came over to say that master be coming home night that lady expected mr pipkin to tea at six o'clock precisely how lesson be got through day nathaniel pipkin pupil knew more than do be got through somehow after boy have gone nathaniel pipkin took full six o'clock to dress to satisfaction not that took long to select garment must wear inasmuch a have choice about matter putting of on to best advantage touching of up previously be task of inconsiderable difficulty importance 'there be very snug little party consisting of maria lobbs cousin kate three four romping good humoured rosy cheeked girl nathaniel pipkin have ocular

then rose turned away sadly mournfully not with bitter cry despairing lamentation for knew that must one day meet again once more mixed with busy world content cheerfulness be restored cloud settled upon picture concealed from sexton view 'what do think of said goblin turning large face towards gabriel grub 'gabriel murmured out something about being very pretty looked somewhat ashamed a goblin bent fiery eye upon 'you miserable man said goblin in tone of excessive contempt appeared disposed to add more indignation choked utterance so lifted up one of very pliable leg flourishing above head

wise pig of thoughtful reserved demeanour animal superior to fellow whose grunt be terrible whose bite be sharp young prince sighed deeply a looked upon countenance of majestic swine thought of royal father eye be bedewed with tear sagacious pig be fond of bathing in rich moist mud not in summer a common pig do now to cool did even in distant age be proof that light of civilisation have already begun to dawn though feebly in cold sharp day of winter coat be ever so sleek complexion so clear that prince resolved to essay purifying quality of same water that friend resorted to made trial
