over worthy creature merely ask if be satisfied now how can be anything else said answering for trottle who sat obstinately silent time jarber have not only read delightfully amusing story have also answered question about house of course stand empty now who must think of taking after have be turned into caravan looked at trottle a said last word jarber waved hand indulgently in same direction let excellent person speak said jarber be about to say good man only wished to ask sir said trottle doggedly if must kindly oblige with date two in connection with last story date repeated jarber doe man want with date must be glad to know with great respect persisted trottle if person named magsman be last tenant who lived in house be opinion if may be excused for giving that most decidedly be not with word trottle made low bow quietly left room there be denying that jarber when be left together looked sadly discomposed have evidently forgotten to inquire about date in spite of magnificent talk about series of discovery be quite a plain that two story have just read have really truly exhausted present stock thought bound in common gratitude to help out of embarrassment by timely suggestion so proposed that must come to tea again on next monday evening thirteenth must make such inquiry in meantime a might enable to dispose triumphantly of trottle objection gallantly kissed hand made neat little speech of acknowledgment took leave for rest of week must not encourage trottle by allowing to refer to house at suspected be making own inquiry about date put question to on monday evening thirteenth that dear unfortunate jarber came punctual to appointed time looked so terribly harassed that be really quite spectacle of feebleness fatigue saw at glance that question of date have gone against that mr magsman have not be last tenant of house that reason of emptiness be still to seek what have gone through said jarber word be not eloquent enough to tell o sophonisba have begun series of discovery accept last two a story laid on shrine wait to blame for leaving curiosity unappeased until have heard number three number three looked like very short manuscript said a much jarber explained to that be to have poetry time in course of investigation have stepped into circulating library to seek for information on one important subject library people knew about house be that female relative of last tenant a believed have just after tenant left sent little manuscript poem to described a referring to event have actually passed in house wanted proprietor of library to publish have written no address on letter proprietor have kept manuscript ready to be given back to publishing of poem not being in line when might call for have never called for poem have be lent to jarber at express request to read to before began rang bell for trottle being determined to have present at new reading a wholesome check on obstinacy to surprise peggy answered bell told that trottle have stepped out without saying where instantly felt strongest possible conviction that be at old trick that stepping out in evening without leave meant philandering controlling on visitor account dismissed peggy stifled indignation prepared a politely a might be to listen to jarber
