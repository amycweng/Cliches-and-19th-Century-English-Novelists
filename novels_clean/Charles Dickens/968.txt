such character ever existed will not offer plea on behalf to so powerful genteel body will make remark on character of jonas chuzzlewit conceive that sordid coarseness brutality of jonas must be unnatural if there have be nothing in early education in precept example always before to engender develop vice make odious so born so bred admired for made hateful justified from cradle in cunning treachery avarice claim a legitimate issue of father upon whom vice be seen to recoil submit that recoil upon old man in unhonoured age be not mere piece of poetical justice be extreme exposition of direct truth make comment solicit reader attention to in consideration of tale because nothing be more common in real life than want of profitable reflection on cause of many vice crime awaken general horror what be substantially true of family in respect be true of whole commonwealth a sow reap let reader go into child side of prison in england grieve to add of many workhouse judge whether be monster who disgrace street people hulk penitentiary overcrowd penal colony be creature whom have deliberately suffered to be bred for misery ruin american portion of story be in other respect caricature than a be exhibition for most part mr bevan expected of ludicrous side only of american character of side be four twenty year ago from nature most obtrusive most likely to be seen by such traveller a young martin mark tapley a have never in writing fiction have disposition to soften what be ridiculous wrong at home so then hoped that good humored people of united state must not be generally disposed to quarrel with for carrying same usage abroad be happy to believe that confidence in great nation be not misplaced when book be first published be given to understand by authority

especially of proceeding of certain brandywine association be printed in time newspaper in june july at about time when be engaged in writing part of book remain on file of time newspaper of course in writing hope have taken available opportunity of showing want of sanitary improvement in neglected dwelling of poor mr sarah gamp be four twenty year ago fair representation of hired attendant on poor in sickness hospital of london be in many respect noble institution in others very defective think not least among instance of mismanagement that mr betsey prig be fair specimen of hospital nurse that

dinner given to on th of april in city of new york by two hundred representative of press of united state of america made following observation among others so much of voice have lately be heard in land might have be contented with troubling further from present standing point be not duty with henceforth charge not only here on suitable occasion whatsoever wheresoever to express high grateful sense of second reception in america to bear honest testimony to national generosity magnanimity also to declare how astounded have be by amazing change have seen around on side change moral change physical change in amount of land subdued peopled change in rise of vast new city change in growth of older city almost out of recognition change in grace amenity of life change in press without whose advancement advancement can take place anywhere be believe so arrogant a to suppose that in five twenty year there have be change in have nothing to learn extreme impression to correct when be here first brings to point on have ever since landed in united state last november observed strict silence though sometimes tempted to break in reference to will with good leave take into confidence now even press being human may be sometimes mistaken misinformed rather think have in one two rare instance observed information to be not strictly accurate with reference to indeed have now again be more surprised by printed news have read of than by printed news have ever read in present state of existence thus vigour perseverance with have for month past be collecting material for hammering away at new book on america have much astonished seeing that time declaration have be perfectly well known to publisher on side of atlantic that consideration on earth must induce to write one have intended

at to night also to record have be in smallest place equally with largest have be received with unsurpassable politeness delicacy sweet temper hospitality consideration with unsurpassable respect for privacy daily enforced upon by nature of avocation here state of health testimony so long a live so long a descendant have legal right in book will cause to be republished a appendix to copy of two book of mine in have referred to america will do cause to be done not in mere love thankfulness because regard a act of plain justice honour said word with greatest earnestness must lay upon repeat in print here with equal earnestness so long a book will last hope that will form part of will be fairly read a inseparable from experience impression of america charles dickens may chapter one introductory concerning pedigree of chuzzlewit family a lady gentleman with claim to polite breeding can possibly sympathize with chuzzlewit family without being first assured of extreme antiquity of race be great satisfaction to know that undoubtedly descended in direct line from adam eve be in very earliest time closely connected with agricultural interest if must ever be urged by grudging malicious person that chuzzlewit in period of family history displayed overweening amount of family pride surely weakness will be considered not only pardonable laudable when immense superiority of house to rest of mankind in respect of ancient origin be taken into account be remarkable that a there be in oldest family of have record murderer vagabond so never fail to meet in record of old family with innumerable repetition of same phase of character indeed may be laid down a general principle that more extended ancestry greater amount of violence vagabondism for in ancient day two amusement combining wholesome excitement with promising mean of repairing shattered fortune be at once ennobling pursuit healthful recreation of quality of land consequently be source of inexpressible comfort happiness to find that in various period of history chuzzlewits be actively connected with diver slaughterous conspiracy bloody fray be further recorded of that being clad from head to heel in steel of proof did on many occasion lead leather jerkined soldier to death with invincible courage afterwards return home gracefully to relation friend there can be doubt that at least one chuzzlewit came over with conqueror doe not appear that illustrious ancestor 'came over ' monarch to employ vulgar phrase at subsequent period inasmuch a family seem to have be ever greatly distinguished by possession of landed estate be well known that for bestowal of kind of property upon favourite liberality gratitude of norman be a remarkable a virtue be usually found to be in great men when give away what belongs to other people perhaps in place history may pause to congratulate upon enormous amount of bravery wisdom eloquence virtue gentle birth true nobility appears to have come into england with norman invasion amount genealogy of ancient family lends aid to swell must beyond question have be found to be just a great to full a prolific in giving birth to long line of chivalrous descendant boastful of origin even though william conqueror have be william conquered change of circumstance be quite certain must have made manner of difference in respect there be unquestionably chuzzlewit in gunpowder plot if indeed arch traitor fawkes be not scion of remarkable stock a might easily have be supposing chuzzlewit to have emigrated to spain in previous generation there intermarried with spanish lady by whom have issue one olive complexioned son probable conjecture be strengthened if not absolutely confirmed by fact can not fail to be interesting to who be curious in tracing progress of hereditary taste through life of unconscious inheritor be notable circumstance that in later time many chuzzlewits being unsuccessful in other pursuit have without smallest rational hope of enriching conceivable reason set up a coal merchant have month after month continued gloomily to watch small stock of coal without in one instance negotiating with purchaser remarkable similarity between course of proceeding that adopted by great ancestor beneath vault of parliament house at westminster be too obvious too full of interest to stand in need of comment be also clearly proved by oral tradition of family that there existed at one period of history be not distinctly stated matron of such destructive principle so familiarized to use composition of inflammatory combustible engine that be called 'the match maker ' by nickname byword be recognized in family legend to day surely there can be reasonable doubt that be spanish lady mother of chuzzlewit fawkes there be one other piece of evidence bearing immediate reference to close connection with memorable event in english history must carry conviction even to mind if such mind there be remaining unconvinced by presumptive proof there be within few year in possession of highly respectable in way credible unimpeachable member of chuzzlewit family for bitterest enemy never dared to hint at being otherwise than wealthy man dark lantern of undoubted antiquity rendered still more interesting by being in shape pattern extremely like such a be in use at present day now gentleman since deceased be at time ready to make oath did again again set forth upon solemn asseveration that have frequently heard grandmother say when contemplating venerable relic aye be carried by fourth son on fifth of november when be guy fawkes remarkable word wrought a well might strong impression on mind be in habit of repeating very often just interpretation bear conclusion to lead be triumphant irresistible old lady naturally strong minded be nevertheless frail fading be notoriously subject to confusion of idea to say least of speech to age garrulity be liable slight very slight confusion apparent in expression be manifest be ludicrously easy of correction aye ' will be observed that emendation be necessary to be made in two initiative remark aye lantern be carried by forefather ' not fourth son be preposterous 'on fifth of november be guy fawkes here have remark at once consistent clear natural in strict accordance with character of speaker indeed anecdote be so plainly susceptible of meaning other that must be hardly worth recording in original state be not proof of what may be very often be affected not only in historical prose in imaginative poetry by exercise of little ingenious labour on part of commentator have be said that there be instance in modern time of chuzzlewit having be found on term of intimacy with great here again sneering detractor who weave such miserable figment from malicious brain be stricken dumb by evidence for letter be yet in possession of various branch of family from distinctly appears being stated in so many word one diggory chuzzlewit be in habit of perpetually dining with duke humphrey so constantly be guest at nobleman table indeed so unceasingly be grace hospitality companionship forced a be upon that find uneasy full of constraint reluctance writing friend to effect that if fail to do so so by bearer will have choice to dine again with duke humphrey expressing in very marked extraordinary manner a one surfeited of high life gracious company have be rumoured be needle to say rumour originated in same base quarter that certain male chuzzlewit whose birth must be admitted to be involved in obscurity be of very mean low descent how stand proof when son of individual to whom secret of father birth be supposed to have be communicated by father in lifetime lay upon deathbed question be put to in distinct solemn formal way chuzzlewit who be grandfather ' to with last breath le distinctly solemnly formally replied word be taken down at time signed by six witness with name address in full lord zoo may be said have be said for human wickedness have limit that there be lord of name that among title have become extinct none at resembling in sound even be to be discovered what be irresistible inference rejecting theory broached by well meaning mistaken person that mr toby chuzzlewit grandfather to judge from name must surely have be mandarin be wholly insupportable for there be pretence of grandmother ever having be out of country of mandarin having be in within year of father birth except in tea shop can not for moment be regarded a having bearing on question one way other rejecting hypothesis be not manifest that mr toby chuzzlewit have received name imperfectly from father that have forgotten that have mispronounced that even at recent period in question chuzzlewits be connected by bend sinister kind of heraldic over left with unknown noble illustrious house from documentary evidence yet preserved in family fact be clearly established that in comparatively modern day of diggory chuzzlewit before mentioned one of member have attained to very great wealth influence throughout such fragment of correspondence a have escaped ravage of moth who in right of extensive absorption of content of deed paper may be called general register of insect world find making constant reference to uncle in respect of whom must seem to have entertained great expectation a be in habit of seeking to propitiate favour by present of plate jewel book watch other valuable article thus writes on one occasion to brother in reference to gravy spoon brother property diggory must appear to have borrowed otherwise possessed of ' be angry have parted with to uncle ' on occasion express in similar manner with regard to child mug have be entrusted to to get repaired on occasion say have bestowed upon irresistible uncle of mine everything ever possessed that be in habit of paying long constant visit to gentleman at mansion if indeed did not wholly reside there be manifest from following sentence 'with exception of suit of clothes carry about with whole of wearing apparel be at present at uncle ' gentleman patronage influence must have be very extensive for nephew writes 'his interest be too high 'it be too much 'it be tremendous ' like still doe not appear be strange to have procured for lucrative post at court elsewhere to have conferred upon other distinction than be necessarily included in countenance of so great man being invited by to certain entertainment so splendid costly in nature that call 'golden ball be needle to multiply instance of high lofty station vast importance of chuzzlewits at different period if came within scope of reasonable probability that further proof be required might be heaped upon other until formed alp of testimony beneath boldest scepticism must be crushed beaten flat a goodly tumulus be already collected decently battened up above family grave present chapter be content to leave a be merely adding by way of final spadeful that many chuzzlewits male female be proved to demonstration on faith of letter written by own mother to have have chiselled nose undeniable chin form might have served sculptor

solitary one must have utterly settled clenched business in hand for be well known on authority of book treat of such matter one of phenomenon especially that of chiselling be invariably peculiar to only make apparent in person of very best condition history having to own perfect satisfaction consequently to full contentment of reader proved chuzzlewits to have have origin to have be at one time other of importance can not fail to render highly improving acceptable acquaintance to right minded individual may now proceed in earnest with task having shown that must have have by reason of ancient birth pretty large share in foundation increase of human family will one day become province to submit that such of member a will be introduced in page have still many counterpart prototype in

human race having once be monkey that men do play very strange extraordinary trick secondly yet without trenching on blumenbach theory a to descendant of adam having vast number of quality belong more

'then sir ' said mark rubbing hand job done go on sir if please be attention throwing back in arm chair looking at fire with now then glance at mark who at such time nodded head sagely to express profound interest attention martin ran over chief point in history to same effect a have related week before to mr pinch adapted according to best of judgment to mr tapley comprehension with view made a light of love affair a must referred to in very few word here reckoned without host for mark interest be keenest in part of business prompted to ask sundry question in relation to for apologised a one in measure privileged to do so from having seen a martin explained to young lady at blue dragon 'and young lady a gentleman ought to feel more proud of being in love with ' said mark energetically

be clad in least engaging of three hundred sixty five dress in wardrobe of year be raw damp dark dismal cloud be a muddy a ground short perspective of street avenue be closed up by mist a by filthy curtain weather indeed martin bitterly soliloquised be wandering up down here in like thief fine weather indeed for meeting of lover in open air in public walk need be departing with speed for country for have come to pretty pas in might perhaps have gone on to reflect that of morning in year be not best calculated for young lady coming forth on such errand either be stopped on road to reflection if thought tended that way by appearance at short distance on hurried forward to meet squire mr tapley at same time fell discreetly back surveyed fog above with appearance of attentive interest dear martin ' said mary bey dear mary ' said martin lover be such singular kind of people that be did say just then though martin took arm hand too paced up down short walk be least exposed to observation dozen time have changed at love since parted ' said martin at length a looked upon with proud delight 'it be only to be more beautiful than ever have be of common metal of love worn young lady must have denied in most interesting manner must have told that knew have become perfect fright that have wasted away with weeping anxiety that be dwindling gently into early grave that mental suffering be

frank full deep affection for object of early love saw in one who for sake be outcast from home fortune have more idea of bestowing that love upon in other than cheerful sustaining word full of high hope grateful trustfulness than have of being unworthy of in lightest thought deed for base temptation that world must offer 'what change be there in martin ' replied 'for that concern nearest look more anxious more thoughtful than used ' a to that love ' said martin a drew waist within arm first looking round to see that there be observer near beholding mr tapley more intent than ever on fog must be strange if did not for life especially of late have be hard one ' know must have be answered 'when have forgotten to think of ' 'not often hope ' said martin 'not often be sure not often have

say if did answered raising head after short silence looking once more into face be for grief to think of what be resolved to undergo for must not venture to dissuade martin be long long distance there be wide ocean to be crossed illness want be sad calamity in place in foreign country dreadful to endure have thought of 'thought of ' cried martin abating in fondness be very fond of hardly iota of usual impetuosity 'what be to do be very well to say have thought of love must ask in same breath have thought of starving at home have thought of doing porter work for living have thought of holding horse in street to earn roll of bread from day to day come come ' added in gentler tone ' hang down head dear for need encouragement that sweet face alone can give why be well now be brave

that there be one near that mark be still intent upon fog not only looked at lip too kissed into bargain be going to america with great prospect of doing well of returning home very soon may be to

letter have written overnight then resumed fellow employment living in fellow house by fellow mean mr pecksniff of course there be certain person of name of pinch forget poor strange simple oddity mary thoroughly honest sincere full of zeal with cordial regard for mean to return one of day by setting up in life in way other ' old kind nature martin ' said martin 'that be not worth speaking of love be very grateful desirous to serve be more than repaid now one night told pinch history about in be not little interested can tell for know aye may look surprised longer better for becomes have heard play organ in church of village before now have seen listening to music have caught inspiration from too ' organist cried mary thank from heart ' 'yes be ' said martin 'and be get nothing for

be well have occurred to stay if read have written intend sending to by post to night will explain dear tom pinch be rather familiar perhaps said martin suddenly remembering that be proud when have last met call dear tom pinch because like plea ' right very kind ' said mary 'exactly so ' cried martin 'it a well to be kind whenever one can a said before really be excellent fellow dear tom pinch address under cover to mr lupin at blue dragon have begged in short note to deliver to without saying anything about elsewhere to do same with future letter may receive from reason for so doing will be at once apparent to know that will be by bye said martin breaking off be slow of comprehension poor fellow will find out in time reason simply be that want letter to be read by other people particularly by scoundrel whom think angel pecksniff again asked mary 'the same said martin ' will be at once apparent to have completed arrangement for going to america will be surprised to hear that be to be accompanied by mark tapley upon whom have stumbled strangely in london who insists on putting under protection ' meaning love ' said martin breaking off again 'our friend in rear of course ' be delighted to hear bestowed kind glance upon mark brought eye down from fog to encounter received with immense satisfaction said in hearing too that be good soul merry creature must be faithful be certain commendation mr tapley inwardly resolved to deserve from such lip if died for 'now dear pinch resumed martin proceeding with letter ' be going to repose great trust in knowing may do so with perfect reliance on honour secrecy having nobody else just now to trust in ' think must say that martin ' 'must well will take out be perfectly true though ' might seem ungracious perhaps mind pinch ' said martin 'there be occasion to stand on ceremony with however will take out a wish make full stop at secrecy very well will not only be letter again know ' ' understand ' will not only enclose letter to young lady of whom have told to charge to be forwarded a may request most earnestly commit young lady to care regard in event of meeting in absence have reason to think that probability of encountering other perhaps very frequently be now neither remote few although in position can do very little to lessen uneasiness of hers trust to implicitly to do much so deserve confidence have reposed in see dear mary ' said martin 'it will be great consolation to to have anybody matter how simple with whom can speak about very first time talk to pinch will feel at once that there be more occasion for embarrassment hesitation in talking to than if be old woman 'however may be returned smiling 'he be friend be enough ' yes be friend ' said martin 'certainly in fact have told in so many

be here there certainly be not letter end thus knowing need not impress nature extent of confidence upon at greater length a be already sufficiently established in mind will only say in bidding farewell looking forward to next meeting will charge from time through change for better with advancement happiness a if be own may rely upon always believe dear tom pinch faithfully friend martin

breast of other men so kindred vice know other in hiding place day when virtue be incredulous blind 'the quarter gone cried mr tapley in voice of admonition will be ready to return immediately said 'one thing dear martin be bound to tell entreated few minute since only to answer what asked in reference to one theme must must know otherwise must not be at ease since separation of be unhappy

rose from rocking chair before stove so disturbed hot air balmy whiff of soup fanned brow odour of stale tobacco became so decidedly prevalent a to leave doubt of proceeding mainly from gentleman attire indeed a martin walked behind to bar room must not help thinking that great square major in listlessness langour looked very much like stale weed such a might be hoed out of public garden with great advantage to decent growth of preserve tossed on congenial dunghill encountered more weed in bar room of whom being thirsty soul a well a dirty be pretty stale in one sense pretty fresh in among

deeper into house of life than sultan scimitar must reach rare incense on altar having grateful scent in patriotic nostril curling upward to seventh heaven of fame once twice when there be pause martin asked such question a naturally occurred to being stranger about national poet theatre literature art information gentleman be in condition to give on such topic did not extend beyond effusion of such master spirit of time a colonel diver mr jefferson brick others renowned a appeared for excellence in achievement of peculiar style of broadside essay called ' screamer 'we be busy people sir

quite beneath notice have taken part in conversation round stove have gone forth with rest now when heard martin sigh for third fourth time interposed with casual remark a if desired without obtruding upon stranger notice to engage in cheerful conversation if must motive be so obvious yet so delicately expressed that martin felt really grateful to showed so in manner of reply ' will not ask ' said gentleman with smile a rose moved towards 'how like country for can quite anticipate feeling on point a be american consequently bound to begin with question will ask how like colonel 'you be so very frank ' returned martin have hesitation in saying like at though must add that be beholden to for civility in bringing here arranging for stay on pretty reasonable term by way added remembering that

'he may get into trouble otherwise be not slave state be ashamed to say that spirit of tolerance be not so common anywhere in latitude a form be not remarkable for behaving very temperately to other when differ to stranger really think have better go with ' martin called to immediately to be of party so cicero truck went one way three went walked about city for two three hour seeing from best point of view pausing in principal street before such public building a mr bevan pointed out night then coming on apace martin proposed that must adjourn to mr pawkins establishment for coffee in be overruled by new acquaintance who seemed to have set heart on carrying though be only for hour to house of friend of who lived hard by feeling however disinclined be being weary that must be in bad taste not very gracious to object that be unintroduced when open hearted gentleman be so ready to be sponsor martin for once in life at event sacrificed own will pleasure to wish of consented with fair grace so travelling have done that much good already mr bevan knocked at door of very neat house of moderate size from parlour window of light be shining brightly into now dark street be quickly opened by man with thoroughly irish face that seemed a if ought a matter of right principle to be in rag must have sort of business to be looking cheerfully at anybody out of whole suit of clothes commending mark to care of phenomenon for such may be said to have be in martin eye mr bevan led way into room have shed cheerfulness upon street to whose occupant introduced mr chuzzlewit a gentleman from england whose acquaintance have recently have pleasure to make gave welcome in courtesy politeness in le than five minute time found sitting very much at ease by fireside becoming vastly well acquainted with whole family there be two young lady one eighteen other twenty very slender very pretty mother who looked a martin thought much older more faded than ought to have looked grandmother little sharp eyed quick old woman who seemed to have got past stage to have come right again besides there be young lady father young lady brother first engaged in mercantile affair second student at college in certain cordiality of manner like own friend not unlike in face be great wonder for soon appeared that be near relation martin must not help tracing family pedigree from two young lady because be foremost in thought not only from being a aforesaid very pretty by reason of wearing miraculously small shoe thinnest possible silk stocking rocking chair developed to distracting extent there be doubt that be monstrous comfortable circumstance to be sitting in snug well furnished room warmed by cheerful fire full of various pleasant decoration including four small shoe like amount of silk stocking yes why not foot leg therein enshrined there be doubt that martin be monstrous well disposed to regard position in light after recent experience of screw of mr pawkins boarding house consequence be that made very agreeable indeed by time tea coffee arrived with sweet preserve cunning tea cake in train be in highly genial state much esteemed by whole family delightful circumstance turned up before first cup of tea be drunk whole family have be in england there be pleasant thing martin be not quite so glad of when found that knew great duke lord viscount marquess duchess knight baronet quite affectionately be beyond everything interested in least particular concerning however when asked after wearer of coronet said 'be quite well ' martin answered oh yes never better ' when said 'his lordship mother duchess be much changed ' martin said 'oh dear must know anywhere if saw to morrow so got on pretty well in like manner when young lady questioned touching gold fish in grecian fountain in such such nobleman conservatory whether there be a many a there used to be gravely reported after mature consideration that there must be at least twice a many a to exotics 'oh well be of use talking about must be seen to be believed improved state of circumstance reminded family of splendour of brilliant festival comprehending whole british peerage court calendar to be

said when said that upon word honour wished norris father mr norris mother miss norris daughter mr norris junior son must only take up permanent residence in england give pleasure of everlasting friendship occupied very considerable time martin thought rather stange in sort inconsistent during whole of narration in very meridian of enjoyment thereof mr norris father mr norris junior son who corresponded post with four member of english peerage enlarged upon inestimable advantage of having such arbitrary distinction in enlightened land where there be nobleman nature nobleman where society be based on one broad level of brotherly love natural equality indeed mr norris father gradually expanding into oration on swelling theme be becoming tedious when mr bevan diverted thought by happening to make causal inquiry relative to occupier of next house in reply to same mr norris father observed that 'that person entertained religious opinion of must approve therefore have honour of knowing gentleman mr norris mother added reason of own same in effect varying in word to wit that believed people be well enough in way be not genteel little trait came out impressed on martin forcibly mr bevan told about mark negro then appeared that norris be abolitionist be great relief to hear martin be so much encouraged on finding in such company that expressed sympathy with oppressed wretched black now one of young lady prettiest most delicate be mightily amused at earnestness with spoke on craving leave to ask why be quite unable for time to speak for laughing a soon however a must told that negro be funny people so excessively ludicrous in manner appearance that be wholly impossible for who knew well to associate serious idea with very absurd part of creation mr norris father mr norris mother miss norris sister mr norris junior brother even mr norris senior grandmother be of opinion laid down a absolute matter of fact a if there be nothing in suffering slavery grim enough to cast solemn air on human animal though be a ridiculous physically a most grotesque of ape morally a mildest nimrod among tuft hunting republican short ' said mr norris father settling question comfortably 'there be natural antipathy between race 'extending ' said martin friend in low voice 'to cruellest of torture bargain sale of unborn generation mr norris son said nothing made wry face dusted finger a hamlet might after getting rid of yorick skull just a though have that moment touched negro of black have come off upon hand in order that talk might fall again into former

be coyness about very way of pouring out tea tom quite revelled in when asked what must like to have for dinner faltered out 'chops a reasonably good suggestion after last night successful supper tom grew quite facetious rallied desperately know tom ' said sister blushing ' be not quite confident think must make beef steak pudding if tried tom ' 'in whole catalogue of cookery there be nothing must like so much a beef steak pudding ' cried tom slapping leg to give greater force to reply 'yes dear be excellent if must happen not to come quite right first time ' sister faltered 'if must happen not to be pudding exactly must turn out stew soup something of sort will not be vexed tom will ' serious way in looked at tom way in tom looked at way in gradually broke into merry laugh at own expense must have enchanted 'why ' said tom 'this be capital give new uncommon interest in dinner put into lottery for beefsteak pudding be impossible to say what may get may make wonderful discovery perhaps

excellent pudding at event be sure that will think so there be naturally something so handy brisk about ruth that if said must make bowl of faultless turtle soup must believe tom be right be precisely that sort of person nobody ought to have be able to resist coaxing manner nobody have business to try yet never seemed to know be manner at be best of well washed up breakfast cup chatting away whole

with wonderful expertness never once sticking needle into face although be humming pet tune from first to last beating time with finger of left hand upon neckcloth have sooner done than off be again there stood once more a brisk busy a bee tying that compact little chin of hers into equally compact little bonnet intent on bustling out to butcher without minute loss of time inviting tom to come see steak cut with own eye a to tom be ready to go anywhere so off trotted arm in arm a nimbly a please saying to other what quiet street be to lodge in how very cheap what airy situation to see butcher slap steak before laid on block give knife sharpening be to forget breakfast instantly be agreeable too really be to see cut off so smooth juicy there be nothing savage in act although knife be large keen be piece of art high art there be delicacy of touch clearness of tone skillful handling of subject fine shading be triumph of mind over matter quite perhaps greenest cabbage leaf ever grown in garden be wrapped about steak before be delivered over to tom butcher have sentiment for business knew how to refine upon when saw tom putting cabbage leaf into pocket awkwardly begged to be allowed to do for 'for meat said with emotion be humoured not drove ' back went to lodging again after have bought egg flour such small matter tom sat gravely down to write at one end of parlour table while ruth prepared to make pudding at other end for there be nobody in house old woman landlord being mysterious sort of man who went out early in morning be scarcely ever seen saving in mere household drudgery waited on be writing tom ' inquired sister laying hand upon shoulder see dear ' said tom leaning back in chair looking up in face ' be very anxious of course to obtain suitable employment before mr westlock come afternoon think may a well prepare little description of myself qualification such a must show to friend of have better do same for tom also said sister casting down

gentle push have boldness enough for dumpling ' 'you will call pudding tom mind told not ' ' may a well call till prof to be something else said tom 'oh be going to work in earnest be ' aye aye that be in such pleasant earnest moreover that tom attention wandered from writing moment first tripped into kitchen for flour then for pie board then for egg then for butter then for jug of water then for rolling pin then for pudding basin then for pepper then for salt making separate journey for everything laughing time started off afresh when material be collected be horrified to find have apron on so ran upstairs by way of variety to fetch did put on upstairs came dancing down with in hand being one of little woman to whom apron be most becoming little vanity took immense time to arrange having to be carefully smoothed down beneath oh heaven what wicked little stomacher to be gathered up into little plait by string before must be tied to be tapped rebuked wheedled at pocket before must set right at last did when did never mind be sober chronicle then there be cuff to be tucked up for fear of flour have little ring to pull off finger must come off foolish little ring during whole of preparation looked demurely now then at tom from under dark eyelash a if be part of pudding indispensable to composition for life soul of tom must get further in writing than ' respectable young man aged thirty five notwithstanding show made of being supernaturally quiet going about on tiptoe lest must disturb only served a additional mean of distracting attention keeping upon 'tom ' said at last in high glee 'tom 'what now ' said tom repeating to 'aged thirty five ' 'will look here moment please a if have be looking time be going to begin tom wonder why butter inside of basin said busy little sister more than do dare say replied tom laughing believe know anything about ' 'what infidel be tom how else do think must turn out easily when be done for civil engineer land surveyor not to know that goodness tom ' be wholly out of question to try to write tom lined out bespectable young man aged thirty five sat looking on pen in hand with one of most loving smile imaginable such busy little woman a be so full of self importance trying so hard not to smile seem uncertain about anything be perfect treat to tom to see with brow knit rosy lip pursed up kneading away at crust rolling out cutting up into strip lining basin with shaving off fine round rim chopping up steak into small piece raining down pepper salt upon packing into basin pouring in cold water for gravy never venturing to steal look in direction lest gravity must be disturbed until at last basin being full only wanting top crust clapped hand covered with paste flour at tom burst out heartily into such charming little laugh of triumph that pudding need have have other seasoning to commend to taste of reasonable man on earth 'where be pudding ' said tom for be cutting joke tom be 'where ' answered holding up with hand 'look at ' 'that pudding ' said tom 'it will be stupid fellow when be covered in ' returned sister tom still pretending to look incredulous gave tap on head with rolling pin still laughing merrily have returned to composition of top crust when started turned very red tom started too for following eye saw john westlock in room goodness john how did come in ' beg pardon ' said john ' sister pardon especially met old lady at street door who requested to enter here a did hear knock door be open made bold to do so hardly know ' said john with smile of must be disconcerted at having accidentally intruded upon such agreeable domestic occupation so very agreeably skillfully pursued must confess that be tom will kindly come to relief ' john westlock ' said tom bey sister ' hope that a sister of so old friend ' said john laughing 'you will have goodness to detach first impression of from unfortunate entrance ' sister be not indisposed perhaps to say same to on own behalf retorted tom john said of course that be quite unnecessary for have be transfixed in silent admiration held out hand to miss pinch who must take however by reason of flour paste upon own might seem calculated to increase general confusion render matter worse have in reality best effect in world for of must help laughing so found on easy term immediately be delighted to see ' said tom beit down ' can only think of sitting down on one condition ' returned friend be that sister go on with pudding a if be still alone ' 'that be sure will ' said tom 'on one other condition be that stay help to eat ' poor little ruth be seized with palpitation of heart when tom committed appalling indiscretion for felt that if dish turned out failure never must be able to hold up head before john westlock again quite unconscious of state of mind john accepted invitation with imaginable heartiness after little more pleasantry concerning same pudding tremendous expectation made believe to entertain of blushingly resumed occupation took chair ' be here much earlier than intended tom will tell brings think can answer for being glad to hear be that anything wish to show ' 'oh dear cried tom who have forgotten blotted scrap of paper in hand until inquiry brought to recollection ' respectable young man aged thirty five beginning of description of myself be ' think will have occasion to finish tom how be never told have friend in london ' tom looked at sister with might certainly sister looked with might at 'friends in london ' echoed tom 'ah said westlock 'to be sure friend in london ruth dear '

came in when be invited instead of standing gaping staring about on landing well when came in found be stranger grave business like sedate looking stranger mr westlock said be name said favour of few word with said pray be seated sir said here john stopped for instant to glance towards table where tom sister listening attentively be still busy with basin by time made noble appearance then resumed 'the pudding having taken chair tom ' 'what ' cried tom 'having taken chair 'you said pudding ' 'no ' replied john colouring rather ' chair idea of stranger coming into room at past eight o'clock in

present residing yes in london yes have casually heard in roundabout way that have left situation with mr pecksniff be that fact yes be did want yes did ' 'certainly said tom nodding head what impressed upon may rest assured that set point beyond possibility of mistake gave distinctly to understand that might make up mind about very well ' then said think can accommodate ' tom sister stopped short 'lord bless ' cried tom dear think can accommodate ' 'of course begged ' pursued john westlock glancing at tom sister who be not le eager in interest than tom proceed said must undertake to see immediately replied that have very little to say being man of few word such a be be to purpose so indeed turned out for immediately went on to tell that friend of be in want of kind of secretary librarian that although salary be small being only hundred pound year with board lodging still duty be not heavy there post be vacant ready for acceptance ' gracious cried tom ' hundred pound year dear john ruth love hundred pound year 'but strangest part of story resumed john westlock laying hand on tom wrist to bespeak attention repress ecstasy for moment strangest part of story miss pinch be know man from adam neither doe man know tom ' 'he ca ' said tom in great perplexity 'if be londoner know one in london ' on observing ' john resumed still keeping hand upon tom wrist have doubt must excuse freedom took in inquiring who directed to how came to know of change have taken place in friend position how came to be acquainted with friend peculiar fitness for office a have described drily said that be not at liberty to enter into explanation 'not at liberty to enter into explanation repeated tom drawing long breath ' must be perfectly aware said ' john added 'that to person who have ever be in mr pecksniff neighbourhood mr thomas pinch acquirement be a well known a church steeple blue dragon ' blue dragon repeated tom staring alternately at friend sister think of that spoke a familiarly of blue dragon give word a if have be mark tapley opened eye can tell when did so must not fancy have ever seen man before although said with smile know blue dragon mr westlock kept up there once twice kept up there so did remember tom tom nodded with great significance falling into state of deeper perplexity than before observed that be most unaccountable extraordinary

life tom there expects to call morning now know a much of strange incident a do upon honour ' tom face between exultation in hundred pound year wonder at narration be only to be equalled by face of sister on there sat very best expression of blooming surprise that painter must have wished to see what beef steak pudding must have come to if have not be by time finished astrology must hardly determine 'tom said ruth after little hesitation mr westlock in friendship for know more of than chooses to tell ' 'no indeed cried john eagerly 'it be not so assure wish be can not take credit to

ungenerous in to be so suspicious of when repose implicit faith in have unbounded confidence in pudding miss pinch laughed at soon got back into serious vein discussed subject with profound gravity else be obscure in business appeared to be quite plain that tom be offered salary of one hundred pound year being main point surrounding obscurity rather set off than otherwise tom being in great flutter wished to start for austin friar instantly waited nearly hour by john advice before departed tom made a spruce a must before leaving home when john westlock through half opened parlour door have glimpse of brave little sister brushing collar of coat in passage taking up loose stitch in glove hovering lightly about about touching up here there in height of quaint little old fashioned

fips occupied two chair mr fips took office stool from stuffing whereof drew forth piece of horse hair of immense length put into mouth with great appearance of appetite looked at tom pinch curiously with entire freedom from such expression a must be reasonably construed into unusual display of interest after short silence during mr fips be so perfectly unembarrassed a to render manifest that must have broken sooner without hesitation if have felt inclined to do so asked if mr westlock have made offer fully known to mr pinch john answered in affirmative 'and think worth while sir do ' mr fips inquired of tom ' think piece of great good fortune sir ' said tom ' be exceedingly obliged to for offer ' 'not to ' said mr fips act upon instruction 'to friend sir then said tom 'to gentleman with

that so far mistrust that think likely to impose on tom regardlessness of on kind nature of good quality have intention replied john 'of conveying such impression to be exceedingly sorry to have done so 'but entertain ' said martin 'you ask so pointedly directly ' returned other can not deny having accustomed to regard a one who not in wantonness in mere thoughtlessness of character did not sufficiently consider nature did not quite treat a deserves to be treated be much easier to slight than to appreciate tom pinch ' be not said warmly be energetically spoken too for there be subject in

with preface related circumstance connected with having presided over illness slow recovery of patient at bull tacked on to skirt of narrative tom own account of business on wharf martin be not little puzzled when came to end for two story seemed to have connection with other to leave a phrase be abroad 'if will excuse for one moment ' said john rising ' will beg almost immediately to come into

host have spoken when tom pinch introduced be young man with deep black hair eye be gaunt pale evidently have not long recovered from severe illness stood a martin entered sat again at john desire eye be cast downward for one glance at half in humiliation half in entreaty kept so sat quite still silent 'this person name be lewsome ' said john westlock have mentioned to a having be seized with illness at inn near here undergone so much have have very hard time of ever since began to recover a see be now doing well a did not move speak john westlock made pause martin not knowing what to say said that be glad to hear short statement that wish to hear from own lip mr chuzzlewit ' john pursued looking attentively at not at martin 'he made to for first time yesterday repeated to morning without least variation of essential particular have already told that informed before be removed from inn that have secret to disclose to lay heavy on mind fluctuating between sickness health between desire to relieve of dread of involving by revealing have until yesterday avoided disclosure never pressed for having idea of weight import of right to do so until within few day past when understanding from on own voluntary avowal in letter from country that related to person whose name be jonas chuzzlewit thinking that might throw light on little mystery made tom anxious now then urged point upon heard statement a will now from own lip be due to to say that in apprehension of death committed to writing sometime since folded in sealed paper addressed to must not resolve however to place of own act in hand have paper in breast believe at moment ' young man touched hastily in corroboration of fact will be well to leave in charge perhaps said john 'but mind now a said held up

from 'but out of sight in heaven name ' will remain here ' john whispered with ' softly turning key upon a went out conducted martin into adjoining room in have be before martin be so amazed so shocked confounded by what have heard that be time before must reduce to order in mind must sufficiently comprehend bearing of one part upon to take in detail at one view when at length have whole narrative clearly before john westlock went on to point out great probability of guilt of jonas being known to other people who traded in for own benefit who be by such mean able to exert control over tom pinch have accidentally witnessed unconsciously assisted appeared so plain that agreed upon without difficulty instead of deriving least assistance from source found that embarrassed more knew nothing of real party who possessed power only person before be tom landlord have right to question tom landlord even if must find according to tom account must not be easy to do granting that did

person to decide upon course must be taken to get at view must be impossible for mr pecksniff view be certain to be nature of mr pecksniff view in reference to own son in law might be easily reckoned upon apart from consideration martin must not endure thought of seeming to grasp at unnatural charge against relative using a stepping stone to grandfather favour that must seem to do so if presented before grandfather in mr pecksniff house again for purpose of declaring that mr pecksniff of men must represent conduct in despicable light perfectly well knew on other hand to be in possession of such statement take measure of further inquiry in reference to be tantamount to being partner in guilt professed to disclose in word be wholly unable to discover outlet from maze of difficulty did not lie through perplexed entangled thicket although mr tapley be promptly taken into confidence fertile imagination of gentleman suggested many bold expedient to do justice be quite ready to carry into instant operation on own personal responsibility still 'bating general zeal of mr tapley nature nothing be made particularly clearer by offer of service be in position of affair that tom account of strange behaviour of decayed clerk on night of tea party became of great moment finally convinced that to arrive at more accurate knowledge of working of old man mind memory must be to take most important stride in pursuit of truth so having first satisfied that communication have ever taken place between lewsome mr chuffey must have accounted at once for suspicion latter might entertain unanimously resolved that old clerk be man wanted like unanimous resolution of public meeting will oftentimes declare that grievance be not to be borne moment longer be nevertheless borne for century
