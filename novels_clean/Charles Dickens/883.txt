with habit of getting under lee of shelter waterside character acquire waterside character at present in question led way to leeside of six jolly fellowship porter before spoke look round here lawyer lightwood at red curtain fellowship ouse a told wouldnt run away have run away not showing much impressed by remarkable confirmation of informer evidence lightwood inquired what other business have

outsider flickered in wind also within door mr inspector be at study a of yore recognized friend instant reappeared reappearance have effect on composure not even circumstance that riderhood be conductor moved otherwise than a took dip of ink seemed by settlement of chin in stock to propound to personage without looking at question what have be up to last mortimer lightwood asked must be so

that have several time reckoned up gaffer have never be able to bring to satisfactory criminal total that if story be true be only in part true that two men very shy character must have be jointly pretty equally in that man have spotted other to save get money think added mr inspector in conclusion that if go well with he in tolerable way of getting a be fellowship gentleman where light be

who may not try for place there duty to do will do under circumstance to best of judgment ability speaking a shipper of lime began eugene man have better right to do than know said mr inspector hope not said eugene father having be shipper of lime before grandfather before in fact having be family immersed to crown of head in lime during several generation beg to observe if missing lime must be got hold of without young female relative of distinguished gentleman engaged in lime trade cherish next to life being present think might be more agreeable proceeding to assisting bystander be to say

yes said bradley headstone in slurring way for mind scarcely seemed to touch point so smoothly did glide to there be possibility to consider man who have worked way might come to admire sister might even in time bring to think of marrying sister must be sad drawback heavy penalty upon if overcoming in mind other inequality of condition other consideration against inequality consideration remained in full force thats much own meaning sir ay ay said bradley headstone spoke of mere brother now case have supposed must be much stronger case because admirer husband must form connexion voluntarily besides being obliged to proclaim brother be not after know must be said of that couldnt help while must be said of with equal reason that must thats true sir sometimes since lizzie be left free by father death have thought that young woman might soon acquire more than enough to pas muster sometimes have even thought that perhaps miss peecher for purpose must advise not miss peecher bradley

figure paused on pavement at outer door mr eugene wrayburn aint said miss wren so be told be answer may come in if youre good be not good said eugene ill come in gave hand to jenny wren gave hand to lizzie stood leaning by door at lizzies side have be strolling with cigar said be smoked out gone by time have strolled round to return in direction that might look in a passed have not seen brother to night yes said lizzie whose manner be little troubled gracious condescension on brother part mr eugene wrayburn thought have passed young gentleman on bridge yonder who be friend with schoolmaster to be sure looked like lizzie sat so still that one must not have said fact of manner being troubled be expressed yet one must not have doubted eugene be a easy a ever perhaps a sat with eye cast down might have be rather more perceptible that attention be concentrated upon for certain moment than concentration upon subject for short time ever be elsewhere have nothing to report lizzie said eugene having promised that eye must be always kept on mr riderhood through friend lightwood like occasionally to renew assurance that keep promise keep friend up to mark must not have doubted sir generally confess man to be doubted returned eugene coolly for why be asked sharp miss wren because dear said airy eugene be bad idle dog then why dont reform be good dog inquired miss wren because dear

to come here certain night in week give certain instruction wouldnt want if hadnt be self denying daughter sister know that good to have must never have so devoted to brother having then why not have especially when friend miss jenny here must profit by too if proposed to be teacher to attend lesson obviously incongruous a to might a well be on other side of globe not on globe at false pride lizzie because true pride wouldnt shame be shamed by thankless brother true pride wouldnt have schoolmaster brought here like doctor to look at bad case true pride must go to work do know well enough for know that own true pride must do to morrow if have way mean false pride wont let supply very well add more than false pride doe wrong to doe wrong to dead father how to father mr wrayburn asked with anxious face how to father can ask by perpetuating consequence of ignorant blind obstinacy by resolving not to set right wrong did by determining that deprivation to condemned forced upon will always rest upon head chanced to be subtle string to sound in who have so spoken to brother within hour sounded far more forcibly because of change in speaker for moment passing appearance of earnestness complete conviction injured resentment of suspicion generous unselfish interest quality in usually so light careless felt to be inseparable from touch of opposite in own breast thought have so far below so different rejected disinterestedness because of vain misgiving that sought out heeded personal attraction that might descry in poor girl pure of heart purpose must not bear to think sinking before own eye a suspected of drooped head a though have done wicked grievous injury broke into silent tear dont be distressed said eugene very very kindly hope be not who have distressed meant more than to put matter in true light before though acknowledge did selfishly enough for be disappointed disappointed of doing service how else must be disappointed wont break heart laughed eugene wont stay by eight forty hour be genuinely disappointed have set fancy on doing little thing for for friend miss jenny novelty of doing anything in least useful have charm see now that might have managed better might have affected to do wholly for friend miss j might have got up morally a sir eugene bountiful upon soul cant make flourish must rather be disappointed than try if meant to follow home what be in lizzies thought be skilfully done if followed by mere fortuitous coincidence be done by evil chance opened out so naturally before said eugene ball seemed so thrown into hand by accident happen to be originally brought into contact with lizzie on two occasion that know of happen to be able to promise that watch will be kept upon false accuser riderhood happen to be able to give little consolation in darkest hour of distress by assuring that dont believe on same occasion tell be idlest least of lawyer that be better than none in case have noted down with own hand that may be always sure of best help incidentally of lightwood too in effort to clear father so gradually take fancy may help so easily to clear father of other blame mentioned few minute ago be just real one hope have explained for be heartily sorry to have distressed hate to claim to mean well really did mean honestly simply well want to know have never doubted that mr wrayburn said more repentant le claimed be very glad to hear though if have quite understood whole meaning at first think must not have refused do think must dont know must mr wrayburn well then why refuse now do understand not easy for to talk to returned lizzie in confusion for see consequence of what say a soon a say take consequence laughed eugene take away disappointment lizzie hexam a truly respect a be friend poor devil of gentleman protest dont even now understand why hesitate there be appearance of openness trustfulness unsuspecting generosity in word manner won poor girl over not only won over again caused to feel a though have be influenced by opposite quality with vanity at head will not hesitate longer mr wrayburn hope will not think worse of for having hesitated at for for jenny let answer for jenny dear little creature have be leaning back attentive with elbow resting on elbow of chair chin upon hand without changing attitude answered yes so suddenly that rather seemed a if have chopped monosyllable than spoken for for jenny thankfully accept kind offer agreed dismissed said eugene giving lizzie hand before lightly waving a if waved whole subject away hope may not be often so much be made of so

family cheese be much too large for want bred infinite amount of parasite be content to regard drawback on property a sort of perpetual legacy duty felt more resigned to forasmuch a mr boffin enjoyed completely miss bella be delighted that young lady be doubt acquisition to boffin be far too pretty to be unattractive anywhere far too quick of perception to be below tone of new career whether improved heart might be matter of taste be open to question a touching matter of taste improvement of appearance manner there must be question whatever thus soon came about miss bella began to set mr boffin right even further that miss bella began to feel ill at ease a be responsible when saw mr boffin going wrong not that so sweet disposition so sound nature must ever go very wrong even among great visiting authority who agreed that boffin be charmingly vulgar for certain be not own case in saying so that when made slip on social ice on child of podsnappery with genteel soul to be saved be required to skate in circle to slide in long row inevitably tripped miss bella up so that young lady felt caused to experience great confusion under glance of more skilful performer engaged in ice exercise at miss bellas time of life be not to be expected that must examine very closely on congruity stability of position in mr boffin house a have never be sparing of complaint of old home when have other to compare with so there be novelty of ingratitude disdain in very much preferring new one invaluable man be rokesmith said mr boffin after two three month cant quite make out neither must bella so found subject rather interesting take more care of affair morning noon night said mr boffin than fifty other men put together must must yet have way of own be like tying scaffolding pole

beneath suggested bella if so ought to know best dear aint that repeated mr boffin with shake of head after again thinking over rokesmiths modest man dont consider beneath then what doe consider sir asked bella dashed if know said mr boffin seemed at first a if be only lightwood that objected to meet now seems to be everybody except oho thought miss bella in deed thats be for mr mortimer lightwood have dined there two three time have met elsewhere have shown attention rather cool in secretary pa lodger to make subject of jealousy that pa daughter must be so contemptuous of pa lodger be odd there be odder anomaly than in mind of spoilt girl spoilt first by poverty then by wealth be history part however to leave to unravel little too much think miss bella reflected scornfully to have pa lodger laying claim to keeping eligible people off little too much indeed to have opportunity opened to by mr mr boffin appropriated by mere secretary pa lodger yet be not so very long ago bella have be fluttered by discovery that same secretary lodger seem to like ah eminently aristocratic mansion mr boffin dressmaker have not come into play then in spite of seemingly retiring manner very intrusive person secretary lodger in miss bellas opinion always light in office room when came home from play opera always at carriage door to hand out always provoking radiance too on mr boffin

pardon mr rokesmith must beg not to do so that show to such admirable advantage replied with earnestness forgive must not help saying that to return to what have digressed from let add perhaps think report to deliver little message like forbear to trouble a never ask be going sir said bella looking at a if have reproved to see tomorrow be that asked hesitating said to to to please to will make message can if like mr rokesmith message message be going to see tomorrow then will tell so lingered moment a though to give opportunity of prolonging conversation if wished a remained silent left two

receive miss bella with becoming show of indifference family room looked very small very mean downward staircase by be attained looked very narrow very crooked little house arrangement be poor contrast to eminently aristocratic dwelling can hardly believe thought bella that ever did endure life in place gloomy majesty on part of mr wilfer native pertness on part of lavvy did not mend matter bella really stood in natural need of little help got none said mr wilfer presenting cheek to be kissed a sympathetic responsive a back of bowl of spoon be quite honour will probably find sister lavvy

of mine desert for proud prosperous child of mine despises be quite fitting ma bella struck in mr mr boffin be prosperous doubt have right to say be proud must know very well that be not in short ma said lavvy bouncing over to enemy without word of notice must know very well if dont more shame for that mr mr boffin be just absolute perfection truly returned mr wilfer courteously receiving

have sometimes to think constrain stop before speaking must not say word want to say again ramble away from thinking out to end be not so far to end need be tempted to break off now on straight examined newspaper day for tidings be missing saw none going out that night to walk for kept retired while be light found crowd assembled round placard posted at whitehall described john harmon a found dead mutilated in river under circumstance of strong suspicion described dress described paper in pocket stated where be lying for recognition in wild incautious way hurried there there with horror of death have escaped before eye in most appalling shape added to inconceivable horror tormenting at time when poisonous stuff be strongest on perceived that radfoot have be murdered by unknown hand for money for must have murdered that probably have be shot into river from same dark place into same dark tide when stream ran deep strong night almost gave up mystery though suspected one must offer information knew absolutely nothing save that murdered man be not radfoot next day while hesitated next day while hesitated seemed a if whole country be determined to have dead inquest declared dead government proclaimed dead must not listen at fireside for five minute to outer noise be borne into ear be dead so john harmon died julius handford disappeared john rokesmith be born john rokesmiths intent to night have be to repair wrong that must never have imagined possible coming to ear through lightwood talk related to be bound by consideration to remedy in intent john rokesmith will persevere a duty be now be thought out to time nothing omitted nothing beyond time to think out through future be harder though much shorter task than to think out through past john harmon be dead must john harmon come to life if yes why if why take yes first to enlighten human justice concerning offence of one far beyond who may have living mother to enlighten with light of stone passage flight of stair brown window curtain black man to come into possession of father money with sordidly to buy beautiful creature whom love can not help reason have nothing to do with love against reason who must a soon love for own sake a must love beggar at corner what use for money how worthy of old misuse now take reason why john harmon must not come to life because have passively allowed dear old faithful friend to pas into possession of property because see happy with making good use of effacing old rust tarnish on money because have virtually adopted bella will provide for because there be affection enough in nature warmth enough in heart to develop into something enduringly good under favourable condition because fault have be intensified by place in father will be already growing better because marriage with john harmon after what have heard from own lip must be shocking mockery of must always be conscious must degrade in mind in mine of in others because if john harmon come to life doe not marry property fall into very hand that hold now what must have dead have found true friend of lifetime still a true a tender a faithful a when be alive making memory incentive to good action done in name dead have found when might have slighted name passed greedily over grave to ease wealth lingering by way like single hearted child to recall love for when be poor frightened child dead have heard from woman who must have be wife if have lived revolting truth must have purchased caring nothing for a sultan buy slave what must have if dead must know do know how living use who among host of dead have found more disinterested fidelity on earth than be not that enough for if have come back noble creature must have welcomed wept over given up everything to with joy did not come back have passed unspoiled into place let rest in let bella rest in hers what course for then to live same quiet secretary life carefully avoiding chance of recognition until will have become more accustomed to altered state until great swarm of swindler under many name will have found newer prey by time method be establishing through affair with will day take new pain to make familiar will be may hope machine in such working order a that can keep going know need ask of generosity to have when right time come will ask more than will replace in former path of life john rokesmith will tread a contentedly a may john harmon will come back more may never in day to come afar off have weak misgiving that bella might in contingency have taken for own sake if have plainly asked will plainly ask proving beyond question what already know too well now be thought out from beginning to end mind be easier so deeply engaged have living dead man be in thus communing with that have regarded neither wind way have resisted former instinctively a have pursued latter being now come into city where there be coach stand stood irresolute whether to go to lodging to go first to mr boffin house decided to go round by house arguing a carried overcoat upon arm that be le likely to attract notice if left there than if taken to holloway mr wilfer miss lavinia being ravenously curious touching article of lodger stood possessed arriving at house found that mr mr boffin be out that miss wilfer be in drawing room miss wilfer have remained at home in consequence of not feeling very well have inquired in evening if mr rokesmith be in room make compliment to miss wilfer say be here now miss wilfers compliment came down in return if be not too much trouble must mr rokesmith be so kind a to come up before went be not too much trouble mr rokesmith came up oh looked very pretty looked very very pretty if father of late john harmon have left money unconditionally to son if son have lighted on loveable girl for have happiness to make loving a well a loveable dear be not well mr rokesmith yes quite well be sorry to hear when came in that be not mere nothing have headache gone now be not quite fit for hot theatre so stayed at home asked if be not well because look so white do have have busy evening be on low ottoman before fire with little shining jewel of table book work beside ah what different life late john harmons if have be happy privilege to take place upon ottoman draw arm about waist say hope time have be long without what home goddess look darling present john rokesmith far removed from late john harmon remained standing at distance little distance in respect of space great distance in respect of separation mr rokesmith said bella taking up work inspecting round corner wanted to say something to when must have opportunity a explanation why be rude to other day have right to think ill of sir sharp little way in darted look at sensitively injured half pettishly must have be very much admired by late john harmon dont know how well think of miss wilfer truly must have very high opinion of mr rokesmith when believe that in prosperity neglect forget old home do believe so did sir at rate returned bella took liberty of reminding of little omission into have fallen insensibly naturally fallen be no more than beg leave to ask mr rokesmith said bella why took that liberty hope there be offence in phrase be own remember because be truly deeply profoundly interested in miss wilfer because wish to see always at best because will go on sir returned bella with burning face have said more than enough beg that will not go on if have generosity honour will say no more late john harmon looking at proud face with down cast eye at quick breathing a stirred fall of bright brown hair over beautiful neck must probably have remained silent wish to speak to sir said bella once for dont know how to do have sat here evening wishing to speak to determining to speak to feeling must beg for moment time remained silent remained with face averted sometimes making slight movement a if must turn speak at length did so know how be situated here sir know how be situated at home must speak to for since there be one about whom must ask to do so be not generous in be not honourable in to conduct towards a do be ungenerous dishonourable to be devoted to fascinated by preposterous said bella late john harmon might have thought rather contemptuous lofty word of repudiation now feel obliged to go on pursued secretary though be only in self explanation self defence hope miss wilfer that be not unpardonable even in to make honest declaration of honest devotion to honest declaration repeated bella with emphasis be otherwise must request sir said bella taking refuge in touch of timely resentment may not be questioned must excuse if decline to be cross examined oh miss wilfer be hardly charitable ask nothing what own emphasis suggests however waive even that question what have declared take stand by can not recall avowal of earnest deep attachment to recall reject sir said bella must be blind deaf if be not prepared for reply forgive offence for carry punishment with punishment asked bella be present endurance none excuse did not mean to cross examine again take advantage of hasty word of mine said bella with little sting of self reproach to make seem dont know what spoke without consideration when used if be bad be sorry repeat after consideration seems to to be at least better for rest beg may be understood mr rokesmith that there be end of between now for ever now for ever repeated yes appeal to sir proceeded bella with increasing spirit not to pursue appeal to not to take advantage of position in house to make position in distressing disagreeable appeal to to discontinue habit of making misplaced attention a plain to mr boffin a to have done so must think have replied bella in case be not fault if have not mr rokesmith hope be wrong in impression must be very sorry to have justified think have not for future there be apprehension be over be much relieved to hear said bella have far other view in life why must waste own mine said secretary life curious tone caused bella to glance at curious smile with said be gone a glanced back pardon miss wilfer proceeded when eye met have used hard word for doubt have justification in mind that understand ungenerous dishonourable in what must rather not be asked said bella haughtily looking down must rather not ask question be imposed upon kindly explain if not kindly justly oh sir said bella raising eye to after little struggle to forbear be generous honourable to use power here favour with mr mr boffin ability in place give against against be generous honourable to form plan for gradually bringing influence to bear upon suit have shown that like tell that utterly reject late john harmon must have borne good deal must have be cut to heart by suspicion a must be generous honourable to step into place if did so for dont know that did hope did not anticipating knowing beforehand must come here designing to take at disadvantage mean cruel disadvantage said secretary yes assented bella secretary kept silence for little while then merely said be wholly mistaken miss wilfer wonderfully mistaken can not say however that be fault if deserve better thing of know at least sir retorted bella with old indignation rising know history of being here at have heard mr boffin say that be master of line word of will a be master of affair be not enough must have be willed away like horse dog bird must too begin to dispose of in mind speculate in a soon a have ceased to be talk laugh of town be for ever to be made property of stranger believe returned secretary be wonderfully mistaken must be glad to know answered bella doubt if ever will good night of course will be careful to conceal trace of interview from mr mr boffin a long a remain here trust what have complained of be at end for ever be glad have spoken then mr rokesmith have be painful difficult be done if have hurt hope will forgive be inexperienced impetuous have be little spoilt really be not so bad a dare say appear a think quitted room when bella have said relenting in wilful inconsistent way left alone threw back on ottoman said didnt know lovely woman be such dragon then got up looked in glass said to image have be positively swelling feature little fool then took impatient walk to other end of room back said wish pa be here to have talk about avaricious marriage be better away poor dear for know must pull hair if be here then threw work away threw book after sat down hummed tune hummed out of tune quarrelled with john rokesmith what did went down to room buried john harmon many additional fathom deep took hat walked out a went to holloway anywhere else not at minding where heaped mound upon mound of earth over john harmons grave walking did not bring home until dawn of day so busy have be night piling piling weight upon weight of earth above john harmons grave that by time john harmon lay buried under whole alpine range still sexton rokesmith accumulated mountain over lightening labour with dirge cover crush keep down chapter strong of purpose sexton task of piling earth above john harmon night long be not conducive to sound sleep rokesmith have broken morning rest rose strengthened in purpose be over now ghost must trouble mr mr boffin peace invisible voiceless ghost must look on for little while longer at state of

accumulative power of separate circumstance when in distrust engendered by wretched childhood action for evil never yet for good within knowledge then of father father wealth on within influence conceived idea of first deception be meant to be harmless be to last few hour day be to involve in only girl so capriciously forced upon upon whom be so capriciously forced be honestly meant well towards for if have found unhappy in prospect of marriage through heart inclining to man for other cause must seriously have said be of old perverted us of misery making money will let go to sister only protector friend when snare into fell so outstripped first intention a that found placarded by police authority upon london wall for dead confusedly accepted aid fell upon without considering how firmly must seem to fix boffin in accession to fortune when saw knew even from vantage ground of inspection must find flaw in asked will come to life to dispossess such people a there be good to set against putting of to hard proof have heard from bellas own lip when stood tapping at door on night of taking lodging that marriage must have be on part thoroughly mercenary have since tried in own unknown person supposed station not only rejected advance resented be for to have shame of buying meanness of punishing yet by coming to life accepting condition of inheritance must do former by coming to life rejecting must do latter consequence that have never foreshadowed be implication of innocent man in supposed murder must obtain complete retraction from accuser set wrong right clearly wrong must never have be done if have never planned deception then inconvenience distress of mind deception cost be manful repentantly to accept a among consequence make complaint thus john rokesmith in morning buried john harmon still many fathom deeper than have be buried in night going out earlier than be accustomed to do encountered cherub at door cherub way be for certain space way walked

aside to good little wife think will leave to somebody else circumstance be hardly favourable there be plenty of talker going about love will soon find one while discourse be interchanging bella secretary observed lizzie hexam with great attention brought face to face for first time with daughter of supposed murderer be natural that john harmon must have own secret reason for careful scrutiny of countenance manner bella knew that lizzies father have be falsely accused of crime have have so great influence on own life fortune interest though have secret spring like of secretary be equally natural have expected to see something very different from real lizzie hexam thus fell out that became unconscious mean of bringing together for when have walked on with to little house in clean village by paper mill where lizzie have lodging with elderly couple employed in establishment when mr milvey bella have be up to see room have come down mill bell rang called lizzie away for time left secretary bella standing rather awkwardly in small street mr milvey being engaged in pursuing village child investigation whether be in danger of becoming child of israel reverend frank being engaged to say truth in evading that branch of spiritual function getting out of sight surreptitiously bella at length said hadnt better talk about commission have undertaken mr rokesmith by mean said secretary suppose faltered bella that be commissioned shouldnt be here suppose so be secretary answer when proposed to come with mr mr milvey said bella mr boffin urged to do so in order might give small report not worth anything mr rokesmith except for being woman indeed with may be fresh reason for being worth nothing of lizzie hexam mr boffin said secretary directed to come for same purpose a spoke be leaving little street emerging on wooded landscape by river think well of mr rokesmith pursued bella conscious of making advance think highly of be so glad of something quite refined in beauty be there not appearance be very striking there be shade of sadness upon be quite touching at least be not setting up own poor opinion know mr rokesmith said bella excusing explaining in pretty shy way be consulting noticed that sadness hope may not said secretary in lower voice be result of false accusation have be retracted when have passed on little further without speaking bella after stealing glance two at secretary suddenly said oh mr rokesmith dont be hard with dont be stern with be magnanimous want to talk with on equal term secretary a suddenly brightened returned upon honour have thought for forced to be constrained lest might misinterpret being more natural there gone thank said bella holding out little hand forgive cried secretary eagerly forgive for there be tear in eye be prettier in sight though smote on heart rather reproachfully too than other glitter in world when have walked little further be going to speak to said secretary with shadow so long on quite thrown off cast away about lizzie hexam so be going to speak to if must have begun now that can begin sir returned bella with look a if italicized word by putting one of dimple under be going to say remember of course that in short letter to mr boffin short containing everything to purpose stipulated that name else place of residence must be kept strictly secret among bella nodded yes be duty to find out why made that stipulation have in charge from mr boffin to discover be very desirous for to discover whether retracted accusation still leaf stain upon mean whether place at disadvantage towards one even towards yes said bella nodding thoughtfully understand that seems wise considerate may not have noticed miss wilfer that have same kind of interest in that have in just a be attracted by beaut by appearance manner be attracted by yours certainly have not noticed returned bella again italicizing with dimple must have given credit for secretary with smile held up hand so plainly interposing not for better taste that bellas colour deepened over little piece of coquetry be checked in so resumed secretary if must speak with alone before go away from here feel quite sure that natural easy confidence must arise between of course must not be asked to betray of course must not if be if object to put question to to ascertain for own feeling in one matter can do so at far greater advantage than else must mr boffin be anxious on subject be added secretary after moment for special reason very anxious will be happy mr rokesmith returned bella to be of least use for feel after serious scene of to day that be useless enough in world dont say that urged secretary oh mean said bella raising eyebrow one be useless in world retorted secretary who lightens burden of for one else assure dont mr rokesmith said bella half cry not for father dear loving forgetting easily satisfied pa oh yes think so be enough if only think so said secretary excuse interruption dont like to hear depreciate once depreciated sir thought bella pouting hope may be satisfied with consequence brought upon head however said nothing to purpose even said something to different purpose mr rokesmith seems so long since spoke together naturally that be embarrassed in approaching subject mr boffin know be very grateful to dont know feel true respect for be bound to by strong tie of own generosity now dont unquestionably also that be favourite companion make said bella so very difficult to speak of doe treat well see how treat secretary answered with patient yet proud air yes see with pain said bella very energetically secretary gave such radiant look that if have thanked hundred time must not have said a much a look said see with pain repeated bella often make miserable miserable because can not bear to be supposed to approve of have indirect share in miserable because can not bear to be forced to admit to myself that fortune be spoiling mr boffin miss wilfer said secretary with beaming face if must know with what delight make discovery that fortune isnt spoiling must know that more than compensates for slight at other hand oh dont speak of said bella giving impatient little slap with glove dont know a well a a know suggested secretary finding that stopped do know know quite enough of myself said bella with charming air of being inclined to give up a bad job dont improve upon acquaintance mr boffin mr boffin manner to consideration for be not what used to be observed secretary must be admitted be too plain to be denied be disposed to deny rokesmith asked bella with look of wonder ought not to be glad to do so if must though be only for own sake truly returned bella must try very much must please promise that wont take ill what be going to add mr rokesmith promise with heart must sometimes must think said bella hesitating little lower in own estimation assenting with movement of head though not at all looking a if did secretary replied have very strong reason miss wilfer for bearing with drawback of position in house inhabit believe that be not mercenary although have through series of strange fatality faded out of place in life if what see with gracious good sympathy be calculated to rouse pride there be other consideration see urging to quiet endurance latter be by far stronger think have noticed mr rokesmith said bella looking at with curiosity a not quite making out that repress force to act passive part be right repress force to act part be not in tameness of spirit that submit have settled purpose good one hope said bella good one hope answered looking steadily at sometimes have fancied sir said bella turning away eye that great regard for mr boffin be very powerful motive with be right again be must do anything for bear anything for there be word to express how esteem that good good woman a do too may ask one thing more mr rokesmith anything more of course see that really suffers when mr boffin show how be changing see day a see be grieved to give pain to give pain said bella repeating phrase quickly with eyebrow raised be generally unfortunate cause of perhaps say to a often say to that be best of men in spite of often overhear in honest beautiful devotion to saying so to returned secretary with same steady look can not assert that ever say so to bella met steady look for moment with wistful musing little look of own then nodding pretty head several time like dimpled philosopher of very best school who be moralizing on life heaved little sigh gave up thing in general for bad job a have previously be inclined to give up herself for that have very pleasant walk tree be bare of leaf river be bare of water lily sky be not bare of beautiful blue water reflected delicious wind ran with stream touching surface crisply perhaps old mirror be never yet made by human hand if image have in time reflected must pas across surface again must fail to reveal scene of horror distress great serene mirror of river seemed a if might have reproduced have ever reflected between placid bank brought nothing to light save what be peaceful pastoral blooming so walked speaking of newly filled up grave of johnny of many thing so on return met brisk mr milvey coming to seek with agreeable intelligence that there be fear for village child there being christian school in village worse judaical interference with than to plant garden so got back to village a lizzie hexam be coming from paper mill bella detached to speak with in own home be afraid be poor room for said lizzie with smile of welcome a offered post of honour by fireside not so poor a think dear returned bella if knew indeed though attained by wonderful winding narrow stair seemed to have be erected in pure white chimney though very low in ceiling very rugged in floor rather blinking a to proportion of lattice window be pleasanter room than despised chamber once at home in bella have first bemoaned misery of taking lodger day be closing a two girl looked at one by fireside dusky room be lighted by fire grate might have be old brazier glow might have be old hollow down by flare quite new to said lizzie to be visited by lady so nearly of own age so pretty a pleasure to to look at have nothing left to begin with returned bella blushing because be going to say that be pleasure to to look at lizzie can begin without beginning cant lizzie took pretty little hand be held out in a pretty little frankness now dear said bella drawing chair little nearer taking lizzies arm a if be going out for walk be commissioned with something to say dare say will say wrong wont if can help be in reference to letter to mr mr boffin be what be let see oh yes be what be with exordium bella set forth that request of lizzies touching secrecy delicately spoke of false accusation retraction asked might beg to be informed whether have bearing near remote on such request feel dear said bella quite amazing by business like manner in be getting on that subject must be painful one to be mixed up in also for dont know whether may know suspect be willed away girl who be to have be married to unfortunate gentleman if have be pleased to approve of so be dragged into subject without consent be dragged into without consent there be very little to choose between have doubt said lizzie that be miss wilfer have often heard named can tell who unknown friend be unknown friend dear said bella who caused charge against poor father to be contradicted sent written paper bella have never heard of have notion who be must have be glad to thank returned lizzie have done great deal for must hope that will let thank day asked have anything to do accusation bella put in yes have either anything to do with wishing to live quite secret retired here no a lizzie hexam shook head in giving reply a glance sought fire there be quiet resolution in folded hand not lost on bellas bright eye have lived much alone asked bella nothing new to used to be always alone many hour together in day in night when poor father be alive have brother have be told have brother be not friendly with be very good boy though have raised by industry dont complain of a said with eye upon fire glow there be instantaneous escape of distress into face bella seized moment to touch hand lizzie wish must tell whether have friend of own sex age have lived that lonely kind of life have never have one be answer said bella not that life have be lonely for must have sometimes wished lonelier instead of having ma going on like tragic muse with face ache in majestic corner lavvy being spiteful though of course be very fond of wish must make friend of lizzie do think must have more of what call character dear than canary bird know be trustworthy wayward playful affectionate nature giddy for want of weight of sustaining purpose capricious because be always fluttering among little thing be yet captivating one to lizzie be so new so pretty at once so womanly so childish that won completely when bella said again do think must lizzie with eyebrow raised head inquiringly on one side odd doubt about in own bosom lizzie showed beyond question that thought must tell dear said bella what be matter why live like lizzie presently began by way of prelude must have many lover when bella checked with little scream of astonishment dear havent one not one well perhaps one said bella be sure dont know have one what may think about at present time cant say perhaps have one of course dont count idiot george sampson however never mind want to hear about there be certain man said lizzie passionate angry man who say love who must believe doe love be friend of brother shrank from within when brother first brought to last time saw terrified more than can say there stopped did come here to escape from lizzie came here immediately after so alarmed be afraid of here be not timid generally be always afraid of be afraid to see newspaper to hear word spoken of what be done in london lest must have done violence then be not afraid of for dear said bella after pondering on word must be even that if met about here look round for always a pas to fro at night be afraid of anything may do to in london dear might be fierce enough even to do violence to dont think of then must almost seem dear said bella quaintly a if there must be somebody else lizzie put hand before face for moment before replying word be always in ear blow struck upon stone wall a said be always before eye have tried hard to think not worth remembering can not make so little of hand be trickling down with blood a said to then hope that may never kill rather startled bella made clasped girdle of arm round lizzies waist then asked quietly in soft voice a looked at fire kill be man so jealous then of gentleman said lizzie hardly know how to tell of gentleman far above way of life who broke father death to have shown interest in since doe love lizzie shook head doe admire lizzie ceased to shake head pressed hand upon living girdle be through influence that came here o of world have know that be here get least clue where to find lizzie dear why asked bella in amazement at burst then quickly added reading lizzies face dont say why be foolish question of mine see see there be silence between lizzie with drooping head glanced down at glow in fire where first fancy have be nursed first escape made from grim life out of have plucked brother foreseeing reward know now said raising eye to bellas there be nothing left out be reason for living secret here with aid of good old man who be true friend for short part of life at home with father knew of thing dont ask what that set face against tried to better dont think must have done more then without letting hold on father go sometimes lie heavy on mind by doing for best hope may wear out wear out too said bella soothingly weakness lizzie in favour of one who be not worthy of dont want to wear that out be flushed reply do want to believe do believe that be not worthy of must gain by how much must lose bellas expressive little eyebrow remonstrated with fire for short time before rejoined dont think that press lizzie wouldnt gain in peace hope even in freedom wouldnt be better not to live secret life in hiding not to be shut out from natural wholesome prospect forgive asking must that be gain doe woman heart that have weakness in have spoken of returned lizzie seek to gain anything question be so directly at variance with bellas view in life a set forth to father that said internally there little mercenary wretch do hear that aint ashamed of self unclasped girdle of arm expressly to give penitential poke in side said lizzie observed bella returning to subject when have administered chastisement that must lose besides must mind telling what must lose lizzie must lose of best recollection best encouragement best object carry through daily life must lose belief that if have be equal have loved must have tried with might to make better happier a must have made must lose almost value put upon little learning have be owing to conquered difficulty of might not think thrown away upon must lose kind of picture of of what might have be if have be lady have loved be always with somehow feel must not do mean wrong thing before must leave off prizing remembrance that have done nothing good since have known that have made change within like like change in grain of hand be coarse cracked hard brown when rowed on river with father be softened made supple by new work a see now trembled with weakness a showed understand dear thus went on have never dreamed of possibility of being anything to on earth kind picture know must not make understand if understanding be not in own breast already have more dreamed of possibility of being wife than ever have word must not be stronger than yet love love so much so dearly that when sometimes think life may be weary one be proud of glad of be proud glad to suffer something for even though be of service to will never know of care for bella sat enchained by deep unselfish passion of girl woman of own age courageously revealing in confidence of sympathetic perception of truth yet have never experienced anything like thought of existence of anything like be late upon wretched night said lizzie when eye first looked at in old river side home very different from eye may never look at again must rather that never did hope that never may must not have light of taken out of life for anything life can give have told everything now dear if come little strange to to have parted with be not sorry have thought of ever parting with single word of moment before came in came in mind changed bella kissed on cheek thanked warmly for confidence only wish said bella be more deserving of more deserving of repeated lizzie with incredulous smile dont mean in respect of keeping said bella because one must tear to bit before getting at syllable of though there merit in for be naturally a obstinate a pig what mean be lizzie that be mere impertinent piece of conceit shame lizzie put up pretty brown hair came tumbling down owing to energy with bella shook head remonstrated while thus engaged dear oh very well to call dear said bella with pettish whimper be glad to be called so though have slight enough claim to be be nasty little thing dear urged lizzie again such willow cold worldly limited little brute said bella bringing out last adjective with culminating force do think inquired lizzie with quiet smile hair being now secured that dont know better do know better though said bella do really believe know better oh must be so glad if did know better be so very much afraid must know best lizzie asked laughing outright whether ever saw own face heard own voice suppose so returned bella look in glass often enough chatter like magpie have seen face heard voice at

little dressmaker to be assumed presented with easy confidence under first appellation that association suggested gather dear mortimer pursued eugene a lightwood stared at obscene visitor from manner of mr doll be occasionally complicated that desire to make communication to have mentioned to mr doll that be on term of confidence have requested mr doll to develop view here wretched object being much embarrassed by holding what remained of hat eugene airily tossed to door put down in chair will be necessary think observed to wind up mr doll before anything to mortal purpose can be got out of

eugene to lightwood be considerably unstrung deem on whole expedient to fumigate mr doll took shovel from grate sprinkled few live ash on from box on chimney piece took few pastiles set upon then with great composure began placidly waving shovel in front of mr doll to cut off from company lord bless soul eugene cried lightwood laughing again what mad fellow be why doe creature come to see will hear

stated desire to have out with on spot defied to come on upon liberal term of sovereign to halfpenny mr doll then fell cry then exhibited tendency to fall asleep last manifestation a by far most alarming by reason of threatening prolonged stay on premise necessitated vigorous measure eugene picked up worn out hat with tongs clapped on head taking by collar at arm length conducted down stair out of precinct into fleet street there turned face westward left when got back lightwood be standing over fire brooding in sufficiently low spirited manner ill wash hand of mr doll physically said eugene be with again directly mortimer must much prefer retorted mortimer washing hand of mr doll morally eugene so must said eugene see dear boy cant do without in minute two resumed chair a

objecting to occupy ludicrous position therefore transfer position to scout wish eugene must speak little more soberly plainly if be only out of consideration for feeling le at ease than do then soberly plainly mortimer goad schoolmaster to madness make schoolmaster so ridiculous so aware of being made ridiculous that see chafe fret at pore when cross one amiable occupation have be solace of

choke then break out like went into pelting rain again with head bare bending low over river scooping up water with two hand washed blood away beyond figure a riderhood looked from door be vast dark curtain in solemn movement towards one quarter of heaven raised head came back wet from head to foot with lower part of sleeve where have dipped into river streaming water face be like ghost said riderhood did ever see ghost be sullen retort mean to say youre quite wore out that may well be have have rest since left here dont remember have so much a sat down since left here lie down now then said riderhood will if youll give something to quench thirst first bottle jug be again produced mixed weak draught drank in quick succession asked something said then didnt replied riderhood tell

corner seemed gradually to bring poor couch to bradley wandering remembrance slipped off worn down trodden shoe cast heavily wet a be upon bed riderhood sat down in wooden arm chair looked through window at lightning listened to thunder thought be far from being absorbed by thunder lightning for again again again looked very curiously at exhausted man upon bed man have turned up collar of rough coat wore to shelter from storm have buttoned about neck unconscious of of most thing have left coat so both when have laved face in river when have cast upon bed though must have be much easier to if have unloosened thunder rolled heavily forked lightning seemed to make jagged rent in part of vast curtain without a riderhood sat by window glancing at bed sometimes saw man upon bed by red light sometimes by blue sometimes scarcely saw in darkness of storm sometimes saw nothing of in blinding glare of palpitating white fire anon rain must come again with tremendous rush river must seem to rise to meet blast of wind bursting upon door must flutter hair dress of man a if invisible messenger be come around bed to carry away from phase of storm riderhood must turn a if be interruption rather striking interruption possibly interruption still of scrutiny of sleeper sleep sound said within yet he up to that noticing of that getting out of chair may wake when rattling peal wont let alone touching of very cautiously rose to foot totherest said in low calm voice be lying easy there chill in air governor will put coat over answer thats about what be aready see muttered riderhood in lower different voice coat over coat over sleeper moving arm sat down again in chair feigned to watch storm from window be grand spectacle not so grand a to keep eye for minute together from stealing look at man upon bed be at concealed throat of sleeper riderhood so often looked so curiously until sleep seemed to deepen into stupor of dead tired in mind body then riderhood came from window cautiously stood by bed poor man murmured in low tone with crafty face very watchful eye ready foot lest must start up here coat of must make uneasy in sleep will loosen for make more comfortable ah think ought to do poor man think will touched first button with very cautious hand step backward sleeper remaining in profound unconsciousness touched other button with more assured hand perhaps more lightly on account softly slowly opened coat drew back draggling end of bright red neckerchief be then disclosed have even be at pain of dipping part of in liquid to give appearance of having become stained by wear with much perplexed face riderhood looked from to sleeper from sleeper to finally crept back to chair there with hand to chin sat long in brown study looking at chapter golden dustman

want to put before how have shown gratitude to for doing must to further wish with reference to sister have compromised by being seen about with endeavouring to counteract mr eugene wrayburn thats

confidently with a entire absence of tell tale colour in cheek a if there be softening old time behind not wonderful for there be none in hollow empty heart what be there for selfishness to see behind when speak of sister devoutly wish that have never seen mr headstone however did see thats useless now confided in about explained character to how interposed ridiculous fanciful notion in way of being a respectable a tried for fell in love with favoured with might must not be induced to favour so came into collision with mr eugene wrayburn now what have done why have justified sister in being

made up mind will become respectable in scale of society will not be dragged down by others have done with sister a well a with since care so little for a to care nothing for undermining respectability will go way will go mine prospect be very good mean to follow alone mr headstone dont say what have got upon conscience for dont know lie upon hope will see justice of keeping wide

comfort to to know what plan may work out by keeping strictly respectable in scale of society be plan at present occurring to in conclusion if feel sense of having injured desire to make small reparation hope will think how respectable might have be will contemplate blighted existence be strange that wretched man must take heavily to heart perhaps have taken boy to heart first through long
