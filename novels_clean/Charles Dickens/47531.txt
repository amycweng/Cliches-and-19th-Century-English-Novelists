pocket handkerchief almost forgot that see pursued mr brownlow placing poor girl entirely out of question supposing be possible to bring scoundrel to justice without compromising safety what good must bring about hanging few of at least in probability suggested doctor transporting rest very good replied mr brownlow smiling doubt will bring about in fulness of time if step in to forestal seems to that will be performing very quixotic act in direct opposition to own interest at least to oliver be same thing how inquired doctor thus be quite clear that will have most extreme difficulty in getting to bottom of mystery unless can bring man monk upon knee can only be done by stratagem by catching when be not surrounded by people for suppose be apprehended have proof against be not even so far a know a fact appear to concerned with gang in of robbery if be not discharged be very unlikely that must receive further punishment than being committed to prison a rogue vagabond of course ever afterwards mouth be so obstinately closed that might a well for purpose be deaf dumb blind idiot then said doctor impetuously put to again whether think reasonable that promise to girl must be considered binding promise made with best kindest intention really discus point dear young lady pray said mr brownlow interrupting rose a be about to speak promise will be kept dont think will in
