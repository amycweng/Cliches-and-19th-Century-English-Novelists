of echo of own scrooge be not man to be frightened by echo fastened door walked across hall up stair slowly too trimming candle a went may talk vaguely about driving coach six up good old flight of stair through bad young act of parliament mean to say might have got hearse up that staircase taken broadwise with splinter bar towards wall door towards balustrade done easy there be plenty of width for room to spare be perhaps reason why scrooge thought saw locomotive hearse going on before in gloom dozen gas lamp out of street must have lighted entry too well so may suppose that be pretty dark

inexplicable dread that a looked saw bell begin to swing swung so softly in outset that scarcely made sound soon rang out loudly so did bell in house might have lasted minute minute seemed hour bell ceased a have begun together be succeeded by clanking noise deep down below a if person be dragging heavy chain over cask in wine merchant cellar scrooge then remembered to have heard that ghost in haunted house be described a dragging chain cellar door flew open with booming sound then heard noise much louder on floor below then coming up stair then coming straight towards door be humbug still said scrooge wo believe colour changed though when without pause came on through heavy door passed into room before eye upon coming in dying flame leaped up a though cried know be ghost fell again

partner jacob marley can can sit down asked scrooge looking doubtfully at can do then scrooge asked question because did know whether ghost so transparent might find in condition to take chair felt that in event of being impossible might involve necessity of embarrassing explanation ghost sat down on opposite side of fireplace a if be quite used to believe in observed ghost said scrooge what evidence must have of reality beyond of sens know said scrooge why do doubt sens because said little thing affect slight disorder of stomach make cheat may be undigested bit of beef blot of mustard crumb of cheese fragment of underdone potato there be more of gravy than of grave about be scrooge be not much in habit of cracking joke did feel in heart by mean waggish then truth be that tried to be smart a mean of distracting own attention keeping down terror for spectre voice disturbed very marrow in bone to sit staring at fixed glazed eye in silence for moment must play scrooge felt very deuce with there be something very awful too in spectre being provided with infernal atmosphere of own scrooge must not feel be clearly case for though ghost sat perfectly motionless hair skirt tassel be still agitated a by hot vapour from oven see toothpick said scrooge returning quickly to charge for reason just assigned wishing though be only for second to divert vision stony gaze from do

glanced about on floor in expectation of finding surrounded by fifty sixty fathom of iron cable must see nothing jacob said imploringly old jacob marley tell more speak comfort to jacob have none to give ghost replied come from other region ebenezer scrooge be conveyed by other minister to other kind of men can tell must very little more be all permitted to can not rest can not stay can not linger anywhere spirit never walked beyond counting house mark in life spirit never roved beyond narrow limit of money changing hole weary journey lie before be habit with scrooge whenever became thoughtful to put hand in breech pocket pondering on what ghost have said did so now without lifting up eye getting off knee must have be very slow about jacob scrooge observed in business like manner though with humility deference slow ghost repeated seven year dead mused scrooge travelling time whole time said ghost rest no peace incessant torture of remorse travel fast said scrooge on wing of wind replied ghost might have got over great quantity of ground in seven year said ghost on hearing set up cry clanked chain so hideously in dead silence of night that ward must have be justified in indicting for nuisance oh captive bound double ironed cried phantom not to know age of incessant labour by immortal creature for earth must pas into eternity before good of be susceptible be developed not to know that christian spirit working kindly in little sphere whatever may be will find mortal life too short for vast mean of usefulness not to know that space of regret can make amends for one life opportunity misused yet such be oh such be be always good man of business jacob faltered scrooge who now began to apply to business cried ghost wringing hand again mankind be business common welfare be business charity mercy forbearance benevolence be business dealing of trade be drop of water in comprehensive ocean of business held up chain at arm length a if be cause of unavailing grief

light part of penance pursued ghost be here to night to warn that have yet chance hope of escaping fate chance hope of procuring ebenezer be always good friend to said scrooge thank'ee will be haunted resumed ghost by three spirit scrooge countenance fell almost a low a ghost have done be that chance hope mentioned jacob demanded in faltering voice be think 'd rather not said scrooge without visit said ghost can not hope to shun path tread expect first to morrow when bell toll one must take 'em at once have over jacob hinted scrooge expect second on next night at same hour third upon next night when last stroke of twelve have ceased to vibrate look to see more look for own sake remember have passed between when have said word spectre took wrapper from table bound round head a before scrooge knew by smart sound teeth made when jaw be brought together by bandage ventured to raise eye again found supernatural visitor confronting in erect attitude with chain wound over about arm apparition walked backward from at step took window raised little so that when spectre reached be wide open beckoned scrooge to approach did when be within two pace of other marley ghost held up hand warning to come nearer scrooge stopped not so much in obedience a in surprise fear for on raising of hand became sensible of confused noise in air incoherent sound of lamentation regret wailing inexpressibly sorrowful self accusatory spectre after listening for moment joined in mournful dirge floated out upon bleak dark night scrooge followed to window desperate in curiosity looked out air be filled with phantom wandering hither thither in restless haste moaning a went one of wore chain like marley ghost few might be guilty government be linked together none be free many have be personally known to scrooge in life have be quite familiar with one old ghost in white waistcoat with monstrous iron safe attached to ankle who cried piteously at being unable to assist wretched woman with infant whom

stopped at first syllable being from emotion have undergone fatigue of day glimpse of invisible world dull conversation of ghost lateness of hour much in need of repose went straight to bed without undressing fell asleep upon instant stave ii first of three spirit when scrooge awoke be so dark that looking out of bed must scarcely distinguish transparent window from opaque wall of chamber be endeavouring to pierce darkness with ferret eye when chime of neighbouring church struck four quarter so listened for hour to great astonishment heavy bell went on from six to seven from seven to eight regularly up to twelve then stopped twelve be past two when went to bed clock be wrong icicle must have got into work twelve touched spring of repeater to correct most preposterous clock rapid little pulse beat twelve stopped why be possible said scrooge can have slept through whole day far into night be possible that anything have happened to sun be twelve at noon idea being alarming one scrambled out of bed groped way to window be obliged to rub frost off with sleeve of dressing gown before must see anything must see very little then must make out be that be still very foggy extremely cold that there be noise of people running to fro making great stir a there unquestionably must have be if night have beaten off bright day taken possession of world be great relief because three day after sight of first of exchange pay to mr ebenezer scrooge order so forth must have become mere united state security if there be day to count by scrooge went to bed again thought thought thought over over over must make nothing of more thought more perplexed be more endeavoured not to think more thought marley ghost bothered exceedingly time resolved within after mature inquiry that be dream mind flew back again like strong spring released to first position presented same problem to be worked through be dream not scrooge lay in state until chime have gone three quarter more when remembered on sudden that ghost have warned of visitation when bell tolled one resolved to lie awake until hour be passed considering that must no more go to sleep than go to heaven be perhaps wisest resolution in power quarter be so long that be more than once convinced must have sunk into doze unconsciously missed clock at length broke upon listening ear ding dong quarter past said scrooge

very wonder of must be again distinct clear a ever be spirit sir whose coming be foretold to asked scrooge be voice be soft gentle singularly low a if instead of being so close beside be at distance who what be scrooge demanded be ghost of christmas past long past inquired scrooge observant of dwarfish stature past perhaps scrooge must not have told anybody why if anybody must have asked have special desire to see spirit in cap begged to be covered what exclaimed ghost must so soon put out with worldly hand light give be not enough that be one of whose passion made cap force through whole train of year to wear low upon brow scrooge reverently disclaimed intention to offend knowledge of having wilfully bonneted spirit at period of life then made bold to inquire what business brought there welfare said ghost scrooge expressed much obliged must not help thinking that night of unbroken rest must have be more conducive to end spirit must have heard thinking for said immediately reclamation then take heed put out strong hand a spoke clasped gently by arm rise walk with must have be in vain for scrooge to plead that weather hour be not adapted to pedestrian purpose that bed be
