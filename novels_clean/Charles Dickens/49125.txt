though not so much a infant boy a prospective man son of firm therefore be impatient to have grow up feeling a if boy have charmed life must become man around whom hope centred thus paul grew to be nearly five year old be pretty little fellow though there be something wan wistful in small face gave occasion to many significant shake of nurse head temper gave abundant promise of being imperious like father in after life be childish sportive enough at time have strange old fashioned thoughtful way at other time of sitting brooding in miniature arm chair when looked talked like one of terrible little being in fairy tale who at hundred fifty two hundred year of age fantastically represent child for whom have be substituted must frequently be stricken with mood upstairs in nursery must sometimes lapse into suddenly exclaiming that be tired even while playing with florence driving nurse in single harness at one time did fall into so surely a when little chair being carried down into father room sat there with after dinner by fire be strangest pair at time ever firelight shone upon mr dombey so erect solemn gazing at blaze little image with old old face peering into red

mamma mr dombey having recovered from surprise not to say alarm for be very first occasion on child have ever broached subject of mother to expounded to how money though very potent spirit must not keep people alive whose time be come to die how must die unfortunately even in city though be never so rich paul listened to much more with grave attention then suddenly asked question be still more alarming ca make strong quite well either papa can why be strong quite well returned mr dombey be not oh age of face be turned up again with expression half of melancholy half of slyness on be a

in continual sly smile to carker mr dombey must entrust various message for mr dombey a to running of house hiring of servant like mr dombey knew that must resent such petty interference especially through outsider did not know that submitted quietly to indignity simply for sake of florence whom wished to protect even love for girl be given in secret for same reason florence long since awakened from dream mournfully observed estrangement between father new mother saw widen more more knew that there be greater bitterness between day have be very hard to have love repulsed now seemed harder to be compelled to doubt father choose between mother so affectionate dear to yet whose other mood must only witness with distrust fear one great sorrow however be spared never have least suspicion that mr dombey by tenderness for widened separation from father gave new cause of dislike if have thought for single moment what grief must have felt what sacrifice must have tried to make poor loving girl

in though whole strain be so subdued even when there be three of that made le noise in grim old house than lightest breath of wind what must become with surroundings how must character fail to be influenced by be to be wondered at if thought be dazed a eye be when came out into natural light from misty yellow room perhaps might have talked over with joe have not be for enormous tale about coach dog veal cutlet felt natural shrinking from having miss havisham estella discussed have come upon in beginning grew much more potent a time went on reposed complete confidence in one biddy so told everything why came natural for to do so why biddy have deep concern in everything told did not know then though think know now went on in way for long time seemed likely that must continue to go
