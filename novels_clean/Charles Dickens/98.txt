buzzing from blue fly miss manette if prisoner doe not perfectly understand that give evidence be duty to give must give can not escape from giving with great unwillingness be only person present in condition please to go on told that be travelling on business of delicate difficult nature might get people into trouble that be therefore travelling under assumed name said that business have within few day taken to france might at interval take backwards forward between france england for long time to come did say anything about america miss manette be particular tried to explain to how quarrel have arisen said that so far a must judge be wrong foolish one on england part added in jesting way that perhaps george washington might gain almost a great name in history a george third there be harm in way of saying be said laughingly to beguile time strongly marked expression of face on part of chief actor in scene of great interest to whom many eye be directed will be unconsciously imitated by spectator forehead be painfully anxious intent a gave evidence in pause when stopped for judge to write down watched effect upon counsel for against among looker on there be same expression in quarter of court insomuch that great majority of forehead there might have be mirror reflecting witness when judge looked up from note to glare at tremendous heresy about george washington mr attorney general now signified to lord that deemed necessary a matter of precaution form to call young lady father doctor manette who be called accordingly doctor manette look upon prisoner have ever seen before once when called at lodging in three year three year half ago can identify a fellow passenger on board packet speak to conversation with daughter sir can do be there particular special reason for being unable to do either answered in low voice there be have be misfortune to undergo long imprisonment without trial even accusation in native country doctor manette answered in tone went to heart long imprisonment be newly released on occasion in question tell so have remembrance of occasion none mind be blank from time can not even say what time when employed in captivity in making shoe to time when found living in london with dear daughter here have become familiar to when gracious god restored faculty be quite unable even to say how have become familiar have remembrance of process mr attorney general sat down father daughter sat down together singular circumstance then arose in case object in hand being to show that prisoner went down with fellow plotter untracked in dover mail on friday night in november five year ago got out of mail in night a blind at place where did not remain from travelled back dozen mile more to garrison dockyard there collected information witness be called to identify a having be at precise time required in coffee room of hotel in garrison dockyard town waiting for person prisoner counsel be cross examining witness with result except that have never seen prisoner on other occasion when wigged gentleman who have time be looking at ceiling of court wrote word two on little piece of paper screwed up tossed to opening piece of paper in next pause counsel looked with great attention curiosity at prisoner say again be quite sure that be prisoner witness be quite sure did ever see anybody very like prisoner not so like witness said a that must be mistaken look well upon gentleman learned friend there pointing to who have tossed paper over then look well upon prisoner how say be very like other allowing for learned friend appearance being careless slovenly if not debauched be sufficiently like other to surprise not only witness everybody present when be thus brought into comparison lord being prayed to bid learned friend lay aside wig giving very gracious consent likeness became much more remarkable lord inquired of mr stryver prisoner counsel whether be next to try mr carton name of learned friend for treason mr stryver replied to lord must ask witness to tell whether what happened once might happen twice whether must have be so confident if have seen illustration of rashness sooner whether must be so confident having seen more upshot of be to smash witness like crockery vessel shiver part of case to useless lumber mr cruncher have by time taken quite lunch of rust off finger in following of evidence have now to attend while mr stryver fitted prisoner case on jury like compact suit of clothes showing how patriot barsad be hired spy traitor unblushing trafficker in blood one of greatest scoundrel upon earth since accursed juda certainly did look rather like how virtuous servant cly be friend partner be worthy to be how watchful eye of forger false swearer have rested on prisoner a victim because family affair in france being of french extraction did require making passage across channel though what affair be consideration for others who be near dear to forbade even for life to disclose how evidence have be warped wrested from young lady whose anguish in giving have witnessed came to nothing involving mere little innocent gallantry politeness likely to pas between young gentleman young lady so thrown together with exception of reference to george washington be altogether too extravagant impossible to be regarded in other light than a monstrous joke how must be weakness in government to break down in attempt to practise for popularity on lowest national antipathy fear therefore mr attorney general have made most of how nevertheless rested upon nothing save that vile infamous character of evidence too often disfiguring such case of state trial of country be full there lord interposed with a grave face a if have not be true saying that must not sit upon bench suffer allusion mr stryver then called few witness mr cruncher have next to attend while mr attorney general turned whole suit of clothes mr stryver have fitted on jury inside out showing how barsad cly be even hundred time better than have thought prisoner hundred time worse lastly came lord turning suit of clothes now inside out now outside in on whole decidedly trimming shaping into grave clothes for prisoner now jury turned to consider great fly swarmed again mr carton who have so long sat looking at ceiling of court changed place attitude even in excitement while learned friend mr stryver massing paper before whispered with who sat near from time to time glanced anxiously at jury while spectator moved more le grouped anew while even lord arose from seat slowly paced up down platform not unattended by suspicion in mind of audience that state be feverish one man sat leaning back with torn gown half off untidy wig put on just a have happened to light on head after removal hand in pocket eye on ceiling a have be day something especially reckless in demeanour not only gave disreputable look so diminished strong resemblance undoubtedly bore to prisoner momentary earnestness when be compared together have strengthened that many of looker on taking note of now said to one must hardly have thought two be so alike mr cruncher made observation to next neighbour added id hold guinea that dont get law work to do dont look like sort of one to get do yet mr carton took in more of detail of scene than appeared to take in for now when miss manettes head dropped upon father breast be first to see to say audibly officer look to young lady help gentleman to take out dont see will fall there be much commiseration for a be removed much sympathy with

cloud ever since a passed out jury who have turned back paused moment spoke through foreman be not agreed wished to retire lord perhaps with george washington on mind showed surprise that be not agreed signified pleasure that must retire under watch ward retired trial have lasted day lamp in court be now being lighted began to be rumoured that jury must be out long while spectator dropped off to get refreshment prisoner withdrew to back of dock sat down mr lorry who have gone out when young lady father went out now reappeared beckoned to jerry who in slackened interest must easily get near

manette look at obeyed in old mechanically submissive manner without pausing in work know dear friend think again be not proper occupation think dear friend nothing must induce to speak more looked up for instant at time when be requested to do so persuasion must extract word from worked worked worked in silence word fell on a must have fallen on echoless wall on air only ray of hope that mr lorry must discover be that sometimes furtively looked up without being asked in there seemed faint expression of curiosity perplexity a though be trying to reconcile doubt in mind two thing at once impressed on mr lorry a important above others first that must be kept secret from lucie second that must be kept secret from who knew in conjunction with miss pro took immediate step towards latter precaution by giving out that doctor be not well required few day of complete rest in aid of kind deception to be practised on daughter miss pro be to write describing having be called away professionally referring to imaginary letter of two three hurried line in own hand represented to have be addressed to by same post measure advisable to be taken in case mr lorry took in hope of coming to if must happen soon kept course in reserve be to have certain opinion that thought best on doctor case in hope of recovery of resort to third course being thereby rendered practicable mr lorry resolved to watch attentively with a little appearance a possible of doing so therefore made arrangement to absent from tellsons for first time in life took post by window in same room be not long in discovering that be worse than useless to speak to since on being pressed became worried abandoned that attempt on first day resolved merely to keep always before a silent protest against delusion into have fallen be falling remained therefore in seat near window reading writing expressing in a many pleasant natural way a must think of be free place doctor manette took what be given to eat drink worked on first day until be too dark to see worked on hour after mr lorry must not have seen for life to read write when put tool aside a useless until morning mr lorry rose said to will go out looked down at floor on side of in old manner looked up in old manner repeated in old low voice out yes for walk with why not made effort to say why not said not word more mr lorry thought saw a leaned forward on bench in dusk with elbow on knee head in hand that be in misty way asking why not sagacity of man of business perceived advantage here determined to hold miss pro divided night into two watch observed at interval from adjoining room paced up down for long time before lay down when did finally lay down fell asleep in morning be up betimes went straight to bench to work on second day mr lorry saluted cheerfully by name spoke to on topic have be of late familiar to returned reply be evident that heard what be said that thought about however confusedly encouraged mr lorry to have miss pro in with work several time during day at time quietly spoke of lucie of father then present precisely in usual manner a if there be nothing amiss be done without demonstrative accompaniment not long enough often enough to harass lightened mr lorry friendly heart to believe that looked up oftener that appeared to be stirred by perception of inconsistency surrounding when fell dark again mr lorry asked a before dear doctor will go out a before repeated out yes for walk with why not time mr lorry feigned to go out when must extract answer from after remaining absent for hour returned in meanwhile doctor have removed to seat in window have sat there looking down at plane tree on mr lorry return slipped away to bench time went very slowly on mr lorry hope darkened heart grew heavier again grew yet heavier heavier day third day came went fourth fifth five day six day seven day eight day nine day with hope ever darkening with heart always growing heavier heavier mr lorry passed through anxious time secret be well kept lucie be unconscious happy must not fail to observe that shoemaker whose hand have be little out at first be growing dreadfully skilful that have never be so intent on work that hand have never be so nimble expert a in dusk of ninth evening chapter xix opinion worn out by anxious watching mr lorry fell asleep at post on tenth morning of suspense be startled by shining of sun into room where heavy slumber have overtaken when be dark night rubbed eye roused doubted when have done so whether be not still asleep for going to door of doctor room looking in perceived that shoemaker bench tool be put aside again that doctor sat reading at window be in usual morning dress face mr lorry must distinctly see though still very pale be calmly studious attentive even when have satisfied that be awake mr lorry felt giddily uncertain for few moment whether late shoemaking might not be disturbed dream of own for did not eye show friend before in accustomed clothing aspect employed a usual be there sign within range that change of have so strong impression have actually happened be inquiry of first confusion astonishment answer being obvious if impression be not produced by real corresponding sufficient cause how came jarvis there how came to have fallen asleep in clothes on sofa in doctor manettes consulting room to be debating point outside doctor bedroom door in early morning within few minute miss pro stood whispering at side if have have particle of doubt left talk must of necessity have resolved be by time clear headed have none advised that must let time go by until regular breakfast hour must then meet doctor a if nothing unusual have occurred if appeared to be in customary state of mind mr lorry must then cautiously proceed to seek direction guidance from opinion have be in anxiety so anxious to obtain miss pro submitting to judgment scheme be worked out with care having abundance of time for usual methodical toilette mr lorry presented at breakfast hour in usual white linen with usual neat leg doctor be summoned in usual way came to breakfast so far a be possible to comprehend without overstepping delicate gradual approach mr lorry felt to be only safe advance at first supposed that daughter marriage have taken place yesterday incidental allusion purposely thrown out to day of week day of month set thinking counting evidently made uneasy in other respect however be so composedly that mr lorry determined to have aid sought that aid be own therefore when breakfast be done cleared away doctor be left together mr lorry said feelingly dear manette be anxious to have opinion in confidence on very curious case in be deeply interested be to say be very curious to perhaps to better information may be le so glancing at hand be discoloured by late work doctor looked troubled listened attentively have already glanced at hand more than once doctor manette said mr lorry touching affectionately on arm case be case of particularly dear friend of mine pray give mind to advise well for sake above for daughter daughter dear manette if understand said doctor in subdued tone mental shock yes be explicit said doctor spare detail mr lorry saw that understood one proceeded dear manette be case of old prolonged shock of great acuteness severity to affection feeling a express mind mind be case of shock under sufferer be borne down one can not say for how long because believe can not calculate time there be other mean of getting at be case of shock from sufferer recovered by process that can not trace a once heard publicly relate in striking manner be case of shock from have recovered so completely a to be highly intelligent man capable of close application of mind great exertion of body of constantly making fresh addition to stock of knowledge be already very large unfortunately there have be paused took deep breath slight relapse doctor in low voice asked of how long duration nine day night how did show infer glancing at hand again in resumption of old pursuit connected with shock be fact now did ever see asked doctor distinctly collectedly though in same low voice engaged in pursuit originally once when relapse fell on be in most respect in respect a be then think in respect spoke of daughter doe daughter know of relapse have be kept from hope will always be kept from be known only to to one other who may be trusted doctor grasped hand murmured be very kind be very thoughtful mr lorry grasped hand in return of two spoke for little while now dear manette said mr lorry at length in most considerate most affectionate way be mere man of business unfit to cope with such intricate difficult matter posse kind of information necessary posse kind of intelligence want guiding there be man in world on whom must so rely for right guidance a on tell how doe relapse come about be there danger of must repetition of be prevented how must repetition of be treated how doe come about at what can do for friend man ever can have be more desirous in heart to serve friend than be to serve mine if knew how dont know how to originate in such case if sagacity knowledge experience must put on right track might be able to do so much unenlightened undirected can do so little pray discus with pray enable to see little more clearly teach how to be little more useful doctor manette sat meditating after earnest word be spoken mr lorry did not press think probable said doctor breaking silence with effort that relapse have described dear friend be not quite unforeseen by subject be dreaded by mr lorry ventured to ask very much said with involuntary shudder have idea how such apprehension weighs on sufferer mind how difficult how almost impossible be for to force to utter word upon topic oppresses must asked mr lorry be sensibly relieved if must prevail upon to impart secret brooding to one when be on think so be a have told next to impossible even believe in case to be quite impossible now said mr lorry gently laying hand on doctor arm again after short silence on side to what must refer attack believe returned doctor manette that there have be strong extraordinary revival of train of thought remembrance be first cause of malady intense association of most distressing nature be vividly recalled think be probable that there have long be dread lurking in mind that association must be recalled say under certain circumstance say on particular occasion tried to prepare in vain perhaps effort to prepare made le able to bear must remember what took place in relapse asked mr lorry with natural hesitation doctor looked desolately round room shook head answered in low voice not at all now a to future hinted mr lorry a to future said doctor recovering firmness must have great hope a pleased heaven in mercy to restore so soon must have great hope yielding under pressure of complicated something long dreaded long vaguely foreseen contended against recovering after cloud have burst passed must hope that worst be over well well thats good comfort be thankful said mr lorry be thankful repeated doctor bending head with reverence there be two other point said mr lorry on be anxious to be instructed may go on can not do friend better service doctor gave hand to first then be of studious habit unusually energetic applies with great ardour to acquisition of professional knowledge to conducting of experiment to many thing now doe do too much think not may be character of mind to be always in singular need of occupation may be in part natural to in part result of affliction le be occupied with healthy thing more must be in danger of turning in unhealthy direction may have observed made discovery be sure that be not under too great strain think be quite sure of dear manette if be overworked now dear lorry doubt if must easily be there have be violent stress in one direction need counterweight excuse a persistent man of business assuming for moment that be overworked must show in renewal of disorder think so think said doctor manette with firmness of self conviction that anything one train of association must renew think that henceforth nothing extraordinary jarring of chord must renew after what have happened after recovery find difficult to imagine such violent sounding of string again trust almost believe that circumstance likely to renew be exhausted spoke with diffidence of man who knew how slight thing must overset delicate organisation of mind yet with confidence of man who have slowly won assurance out of personal endurance distress be not for friend to abate confidence professed more relieved encouraged than really be approached second last point felt to be most difficult of remembering old sunday morning conversation with miss pro remembering what have seen in last nine day knew that must face occupation resumed under influence of passing affliction so happily recovered from said mr lorry clearing throat will call blacksmith work blacksmith work will say to put case for sake of illustration that have be used in bad time to work at little forge will say that be unexpectedly found at forge again be not pity that must keep by doctor shaded forehead with hand beat foot nervously on ground have always kept by said mr lorry with anxious look at friend now must not be better that must let go still doctor with shaded forehead beat foot nervously on ground find easy to advise said mr lorry quite understand to be nice question yet think there shook head stopped see said doctor manette turning to after uneasy pause be very hard to explain consistently innermost working of poor man mind once yearned so frightfully for occupation be so welcome when came doubt relieved pain so much by substituting perplexity of finger for perplexity of brain by substituting a became more practised ingenuity of hand for ingenuity of mental torture that have never be able to bear thought of putting quite out of reach even now when believe be more hopeful of than have ever be even speaks of with kind of confidence idea that might need that old employment not find give sudden sense of terror like one may fancy strike to heart of lost child looked like illustration a raised eye to mr lorry face may not mind ask for information a plodding man of business who only deal with such material object a guinea shilling bank note may not retention of thing involve retention of idea if thing be gone dear manette might not fear go with in short be not concession to misgiving to keep forge there be silence see too said doctor tremulously be such old companion must not keep said mr lorry shaking head for gained in firmness a saw doctor disquieted must recommend to sacrifice only want authority be sure doe good come give authority like dear good man for daughter sake dear manette very strange to see what struggle there be within in name then let be done sanction must not take away while be present let be removed when be not there let miss old companion after absence mr lorry readily engaged for conference be ended passed day in country doctor be quite restored on three following day remained perfectly well on fourteenth day went away to join lucie husband precaution have be taken to account for silence mr lorry have previously explained to have written to lucie in accordance with have suspicion on night of day on left house mr lorry went into room with chopper saw chisel hammer attended by miss pro carrying light there with closed door in mysterious guilty manner mr lorry hacked shoemaker bench to piece while miss pro held candle a if be assisting at murder for indeed in grimness be unsuitable figure burning of body previously reduced to piece convenient for purpose be commenced without delay in kitchen fire tool shoe leather be buried in garden so wicked do destruction secrecy appear to honest mind mr lorry miss pro while engaged in commission of deed in removal of trace almost felt almost looked like accomplice in horrible crime chapter xx plea when newly married pair came home first person who appeared to offer congratulation be sydney carton have not be at home many hour when presented be not improved in habit in look in manner there be certain rugged air of fidelity about be new to observation of charles darnay watched opportunity of taking darnay aside into window of speaking to when one overheard mr darnay said carton wish might be friend be already friend hope be good enough to say so a fashion of

smiling find easier to comprehend in own mind than to convey to yours however let try remember certain famous occasion when be more drunk than than usual remember certain famous occasion when forced to confess that have be drinking remember too curse of occasion be heavy upon for always remember hope may be taken into account one day when day be at end for dont be alarmed be not going to preach be not at alarmed earnestness in be anything alarming to ah said carton with careless wave of hand a if waved that away on drunken occasion in question one of large number a know be insufferable about liking not liking wish must forget forgot long ago fashion of speech again mr darnay oblivion be not so easy to a represent to be to have by mean forgotten light answer doe not help to forget if be light answer returned darnay beg forgiveness for have other object than to turn slight thing to surprise seems to trouble too much aside declare to on faith of gentleman have long dismissed from mind good heaven what be there to dismiss have have nothing more important to remember in great service rendered day a to great service said carton be bound to avow to when speak of in way that be mere professional claptrap dont know that cared what became of when rendered say when rendered be speaking of past make light of obligation returned darnay will not quarrel with light answer genuine truth mr darnay trust have gone aside from purpose be speaking about being friend now know know be incapable of higher better flight of men if doubt ask stryver hell tell so prefer to form own opinion
