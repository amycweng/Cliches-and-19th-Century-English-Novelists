horseback be one of circus people who always came down to mudfog at time of year who have be engaged by nicholas tulrumble expressly for occasion there be horse whisking tail about balancing on hind leg flourishing away with fore foot in manner must have gone to heart soul of reasonable crowd mudfog crowd never be reasonable one in probability never will be instead of scattering very fog with shout a ought most indubitably to have done be fully intended to do by nicholas tulrumble sooner recognized herald than began to growl forth most unqualified disapprobation at bare notion of riding like other man if have come out on head indeed jumping through hoop flying through red hot drum even standing on one leg with other foot in mouth might have have something to say to for professional

horse being used to arena not to street must stand still dance instead of going on prancingall of be matter might be dilated upon to great advantage have not least intention of dilating upon notwithstanding oh be grand beautiful sight to behold corporation in glass coach provided at sole cost charge of nicholas tulrumble coming rolling along like funeral out of mourning to watch attempt corporation made to look great solemn when nicholas tulrumble in four wheel chaise with tall postilion rolled out after with mr jennings on one side to look like chaplain supernumerary on other with old life guardsman sabre to imitate sword bearer to see tear rolling down face of mob a screamed with merriment be beautiful so be appearance of mr tulrumble son a bowed with grave dignity out of coach window to dirty face be laughing around be not even with that have to do with sudden stopping of procession at blast of trumpet whereat whereupon profound silence ensued eye be turned towards mudfog hall in confident anticipation of new wonder wont laugh now mr jennings said nicholas tulrumble think not sir said mr jennings see how eager look said nicholas tulrumble aha laugh will be on

armour got by mean other rather out of calculation in hurry confusion of preparation drank about four glass to piece instead of one not to mention something strong went on top of whether brass armour checked natural flow of perspiration thus prevented spirit from evaporating be not scientific enough to know whatever cause be mr twigger sooner found outside gate of mudfog hall than also found in very considerable state of intoxication hence extraordinary style of progressing be bad enough a if fate fortune have conspired against nicholas tulrumble mr twigger not having be penitent for good calendar month took into head to be most especially particularly sentimental just when repentance must have be most conveniently dispensed with immense tear be rolling down cheek be vainly endeavouring to conceal grief by applying to eye blue cotton pocket handkerchief with white spotsan article not strictly in keeping with suit of armour three hundred year old thereabouts twigger

being smothered in antique costumedear mr jennings can nothing be done with nothing at replied ned nothing at gentleman im unhappy wretch im body gentleman in brass coffin at poetical idea of own conjuring up ned cried so much that people began to get sympathetic to ask what tulrumble meant by putting man into such machine a one individual in hairy waistcoat like top of trunk who have previously expressed opinion that if ned hadnt be poor man nicholas have dared do hinted at propriety of breaking four wheel chaise nicholas head last compound proposition crowd seemed to consider very good notion be not acted upon however for have hardly be broached when ned twiggers wife made appearance abruptly in little circle before noticed ned sooner caught glimpse of face form than from mere force of habit set off towards home just a fast a leg must carry be not very quick in present instance either for however ready might have be to carry couldnt get on very well under brass armour so mr twigger have plenty of time to denounce nicholas tulrumble to face to express opinion that be decided monster to intimate that if ill used husband sustained personal damage from brass armour must have law of nicholas tulrumble for manslaughter when have said with due vehemence posted after ned who be dragging along a best must deploring unhappiness in most dismal tone what wailing

remembered that harlequin be occasionally guilty of witty even clever act be rather disposed to acquit young men of family independent property generally speaking of such misdemeanour on more mature consideration of subject have arrived at conclusion that harlequin of life be just ordinary men to be found in particular walk degree on whom certain station particular conjunction of circumstance confers magic wand brings to few word on pantomime of public political life will say at once then concludemerely premising in place that decline reference to columbine being in wise satisfied of

illustrative of excellent quality one old spelling book in particular recount touching instance of old lion of high moral dignity stern principle who felt imperative duty to devour young man who have contracted habit of swearing a striking example to rising generation be extremely pleasant to reflect upon indeed say very great deal in favour of lion a mass be bound to state however that such individual lion a have happened to fall in with have not put forth very striking characteristic have not acted up to chivalrous character assigned by chronicler never saw lion in what be called

sluggish quadruped remember to have ever seen one of perfectly awake except at feeding time in respect uphold biped lion against four footed namesake boldly challenge controversy upon subject with opinion may be easily imagined that curiosity interest be very much excited other day when lady of acquaintance called on resolutely declined to accept refusal of invitation to evening party for said

hope to obtain full view of interesting animal two three hour passed quadrille began room filled lion appeared lady of house became inconsolablefor be one of peculiar privilege of lion to make solemn

to one gentleman whispered very choice thing that noble animal have said in very act of coming up stair of course rendered mental effort still more astonishing to murmured hasty account of grand

to obtain seat nearly opposite of course keeper be there already have planted at precisely distance from charge afforded decent pretext for raising voice when addressed to so loud key a must not fail to attract attention of whole company immediately began to apply seriously to task of bringing lion out putting through whole of manuvres such flash of wit a elicited from lion first of began to make pun upon salt cellar then upon breast of fowl then upon trifle best joke of be decidedly on lobster salad upon latter subject lion came out most vigorously in opinion of most competent authority quite outshone be very excellent mode of shining in society be founded humbly conceive upon classic model of dialogue between mr punch friend proprietor wherein latter take up hill work be content to pioneer to joke repartee of mr p who never fails to gain great credit excite much laughter thereby whatever be founded on however recommend to lion present to come for in instance succeeded to admiration perfectly dazzled whole body of hearer when salt cellar fowl breast trifle lobster salad be exhausted must not afford standing room for solitary witticism keeper performed that very dangerous feat be still done with of caravan lion although in one instance terminated fatally of putting head in animal mouth placing entirely at mercy boswell frequently present melancholy instance of lamentable result of achievement other keeper jackal have be terribly lacerated for daring be due to lion to state that condescended to be trifled with in most gentle manner finally went home with
