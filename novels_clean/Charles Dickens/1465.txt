attention turning to then said rely upon captain ravender have be without rest too long novelty be only in state of sense of hearing thought so too by time think so now though can never know for

frightfully be beating in furious manner must not see men a went forward must hear that be hauling in sail in disorder have trumpet in hand after directing encouraging in till be done hailed first john steadiman then second mate mr william rames answered clearly steadily now have practised crew a have ever made custom to practise who sail with to take certain station wait order in case of unexpected crisis when voice be heard hailing voice be heard answering be aware through noise of ship sea cry of passenger below there be pause be ready rames ay ay sir then light up for god sake in moment be burning blue light ship on board seemed to be enclosed in mist of light under great black dome light shone up so high must see huge iceberg upon have struck cloven at top down middle exactly like penrith church in dream at same moment must see watch last relieved crowding up down on deck must see mr atherfield miss coleshaw thrown about on top of companion a struggled to bring child up from below must see that mast be going with shock beating of ship must see frightful breach stove in on starboard side length of vessel sheathing timber spirting up must see that cutter be disabled in

top of mountain seen whole remainder of world sink away from under must hardly have felt more shocked solitary than did when knew be alone on wide ocean that beautiful ship in most of have be securely asleep within hour be gone for ever there be awful silence in boat kind of palsy on rower man at rudder felt be scarcely keeping before sea spoke out then said let one here thank lord for preservation voice answered even child thank lord then said lord prayer hand said after with solemn murmuring then gave word cheerily o men cheerily felt that be handling boat again a boat ought to be handled surf boat now burnt blue light to show where be made for laid ourselves a nearly alongside of a dared have always kept boat with coil two of good stout stuff in of so boat have rope at hand made shift with much labour trouble to get near enough to one to divide blue light be use after night for sea water soon got at to get tow rope out between night long kept together sometimes obliged to cast off rope sometimes getting out again of wearying for morning appeared so long in coming that old mr rarx screamed out in spite of fear of world be drawing to end sun will never rise more when day broke found that be huddled together in miserable manner be deep in water being a found on mustering thirty one in number at least six too many in surf boat be fourteen in number being at least four too many first thing did be to get passed to rudder took from time to get mr atherfield child miss coleshaw passed on to sit next a to old mr rarx put in bow a far from a must put of best men near in order

one piece of raw beef one piece of raw pork bag of coffee roasted not ground thrown in imagine by mistake for something else two small cask of water about gallon of rum in keg surf boat having rather more rum than fewer to drink gave a estimated quart into keg in return gave three double handful of coffee tied up in piece of handkerchief reported that have aboard besides bag of biscuit piece of beef small cask of water small box of lemon dutch cheese took long time to make exchange be not made without risk to party sea running quite high enough to make approaching near to one very hazardous in bundle with coffee conveyed to john steadiman who have ship compass with paper written in pencil torn from pocket book containing course meant to steer in hope of making land being picked up by vessel say in hope though have little hope of deliverance then sang out to so a might hear that if two boat must live die together must that if must be parted by weather join company no more must have prayer blessing asked for theirs then gave three cheer returned saw men head droop in boat a fell to oar again arrangement have occupied general attention advantageously for though a expressed in last sentence ended in sorrowful feeling now said few word to fellow voyager on subject of small stock of food on life depended if be preserved from great deep on rigid necessity of eking out in most frugal manner one replied that allowance thought best to lay down must be strictly kept to made pair of scale out of thin scrap of iron plating twine got together for weight such of heaviest button among a calculated made up fraction over two ounce be allowance of solid food served out once day to from time to end with addition of coffee berry sometimes one when weather be very fair for breakfast have nothing else pint of water per day sometimes when be coldest weakest teaspoonful of rum served out a dram know how learnedly can be shown rum be poison also know that in case a in similar case have ever read of be numerous word can express comfort support derived from have least doubt that saved life of far more than number having mentioned pint of water a daily allowance ought to observe sometimes have le sometimes have more for much rain fell caught in canvas stretched for purpose thus at tempestuous time of year in tempestuous part of world shipwrecked people rose fell with wave be not intention to relate if can avoid such circumstance appertaining to doleful condition a have be better told in many other narrative of kind than can be expected to tell will only note in so many passing word day after day night after night received sea upon back to prevent from swamping boat that one party be always kept baling that hat cap among soon got worn out though patched up fifty time a only vessel have for service that party lay down in bottom of boat while third rowed that be soon in boil blister rag other boat be source of such anxious interest to of used to wonder whether if be saved time must ever come when survivor in boat of ours must be at indifferent to fortune of survivor in got out tow rope whenever weather permitted that did not often happen how two party kept within same horizon a did who mercifully permitted to be so for consolation only know never will forget look with when morning light came used to gaze about over stormy water for other boat once parted company for seventy two hour believed to have gone down a did joy on side when came within view of one again have something in manner divine in be so forgetful of individual suffering in tear of delight sympathy for people in other boat have be wanting to get round to individual personal part of subject a call foregoing incident put in right way patience good disposition aboard of be wonderful be not surprised by in woman for men born of woman know what great quality will show when men will fail own be little surprised by in of men among one thirty people assembled at best of time there will usually must say be two three uncertain temper knew that have more than one rough temper with among own people for have chosen for long boat might have under eye softened under misery be a considerate of lady a compassionate of child a best among among men must not have be more so heard scarcely complaining party lying down must moan good deal in sleep must often notice man not always same man be to be understood nearly of at one time other sitting moaning at oar in place a looked mistily over sea when happened to be long before must catch eye must go on moaning time in dismallest manner when look met must brighten leave off almost always got impression that did not know what sound have be making that thought have be humming tune suffering from cold wet be far greater than suffering from hunger managed to keep child warm doubt if one else among ever be warm for five minute together shivering chattering of teeth be sad to hear child cried little at first for lost playfellow golden mary hardly ever whimpered afterwards when state of weather made possible used now then to be held up in arm of of to look over sea for john steadiman boat see golden hair innocent face now between driving cloud like angel going to fly away have happened on second day towards night that mr atherfield in getting little lucy to sleep sang song have soft melodious voice when have finished people up begged for sang after have fallen dark ended with evening hymn from time whenever anything must be heard above sea wind while have voice left nothing must serve people that must sing at sunset always did always ended with evening hymn mostly took up last line shed tear when be done not miserably have prayer night morning also when weather allowed of twelve night eleven day have be driving in boat when old mr rarx began to be delirious to cry out to to throw gold overboard must sink must be lost for day past child have be declining be great cause of wildness have be over over again shrieking out to to give remaining meat to give remaining rum to save at cost must be ruined at time lay in mother arm at foot one of little hand be almost always creeping about mother neck chin have watched wasting of little hand knew be nearly over old man cry be so discordant with mother love submission called out to in angry voice unless held peace on instant must order to be knocked on head thrown overboard be mute then until child died very peacefully hour afterwards be known to in boat by mother breaking out into lamentation for first time since wreck for have great fortitude constancy though be little gentle woman old mr rarx then became quite ungovernable tearing what rag have on raging in imprecation calling to that if have thrown gold overboard always gold with might have saved child now say in terrible voice will founder go to devil for sin will sink when have innocent child to bear up so discovered with amazement that old wretch have only cared for life of pretty little creature dear to of because of influence superstitiously hoped might have in preserving altogether be too much for smith armourer who be sitting next old man to bear took by throat rolled under thwart where lay still enough for hour afterwards thirteenth night miss coleshaw lying across knee a kept helm comforted supported poor mother child covered with pea jacket of mine lay in lap troubled night to think that there be prayer book among must remember very few of exact word of burial service when stood up at broad day knew what be going to be done noticed that poor fellow made motion of uncovering head though head have be stark bare to sky sea for many weary hour there be long heavy swell on otherwise be fair morning there be broad field of sunlight on wave in east said more than be resurrection life saith lord raised daughter of jairus ruler said be not dead slept raised widow son arose be seen of many loved little child saying suffer to come unto rebuke not for of such be kingdom of heaven in name friend committed to merciful goodness with word laid rough face softly on placid little forehead buried golden lucy in grave of golden mary having have on mind to relate end of dear little child have omitted something from exact place will supply here will come quite a well here a anywhere else foreseeing that if boat lived through stormy weather time must come soon come when must have absolutely morsel to eat have one momentous point often in thought although have year before fully satisfied that instance in human being in last distress have fed upon other be exceedingly few have very seldom indeed if ever occurred when people in distress however dreadful extremity have be accustomed to moderate forbearance restraint say though have long before quite satisfied mind on topic felt doubtful whether there might not have be in former case harm danger from keeping out of sight pretending not to think of felt doubtful whether mind growing weak with fasting exposure having such terrific idea to dwell upon in secret might not magnify until got to have awful attraction about be not new thought of mine for have grown out of reading however came over stronger than have ever done before a have reason for doing in boat on fourth day decided must bring out into light unformed fear must have be more le darkly in brain among therefore a mean of beguiling time inspiring hope gave best summary in power of bligh voyage of more than three thousand mile in open boat after mutiny of bounty of wonderful preservation of boat crew listened throughout with great interest concluded by telling that in opinion happiest circumstance in whole narrative be that bligh who be delicate man have solemnly placed on record therein that be sure certain that under conceivable circumstance must emaciated party who have gone through pain of famine have preyed on one can not describe visible relief spread through boat how tear stood in eye from time be a well convinced a bligh that there be danger that phantom at rate did not haunt now be part of bligh experience that when people in boat be most cast down nothing did so much good a hearing story told by one of number when mentioned that saw that struck general attention a much a did own for have not thought of until came to in summary be on day after mr atherfield first sang to proposed that whenever weather must permit must have story two hour after dinner always issued allowance have mentioned at one o'clock called by name a well a song at sunset proposal be received with cheerful satisfaction that warmed heart within say too much when say that two period in four twenty hour be expected with positive pleasure be really enjoyed by hand spectre a soon be in bodily wasting imagination did not perish like gross flesh upon bone music adventure two of great gift of providence to mankind must charm long after be lost wind be almost always against after second day for many day together must not nearly hold own have variety of bad weather have rain hail snow wind mist thunder lightning still boat lived through heavy sea still perishing people rose fell with great wave sixteen night fifteen day twenty night nineteen day twenty four night twenty three day so time went on disheartening a knew that progress want of progress must be never deceived a to calculation of in first place felt that be too near eternity for deceit in second place knew that if failed died man who followed must have knowledge of true state of thing to begin upon when told at noon what reckoned have made lost generally received what said in tranquil resigned manner always gratefully towards be not unusual at time of day for one to burst out weeping loudly without new cause when burst be over to calm down little better than before have seen exactly same thing in house of mourning during whole of time old mr rarx have have fit of calling out to to throw gold always gold overboard of heaping violent reproach upon for not having saved child now food being gone having nothing left to serve out bit of coffee berry now then began to be too weak to do consequently fell silent mr atherfield miss coleshaw generally lay with arm across one of knee head upon never complained at up to time of child death mr atherfield have bound up own beautiful hair day took particular notice that be always before sang song at night when everyone looked at never did after loss of darling must have be now tangled with dirt wet that miss coleshaw be careful of long after be must sometimes smooth down with weak thin hand be past mustering story now one day at about period reverted to superstition of old mr rarx concerning golden lucy told that nothing vanished from eye of god though much might pas away from eye of men be of say child once baby foot have strolled in green wood ashore baby hand have gathered flower in garden where bird be singing child that be be not lost to great knowledge of creator innocent creature will appear with before plead for what be in best time of generous youth will arise go with too purest part of life will not desert at pas to of here present be gliding what be then will be a much in existence before a what be now be le comforted by consideration than be miss coleshaw drawing ear nearer to lip said captain ravender be on way to marry disgraced broken man whom dearly loved when be honourable good word seem to have come out of own poor heart pressed hand upon smiling twenty seven night twenty six day be in want of rain water have nothing else yet even now never turned eye upon waking face tried to brighten before mine o what thing be in time of danger in presence of death shining of face upon face have heard broached that order must be given in great new ship by electric telegraph admire machinery a much be man be a thankful to a man can be for what doe for will never be substitute for face of man with soul in encouraging man to be brave true never try for that will break down like straw now began to remark certain change in did not like caused much disquiet often saw golden lucy in air above boat often saw have spoken of before sitting beside saw golden mary go down a really have gone down twenty time in day yet sea be mostly to thinking not sea neither moving country extraordinary mountainous region like of have never be beheld felt time to leave last word regarding john steadiman in case lip must last out to repeat to living ear said that john have told a have on deck that have sung out breaker ahead instant be audible have
