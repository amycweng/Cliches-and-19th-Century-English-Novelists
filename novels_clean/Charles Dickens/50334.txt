first comparatively deep ditch that grew willower year from accumulation formed by uneven bottom there be who admitted that might be a well to clean out yet nobody set about be truly more difficult affair now than must have be at earlier time if ditch be willower be much wider have once be twelve foot wide be now eighteen when drain have be flowing into after rainy day content spread through over soil on side softened then next time horse cow came to drink whole bank be made perfect bog for poor animal however thirsty tried twenty place to find water that must drink before going away in despair such be bar in way of poor woodruffes success with ground before end of summer patience be nearly worn out during showery gleamy may pleasant june have gone on a prosperously a must expect under circumstance confidently anticipated that seasonable july august must set up have have no previous experience of peculiarity of ill drained land hot july august from hoped so much did terrible mischief drought must have merely dried pulverized well drained soil leaving free to profit much by small watering baked overcharged soil of woodruffes garden into hard hot mass of clay amidst produce died off faster faster day even though family wore out strength with constant watering did hope said that must have be spared drought at least seemed a if be to have plague in turn drought seemed at time to be worst of one day fleming saw welcome face in one of carriage mr nelson director of railway who be looking along line to see how matter went though mr nelson be not exactly one of director whom fleming must have chosen to appeal to saw that opportunity must not be lost entreated to alight stay for next train eh what said mr nelson what can want with here station like why one have to put on spectacle to see if must come down sir must be glad to show well suppose must a be standing on little platform train be growing smaller in distance fleming proceeded to business told of serious complaint be made for distance of few mile on hand of clay pit left by railway brickmakers to fill with stagnant water pho pho be that what want to say replied mr nelson need not have stopped just to tell that hear of pit along line be sick of hearing of doe not mend matter in place observed fleming speak freely sir think duty to say that something must be done few day ago more than people hereabouts know much more than will tell of fever have settled on particular point of line now assure sir that if fever once get hold in place believe may carry off before anything can be done sir there be not one of within mile of station have wholesome dwelling pho pho be croaker declared mr nelson never saw such dismal fellow why will die of fright if ever die of anything then sir will have goodness to walk round with see for what think of thing be not only for myself family that speak in evil day induced wife family to settle here ay be nice garden observed mr nelson a fleming pointed to woodruffes land be croaker fleming declare think place be much improved since saw last people must not come settle here if place be like what say instead of arguing matter fleming led way down long flight of step be aware that leading gentleman among bad smell over shoe in foul bog must have more effect than argument be ever known to have on contradictious spirit must have seen worse thing than then must not be so discontented observed mr nelson striking stick upon hard baked soil intersected with crack have seen soil a in day after battle when there be score of finger toe sticking up out of crack what must say to eh may have chance of seeing that here replied fleming if plague come come too fast for coffin maker thing have happened more than once in england believe mr nelson stopped to laugh certainly attended more to business a went on fleming who knew something of way have hope that if must only keep own temper visit of director might not be without good result in passing through woodruffes garden very nice management be necessary woodruffe be at work there charged with ire against railway director landed proprietor whom amidst pang of rheumatism regarded a poisoner of land bane of fortune while on other hand mr nelson who have certainly never be market gardener criticized ridiculed everything met eye what be use of such tool house a big enough for house for what be use of such low fence of such high screen of making walk so wide sheer waste of making bed so long one way so narrow of planting sowing that thing nobody wanted woodruffe have pushed back hat in preparation for defiant reply when fleming caught eye by good tempered smile conveyed to that have oddity to deal with allan who have begun by listening reverently be now looking from one to in great

intermission when sick child began to move rouse look at stranger a if braced by vigor of mother tongue prospect of end seemed farther off than ever mr nelson shrugged shoulder signed to companion walked away through alder woman be not silent because be out of sight voice waxed shriller a followed died away only in distance moss be grasping fleming hand with might when mr nelson spoke to shook stick at asking how came to play with such people saying that if ever heard learning to scold like woman must beat with stick so moss vowed never must when train be in sight by mr nelson be to depart

fleming be dreadful loss be that sort of men that fever cut off said surgeon strong man in prime of life at best period one may say for for society be taken away leaving wife child helpless forlorn be ravage that fever make well must not people tell that be duty to submit asked mr nelson who must not help showing emotion by voice countenance submit said surgeon depends on what people mean who use word if be ill of fever must resign a cheerfully a must if ask whether must submit to see more of neighbor cut off by fever a have be can only ask in return whose doing be that be living in swamp whether be to go on who dug clay pit who let that ditch run abroad make filthy bog be going to charge upon providence talk of submitting to consequence if so be not religion there be religion in

family in england than be now said woodruffe a sat among child few hour after funeral child be glad to hear speak however gloomy might be tone silence have be so terrible that nothing that must say must so weigh upon heart word however brought out widowed daughter tear again be sewing infant lying in lap a tear fell upon face moved cried becky came took up spoke cheerfully to cheerfulness seemed to be worst of poor abby laid forehead to back of chair sobbed a if heart must break ay abby said father heart be breaking mine too can go to rest like have gone before have to think of what will become of young thing yes father said becky gently with tone of remonstrance must endeavor to live not make up mind to dying because life have grown heavy sad dear be ill very ill be not merely that life be grown intolerable to be sure must not live long in such misery of mind be breaking up fast young people looked at other in dismay there be something worse than grief conveyed by father word in hopeless daring despair of tone when ventured to say that life be unendurable becky have child on one arm with other hand took down father plaid from peg put round rheumatic shoulder whispering in ear few word about desiring god will must be done dear replied be who taught that lesson when be child on knee must be strange if forgot when want so much comfort can get dont believe if ask clergyman will tell that doe not believe that be god will that other people must be thrust into swamp like scarcely fit for rat frog to live in be man doing not god that fever make such havoc a have made with fever doe not lay waste healthy place then why be here allan ventured to say father let go go wonder how where cant go let of go have not pound in world to spend in moving in finding new employment if have who must employ who must not laugh at crippled old man asking for work wage then father must see what can do here must not forbid to say god will be done if can not go away must be will that must stay have a much hope courage a can woodruffe threw back in chair be too much to expect that must immediately rally let young people confer plan cheer other first thing to be done agreed be to move hither whenever dismal rain must permit abbys furniture must not be disposed of to husband successor must fit up lower room allan becky settled how thing must stand so a to make at once bed room sitting room if a abby have said meant to try to get scholar keep little school room must be left to seat child keep school exclaimed woodruffe looking round at abby yes father said abby raising head seems to be thing can do will be good for to have something to do becky be stoutest of wonder how long will last groaned father be quite stout now said becky be one to help allan with garden allan will work under direction father while rheumatism last what be to do asked moss pushing in will fetch carry tool said becky be when weather be fine when chilblain be not very bad will be bird boy when sowing season come on be going to put up pent house for in one corner know moss said brother will make so that there will be room for fire in where father may warm yourselves always have dry shoe ready wonder what shoe leather will have cost by time spring come observed woodruffe there be not place where ever have to take cart barrow be not mire rut not path in whole garden call decent one shoe be pulled to piece while frost fog something other prevents getting real work done waste be dreadful nothing must have made take garden where none summer crop be to be have if must have foreseen such thing never saw such thing before never a market gardening without winter spring crop never heard of such thing becky glanced towards allan to see if have nothing to propose if must neither mend place leave did seem hard case allan be looking into fire musing when moss announced that rain be over allan started said must be fetching of abbys thing down if be fair becky really meant to help also wanted opportunity for consultation a to whether must really be god will that must neither be able to mend condition to escape from a mounted long flight of step saw mr nelson issue from station looking about to ascertain if rain be over take stand on embankment followed by gentleman who have roll of paper in hand a stood one be seen to point with stick other with roll of paper way allan set off in direction saying to sister a went dont come that gentleman be so rude will make cry must go wont get angry wont indeed may find a much fault a plea must show how water be standing in furrow hallo what do want here be mr nelson greeting when after minute two saw allan looking listening what business have here hearkening to what be saying wanted to know whether anything be going to be done below there thought if wished must tell something about what dainty little fellow like fellow wear sunday clothes on tuesday rainy tuesday too must get working clothes work will work to morrow sir mother brother in law be buried to day lord bless must have told that how must know that unless told proceeded in much gentler tone however merely remonstrating with allan for letting wet stand in furrow in such way a must spoil garden allan have good ally while in stranger who seemed to understand everything before be explained gentleman be in fact agricultural surveyor one who must tell when looking abroad from height be swamp what meadow where there be clean drain where uneven ditch where soil be likely to be watered where flooded by winter rain where genially warmed where fatally baked by summer sun have seen before allan pointed out how great ditch cut across between cultivated ground little river into ground must be drained must not know till told by allan who be proprietor occupier of parcel of land lying on side ditch mr nelson knew little nothing under head though contradicted lad minute be sure such one did not live here there told be confusing mr smith mr brown did not believe word of mr taylor having bought yonder meadow mr scott now renting field while surveyor went on setting down name a allan told then observed that be not so many that might combine if must to drain property if must be relieved of obstruction of ditch if surveyor of highway must see that ditch be taken in hand mr nelson pronounced that there must be difficulty about ditch if rest must be managed then after few whispered word between gentleman allan be asked first whether be sure that knew where person lived whose name be down in surveyor book next whether must act a guide to morrow for moment thought must be wanted to move abbys thing remembering vast importance of plan seemed now to be fairly growing under eye replied that must go must be happy to make day work to help ever so little towards what wished above everything in world what make in hurry to suppose want to get day work out of for nothing asked mr nelson thrust crown into lad waistcoat pocket saying that must give back again if led gentleman wrong gentleman have time to go running about country on fool errand allan must mind that a allan touched hat ran down step mr nelson observed that boy with good heart did not fly about in way a if be merry on day of mother funeral perhaps be rather thinking of saving father observed surveyor well save a many of a can seem going to pot a be when allan burst in carrying nothing of abbys having little color in cheek for once father sat up in chair baby suddenly stopped cry moss asked where have be at first father disappointed by being listless first refusing to believe anything good then saying that good must happen now be too late abby must not help cry more because be not thought about year sooner be poor husband have made stir now be going to take advice very day that be laid in grave tried to comfort said how natural be that must feel so yet amidst sympathy must not help being cheered that something be to be done at last by degree not slow degree woodruffe became animated be surprising how many thing desired allan to be sure not to forget to point out to surveyor to urge upon be to visit at last said must go be very serious business ought to make effort to have done properly be great effort must make not rheumatism anything else must keep at home allan be glad at heart to see such sign of energy in father though might feel natural disappointment at being left at home perplexity a to what in case ought to do about half crown if mr nelson must be gone home morning settled however surveyor be in gig if allan must hang on keep up with must be very well a must be wanted to open gate to lead way in place too wet for father who be not worth such pair of patent waterproof tall boot a surveyor have on circuit be not very wide one be dark before got home there be always difficulty in arrangement require combined action here there be different level in land different temper view among occupier mr brown have heard nothing about matter must not be hurried till saw occasion mr taylor liked field best wet must not have drier on account for fear of summer sun when assured that drought took hold on well dried land in comparison with wet land shook with laughter asked if expected to believe that mr scott whose combination with two others be essential to drainage of three portion must wait year must go on without after year must see what must do have drained land in own way long ago did not expect that anybody must ask to put spade into man land to let other man put spade into be obstruction everybody else be willing at least not obstructive by clever management be thought that party concerned must make island of mr scott field win over mr brown by time be wanted show mr taylor that a field must no longer be a wet a have be might a well try opposite condition promising to flood field a often a thoroughly a pleased if found worse for being drained must not obtain wished where everybody be not a wise a must be wished so much be agreed upon a made experienced surveyor think that rest must follow enough already to set more laborer to work than place must furnish two three stout men be sent from distance when have once cut clear descent from ditch to river have sunk ditch to seven foot deep made bottom even narrowed to three foot be curious thing to see how ready neighbor became to unite drain with used to be said that here however might be elsewhere winter be time for digging must have meant that winter digging must bring spring crop that therefore be useless now sound of spade never ceased for rest of winter laborer thought best winter have ever known for constant work who employed labor hoped must answer found expensive must trust be right must yield profit by by a for woodruffes be too poor to employ laborer little hope have entered heart again brought strength not only to heart to very limb worked like people beginning world a poor abby must keep house sew while attending to little school becky did lighter part be far from light of garden work finding easy task for moss allan worked like man at drain have be called good drain before now there be outfall for deeper one deeper must be made moreover strong rivalry arose among neighbor about respective portion of combined drainage under stimulus of ambition woodruffe recovered spirit use of limb wonderfully suffered cruelly from rheumatism in evening felt a if must never more lift spade yet not le be at work again in morning so sanguine a to improvement of ground that be necessary to remind when calculating gain that must take two year at least to prove effect of present labor vii be observed by woodruffes family during one week of spring of next year that be very absent be not in low spirit absorbed in thought much devoted to making calculation with pencil paper at last out came one morning at breakfast wonder how must like to have harry hardiman to work with again one looked up harry where be harry be here be coming why will tell have be thinking said father have thought long carefully believe have made up mind to send for harry to come work for a used to do have not labor enough on ground two stout men to acre be smallest allowance for trying what must be made of place be what taylor brown be employing now on best part of land said allan be when can get labor there be such difference between one man to four five acre a there be before that cant always get labor just so therefore continued woodruffe be thinking of sending for harry old neighborhood be not prosperous when left fancy can not have improved since harry might be glad to follow master to thriving neighborhood be such careful fellow dare say have money for journey even if have wife by time a suppose have moss looked most pleased where be pleased at idea of seeing harry again remembrance of harry be of tall young man who used to carry on shoulder wheel in empty water barrel sometimes offer to dip into when be full show how to dig in sand heap with little wooden spade rent to be sure be much lower than in old place observed abby why must not build upon replied father rent be rising here will rise landlord be considerate in lowering mine to per acre when saw how impossible be to make answer say will not ask more yet on account of labor laid out at time of drainage when have partly repaid rent will rise to in fact have made calculation in regard to harrys coming at higher rent than higher than yes must not be surprised if found paying a market gardener near london do ten pound per acre before die rather to let ground to for father said allan when be own property be tired of work disposed to turn over to will pay ten pound per acre then let have cabbage can eat besides be capital land be truth come will that be bargain woodruffe smiled said owed duty to allan did not like to see so hard worked a to be unable to take due care of own corner of garden unable to enter fairly into competition for prize at horticultural show in summer becky now too ought to be spared from occasional help in garden above ground be now in such improving state that must be waste not to bestow due labor upon put in spade where must soil be loose well aired a need be manure penetrated thoroughly frost heat pulverized instead of binding crop be succeeding other so fast that year must be very profitable one where will harry live if come asked abby must get cottage added to new row easily done cottage so healthy a new one pay well good rent be offered for to save doctor bill loss of time from sickness when once system of house drainage be set going cost scarcely more in adding cottage to group to make right than to run up upon solid clay a used to be way here well have good mind to write to harry to day what do think of of fortified by opinion of child mr woodruffe wrote to harry meantime allan becky went to cut vegetable be for sale day moss delighted in running after catching pony in meadow below pony be not very easily caught for be full of spirit instead of woolly insipid grass that used to crop seemed to give only fever nourishment now fed on sweet fresh grass have sour stagnant water soaking root pony be so full of play morning that moss must not get hold of though much stronger than year ago be not yet anything like so robust a boy of age must be be growing heated perhaps little angry a pony galloped off towards distant tree when boy started up behind bush caught halter brought pony round with twitch led to moss moss fancied have seen boy before then white teeth reminded moss of one thing after came for marsh plant said boy got plenty once somewhere hereabouts can not find now will not find now have marsh now stranger said dared not go back without mother wanted badly must not believe if said must not find there be plenty about two mile off along railway among clay pit be told none nearer boy wanted to know where clay pit hereabouts be must not find one of will show one of said moss one where used to hunt rat leading pony showed old gypsy play fellow improvement beginning with great ditch now invisible from being covered in while be open said used to get choked side be plastered after rain soon became grass grown so that be found worth while to cover in now must want little looking to for year to come a for clay pit where rat used to pop in out be now manure pit covered in there be drain into from pony stable from pig stye be near enough to garden to receive refuse sweeping heavy lid with ring in middle covered pit so that nobody must fall in in dark smell must get out moss begged boy to come little further must show own flower bed when boy be there be shown everything else what cart load of vegetable lay cut for sale what arbor have be made of pent house under moss used to take shelter when must hing better than keep off bird how fine duck be five duck be so serviceable in eating off slug what comfortable nest have be made for to lay egg in beside water tank in corner what variety of scarecrow family have invented having one to try must frighten sparrow most while moss be telling how difficult be to deal with sparrow because must not be frightened for more than three day by kind of scarecrow heard allan calling in tone of vexation at being kept waiting so long in instant stranger boy be off leaping gate flying along meadow till be hidden behind hedge two three day after one of duck be missing last time that five have be seen together be when moss be showing to visitor morning after moss finally gave up hope glass of allans hotbed be found broken in midst of bed be deep foot track crushing cucumber plant with allans hope of cucumber prize at horticultural exhibition in summer on more examination more mischief be discovered cabbage have be stolen duck be missing in midst of general concern woodruffe burst out laughing struck that chief of scarecrow have changed hat so have old straw hat used to flap in wind so serviceably be gone in stead appeared helmet saucepan full of hole battered split still fit to be helmet to scarecrow must swear to old hat observed woodruffe if must have luck to see on anybodys head so must said becky for mended bound with black behind green before because have not green ribbon enough nobody must wear before eye be why suspect there be stranger hovering about must watch now moss for first time bethought of boy have brought in from meadow now for first time told family of encounter never saw such simpleton father declared there go along work now dont cry hold up like man work moss did cry must not help worked too must fain have be one of watcher moreover father said be too young for two night be ordered to bed when allan took dark lantern went down to pent house first night accompanied by father next by harry hardiman who have come on first summons by third evening moss be so miserable that sister interceded for be allowed to go down with old friend harry be starlight night without moon low country lay dim unobscured by mist after single remark on fineness of night harry be silent silence be first business stole round fence a if have be thief listened for time before let in at gate passed quickly in locked gate lock of have be well oiled went behind screen along path to be sure that one be there finally perceiving that remaining duck be safe settled in darkness of pent house there sat hour after hour listening if there have be no sound perhaps must not have borne effort sense be relieved by bark of dog at distance then by hoot of owl be known to have done good service in mousing many time once by passage of train on railway above when be over poor moss have much ado to keep awake at last head sank on harrys shoulder forgot where be everything else in world be awakened by harrys moving then whispering quite into ear sit still hear somebody yonder sit still wont go far not out of call must get between gate with lantern under coat harry stole forth moss stood up alone in darkness stillness must hear heart beat nothing else till footstep on path came nearer nearer came quite up came in actually into arbor then duck be certainly fluttering in instant more there be gleam of light upon white plumage of duck then light enough to show that be gypsy boy with dark lantern hung round neck at same moment to show gypsy boy that moss be there two boy stood face to face motionless from utter amazement duck have scuttled waddled away before recovered then moss flew at in glorious passion at once of rage fear leave to moss cried harry casting light upon scene from lantern while collared thief with other hand let go say moss there now well go round be sure whether there be one else in garden then well lodge young rogue where will be safe nobody be there went home in dawn locked up thief in shed slept through what remained of night be about mr nelson usual time for coming down line be observed that now always stopped at station till next train passed probably because be pleasure to to look upon improvement of place be surprise therefore to woodruffe to see standing on embankment after breakfast be natural that mr nelson must be immediately told that gypsy be here again how one of be caught thieving thieving so found of property upon did why thought that be pity moss did not let alone till have laid hold of duck something pho pho dont tell can punish boy for theft when cant prove that stole anything give whipping let go with heart will save much trouble to finish off matter so mr nelson seemed to have curiosity about business for accompanied woodruffe to shed boy seemed to feel awe of great man whom supposed to be magistrate when asked whether felt none giggled said have seen gentleman more afraid of mother than anybody ever be of fancied on thought struck mr nelson must now have advantage of gypsy woman might enjoy at same time opportunity of studying human nature under stress thing liked when stress be not too severe so passed decree on spot that being now nine oclock boy must remain shut up without food till noon when must be severely flogged driven from neighborhood with pleasant prospect before young rogue remained whistling ostentatiously while enemy locked door upon did hear shoot bolt asked woodruffe if hold to dont know how will get at at noon there now what fool people be why did not take out bolt pretty constable must make come come way be going to find gypsy tent again be wondering that be not afraid of woman see observe have hold over time what do mean by allowing child to gather about door ought not to permit be only scholar dont see going in daughter keep little school know since husband death ah poor thing poor thing said mr nelson a abby appeared on threshold calling child in mr nelson always contrived to see one more of family when visited station so happened that have never entered door of dwelling perhaps be not fully conscious of reason be that must not bear to see abbys young face within widow cap to be thus reminded that hers be case of cruel wrong that if most ordinary thought care have be used in preparing place for human habitation husband might be living now happy creature that must never be again on way to gypsy mr nelson saw thing pleased in heart though found fault with what business have woodruffe with additional man in garden must not possibly answer if did not fellow must be sent away again must not burden parish occupier here seemed alike fancy for new labor one two six men at work on land within sight at moment over above what there used to be must be looked to humph must get to alder dryshod now be owing solely to warmth of spring be nonsense to attribute everything to drainage drainage be good thing fine weather be better gypsy tent be found behind alder a before longer in swamp woman be sitting on ground at entrance a before not now with fevered child laid across knee be weaving basket oh see said woodruffe be way osier go have not many to lose now day said woman be welcome to rush can find said woodruffe where be son change of countenance be seen in woman answered carelessly that child be playing yonder one mean be not there said woodruffe have safe caught stealing duck called boy villain disowned so forth when found case hopeless one did not therefore probably must not scold be anybody husband cursed for coming into silly place where now good be to be got when be brought to right point of perplexity about what to do seeing that must not do to stay being unable to go while boy be in durance be told that punishment must be summary though severe if must answer frankly certain question when have once begun giving confidence seemed to enjoy license when husband came up looked a if only waited for departure of visitor to give wife same amount of thrashing that son be awaiting elsewhere vowed that must never pitch tent here again used to be best station in whole round fog be so thick from sunset to long after sunrise have be a good a winter night for going where pleased without fear of prying eye there be not poultry yard pig stye within couple of mile round where must not creep up through fog escaped blame too for swamp ditch used to harbor so much vermin that gypsy be not always suspected a be now till lately people shut into home men went to public house in chill evening there be little fear of meeting one now that fog be gone people be out in garden on fine evening there be men in meadow returning from fishing for must angle now when work be done without fear of catching ague in marsh a went home mr nelson used vigorously last opportunity of lecturing people have own way for humility of gypsy be edifying woodruffe fancied saw finger talk passing while though gypsy never looked at other raised eye from ground woodruffe have to remind director that whistle of next train must soon be heard brought lecture to abrupt conclusion on finishing off with expect therefore that will remember advice never show face here again that will take to proper course of life in future bring up son to honest industry woman with countenance of grief seized one hand covered with kiss husband took other hand pressed to breast must make haste observed mr nelson a led way quickly back think have made impression upon see now right way to treat people dont think will see here again dont think will a reached step whistle be heard mr nelson must only wave hand to woodruffe rush up embankment throw panting into carriage only just in time by evening train re appeared when thirty mile off have wanted purse be gone have doubt paid for gypsy final gratitude of course sufficient force be immediately sent to alder clump there be nothing there charred stick clean pork bone time instead of feather of fowl cabbage leaf two boy have have whipping at noon after conference with little brother at keyhole have caused to withdraw bolt offer resistance considering cry groan have run off with surprising agility be now doubt far away viii gypsy came more fog came more fever came more at least in such form a to threaten general safety where still lingered be about only who deserved

fourth of if employ model wash house weekly cost of washing to poor man average certainly not le than fourpence halfpenny small tradesman driven to economize in linen spend perhaps not more than ninepence in middle upper class cost weekly varies from shilling to five shilling for person amount very often to larger sum on ground mr bullar honorary secretary to association for promoting bath wash house estimate washing expenditure of london at shilling week for inhabitant for whole five million of pound yearly professor clark dear professor tom have consumed four of twelve minute professor clark judge from such estimate a can be furnished by trade that consumption of soap in london be fifteen pound to person per annum twice a much a be employed in other part of england that

there be diminution in want of soap for grain of carbonate of lime dissolved in gallon of water mr donaldson declares two ounce of soap more for hundred gallon of water be required such grain be called degree of hardness water of five degree of hardness requires for example two ounce of soap water of eight degree of hardness then will need fifteen water of sixteen degree will demand thirty two sixteen degree maria be hardness of thames water of water mother have poached upon tea caddy see then that when pay for soap use at rate of six eightpence since unusual hardness of water cause to use double quantity man in london pay at average rate of three fourpence year tax for hard water through cost of soap alone now must finish in five minute brother tom soap be not only matter concern washerwoman customer there be labor also wear tear there be double amount of destruction to linen involved in double time of rubbing double soaping hard water compels washerwoman to employ so that
