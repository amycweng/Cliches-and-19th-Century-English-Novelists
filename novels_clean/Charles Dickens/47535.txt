die away a passed onward burden of reply be still same 'gabriel grub gabriel grub ' goblin grinned broader grin than before a said 'well gabriel what do say to ' sexton gasped for breath 'what do

of sugar loaf hat on narrow edge of tombstone whence threw somerset with extraordinary agility right to sexton foot at planted in attitude in tailor generally sit upon shop board be afraid must leave sir ' said sexton making effort to move 'leave ' said goblin grub going to leave ho ho ho a goblin laughed sexton observed for one instant brilliant illumination within window of church a if whole building be lighted up disappeared organ pealed forth lively air whole troop of goblin very counterpart of first one poured into churchyard began playing at leap frog with tombstone never stopping for instant to take breath 'overing ' highest among one after other with utmost marvellous dexterity first goblin be most astonishing leaper none of others must come near even in extremity of terror sexton must not help observing that while friend be content to leap over common sized gravestone first one took family vault iron railing with a much ease a if have be so many street post at last game reached to most exciting pitch organ played quicker quicker goblin leaped faster faster coiling up rolling head over heel upon ground bounding over tombstone like football sexton brain whirled round with rapidity of motion beheld leg reeled beneath a spirit flew before eye when goblin king suddenly darting towards laid hand upon collar sank with through earth when gabriel grub have have time to fetch breath rapidity of descent have for moment taken away found in what appeared to be huge cavern surrounded on side by crowd of goblin ugly grim in centre of room on elevated seat be stationed friend of churchyard close beside stood gabriel grub without power of motion 'cold to night ' said king of goblin havery cold glass of something warm here ' at command dozen officious goblin with perpetual smile upon face whom gabriel grub imagined to be courtier on account hastily disappeared presently returned with goblet of liquid fire presented to king 'ah cried goblin whose cheek throat be transparent a tossed down flame warms one indeed bring bumper of same for mr grub ' be in vain for unfortunate sexton to protest that be not in habit of taking anything warm at night one of goblin held while poured blazing liquid down throat whole assembly screeched with laughter a coughed choked wiped away tear gushed plentifully from eye after swallowing burning draught 'and now said king fantastically poking taper corner of sugar loaf hat into sexton eye thereby occasioning most exquisite pain now show man of misery gloom few of picture from own great storehouse a goblin said thick

little bed seized tiny hand so cold heavy shrunk back from touch looked with awe on infant face for calm tranquil a be sleeping in rest peace a beautiful child seemed to be saw that be dead knew that be angel looking down upon blessing from bright happy heaven again light cloud passed across picture again subject changed father mother be old helpless now number of about be diminished more than half content cheerfulness sat on face beamed in eye a crowded round fireside told listened to old story of earlier bygone day slowly peacefully father sank into grave soon after sharer of care trouble followed to place of rest few who yet survived knelt by tomb watered green turf covered with tear then rose turned away sadly mournfully not with bitter cry despairing lamentation for knew that must one day meet again once more mixed with busy world content cheerfulness be restored cloud settled upon picture concealed from sexton view 'what do think of ' said goblin turning large face towards gabriel grub gabriel murmured out something about being very pretty looked somewhat ashamed a goblin bent fiery eye upon 'you miserable man ' said goblin in tone of excessive contempt appeared disposed to add more indignation choked utterance so lifted up one of very pliable leg flourishing above head little to insure aim administered good sound kick to gabriel grub immediately after goblin in waiting crowded round wretched sexton kicked without mercy according to established invariable custom of courtier upon earth who kick whom royalty kick hug whom royalty hug more ' said king of goblin at word cloud be dispelled rich beautiful landscape be disclosed to view there be just such to day within mile of old abbey town sun shone from out clear blue sky water sparkled beneath ray

insect spread transparent wing revelled in brief happy existence man walked forth elated with scene be brightness splendour 'you miserable man ' said king of goblin in more contemptuous tone than before again king of goblin gave leg flourish again descended on shoulder of sexton again attendant goblin imitated example of chief many time cloud went came many lesson taught to gabriel grub who although shoulder smarted with pain from frequent application of goblin foot looked on with interest that nothing must diminish saw that men who worked hard earned scanty bread with life of labour be cheerful happy to most ignorant sweet face of nature be never failing source of cheerfulness joy saw who have be delicately nurtured tenderly brought up cheerful under privation superior to suffering must have crushed many of rougher grain because bore within own bosom material of happiness contentment peace saw that woman tenderest most fragile of god creature be oftenest superior to sorrow

face of earth setting good of world against evil came to conclusion that be very decent respectable sort of world after sooner have formed than cloud closed over last picture seemed to settle on sens lull to repose one by one goblin faded from sight a last one disappeared sunk to sleep day have broken when gabriel grub awoke found lying at full length on flat grave stone in churchyard with wicker bottle lying empty by side coat spade lantern well whitened by last night frost scattered on ground stone on have first seen goblin seated stood bolt upright before grave at have worked night before
