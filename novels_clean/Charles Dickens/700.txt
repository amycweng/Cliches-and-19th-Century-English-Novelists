that mr wackles eldest daughter have at time greatly favoured pretension of mr swiveller being accustomed to make slight mention of a gay young man to sigh shake head ominously whenever name be mentioned mr swivellers conduct in respect to miss sophy having be of vague dilatory kind be usually looked upon a betokening fixed matrimonial intention young lady began in course of time to deem

to show family what quality of man trifled with influenced perhaps by late libation performed such feat of agility such spin twirl a filled company with astonishment in particular caused very long gentleman who be dancing with very short scholar to stand quite transfixed by wonder admiration even mr wackles forgot for moment to snub three small young lady who be inclined to be happy must not repress rising thought that to have dancer a in family must be pride indeed at momentous crisis miss cheggs proved vigourous useful ally for not confining to expressing by scornful smile contempt for

best about sophy though be concerted plot between miss sophy sister originating in humane intention having for object inducing mr swiviller to declare in time failed in effect for miss jane being one of young lady who be prematurely shrill shrewish gave such undue importance to part that mr swiviller retired in dudgeon resigning mistress to mr cheggs conveying defiance into look gentleman indignantly returned did speak to sir said mr cheggs following into corner have kindness to smile sir in order that may not be suspected did speak to sir mr swiviller looked with supercilious smile at

piece of sirloin of beef weighing about six pound avoir dupoise in two minute quarter a have witnessed proved by sense of taste further however effect be produced have distinctly seen water boil bubble up when single gentleman winked from fact mr swiveller be led to infer that lodger be great conjuror chemist whose residence under roof must not fail at future day to shed great credit

coming close upon heel of temperate beverage have discussed at dinner awakened slight degree of fever rendered necessary two three other modest quenchers at public house in course of evening chapter a single gentleman after week occupation of lodging still declined to correspond by word gesture with mr brass sister sally invariably chose richard swiveller a channel of communication a proved in

must have lost favourite allusion to crooked way by be approached enabled to liken to paradise in contradistinction to parish church broad thoroughfare leading thereunto kit found at last after trouble pausing at door to take breath that might enter with becoming decency passed into chapel be not badly named in one respect being in truth particularly little bethel bethel of smallest dimension with small number of small pew small pulpit in small gentleman by trade shoemaker by calling divine be delivering in by mean small voice by mean small sermon judging of dimension by condition of audience if gross amount be small comprised still smaller number of hearer a majority be slumbering among be kit mother who finding matter of extreme difficulty to keep eye open after fatigue of last night feeling inclination to close strongly backed seconded by argument of preacher have yielded to drowsiness overpowered fallen asleep though not so soundly that must from time to time utter slight almost inaudible groan a if in recognition of orator doctrine baby in arm be a fast asleep a little jacob whose youth prevented from recognising in prolonged spiritual nourishment anything half a interesting a oyster be alternately very fast asleep very wide awake a inclination to slumber terror of being personally alluded to in discourse gained mastery over now im here thought kit gliding into nearest empty pew be opposite mother on other side of little aisle how be ever to get at persuade to come out might a well be twenty mile off shell never wake till over there go clock again if must leave off for minute if theyd only sing there be little encouragement to believe that event must happen for couple of hour to come preacher went on telling what meant to convince of

in front of clerk desk must scarcely believe when showed quilp rubbed twice thrice still insisted that quilp be there there indeed be sitting with hand upon knee hat between on little wooden bracket with accustomed grin on dirty face eye fixed upon ceiling certainly did not glance at kit at mother appeared utterly unconscious of presence still kit must not help feeling directly that attention of sly little fiend be fastened upon upon nothing else astounded a be by apparition of dwarf among little bethelites not free from misgiving that be forerunner of trouble annoyance be compelled to subdue wonder to take active measure for withdrawal of parent a evening be now creeping on matter grew serious therefore next time little jacob woke kit set to attract wandering attention not being very difficult task one sneeze effected signed to to rouse mother ill luck must have however just then preacher in forcible exposition of one head of discourse leaned over upon pulpit desk so very little more of than leg remained inside while made vehement gesture with right hand held on with left stared seemed to stare straight into little jacob eye threatening by strained look attitude so appeared to child that if so much a moved muscle preacher must be literally not figuratively down upon instant in fearful state of thing distracted by sudden appearance of kit fascinated by eye of preacher miserable jacob sat bolt upright wholly incapable of motion strongly disposed to cry afraid to do so returning pastor gaze until infant eye seemed starting from socket if must do openly must thought kit with walked softly out of pew into mother a mr swiveller must have observed if have be present collared baby without speaking word hush mother whispered kit come along with ive got something to

mother little jacob found in open air with indistinct recollection of having seen people wake up look surprised of quilp having remained throughout interruption in old attitude without moving eye from ceiling appearing to take smallest notice of anything passed oh kit said mother with handkerchief to eye what have done never can go there again never im glad of mother what be there in little bit of pleasure took last night made necessary for to be low spirited sorrowful tonight thats way do if youre happy merry ever come here to say along with chap that youre sorry for more shame for mother be going to say hush dear said mr nubble dont mean what say know youre talking sinfulness dont mean do mean retorted kit dont believe mother harmless cheerfulness good humour be thought greater sin in

yielded to prayer mr chuckster sir will have goodness to tap at window for constable thats waiting in coach three gentleman looked at other with blank face when word be uttered mr chuckster doing a be desired leaping off stool with something of excitement of inspired prophet whose foretelling have in fulness of time be realised held door open for entrance of wretched captive scene a there be when kit came in bursting into rude eloquence with truth at length inspired called heaven to witness that be innocent that how property came to be found upon knew not such confusion of tongue before circumstance be related proof disclosed dead silence when be told three friend exchanged look of doubt amazement be not possible said mr witherden after long pause that note may have found way into hat by accident such a removal of paper on desk for instance be clearly shown to be quite impossible mr swiveller though unwilling witness must not help proving to demonstration from position in be found that must have be designedly secreted very distressing said brass immensely distressing be sure when come to be tried will be very happy to recommend to mercy on account of previous good character did lose money before certainly doesnt quite follow that took presumption against strongly against be christian hope suppose said constable looking round that gentleman here can give evidence a to whether he be flush of money of late do happen to know sir have have money from time to time certainly returned mr garland to whom man have put question that a always told be given by mr brass yes to be sure said kit eagerly can bear out in sir eh cried brass looking from face to face with expression of stupid amazement money know half crown that gave from lodger said kit oh dear

perhaps gentleman if have not said in presence have reported youd have held to be impossible likewise eh with such pacific bantering remark did mr brass refute foul aspersion on character virtuous sarah moved by stronger feeling having at heart perhaps more jealous regard for honour of family flew from brother side without previous intimation of design darted at prisoner with utmost fury must undoubtedly have gone hard with kit face that wary constable foreseeing design drew aside at critical moment thus placed mr chuckster in circumstance of jeopardy for gentleman happening to be next object of miss brass wrath rage being like love fortune blind be pounced upon by fair enslaver have false collar plucked up by root hair very much dishevelled before exertion of company must make sensible of mistake constable taking warning by desperate attack thinking perhaps that must be more satisfactory to end of justice if prisoner be taken before magistrate whole rather than in small piece led back to hackney coach without more ado moreover insisted on miss brass becoming outside passenger to proposal charming creature after little angry discussion yielded consent so took brother sampsons place upon box mr brass with reluctance agreeing to occupy seat inside arrangement perfected drove to justice room with speed followed by notary two friend in coach mr chuckster alone be left behind greatly to indignation for held evidence must have given relative to kit returning to work out shilling to be so very material a bearing upon hypocritical designing character that considered suppression little better than compromise of felony at justice room found single gentleman who have gone straight there be expecting with desperate impatience not fifty single gentleman rolled into one must have helped poor kit who in hour afterwards be committed for trial be assured by friendly officer on way to prison that there be occasion to be cast down for session must soon be on must in likelihood get little affair disposed of be comfortably transported in le than fortnight chapter let moralist philosopher say what may be very questionable whether guilty man must have felt half a much misery night a kit did being innocent world being in constant commission of vast quantity of injustice be little too apt to comfort with idea that if victim of falsehood malice have clear conscience can not fail to be sustained under trial somehow other to come right at last in case say who have hunted down though certainly dont expect nobody will be better pleased than whereas world must do well to reflect injustice be in to generous properly constituted mind injury of others most insufferable most torturing most hard to bear that many clear conscience have gone to account elsewhere many sound heart have broken because of very reason knowledge of own desert only aggravating suffering rendering le endurable world however be not in fault in kit case kit be innocent knowing feeling that best friend deemed guilty that mr mr garland must look upon a monster of ingratitude that barbara must associate with be bad criminal that pony must consider forsaken that even own mother might perhaps yield to strong appearance against believe to be wretch seemed knowing feeling experienced at first agony of mind word can describe walked up down little cell in be locked up for night almost beside with grief even when violence of emotion have in degree subsided be beginning to grow more calm there came into mind new thought anguish of be scarcely le child bright star of

building for long time a if be in prison too unable to get out turnkey have given to understand that be lodged like few others in jail apart from mass of prisoner because be not supposed to be utterly depraved irreclaimable have never occupied apartment in mansion before kit be thankful for indulgence sat reading church catechism very attentively though have known by heart from little child until

through several winding way strong gate into passage where placed at grating turned upon heel beyond grating at distance of about four five foot be exactly like in space between sat turnkey reading newspaper outside further railing kit saw with palpitating heart mother with baby in arm barbaras mother with never failing umbrella poor little jacob staring in with might a though be looking for bird wild beast thought men be mere accident with whom bar must have possible concern when little jacob saw brother thrusting arm between rail to hug found that came nearer still stood afar off with head resting on arm by held to one of bar began to cry most piteously whereupon kit mother barbaras mother who have restrained a much a possible burst out sobbing weeping afresh poor kit must not help joining not one of must speak word during melancholy pause turnkey read newspaper with waggish look have evidently got among facetious paragraph until happening to take eye off for instant a if to get by dint of contemplation at very marrow of joke of deeper sort than rest appeared to occur to for first time that somebody be cry now lady lady said looking round with surprise id advise not to waste time like allowanced here know mustnt let that child make noise against rule im poor mother sir sobbed mr nubble curtseying humbly be brother sir oh dear dear well replied turnkey folding paper on knee so a to get with greater convenience at top of next column cant be helped know aint only one in same fix mustnt make noise about with that went on reading man be not unnaturally cruel hard hearted have come to look upon felony a kind of disorder like scarlet fever erysipelas people have hadnt just a might be oh darling kit said mother whom barbaras mother have charitably relieved of baby must see poor boy here dont believe that did what accuse of mother dear cried kit in choking voice believe exclaimed poor woman never knew tell lie do bad action from cradle have never have

comfort to from hour of birth until time never laid down one night in anger with believe of kit why then thank god said kit clutching bar with earnestness shook can bear come what may will always have one drop of happiness in heart when think that said that at poor woman fell cry again barbaras mother too little jacob whose disjointed thought have by time resolved into pretty distinct impression that kit couldnt go out for walk if wanted that there be bird lion tiger other natural curiosity behind bar nothing indeed caged brother added tear to theirs with a little noise a possible kit mother drying eye moistening poor soul more than dried now took from ground small basket submissively addressed to turnkey saying must please to listen to for minute turnkey being in very crisis passion of joke motioned to with hand to keep silent one minute longer for life did remove hand into former posture kept in same warning attitude until have finished paragraph when paused for few second with

anything sober being compelled to take further draught of same strong bowl found that instead of at contributing to recovery have novel effect of making counting house spin round round with extreme velocity causing floor ceiling to heave in very distressing manner after brief stupor awoke to consciousness of being partly under table partly under grate position not being most comfortable one must have chosen for managed to stagger to foot holding on by admiral looked round for host mr brass first impression be that host be gone have left there alone perhaps locked in for night strong smell of tobacco however suggested new train of idea looked upward saw that dwarf be smoking in hammock good bye sir cried brass faintly good bye sir wont stop night said dwarf peeping out do stop night

sprang once more into hammock chapter professional gentleman who have given kit consolatory piece of information relative to settlement of trifle of business at old bailey probability of being very soon disposed of turned out to be quite correct in prognostication in eight day time session commenced in one day afterwards grand jury found true bill against christopher nubble for felony in two day from finding aforesaid christopher nubble be called upon to plead guilty not guilty to indictment for said christopher did feloniously abstract steal from dwelling house office of one sampson brass gentleman one bank note for five pound issued by governor company of bank of england in contravention of statute in case made provided against peace of sovereign lord king crown dignity to indictment christopher nubble in low trembling voice pleaded not guilty here let who be in habit of forming hasty judgment from appearance who must have have christopher if innocent speak out very strong loud observe confinement anxiety will subdue stoutest heart to one who have be close shut up though be only for ten eleven day seeing stone wall very few stony face sudden entrance into great hall filled with life be rather disconcerting startling circumstance to must be added that life in wig be to large class of people much more terrifying impressive than life with own head of hair if in addition to consideration there be taken into account kit natural emotion on seeing two mr garland little notary looking on with pale anxious face will perhaps seem matter of very great wonder that must have be rather out of sort unable to make quite at home although have never seen either of mr garland mr witherden since time of arrest have be given to understand that have employed counsel for therefore when one of gentleman in wig got up said be for prisoner lord kit made bow when gentleman in wig got up said im against lord kit trembled very much bowed to too didnt hope in own heart that gentleman

learned friend here looked sideways at kit gentleman to impeach testimony of immaculate witness whom must call before did hope trust that learned friend must have greater respect veneration for character of prosecutor than whom a well knew there did not exist never have existed more honourable member of most honourable profession to be attached then said did jury know bevis mark if did know bevis mark a trusted for own character did did know historical elevating association connected with most remarkable spot did believe that man like brass must reside in place like bevis mark not be virtuous most upright character when have said great deal to on point remembered that be insult to understanding to make remark on what must have felt so strongly without therefore called sampson

managed by mr brass gentleman very obdurate to kit in short kit gentleman can get nothing out of repetition of what have said before only little stronger time a against client therefore let go in confusion then mr brass gentleman call richard swiveller richard swiveller appears accordingly now mr brass gentleman have whispered in ear that witness be disposed to be friendly to prisoner to say

portentous gravity nodding head once in slow ghost like manner vanished paid coachman turned back on bevis mark big with great design for comforting of kit mother aid of kit life of gentleman devoted to such pleasure a richard swiveller be extremely precarious spiritual excitement of last fortnight working upon system affected in slight degree by spirituous excitement of year proved little too much for very night mr richard be seized with alarming illness in twenty four hour be stricken with raging fever chapter tossing to fro upon hot uneasy bed tormented by fierce thirst nothing must appease unable to find in change of posture moment peace ease rambling ever through desert of thought where there be resting place sight sound suggestive of refreshment repose nothing dull eternal weariness with change restless shifting of miserable body weary wandering of mind constant still to one ever present anxiety to sense of something left undone of fearful obstacle to be surmounted of carking care must not be driven away haunted distempered brain now in form now in always shadowy dim recognisable for same phantom in shape took darkening vision like evil conscience making slumber horrible in slow torture of dread disease unfortunate richard lay wasting consuming inch by inch until at last when seemed to fight struggle to rise up to be held down by devil sank into deep sleep dreamed more awoke with sensation of most blissful rest better than sleep began gradually to remember something of suffering to think what long night have be whether have not be delirious twice thrice happening in midst of cogitation to raise hand be astonished to find how heavy seemed yet how thin light really be still felt indifferent happy having curiosity to pursue subject remained in same waking slumber until attention be attracted by cough made doubt whether have locked door last night feel little surprised at having companion in room still lacked energy to follow up train of thought unconsciously fell in luxury of repose to staring at green stripe on bed furniture associating strangely with patch of fresh turf while yellow ground between made gravel walk so helped out long perspective of trim garden be rambling in imagination on terrace have quite lost among indeed when heard cough once more walk shrunk into stripe again at sound raising little in bed holding curtain open with one hand looked out same room certainly still by candlelight with what unbounded astonishment did see bottle basin article of linen airing by fire such like furniture of sick chamber very clean neat quite different from anything have left there when went to bed atmosphere too filled with cool smell of herb vinegar floor newly sprinkled what marchioness yes playing cribbage with herself at table there sat intent upon game coughing now then in subdued manner a if feared to disturb shuffling card cutting dealing playing counting pegging going through mystery of cribbage a if have be in full practice from cradle mr swiveller contemplated thing for short time suffering curtain to fall into former position laid head on pillow again im dreaming thought richard thats clear when went to

grand cairo marchioness be genie having have wager with genie about who be handsomest young man alive worthiest to be husband of princess of china have brought away room to compare together perhaps said mr swiveller turning languidly round on pillow looking on side of bed be next wall princess may be still shes gone not feeling quite satisfied with explanation a even taking to be correct one still involved little mystery doubt mr swiveller raised curtain again determined to take first favourable opportunity of addressing companion occasion presented marchioness dealt turned up knave omitted to take usual advantage upon mr swiveller called out a loud a must two for heel marchioness jumped up quickly clapped hand arabian night certainly thought mr swiveller always clap hand instead of ringing bell now for two thousand black slave with jar of jewel on head appeared however that have only clapped hand for joy for directly afterward began to laugh then to cry declaring not in choice arabic in familiar english that be so glad didnt know what to do marchioness said mr swiveller thoughtfully be pleased to draw nearer first of will have goodness to inform where will find voice

marchioness having arranged bed clothes more comfortably felt that hand forehead be quite cool discovery filled with delight cried little more then applied to getting tea ready making thin dry toast while be thus engaged mr swiveller looked on with grateful heart very much astonished to see how thoroughly at home made attributing attention in origin to sally brass whom in own mind must not thank enough when marchioness have finished toasting spread clean cloth on tray brought crisp slice great basin of weak tea with said doctor have left word might refresh when awoke propped up with pillow if not a skilfully a if have be professional nurse life at least a tenderly looked on with unutterable satisfaction while patient stopping now then to shake by hand took poor meal with appetite relish

truth before very long mr swiveller have despatched a much toast tea a in stage of recovery be discreet to let have care of marchioness did not stop here for disappearing for instant presently returning with basin of fair water laved face hand brushed hair in short made a spruce smart a anybody under such circumstance must be made in a brisk business like manner a if be very little boy grown up nurse to various attention mr swiveller submitted in kind of grateful astonishment beyond reach of language when be at last brought to end marchioness have withdrawn into distant corner to take own poor breakfast cold enough by time turned face away for few moment shook hand heartily with air gentleman said dick rousing from pause turning round again youll excuse men who have be brought so low a have be be easily fatigued be fresh again now fit for talking be short of chair here among other trifle if youll do favour to sit upon bed what can do for said mr garland kindly if must make marchioness yonder marchioness in real sober earnest returned dick id thank to get done off hand a cant a question be not what will do for what will do for somebody else who have better claim upon pray sir let know what intend doing chiefly on account that have come just now said single gentleman for will have visitor presently feared must be anxious unless knew from what step intended to take therefore came to before stirred in matter gentleman returned dick thank anybody in helpless state that see in be naturally anxious dont let interrupt sir then see good fellow said single gentleman while have doubt of truth of disclosure have so providentially come to light meaning hers said dick pointing towards marchioness meaning hers of course while have doubt of that proper use of must

certainty by best opinion have be enabled in short space of time to take upon subject youll agree with to give even most distant chance of escape if must help must be monstrous say with doubt if somebody must escape let be one yes returned dick certainly be if somebody must upon word im unwilling that anybody must since law be made for degree to curb vice in others a well a in so forth know doesnt strike in light single gentleman smiled a if light in mr swiveller have put question be not clearest in world proceeded to explain that contemplated proceeding by stratagem in first instance that design be to endeavour to extort confession from gentle sarah when find how much know how know said that be clearly compromised already be not without strong hope that may be enabled through mean to punish other two effectually if must do might go scot free for aught cared dick received project in anything gracious manner representing with a much warmth a be then capable of showing that must find old buck meaning sarah more difficult to manage than quilp that for tampering terrifying cajolery be very unpromising unyielding subject that be of kind of brass not easily melted moulded into shape in short that be match for must be signally defeated be in vain to urge to adopt other course single gentleman have be described a explaining joint intention must have be written that spoke together that if one of by chance held peace for moment stood gasping panting for opportunity to strike in again in word that have reached that pitch of impatience anxiety where men can neither be persuaded reasoned with that must have be a easy to turn most impetuous wind that ever blew a to prevail on to reconsider determination so after telling mr swiveller how have not lost sight of kit mother child how have never once even lost sight of kit have be unremitting in endeavour to procure mitigation of sentence how have be perfectly distracted between strong proof of guilt own fading hope of innocence how richard swiveller might keep mind at rest for everything must be happily adjusted between time night after telling adding great many kind cordial expression personal to be unnecessary to recite mr garland notary single gentleman took leaf at very critical time richard swiveller must assuredly have be driven into fever whereof result might have be fatal mr abel remained behind very often looking at watch at room door until mr swiveller be roused from short nap by setting down on landing place outside a from shoulder of porter of giant load seemed to shake house made little physic bottle on mantel shelf ring again directly sound reached ear mr abel started up hobbled to door opened behold there stood strong man with mighty hamper being hauled into room presently

possible that such thing must be except in shop stood rooted to spot in one shoe with mouth eye watering in unison power of speech quite gone not so mr abel strong man who emptied hamper big a be in twinkling not so nice old lady who appeared so suddenly that might have come out of hamper too be quite large enough who bustling about on tiptoe without noise now here now there now everywhere at once began to fill out jelly in tea cup to make chicken broth in small saucepan to peel orange for sick man to cut up in little piece to ply small servant with glass of wine choice bit of everything until more substantial meat must be prepared for refreshment whole of appearance be so unexpected bewildering that mr swiveller when have taken two orange little jelly have seen strong man walk off with empty basket plainly leaving abundance for use benefit be fain to lie down fall asleep again from sheer inability to entertain such wonder in mind meanwhile single gentleman notary mr garland repaired to certain coffee house from place indited sent letter to miss sally brass requesting in term mysterious brief to favour unknown friend who wished to consult with company there a speedily a possible communication performed errand so well that within ten minute of messenger return report of delivery miss brass be announced pray maam said single gentleman whom found alone in room take

side looked at questioner with curious kind of spasm about mouth with cunning aspect of immense expression two key repeated notary one of gave opportunity of roaming through house at night when supposed fast locked up of overhearing confidential consultation among others that particular conference to be described to day before justice will have opportunity of hearing relate that conference mr brass held together on night before most unfortunate innocent young man be accused of robbery by horrible device of will only say that may be characterised by epithet have applied to wretched little witness by few stronger one besides sally took pinch although face be wonderfully composed be apparent that be wholly taken by surprise that what have expected to be taxed with in connection with small servant be something very different from come come miss brass said notary have great command of feature feel see that by chance never entered imagination base design be revealed two of plotter must be brought to justice now know pain penalty be liable to so need not dilate upon have proposal to make to have honour of being sister to one of greatest scoundrel unhung if may venture to

sufficient evidence a hear already will not say to that suggest course in mercy for to tell truth entertain regard for be necessity to be reduced recommend to a matter of very best policy time said mr witherden pulling out watch in business like be exceedingly precious favour with decision a speedily a possible maam with smile upon face looking at of three by turn miss brass took two three more pinch of snuff having by time very little left travelled round round box with forefinger thumb scraping up having disposed of likewise put box carefully in pocket said be to accept reject at once be yes said mr witherden charming creature be opening lip to speak in reply when door be hastily opened too head of sampson brass be thrust into room excuse said gentleman hastily wait bit so saying quite indifferent to astonishment presence occasioned crept in shut door kissed greasy glove a servilely a if be dust made most abject bow sarah said brass hold tongue if please let speak gentleman if must express pleasure give to see three such men in happy unity of feeling concord of sentiment think must hardly believe though be unfortunate nay gentleman criminal if be to use harsh expression in company like still have feeling like other men have heard of poet who remarked that feeling be common lot of if must have be pig gentleman have uttered that sentiment must still have be immortal if youre not idiot said miss brass harshly hold peace sarah dear returned brother thank know what be about love will take liberty of expressing accordingly mr witherden sir handkerchief be hanging out of pocket must allow to a mr brass advanced to remedy accident notary shrunk from with air of disgust brass who over above usual prepossessing quality have scratched face green shade over one eye hat grievously crushed stopped short looked round with pitiful smile shuns said sampson even when must a may say heap coal of fire upon head well ah be falling house rat if may be allowed expression in reference to gentleman respect love beyond everything fly from gentleman regarding conversation just now happened to see sister on way here wondering where must be going to being may venture to say naturally of suspicious turn followed since then have be listening if youre not mad interposed miss sally stop there say more sarah dear rejoined brass with undiminished politeness thank kindly will still proceed mr witherden sir a have honour to be member of same profession to say nothing of other gentleman having be lodger having partaken a one may say of hospitality of roof think might have given refusal of offer in first instance do indeed now dear sir cried brass seeing that notary be about to interrupt suffer to speak beg mr witherden be silent brass went on if will do favour said holding up green shade revealing eye most horribly discoloured to look at will naturally inquire in own mind how did get if look from to face will wonder what must have be cause of scratch if from to hat how came into state in see gentleman said brass striking hat fiercely with clenched hand to question answer three gentleman looked at other said nothing say pursued brass glancing aside at sister a though be talking for information speaking with snarling malignity in violent contrast to usual smoothness answer to all question quilp quilp who deludes into infernal den take delight in looking on chuckling while scorch burn bruise maim quilp who never once never once in communication together have treated otherwise than a dog quilp whom have always hated with whole heart never so much a lately give cold shoulder on very matter a if have have nothing to do with instead of being first to propose cant trust in one of howling raving blazing humour believe hed let out if be murder never think of so long a must terrify now said brass picking up hat again replacing shade over eye actually crouching down in excess of servility what doe lead to what must say led to gentleman must guess at near mark nobody spoke brass stood smirking for little while a if have propounded choice conundrum then said to be short with then lead to if truth have come out a plainly have in manner there standing up against very sublime grand thing be truth gentleman in way though like other sublime grand thing such a thunder storm be not always over above glad to see have better turn upon man than let man turn upon clear to that be done for therefore if anybody be to split have better be person have advantage of sarah dear comparatively speaking youre safe relate circumstance for own profit with mr brass in great hurry revealed whole story bearing a heavily a possible on amiable employer making out to be rather saint like holy character though subject acknowledged to human weakness concluded thus now gentleman be not man who doe thing by half being in for penny be ready a saying be to be in for pound must do with what please take where please if wish to have in writing well reduce into manuscript immediately will be tender with be sure be quite confident will be tender with be men of honour have feeling heart yielded from necessity to quilp for though necessity have law have lawyer yield to from necessity too from policy besides because of feeling have be pretty long time working within punish quilp gentleman weigh heavily upon grind down tread under foot have done a much by for many many day having now arrived at conclusion of discourse sampson checked current of wrath kissed glove again smiled a only parasite coward can said miss brass raising head with have hitherto sat resting on hand surveying from head to foot with bitter sneer be brother be be brother have worked toiled for believed to have have something of man in sarah dear returned sampson rubbing hand feebly disturb friend besides youre disappointed sarah not knowing what say expose yes pitiful dastard retorted lovely damsel understand feared must be beforehand with do think must have be enticed to say word id have scorned if have tried tempted for twenty year simpered brass who in deep debasement really seemed to have changed sex with sister to have made over to spark of manliness might have possessed think so sarah think so perhaps must have acted quite different good fellow will not have forgotten that be maxim with foxey revered father gentleman always suspect everybody thats maxim to go through life with if be not actually about to purchase own safety when showed suspect youd have done by time therefore ive done spared trouble a well a shame shame gentleman added brass allowing to be slightly overcome if there be be mine better that female must be spared with deference to better opinion of mr brass more particularly to authority of great ancestor may be doubted with humility whether elevating principle laid down by latter gentleman acted upon by descendant be always prudent one attended in practice with desired result be beyond question bold presumptuous doubt inasmuch a many distinguished character called men of world long headed customer knowing dog shrewd fellow capital hand at business like have made do daily make axiom polar star compass still doubt may be gently insinuated in illustration may be observed that if mr brass not being over suspicious have without prying listening left sister to manage conference on joint behalf prying listening have not be in such mighty hurry to anticipate must not have be for distrust jealousy must probably have found much better off in end thus will always happen that men of world who go through in armour defend from quite a much good a evil to say nothing of inconvenience absurdity of mounting guard with microscope at time of wearing coat of mail on most innocent occasion three gentleman spoke together apart for few moment at end of consultation be very brief notary pointed to writing material on table informed mr brass that if wished to make statement in writing have opportunity of doing so at same time felt bound to tell that must require attendance presently before justice of peace in what did said be guided entirely by own discretion gentleman said brass drawing off glove crawling in spirit upon ground before will justify tenderness with know will be treated a without tenderness must now that discovery have be made stand in worst position of three may depend upon will make clean breast mr witherden sir kind of faintness be upon spirit if must do favour to ring bell order up glass of something warm spicy will notwithstanding what have passed have melancholy pleasure in drinking good health have hoped said brass looking round with mournful smile to have seen three gentleman one day with leg under mahogany in humble parlour in mark hope be fleeting dear mr brass found so exceedingly affected at point that must say hing more until refreshment arrived having partaken of pretty freely for one in agitated state sat down to write lovely sarah now with arm folded now with hand clasped behind paced room with manly stride while brother be thus employed sometimes stopped to pull out snuff box bite lid continued to pace up down until be quite tired then fell asleep on chair near door have be since supposed with reason that slumber be sham feint a contrived to slip away unobserved in dusk of afternoon whether be intentional waking departure somnambulistic leave taking walking in sleep may remain subject of contention on one point indeed main one party be agreed in state walked away certainly did not walk back again mention having be made of dusk of afternoon will be inferred that mr brass task occupied time in completion be not finished until evening being done at last that worthy person three friend adjourned in hackney coach to private office of justice who giving mr brass warm reception detaining in secure place that might insure to pleasure of seeing on morrow dismissed others with cheering assurance that warrant must not fail to be granted next day for apprehension of mr quilp that proper application statement of circumstance to secretary of state who be fortunately in town must doubt procure kit free pardon liberation without delay now indeed seemed that quilps malignant career be drawing to close retribution often travel slowly especially when heaviest have tracked footstep with sure certain scent be gaining on fast unmindful of stealthy tread victim hold course in fancied triumph still at heel come once afoot be never turned aside business ended three gentleman hastened back to lodging of mr swiveller whom found progressing so favourably in recovery a

two outstanding account in reference to have already received diver threatening letter countenance fell a replied certainly sir hope not anything of very disagreeable nature though if thought so must choose better time for communicating replied notary let tell first that friend who have be here to day know nothing of that kindness to have be quite spontaneous with hope of return may do thoughtless careless man good to know dick thanked said hoped must have be making inquiry about said witherden little thinking must find under such circumstance a have brought together be nephew of rebecca swiveller spinster deceased of cheselbourne in dorsetshire deceased cried dick deceased if have be sort of nephew must have come into possession so say will see reason to doubt of five twenty thousand
