up again because reply depends so materially louisa on sense in use expression now mr bounderby doe not do injustice doe not do injustice of pretending to anything fanciful fantastic be using synonymous term sentimental mr bounderby must have seen grow up under eye to very little purpose if must so far forget what be due to good sense not to say to a to address from such ground therefore perhaps expression itselfi merely suggest to dearmay be little misplaced what must advise to use in stead father why dear louisa said mr gradgrind completely recovered by time must advise since ask to consider question a have be accustomed to consider other question simply a one of tangible fact ignorant giddy may embarrass such subject with irrelevant fancy other absurdity have existence properly viewedreally existencebut be compliment to to say that know better now what be fact of case be will say in round number twenty year of age mr bounderby be will say in round number fifty there be disparity in respective year in mean position there be none on contrary there be great suitability then question arises be one disparity sufficient to operate a bar to marriage in considering question be not unimportant to take into account statistic of marriage so far a have yet be obtained in england wale find on reference to figure that large proportion of marriage be contracted between party of very unequal age that elder of contracting party be in rather more than three fourth of instance bridegroom be remarkable a showing wide prevalence of law among native of british possession in india also in considerable part of china among calmucks of tartary best mean of computation yet furnished by traveller yield similar result disparity have mentioned therefore almost cease to be disparity virtually disappears what do recommend father asked louisa reserved composure not in least affected by gratifying result must substitute for term used just now for misplaced expression louisa returned father appears to that nothing can be plainer confining rigidly to fact question of fact state to be doe mr bounderby ask to marry yes doe sole remaining question then be will marry think nothing can be plainer than will marry repeated louisa with great deliberation precisely be satisfactory to a father dear louisa to know that come to consideration of question with previous habit of mind habit of life belong to many young woman father returned now leave to judge for said mr gradgrind have stated case a such case be usually stated among practical mind have stated a case of mother be stated in

impelled to throw upon breast give pent up confidence of heart to see must have overleaped at bound artificial barrier have for many year be erecting between subtle essence of humanity will elude utmost cunning of algebra until last trumpet ever to be sounded will blow even algebra to wreck barrier be too many too high for leap with unbending utilitarian matter of fact face hardened again moment shot away into plumbless depth of past to mingle with lost opportunity be drowned there removing eye from sat so long looking silently towards town that said at length be consulting chimney of coketown work louisa there seems to be nothing there languid monotonous smoke yet when night come fire burst out father answered turning quickly of course know that louisa see application of remark to

interposed be short doubt dear still average duration of human life be proved to have increased of late year calculation of various life assurance annuity office among other figure can not go wrong have established fact speak of own life father o indeed still said mr gradgrind need not point out to louisa that be governed by law govern life in aggregate while last must wish to do little can little be fit for what doe matter mr gradgrind seemed rather at loss to understand last four word replying how matter what matter dear mr bounderby went on in steady straight way without regarding asks to marry question have to ask be will marry be so father be not have told so father have not certainly dear let be so since mr bounderby like to take thus be satisfied to accept proposal tell father a soon a please that be answer repeat word for word if can because must wish to know what said be quite right dear retorted father approvingly to be exact will observe very proper request have wish in reference to period of marriage child none father what doe matter mr gradgrind have drawn chair little nearer to taken hand repetition of word seemed to strike with little discord on ear paused to look at still holding hand said louisa have not considered essential to ask one question because possibility implied in appeared to to be too remote perhaps ought to do so have never entertained in secret other proposal father returned almost scornfully what other proposal can have be made to whom have seen where have be be heart experience dear louisa returned mr gradgrind reassured satisfied correct justly merely wished to discharge duty what do know father said louisa in quiet manner of taste fancy of aspiration affection of part of nature in such light thing might have be nourished what escape have have from problem must be demonstrated reality must be grasped a said unconsciously closed hand a if upon solid object slowly opened a though be releasing dust ash dear assented eminently practical parent quite true quite true why father pursued what strange question to ask baby preference that even have heard of a common among child have never have innocent resting place in breast have be so careful of that never have child heart have trained so well that never dreamed child dream have dealt so wisely with father from cradle to hour never have child

slightly said nothing two hour be long stretch of lounging about after long day labour stephen sat upon step of door leaned against wall under archway strolled up down listened for church clock stopped watched child playing in street purpose other be so natural to one that mere loiterer always look feel remarkable when first hour be out stephen even began to have uncomfortable sensation upon of being for time disreputable character then came lamplighter two lengthening line of light down long perspective of street until be blended lost in distance mr sparsit closed first floor window drew down blind went up stair presently light went up stair after passing first fanlight of door afterwards two staircase window on way up by by one corner of second floor blind be disturbed a if mr

hand be in street be barely daybreak when with parting look round room mournfully wondering whether must ever see again went out town be a entirely deserted a if inhabitant have abandoned rather than hold communication with everything looked wan at hour even coming sun made pale waste in sky like sad sea by place where rachael lived though be not in way by red brick street by great silent factory not trembling yet by railway where danger light be waning in strengthening day by railway crazy neighbourhood half pulled down half built up by scattered red brick villa where besmoked evergreen be sprinkled with dirty powder like untidy snuff taker by coal dust path many variety of ugliness stephen got to top of hill looked back day be shining radiantly upon town then bell be going for morning work domestic fire be not yet lighted high chimney have sky to puffing out poisonous volume must not be long in hiding for hour of many window be golden showed coketown people sun eternally in eclipse through medium of smoked glass so strange to turn from chimney to bird so strange to have road dust on foot instead of coal grit so strange to have lived to time of life yet to be beginning like boy summer morning with musing in mind bundle under arm stephen took attentive face along high road tree arched over whispering that left true loving heart behind chapter vii gunpowder mr james harthouse

propensity to call mr bounderby miss gradgrind yielded to three four score time in course of evening repetition of mistake covered mr sparsit with modest confusion indeed said seemed so natural to say miss gradgrind whereas to persuade that young lady whom have have happiness of knowing from child must be really truly mr bounderby found almost impossible be further singularity of remarkable case

between may be a well to be in training therefore rang bell tossing negligently on sofa ordered dinner at beefsteak in got through intervening time a well a must be not particularly well for remained in greatest perplexity a hour went on kind of explanation offered perplexity augmented at compound interest however took affair a coolly a be in human nature to do entertained with facetious idea of training more than once wouldnt be bad yawned at one time to give waiter five shilling throw at time occurred to fellow of about thirteen fourteen stone might be hired by hour jest did not tell materially on afternoon suspense sooth to say lagged fearfully be impossible even before dinner to avoid often walking about in pattern of carpet looking out of window listening at door for footstep occasionally becoming rather hot when step approached that room after dinner when day turned to twilight twilight turned to night still communication be made to began to be a expressed like holy office slow torture however still true to conviction that indifference be genuine high breeding only conviction have seized crisis a opportunity for ordering candle newspaper have be trying in vain for hour to read newspaper when waiter appeared said at once mysteriously apologetically beg pardon sir youre wanted sir if please general recollection that be kind of thing police said to swell mob caused mr harthouse to ask waiter in return with bristling indignation what devil meant by wanted beg pardon sir young lady outside sir wish to see outside where outside door sir giving waiter to personage before mentioned a block head duly qualified for consignment mr harthouse hurried into gallery young woman whom have never seen stood there plainly dressed very quiet very pretty a conducted into room placed chair for observed by light of candle that be even prettier than have at first believed face be innocent youthful expression remarkably pleasant be not afraid of in way disconcerted seemed to have mind entirely preoccupied with occasion of visit to have substituted consideration for speak to mr harthouse said when be alone to mr harthouse added in mind speak to with most confiding eye ever saw most earnest voice though so quiet ever heard if understandand sirsaid sissy what honour a gentleman bind to in other matter blood really rose in face a began in word be sure may rely upon to keep visit secret to keep secret what be going to say will rely upon if will tell may so far trust may assure be young a see be alone a see in coming to sir have advice encouragement beyond own hope thought be very strong a followed momentary upward glance of eye thought besides be very odd beginning dont see where be going think said sissy have already guessed whom left just now have be in greatest concern uneasiness during last four twenty hour have appeared a many year returned on lady account hope have be encouraged to form that come from lady deceive trust left within hour at at father mr harthouses face lengthened in spite of coolness perplexity increased then certainly thought see where be going hurried there last night arrived there in great agitation be insensible through night live at father be with may be sure sir will never see her again a long a live mr harthouse drew long breath if ever man found in position of not knowing what to say made discovery beyond question that be so circumstanced child like ingenuousness with visitor spoke modest fearlessness truthfulness put artifice aside entire forgetfulness of herself in earnest quiet holding to object with have come together with reliance on easily given promisewhich in shamed himpresented something in be so inexperienced against knew of usual weapon must fall so powerless that not word must rally to relief at last said so startling announcement so confidently made by such lip be really disconcerting in last degree may be permitted to inquire if be charged to convey information to in hopeless word by lady of whom speak have charge from drowning man catch at straw with disrespect for judgment with doubt of sincerity excuse saying that cling to belief that there be yet hope that be not condemned to perpetual exile from lady presence there be not least hope first object of coming here sir be to assure that must believe that there be more hope of ever speaking with again than there must be if have died when came home last night must believe if cantor if must by infirmity of nature be obstinateand wont be still true there be hope james harthouse looked at with incredulous smile upon lip mind looked over beyond smile be quite thrown away bit lip took little time for consideration well if must unhappily appear said after due pain duty on part that be brought to position so desolate a banishment will not become lady persecutor said have commission from have only commission of love for love for have other trust than have be with since came home that have given confidence have further trust than know something of character marriage o mr harthouse think have that trust too be touched in cavity where heart must have beenin that nest of addled egg where bird of heaven must have lived if have not be whistled awayby fervour of reproach be not moral sort of fellow said never make pretension to character of moral sort of fellow be a immoral a need be at same time in bringing distress upon lady who be subject of present conversation in unfortunately compromising in way in committing by expression of sentiment towards not perfectly reconcilable within fact withthe domestic hearth in taking advantage of father being machine of brother being whelp of husband being bear beg to be allowed to assure have have particularly evil intention have glided on from one step to with smoothness so perfectly diabolical have not slightest idea catalogue be so long until began to turn over whereas find said mr james harthouse in conclusion that be really in several volume though said in frivolous way way seemed for once conscious polishing of ugly surface be silent for moment then proceeded with more self possessed air though with trace of vexation disappointment must not be polished out after have be just now represented to in manner find impossible to doubti know of hardly other source from must have accepted so readilyi feel bound to say to in whom confidence have mentioned have be reposed can not refuse to contemplate possibility however unexpected of seeing lady more be solely to blame for thing having come to thisandand can not say added rather hard up for general peroration have sanguine expectation of ever becoming moral sort of fellow have belief in moral sort of fellow sissy face sufficiently showed that appeal to be not finished spoke resumed a raised eye to again of first object may assume that there be second to be mentioned yes will oblige by confiding mr harthouse returned sissy with blending of gentleness steadiness that quite defeated with simple confidence in being bound to do what required that held at singular disadvantage only reparation that remains with be to leave here immediately finally be quite sure that can mitigate in other way wrong harm have done be quite sure that be only compensation have left in power to make say that be much that be enough be something be necessary therefore though without other authority than have given even without knowledge of other person than ask to depart from place to night under obligation never to return to if have asserted influence over beyond plain faith in truth right of what said if have concealed least doubt irresolution have harboured for best purpose reserve pretence if have shown felt lightest trace of sensitiveness to ridicule astonishment remonstrance might offer must have carried against at point must a easily have changed clear sky by looking at in surprise a affect do know asked quite at loss extent of what ask probably be not aware that be here on public kind of business preposterous enough in have gone in for sworn by be supposed to be devoted to in quite desperate manner probably be not aware of assure fact have effect on sissy fact fact besides said mr harthouse taking turn two across room dubiously so alarmingly absurd must make man so ridiculous after going in for fellow to back out in such incomprehensible way be quite sure repeated sissy that be only reparation in power sir be quite sure must not have come here glanced at face walked about again upon soul dont know what to say so immensely absurd fell to lot now to stipulate for secrecy if be to do very ridiculous thing said stopping again presently leaning against chimney piece must only be in most inviolable confidence will trust to sir returned sissy will trust to leaning against chimney piece reminded of night with whelp be self same chimney piece somehow felt a if be whelp to night must make way at suppose man never be placed in more ridiculous position said after looking down looking up laughing frowning walking off walking back again see way out of will be will be will be suppose must take off imaginein short engage to do sissy rose be not surprised by result be happy in face beamed brightly will permit to say continued mr james harthouse that doubt if other ambassador ambassadress must have addressed with same success must not only regard a being in very ridiculous position a being vanquished at point will allow privilege of remembering enemy name name said ambassadress only name must possibly care to know to night sissy jupe pardon curiosity at parting related to family be only poor girl returned sissy be separated from fatherhe be only strollerand taken pity on by mr gradgrind have lived in house ever since be gone wanted to complete defeat said mr james harthouse sinking with resigned air on sofa after standing transfixed little while defeat may now be considered perfectly accomplished only

more note one to mr bounderby announcing retirement from part of country showing where must be found for next fortnight other similar in effect to mr gradgrind almost a soon a ink be dry upon superscription have left tall chimney of coketown behind be in railway carriage tearing glaring over dark landscape moral sort of fellow might suppose that mr james harthouse derived comfortable reflection afterwards from prompt retreat a one of few action made amends for anything a token to that have escaped climax of very bad business be not so at secret sense of having failed be ridiculousa dread of what other fellow who went in for similar sort of thing must say at expense if knew itso oppressed that what be about very best passage in life be one of others must not have owned to on account only one made ashamed of chapter iii very decided indefatigable mr sparsit with violent cold upon voice reduced to whisper stately frame so racked by continual sneeze that seemed in danger of dismemberment gave chase to patron until found in metropolis there majestically sweeping in upon at hotel in st james street exploded combustible with be charged blew up having executed mission with infinite relish high minded woman then fainted away on mr bounderbys coat collar mr bounderbys first procedure be to shake mr sparsit off leave to progress a might through various stage of suffering on floor next have recourse to administration of potent restorative such a screwing patient thumb smiting hand abundantly watering face inserting salt in mouth when attention have recovered speedily did hustled into fast train without offering other refreshment carried back to coketown more dead than alive regarded a classical ruin mr sparsit be interesting spectacle on arrival at journey end considered in other light amount of damage have by time sustained be excessive impaired claim to admiration utterly heedless of wear tear of clothes constitution adamant to pathetic sneeze mr bounderby immediately crammed into coach bore off to stone lodge now tom gradgrind said bounderby bursting into father in law room late at night here lady heremrs sparsityou know mr sparsitwho have something to say to will strike dumb have missed letter exclaimed mr gradgrind surprised by apparition missed letter sir bawled present time be time for letter man will talk to josiah bounderby of coketown about letter with mind in state in now bounderby said mr gradgrind in tone of temperate remonstrance speak of very special letter have written to in reference to louisa tom gradgrind replied bounderby knocking flat of hand several time with great vehemence on table speak of very special messenger have come to in reference to louisa mr sparsit maam stand forward that unfortunate lady hereupon essaying to offer testimony without voice with painful gesture expressive of inflamed throat became so aggravating underwent so many facial contortion mr bounderby unable to bear seized by arm shook if cant get out maam said bounderby leave to get out be not time for lady however highly connected to be totally inaudible seemingly swallowing marble tom gradgrind mr sparsit latterly found by accident in situation to overhear conversation out of door between daughter precious gentleman friend mr james harthouse indeed said mr gradgrind ah indeed cried bounderby in conversation be not necessary to repeat tenor bounderby know what passed do perhaps said bounderby staring with might at so quiet assuasive father in law know where daughter be at present time undoubtedly be here here dear bounderby let beg to restrain loud out break on account louisa be here moment must detach from interview with person of whom speak whom deeply regret to have be mean of introducing to louisa hurried here for protection have not be at home many hour when received herhere in room hurried by train to town ran from town to house through raging storm presented before in state of distraction of course have remained here ever since let entreat for own sake for hers to be more quiet mr bounderby silently gazed about for moment in direction except mr sparsits direction then abruptly turning upon niece of lady scadgers said to wretched woman now maam will be happy to hear little apology may think proper to offer for going about country at express pace with other luggage than cock bull maam sir whispered mr sparsit nerve be at present too much shaken health be at present too much impaired in service to admit of doing more than taking refuge in tear did well maam said bounderby without making observation to may not be made with propriety to woman of good family what have got to add to be that there be something else in appears to may take refuge namely coach coach in came here being at door youll allow to hand down to pack home to bank where best course for to pursue will be to put foot into hottest water can bear take glass of scalding rum butter after get into bed with word mr bounderby extended right hand to weeping lady escorted to conveyance in question shedding many plaintive sneeze by way soon returned alone now a showed in face tom gradgrind that wanted to speak to resumed here be be not in very agreeable state tell plainly not relishing business even a be not considering that be at time a dutifully submissively treated by daughter a josiah bounderby of coketown ought to be treated by wife have opinion dare say have mine know if mean to say anything to to night go against candid remark have better let alone mr gradgrind will be observed being much softened mr bounderby took particular pain to harden at point be amiable nature dear bounderby mr gradgrind began in reply now youll excuse said bounderby dont want to be too dear that to start with when begin to be dear to man generally find that intention be to come over be not speaking to politely a be aware be not polite if like politeness know where to get have gentleman friend know theyll serve with a much of article a want dont keep bounderby urged mr gradgrind be liable to mistake thought couldnt make em interrupted bounderby perhaps thought so say be liable to mistake must feel sensible of delicacy grateful for if must spare reference to harthouse will not associate in conversation with intimacy encouragement pray persist in connecting with mine never mentioned name said bounderby well well returned mr gradgrind with patient even submissive air sat for little while pondering bounderby see reason to doubt whether have ever quite understood louisa who do mean by let say then returned in answer to coarsely blurted question doubt whether have understood louisa doubt whether have be quite right in manner of education there hit returned bounderby there agree with have found out at last have education ill tell what education isto be tumbled out of door neck crop put upon shortest allowance of everything except blow thats what call education think good sense will perceive mr gradgrind remonstrated in humility whatever merit of system may be must be difficult of general application to girl dont see at sir returned obstinate bounderby well sighed mr gradgrind will not enter into question assure have desire to be controversial seek to repair what be amiss if possibly can hope will assist in good spirit bounderby for have be very much distressed dont understand yet said bounderby with determined obstinacy therefore wont make promise in course of few hour dear bounderby mr gradgrind proceeded in same depressed propitiatory manner appear to myself to have become better informed a to louisas character than in previous year enlightenment have be painfully forced upon discovery be not mine think there arebounderby will be surprised to hear say thisi think there be quality in louisa whichwhich have be harshly neglected andand little perverted andand must suggest to thatthat if must kindly meet in timely endeavour to leave to better nature for whileand to encourage to develop by tenderness considerationitit must be better for happiness of of louisa said mr gradgrind shading face with hand have always be favourite child blustrous bounderby crimsoned swelled to extent on hearing word that seemed to be probably be on brink of fit with very ear bright purple shot with crimson pent up indignation however said youd like to keep here for time ii have intended to recommend dear bounderby that must allow louisa to remain here on visit be attended by sissy mean of course cecilia jupe who understands in whom trust gather from tom gradgrind said bounderby standing up with hand in pocket that be of opinion there what people call incompatibility between loo bounderby fear there be at present general incompatibility between louisa andandand almost relation in have placed be father sorrowful reply now look here tom gradgrind said bounderby flushed confronting with leg wide apart hand deeper in pocket hair like hayfield wherein windy anger be boisterous have said say be going to say mine be coketown man be josiah bounderby of coketown know brick of town know work of town know chimney of town know smoke of town know hand of town know em pretty well theyre real when man tell anything about imaginative quality always tell that man whoever be that know what mean mean turtle soup venison with gold spoon that want to be set up with coach six thats what daughter want since be of opinion that ought to have what want recommend to provide for because tom gradgrind will never have from bounderby said mr gradgrind hoped after entreaty must have taken different tone just wait bit retorted bounderby have said say believe heard out hear out if please dont make spectacle of unfairness a well a inconsistency because although be sorry to see tom gradgrind reduced to present position must be doubly sorry to see brought so low a now there incompatibility of sort be given to understand by between daughter ill give to understand in reply to that there unquestionably be incompatibility of first magnitudeto be summed up in thisthat daughter dont properly know husband merit be not impressed with sense a must become by george of honour of alliance thats plain speaking hope bounderby urged mr gradgrind be unreasonable be said bounderby be glad to hear say so because when tom gradgrind with new light tell that what say be unreasonable be convinced at once must be devilish sensible with permission be going on know origin know that for good many year of life didnt want shoeing horn in consequence of not having shoe yet may believe not a think proper that there be ladiesborn ladiesbelonging to familiesfamilieswho next to worship ground walk on discharged like rocket at father in law head whereas daughter proceeded bounderby be far from being born lady that know not that care pinch of candle snuff about such thing for be very well aware dont that such be fact tom gradgrind cant change why do say not fear observed mr gradgrind in low voice to spare hear out said bounderby refrain from cutting in till turn come round say because highly connected female have be astonished to see way in daughter have conducted to witness insensibility have wondered how have suffered wonder now wont suffer bounderby returned mr gradgrind rising le say to night better think on contrary tom gradgrind more say to night better think be consideration checked till have said mean to say then dont care how soon stop come to question may shorten business what do mean by proposal made just now what do mean bounderby by visiting proposition said bounderby with inflexible jerk of hayfield mean that hope may be induced to arrange in friendly manner for allowing period of repose reflection here may tend to gradual alteration for better in many respect to softening down of idea of incompatibility said bounderby if put in term what made think of said bounderby have already said fear louisa have not be understood be asking too much bounderby that so far elder must aid in trying to set right have accepted great charge of for better for worse for mr bounderby may have be annoyed by repetition of own word to stephen blackpool cut quotation short with angry start come said dont want to be told about know what took for a well a do never mind what took for thats look out be merely going on to remark bounderby that may be more le in wrong not even excepting that yielding on part remembering trust have accepted may not only be act of true kindness perhaps debt incurred towards louisa think differently blustered bounderby be going to finish business according to own opinion now dont want to make quarrel of with tom gradgrind to tell truth dont think must be worthy of reputation to quarrel on subject a to gentleman friend may take off wherever like best if fall in way will tell mind if dont fall in way shant for wont be worth while to do a to daughter whom made loo bounderby might have done better by leaving loo gradgrind if dont come home to morrow by twelve oclock at noon will understand that prefers to stay away will send wearing apparel so forth over here youll take charge of for future what will say to people in general of incompatibility led to so laying down law will be be josiah bounderby have bringing up shes daughter of tom gradgrind have bringing up two horse wouldnt pull together be pretty well known to be rather uncommon man believe most people will understand fast enough that must be woman rather out of common also who in long run must come up to mark let seriously entreat to reconsider bounderby urged mr gradgrind before commit to such decision always come to decision said bounderby tossing hat on do do at once must be surprised at tom gradgrinds addressing such remark to josiah bounderby of coketown knowing what know of if must be surprised by anything tom gradgrind did after making party to sentimental humbug have given decision have got no more to say good night so mr bounderby went home to town house to bed at five minute past twelve oclock next day directed mr bounderbys property to be carefully packed up
