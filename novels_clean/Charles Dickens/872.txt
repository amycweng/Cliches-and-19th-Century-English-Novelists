in london that majesty considered average hand equal to posting of one hundred bill single sheet in day king be of opinion that although poster have much increased in size have not increased in number a abolition of state lottery have occasioned great falling off especially in country over above change bethought that custom of advertising in newspaper have greatly increased completion of many london improvement a trafalgar square particularly observed singularity of majesty calling that improvement royal exchange c have of late year reduced number of advantageous posting place bill sticker

must be least consolation to to know on philosophical ground that be merely imagination be question cant help asking by way late brutal assault strongly question expediency of advocating revival of whipping for crime be natural generous impulse to be indignant at perpetration of inconceivable brutality doubt whipping panacea gravely not in least regard pity for criminal whom hold in far lower estimation than mad wolf in consideration for general tone feeling be very much improved since whipping time be bad for people to be familiarised with such punishment when whip went out of bridewell ceased to be flourished at cart tail at whipping post began to fade out of madhouse workhouse school family to give place to better system everywhere than cruel driving must be hasty because few brute may be inadequately punished to revive in aspect what in so many aspect society be hardly yet happily rid of whip be very contagious kind of thing difficult to confine within one set of bound utterly
