that pirate possessed up at prison in wood settled always to encamp on opposite side of stream so a to have breadth of river between sleep opinion be that if be acquainted with near way by land to mouth of river must come up in force retake kill according a must that if be not case if river ran by none of secret station might escape when say settled that mean that planned anything with confidence a to what might happen hour hence so much have happened in one night such great change have be violently suddenly made in fortune of many among that have got better used to uncertainty in little while than dare say most people do in course of life difficulty soon got into through off setting point current of stream made likelihood of being drowned alone to say nothing of being retaken a broad plain a sun at noonday to of worked hard at managing raft under direction of seaman of own skill think never must have prevented from oversetting also worked hard at making good defect in first hasty construction water soon found out while humbly resigned to going down if be will of father be in heaven humbly made up mind that must do best be in so held on gliding with stream drove to bank drove to bank turned whirled yet carried on sometimes much too slowly sometimes much too fast yet carried on little deaf dumb boy slumbered good deal now be case with child caused very little
