sacred edifice resounded with united wailing a four sister mr robinson continued to occupy same house after memorable occasion a married sister whoever be never appeared in public without other three be not quite clear that neighbour ever must have discovered real mr robinson for circumstance of most gratifying description will happen occasionally in best regulated family three quarter day elapsed

parish business pride not little on style of addressing parishioner in vestry assembled view be rather confined than extensive principle more narrow than liberal have be heard to declaim very loudly in favour of liberty of press advocate repeal of stamp duty on newspaper because daily journal who now have monopoly of public never give verbatim report of vestry meeting must not appear egotistical for world at same time must say that there be speechesthat celebrated speech of own on emolument of sexton duty of office for instancewhich might be communicated to public greatly to improvement advantage great opponent in public life be captain purday old naval officer on half pay to whom have already introduced reader captain being determined opponent of constituted authority whoever may chance to be other friend being steady supporter with equal disregard of individual merit will readily be supposed that occasion for coming into direct collision be few far between divided vestry fourteen time on motion for heating church with warm water instead of coal made speech about liberty expenditure prodigality hot water threw whole parish into state of excitement then captain when be on visiting committee opponent overseer brought forward certain distinct specific charge relative to management of workhouse boldly expressed total want of confidence in existing authority moved for

change in public taste took place with reference to itinerant bear who being discountenanced by populace gradually fell off one by one from street of metropolis until not one remained to create taste for natural history in breast of poor uninstructed one bear indeeda brown ragged animalhad lingered about haunt of former triumph with worn dejected visage feeble limb have essayed to wield quarter staff for amusement of multitude hunger utter want of due recompense for ability have at length driven from field be only too probable that have fallen sacrifice to rising taste for grease regretted to add that similar le lamentable change have taken place with reference to monkey delightful animal have formerly be almost a plentiful a organ on top of be accustomed to sit proportion in year appeared by parliamentary return being a one monkey to three organ owing however to altered taste in musical instrument substitution in great measure of narrow box of music for organ left monkey nothing to sit upon source of public amusement be wholly dried up considering matter of deepest importance in connection with national education that people must not lose such opportunity of making

bear monkey generally in absence of proper encouragement be dispersed in other direction professor pumpkinskull wished to take opportunity of calling attention of section to most important serious point author of treatise just read have alluded to prevalent taste for bear grease a mean of promoting growth of hair undoubtedly be diffused to very great a appeared to very alarming extent gentleman attending section must fail to be aware of fact that youth of present age evinced by behaviour in street at place of public resort considerable lack of gallantry gentlemanly feeling in more ignorant time have be thought becoming wished to know whether be possible that constant outward application of bear grease by young gentleman about town have imperceptibly infused into unhappy person something of nature quality of bear shuddered a threw out remark if theory on inquiry must prove to be well founded must at once explain great deal of unpleasant eccentricity of behaviour without such discovery be wholly unaccountable president highly complimented learned gentleman on most valuable suggestion produced greatest effect upon assembly remarked that only week previous have seen young gentleman at

obtaining certain stamped acceptance from young gentleman in army have scarcely laid down pen to contemplate for few moment admirable actor performance of exquisite practical joke than new branch of subject flashed suddenly upon so take up again at once people who have be behind scene most people who have be before know that in representation of pantomime good many men be sent upon stage for express purpose of being cheated knocked down now down to moment ago have never be able to understand for what possible purpose great number of odd lazy large headed men whom one be in habit of meeting here there everywhere must ever have be created see now be supernumerary in pantomime of life men who have be thrust into with other view than to be constantly tumbling over other running head against sort of strange thing sat opposite to one of men at supper table only last week now think of be exactly like gentleman with pasteboard head face who do corresponding business in theatrical pantomime there be same broad stolid simperthe same dull leaden eyethe same unmeaning vacant stare be said be done always came in at precisely wrong place jostled against something that have not slightest business with looked at man across table again again must not satisfy what race of being to class with how very odd that never occurred to before will frankly own that have be much troubled with harlequin see harlequin of so many kind in real living pantomime that hardly know to select a proper fellow of of theatre at one time be disposed to think that harlequin be neither more le than young man of family independent property who have run away with opera dancer be fooling life mean away in light trivial amusement on reflection however remembered that harlequin be occasionally guilty of witty even clever act be rather disposed to acquit young men of family independent property generally speaking of such misdemeanour on more mature consideration of subject have arrived at conclusion that harlequin of life be just ordinary men to be found in particular walk degree on whom certain station particular conjunction of circumstance confers magic wand brings to few word on pantomime of public political life will say at once then concludemerely premising in place that decline reference to columbine being in wise satisfied of nature of connection with parti coloured lover not feeling by mean clear that must be justified in introducing to virtuous respectable lady who peruse lucubration take that commencement of session of parliament be neither more le than drawing up of curtain for grand comic pantomime that majesty most gracious speech on opening thereof may be not inaptly compared to clown opening speech of here be lord gentleman here be appears to mind at least to be very good abstract of point meaning of propitiatory address of ministry when remember how frequently speech be made immediately after change too parallel be quite perfect still more singular perhaps cast of political pantomime never be richer than at day be particularly strong in clown at former time must say have have such astonishing tumbler performer so ready to go through whole of feat for amusement of admiring throng extreme readiness to exhibit indeed have given rise to ill natured reflection having be objected that by exhibiting gratuitously through country when theatre be closed reduce to level of mountebank thereby tend to degrade respectability of profession certainly grimaldi never did sort of thing though brown king gibson have gone to surrey in vacation time mr c j smith have ruralised at sadlers well find theatrical precedent for general tumbling through country except in gentleman name unknown who threw summerset on behalf of late mr richardson who be authority either because have never be on regular board laying aside question after be mere matter of taste may reflect with pride gratification of heart on proficiency of clown a exhibited in season night after night will twist tumble about till two three four oclock in morning playing strangest antic giving other funniest slap on face can possibly be imagined without evincing smallest token of fatigue strange noise confusion shouting roaring amid be done too must put to shame most turbulent sixpenny gallery that ever yelled through boxing night be especially curious to behold one of clown compelled to go through most surprising contortion by irresistible influence of wand of office leader harlequin hold above head acted upon by wonderful charm will become perfectly motionless moving hand foot finger will even lose faculty of speech at instant notice on other hand will become life animation if required pouring forth torrent of word without sense meaning throwing into wildest most fantastic contortion even grovelling on earth licking up dust exhibition be more curious than pleasing indeed be rather disgusting than otherwise except to admirer of such thing with whom confess have fellow feeling strange tricksvery strange tricksare also performed by harlequin who hold for time being magic wand have just mentioned mere waving before man eye will dispossess brain of notion previously stored there fill with entirely new set of idea one gentle tap on back will alter colour of man coat completely there be expert performer who having wand held first on one side then on other will change from side to side turning coat at evolution with so much rapidity dexterity that quickest eye can scarcely detect motion occasionally genius who confers wand wrests from hand of temporary possessor consigns to new performer on occasion character change side then race hard knock begin anew might have extended chapter to much greater lengthwe might have carried comparison into liberal professionswe might have shown a be in fact original purpose that be in little pantomime with scene character of own complete a fear have be quite lengthy enough already will leave chapter just where be gentleman not altogether unknown a dramatic poet wrote thus year two ago world stage men woman merely player tracking out footstep at scarcely worth mentioning little distance of few million of league behind venture to add by way of new reading that meant pantomime that be actor in pantomime of life particular concerning lion have great respect for lion in abstract in common with most other people have heard read of many instance of bravery generosity have duly admired that heroic denial charming philanthropy prompt never to eat people except when be hungry have be deeply impressed with becoming sense of politeness be said to display towards unmarried lady of certain state natural history teem with anecdote illustrative of excellent quality one old spelling book in particular recount touching instance of old lion of high moral dignity stern principle who felt imperative duty to devour young man who have contracted habit of swearing a striking example to rising generation be extremely pleasant to reflect upon indeed say very great deal in favour of lion a mass be bound to state however that such individual lion a have happened to fall in with have not put forth very striking characteristic have not acted up to chivalrous character assigned by chronicler never saw lion in what be called natural state certainly be to say have never met lion out walking in forest crouching in lair under tropical sun waiting till dinner must happen to come by hot from baker have seen under influence of captivity pressure of misfortune must say that appeared to very apathetic heavy headed fellow lion at zoological garden for instance be very well have undeniable mane look very fierce lord bless of that lion of fashionable world look just a ferocious be most harmless creature breathing box lobby lion regent street animal will put on most terrible aspect roar fearfully if affront will never bite if offer to attack manfully will fairly turn tail sneak off doubtless creature roam about sometimes in herd if meet especially meek looking peaceably disposed fellow will endeavour to frighten faintest show of vigorous resistance be sufficient to scare even then be pleasant characteristic whereas make matter of distinct charge against zoological lion brother at fair that be sleepy dreamy sluggish quadruped remember to have ever seen one of perfectly awake except at feeding time in respect uphold biped lion against four footed namesake boldly challenge controversy upon subject with opinion may be easily imagined that curiosity interest be very much excited other day when lady of acquaintance called on resolutely declined to accept refusal of invitation to evening party for said have got lion coming at once retracted plea of prior engagement became a anxious to go a have previously be to stay away went early posted ourselves in eligible part of drawing room from whence must hope to obtain full view of interesting animal two three hour passed quadrille began room filled lion appeared lady of house became inconsolablefor be one of peculiar privilege of lion to make solemn appointment never keep themwhen of sudden there came tremendous double rap at street door master of house after gliding out unobserved a flattered to peep over banister came into room rubbing hand together with great glee cried out in very important voice dear mrnaming lion have moment arrived upon eye be turned towards door observed several young lady who have be laughing conversing previously with great gaiety good humour grow extremely quiet sentimental while young gentleman who have be cutting great figure in facetious small talk way suddenly sank very obviously in estimation of company be looked upon with great coldness indifference even young man who have be ordered from music shop to play pianoforte be visibly affected struck several false note in excess of excitement time there be great talking outside more than once accompanied by loud laugh cry of oh capital excellent from inferred that lion be jocose that exclamation be occasioned by transport of keeper host be deceived for when lion at last appeared overheard keeper who be little prim man whisper to several gentleman of acquaintance with uplifted hand expression of half suppressed admiration thatnaming lion again be in such cue to night lion be literary one of course there be vast number of people present who have admired roaring be anxious to be introduced to very pleasant be to see brought up for purpose to observe patient dignity with received patting caressing brought forcibly to mind what have so often witnessed at country fair where other lion be compelled to go through a many form of courtesy a chance to be acquainted with just a often a admiring party happen to drop in upon while lion be exhibiting in way keeper be not idle for mingled among crowd spread praise most industriously to one gentleman whispered very choice thing that noble animal have said in very act of coming up stair of course rendered mental effort still more astonishing to murmured hasty account of grand dinner have taken place day before where twenty seven gentleman have got up at once to demand extra cheer for lion to lady made sundry promise of interceding to procure majestic brute sign manual for album then there be little private consultation in different corner relative to personal appearance stature of lion whether be shorter than have expected to see taller thinner fatter younger older whether be like portrait unlike whether particular shade of eye be black blue hazel green yellow mixture at consultation keeper assisted in short lion be sole single subject of discussion till sat down to whist then people relapsed into old topic of conversationthemselves other must confess that looked forward with slight impatience to announcement of supper for if wish to see tame lion under particularly favourable circumstance feeding time be period of others to pitch upon be therefore very much delighted to observe sensation among guest well knew how to interpret immediately afterwards to behold lion escorting lady of house down stair offered arm to elderly female of acquaintance whodear old soulis very best person that ever lived to lead down to meal for be room ever so small party ever so large be sure by intuitive perception of eligible to push pull conductor close to best dish on tablewe say offered arm to elderly female descending stair shortly after lion be fortunate enough to obtain seat nearly opposite of course keeper be there already have planted at precisely distance from charge afforded decent pretext for raising voice when addressed to so loud key a must not fail to attract attention of whole company immediately began to apply seriously to task of bringing lion out putting through whole of manoeuvre such flash of wit a elicited from lion first of began to make pun upon salt cellar then upon breast of fowl then upon trifle best joke of be decidedly on lobster salad upon latter subject lion came out most vigorously in opinion of most competent authority quite outshone be very excellent mode of shining in society be founded humbly conceive upon classic model of dialogue between mr punch friend proprietor wherein latter take up hill work be content to pioneer to joke repartee of mr p who never fails to gain great credit excite much laughter thereby whatever be founded on however recommend to lion present to come for in instance succeeded to admiration perfectly dazzled whole body of hearer when salt cellar fowl breast trifle lobster salad be exhausted must not afford standing room for solitary witticism keeper performed that very dangerous feat be still done with of caravan lion although in one instance terminated fatally of putting head in animal mouth placing entirely at mercy boswell frequently present melancholy instance of lamentable result of achievement other keeper jackal have be terribly lacerated for daring be due to lion to state that condescended to be trifled with in most gentle manner finally went home with showman in hack cab perfectly peaceable slightly fuddled being in contemplative mood be led to make reflection upon character conduct of genus of lion a walked homewards be not long in arriving at conclusion that former impression in favour be very much strengthened confirmed by what have recently seen while other lion receive company compliment in sullen moody not to say snarling manner appear flattered by attention be paid while conceal to utmost of power from vulgar gaze court popular eye unlike brother whom nothing short of compulsion will move to exertion be ever ready to display acquirement to wondering throng have known bear of undoubted ability who when expectation of large audience have be wound up to utmost pitch have peremptorily refused to dance well taught monkey who have unaccountably objected to exhibit on slack wire elephant of unquestioned genius who have suddenly declined to turn barrel organ never once knew heard of biped lion literary otherwiseand state a fact be highly creditable to whole specieswho occasion
