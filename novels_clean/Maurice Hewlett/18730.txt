communication understanding on side when began to teach english noticed that have kind of pity for kind of contempt perhaps be nearer mark must be compelled to express in so clumsy way be philosopher imagine that need of putting one word after may be due to habit of thinking in sequence if there be such thing a time in other world must not be necessary there to frame speech in sentence at be sure that thumbeline be name for never learned real name spoke with bran strap in flash revealed whole thought at once so also answered there be doubt so also contrived to talk with little girl who although be four year old great chatterbox never attempted to say single word of own language to thumbeline yet communicated with by hour together did not know anything of for month more though must have begun almost at once blame for only ought of course to have remembered that child be more likely to see fairy than grown ups then why did florrie keep secret why did not tell mother that have seen fairy in bran kennel child be a open a day yet concealed knowledge from of without least difficulty seemed same careless laughing child have always be one must not have supposed to have care in world yet for nearly six month must have be full of care having daily secret intercourse with thumbeline keeping eye open time lest mother must find out certainly must have taught something in way of keeping secret know that kept mine very badly blame more than enough for keeping at god know what might have be spared if on night brought home have told mary whole truth yet how must have convinced that be impaling one with arm while hand rested on bar of bicycle be not that absurdity on face of yes indeed sequel be absurdity be terrible fact kept thumbeline in kennel for whole winter seemed happy enough there with dog of course have have florrie too though did not find that out until spring doubt now that if have kept in there altogether must have be perfectly contented first time saw florrie with be amazed be sunday morning there be four year old child standing at wire pressing against thumbeline close to face almost touched finger be interlaced be certain that be speaking to

florrie ' said fixed round blue eye upon a if in wonder then looked away said shortly 'no one else must not get to confess admit then at time afterward that have cognisance at of fairy in bran kennel although communication be daily often lasted for hour at time know that make thing better have thought sometimes that child believed to be a insensible to thumbeline a mother be can only have believed
