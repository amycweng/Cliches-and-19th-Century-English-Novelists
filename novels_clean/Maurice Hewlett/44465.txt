must riot have perceived disparity during engagement then reminded that life might have tendered shade intolerant must remember that subject of literary work engrossing to own mind made on hers unaccustomed demand to try to phrase sensation attempt to seize fleeting impression so delicately that must survive process not expire on pen point be instinctive habit with to appeared motiveless wearisome game have endeavoured in novel that read together during honeymoon to cultivate appreciation of what be fine for have told of favourite author have shuddered have obtained book for one day

must be night when went up to bed having written more than hundred word day yet went up with elation because rightly wrongly felt hundred word to have be admirably said knew that there must be evening in future a there have be in past when after reading page of master prose with delight must go tear up five sheet of own manuscript with disgust knew already though shrank from admitting when happened must never be able to confess to cynthia a have done to turquand because cynthia must find absurd fortnight be near conclusion looked forward with eagerness to return to england must plunge into work must be near hawthorn have friend to come to see neither of pair regretted step that have taken loved other honeymoon be trying institution viewed a whole presently where sat turned put question to about projected book intention be praiseworthy be good girl having married author understood that be incumbent on to take interest in work though have fancied once twice that perhaps must have be nicer if like stock jobber have preferred not to discus business at home papa have never cared to do so knew discussing author business be not so simple a have assumed there seemed to be such mass of tedious detail really did matter when do think will be finished said in nine month hope if stick to so long a nine month exclaimed with surprise why have read let see two three new one of mr st julian

happily retain conscience be almost different plot from what be when began to think be better end well be better thing koh noor tell about suggested complied enthusiastically be being very sympathetic felt with perfect momentary content how jolly be to have lovely wife talk over thing with just what have pictured must be more exciting if kept that mystery till third volume said at end of five

that wrestle with loathes for being too weak to put aside see see be chiefly sensible that pleasure have vanished that note of interest in voice have died however repeated suggestion to be literary critic must be prepared to maintain view think must be much duller than if have surprise declared did not argue did not attempt to demonstrate that suggestion amounted to proposing that must write quite story than one be talking about felt hopelessly that argument must be waste of time perhaps be right said one doe what one can must say 'what one will ' dear can be done whichever way like there be only one way possible to assure for once 'the wrong way ' be more difficult that think be wrong way said cynthia with gentle firmness looked at moment incredulously good lord said let know something about own business want to pose on strength of solitary novel be not arrogant let know something at event more than heaven above novelist devotes life to trying to learn technique of art want three lifetime to acquire mr jones who be solicitor mr smith shoe manufacturer little miss pink of putney who know first law of fiction who be even aware there be law to know be prepared to tell how book must be written be not miss pink of putney said if be know whether like book whether 'like ' echoed to 'like ' to 'criticise ' men be paid to criticise book when can do be thought to be worth payment editor who exactly bubble over with generosity sign cheque for review pretend to teach mr smith how to make shoe have sense enough to understand that know way better than do people think that can teach painter how to compose picture that can give musician lesson in counterpoint why on earth must imagine be competent to instruct novelist be absurd comparison be far fetched said painter musician know have to study be entitled to consideration due to certain amount of money sunk eh be really there be thousand upon thousand of family in upper middle class of england to whom fiction will never be art because novelist have be to academy paid fee a matter of fact be only in artistic professional circle that novelist in england be regarded with other feeling than good humoured contempt unless be publicly known to be making large income commercial majority smile at have shibboleth be sure be familiar to ca improve mind by reading novel be persuaded be true have heard ever since be child in family where artist professional man of kind have ever let in little light ca improve mind by reading novel be one of stock phrase of middle class english philistia ask if improve mind by looking at picture in national gallery even at academy know be essential that must answer 'certainly ask how do be 'done ' of course really improve mind way because before contemplation of art in form can be anything more than vague amusement very much higher standard of education than have reached be necessary only have learnt to pretend about picture be odd thing perhaps natural one author of sort of book that be impressed by scientist brain worker of description literary not talk think of novelist with respect while people find beneath there be silence in stared again at sea irritation subsiding occurred to that might have expressed opinion le freely considering that philistia be wife birthplace be beginning to excuse when interrupted let discus more humphrey said in grieved voice please be sorry said so much be wrong said kent have vexed be not vexed replied in tone intimated be only hurt cynthia be angry make up turned instantly with touch of hand quick pleased smile set to efface effect of ill humour with entirely successful result a strolled back to hotel side by side felt to be long way from there be even sense of physical remoteness mentally did not seem

turquand have predicted mr walford have obtained very respectable nice looking servant whose only drawback be father in lunatic asylum frequently expressed fear that if be given too much to do might go out of mind on premise ann be so superior general have really proved so difficult to get that thought of hereditary taint have not be allowed to disqualify cynthia confessed to finding little awkward when duty be neglected apart from ann be acquisition author working hour be supposed to be from ten o'clock till seven with interval for luncheon irregular habit of bachelorhood made hard for to accustom to be often agreed that must take leisure in afternoon reseat at desk in alluring hour of lamplight when neighbour child be at rest scale ceased from troubling to neighbour found that be object of considerable curiosity have not lived in suburb hitherto discovered that for man to remain at home day offered much food for conjecture there subsequently in inexplicable manner vocation be ascertained then when cynthia went out people whispered behind window curtain stared of wife family saw good deal at hawthorn at leamington road liking for brother in law did not increase there be air of condescension in mr caesar walford self sufficiency that found highly exasperating bass debut have be fixed during absence for coming season repeated newest compliment paid to by master with languid assurance of artist whose supremacy be already acknowledged by world latest burst of admiration into pincocca have be betrayed have always to be dragged by parent from reluctant lip never
