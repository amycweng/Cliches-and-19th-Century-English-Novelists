afternoon be lost to sight have prosperous voyage throughout trouble in picking up island of sweet dew river lake there in glade of forest in full view of lake saw booth still standing lief men have set up be intact bolt seemingly not drawn not much matter with good within what fresh air sunlight must amend spent better part of six week in about shore then leaving garrison at booth thorwald rest of crew went far wide over land travelling mainly by boat up great river fed lake on west did not return till late in autumn reported to friend that so far a have be forest land extended with timber in of incredible size height increased in density further went country level with mountain to be seen in river be many willow island too shore be white sand firm to walk upon have met with few animal sign of men at thorwald who be unaccustomed to forest country said that must never settle there that must go further north where man might perhaps see where be going stayed out winter where be in spring made preparation to depart sailed east in first place always north of land encountered rough weather off great headland drove on to beach broke ship back gave great deal of work involved long stay while mended there be abundance of timber of good quality be well stocked with tool there be much building to be done before must get at work took best part of summer be away about time of harvest still sailing north being east of mainland country appeared to grow more open tree be sparse must see hill to far west of so presently when there opened out to mouth of great frith thorwald sailed up distance till came to place where there be bluff standing up sheer in water beyond headland broad bay thereabouts standing close inshore berthed ship be able to run out gangway walk from ship to land with party went into country to look about be fine open land with good deal of wood growing on well watered with pasture of fine quality country suit thorwald said will stay here make homestead in a turned out spoke more truly than thought for on way back to ship struck frith nearer to mouth than where anchorage be jumped down cliff to beach in very act to jump thorwald saw something move between two hummock of sand collected men together advanced quietly there behind hummock saw men three hide boat lay at water edge there be three men to thorwald said must rush upon suddenly let of make sure of one man there be twelve men with thorwald counting men who be short very dark with black hair in be feather have bow with thorwald gave chance of using at signal party sprang with cry from behind hummock fell upon three fell at once others took to water be slain there one a went slid out boat scrambling in made off at great pace be soon out of sight behind cliff took hide boat weapon left dead men where lay then went back to ship uneasy thinking what have better do be everybody advice that must seek anchorage further from shore that did setting watch went to bed nothing disturbed until grey hour of morning then watchman called loudly to thorwald thorwald thorwald arm come up thorwald leapt to foot ran out to look water be very smooth still listening intently must hear countless paddle stroke by by in mist water appeared to be moving so many close together be boat so shadowy grey men in out with war wall thorwald cried crew now wide awake obeyed war wall be run up made fast man took spear shield stood behind ready for worst native came within easy shooting range rained shower of arrow at ship did not venture to get at closer quarter held on until have shot arrow then made off with cry icelander looked at other thorwald who be very pale said be man here wounded told then thorwald smiling rather queerly said there slipped in arrow between rail of board shield struck under arm will take out one of declare death wound feel venom working in now see how wisely spoke when said that homestead must be out yonder so will be smaller one than thought to have put up now said lying down upon skin have spread for pull out accursed dart listen to what say will bury there where homestead be to be put up cross over for though be not long christened know that belong to true faith call place crossness in memory of when go home tell people where lie in case of come out be minded to see if anything bore pulling out of dart with great cheerfulness composed for end poison worked swiftly be soon discoloured rambled much in talk towards end have to hold at sunset died everything be done a have ordered dug grave rather than piled cairn about a custom have always be sat up in with weapon thinking that more honourable there be christian among to say prayer over grave made great cross carved rune upon then went back to ship got anchor up being ill disposed to stay there day night passed without attack by daylight rowed out of frith out to sea beat way back to eric booth in wineland found unmolested there remained for autumn winter following then went home to tell eric red lief fate of young thorwald xvii thorbeorn of stockness died of winter sickness winter before thorwald sailed for wineland thore have be very sick too recovered be almost that summer not altogether so for have lost lightness of heart with decision blunt common sense gudrid who have fought a seemed to against fate prevailed be unhappy that must care so little to be with did not know that avoided be so spent most of time at brattalithe where have taken great fancy for thorstan did not tell gudrid did not know what thorstan must have to say to other two be great friend fact of matter be that thore have now got into head that gudrid have cast spell upon thorstan that prediction concerning be le prophecy than gift of magic power found that thorstan must let talk about hard fate by hour together nay more found that thorstan did not at avoid being cast in same lot thorstan indeed be quite open about have so much love in for gudrid said that may say please about to will hear gladly talk evil of sooner than not talk at will never believe will hear name name myself will be enough for so thore grumbled away about trouble thorstan listened to saw gudrid seldom because believed that made uneasy to have there nevertheless prevailed upon thore to bring to brattalithe very often when be there must take off cheerfully to work about estate eric red always made much of even freydis liked well enough be only woman for whom freydis have civil word freydis used to frown upon with arm folded under bosom have soft way said can make men do a want be nothing to see that be made of steel underneath for see that be fool doll one of day will fall in with man worthy of then must like to see pair of at work time said good for gudrid that have child gudrid said be not opinion wish with heart have wait said freydis until have man for mate that made gudrid eye bright must not scorn husband to face said pooh said freydis be not here for long then gudrid turned pale grew very grave know that then why said freydis be common knowledge have have to do with thorberg have second sight be dreadful to gudrid said freydis took easily be woman enough to bear what must bear said one of must die before other hope want to share graf with old man a thore well then suppose have be be to die first do suppose that thore must have left for other girl what do take for not be man enough to have pleasure trust for such be freydis who treated own husband with high hand sent for when wanted freydis spoke of marriage of thorstan gudrid a of appointed thing will suit other said there be good mettle in thorstan gudrid must say nothing to that fate hung heavy upon felt that be killing thore have knife in readiness with to kill not thorstan for knew that have given thorstan heart that death must be more certainly own meantime with dreadful fascination watched doom settling like storm about husband thore only saw now that be better be unconscious of anything impending talked hopefully of what must do when thorwald came home with news of wineland having forgotten dark commerce with thorstan thorstan have not forgotten seemed to be waiting like raven on rock until must be dead gudrid who be fanciful saw in guise silent watchful on rock made patient by certainty be terrible to made old before time be not more than three twenty even now thorstan avoided made matter better worse rather for knew why did felt spotted longed to see felt that be accursed so life drew along for summer autumn then long greenland winter began with dark clinging frozen fog thore seemed to make stand against took to bed from gudrid knew must never rise waited on hand foot lay there watching with aching eye wounded to heart hardly ever spoke seldom asked for anything thorstan used to come up most day to ask how did gudrid knew quite well when be on road must tell thore here be thorstan ericsson coming will not see nay nay not yet be thore

better with gudrid be turning away when said to nay do stop here will need so stood where be little way from bed half dreading half glorying in what be to come thore shut eye seemed to wander in sleep heard talking very fast to counting same thing over over again always failing at certain number thought be counting sheep be salmon in net thorstan watched attentively while gudrid stood in spell presently thorstan got up fetched stool for to sit upon must not look at to thank so time passed in silence broken only by feverish whispering of sick man thought of man be deeply upon woman joy of nearness made heart beat a for thought if there be joy in there be great content sense of peace have not known for long while thought that word from might have broken down peace what need of speech between two thought must live with know thought tell mine without speech at presently thore woke up with start asked what time be be late gudrid said will bring broth maybe will sleep little turned
