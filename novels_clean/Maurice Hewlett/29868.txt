self contained man doubt have noticed how shy at expression chilling at time good in lawyer doubt get idea of large reserve perhaps a well a father for instance bright boy of theirs now may have noticed how little there be between what do think of spartan parent in day oh think mr lancelot can hold own said urquhart will do with mother to help suppose spartan boy differed very much from other kind of boy mostly have time to notice anything be sharp a razor when do eager note must be detected in francis lingen voice almost crow ah have noticed then mother mean mr macartney now there again

disappeared into room so took off to bed surely might have said word have gone off so well mr urquhart have be success really liked very much how judge have taken to how lancelot at first stair stopped in three quarter of mind to go in screw sentence out of feared angry blank of eyeglass trailing up to bed thought that must date crumbling of married estate by ascendency of eyeglass to think only to think that when be engaged to james used to play with to try in eye to hide from well have lancelot darling boy brought to mind that week to night must be orphaned of day dreaded be coming again blank week month followed true to idea of discipline of value of doing thing well for own sake macartney be dry about merit of dinner party when met at breakfast eh oh yes thought went quite reasonably urquhart talked too much thought dear james be nettled really be looked up eyeglass hovered in hand plait il nothing only thought that be hard to please really because think man too vivacious lancelot said to porridge bowl over spoon think be ripping have hit said father 'd rip up anybody lucy piqued upon tender part be provoked into what always avoided if must acrimony at

be afraid of being scored off husbanded sigh poor james to pity james be new experience felt better for be able to afford lighter hand when met at dinner may even be that james have thought time come

through pooh woman yet ever disregarded homage of man must send rose to morrow without card must understand so went on wagner came back to own on occasion after second great adventure lucy have conflict with fate thankfully took gift of god took a final a thing complete in thing most beautiful most touching most honourable to giver recipient revived warmth of feeling time without bitter lee

people to keep hold on gay little dinner party one of hers a told james finished month of high light young pierson couple warrener mr treveer jimmy urquhart eight with faithful francis lingen be left out a concession to james love in dark noticed with quiet amusement how gratified james be be so gratified that did not even remark upon now james little weakness one of let say be that must not resist cutting phrase when thing did not matter therefore reasoned francis lingen absurdly enough did matter that must that anything of sort must matter to james be one more sign to of promise just a weather be one spring be at hand soon must go maying so dined at one table have blaze of daffodil from wycross everybody seemed to talk at once pierson told after dinner that madge thought urquhart ripping a have thought wagner certainly be one to make dinner party go be ridiculous about laurence corbet sacred fox shoot that thing god of heaven what be about beg pardon thought be out of sens must be torn to piece by dog be very good at simulating savagery have favourite trick of dropping suddenly turning on caught mr treveer lady of ardour not tempered by insight agreed with about hunting oh be so right now ca something be done about must little paper be written in vein know not by said urquhart be hunting man see mr treveer held up fan took offence lucy with mabel letter in mind gave guest attention for life of must not see that paid beyond what have for others for dinner joined pierson at side made effort to oust did not flatter by recalling lancelot seemed rather to muse out loud james with coat tail to fire be quite at ease when urquhart offered to drive down to westgate for half term mentioned be james who said capital will be jolly for must come must child be must come motor in march must die besides added a know have to be at brighton that sunday have known have known also that brighton be excuse one of bogy kept locked in cupboard be james ennui when lancelot be

have qualm odd that visit of eros must second time be succeeded by motor jaunt to go motoring again with mr urquhart oh owned that be absurd james did not conceal sarcasm fear fate too much quoted at pleaded with darling said be immensely complacent over suppose be sign of old age after why must go by train in own car if come to firstly said james through eyeglass because urquhart asks to go in terror destroyeth in noonday compared to ours secondly because if want must rather like to go to brighton in mine oh said then mind motoring in march not in closed car said james not to brighton acted a extinguisher of warmer feeling let urquhart do worst then chapter ix sundry romantic episode little cloud of witness assembled at will like seagull out of blue inane must come about in after year madly exhilarating rush to westgate for instance on keen march morning sudden question of hers to urquhart what made think of asking laconic answer given without turn of head because knew must like did before know be january there be one connected with be going alone up to schoolhouse flush of pleasure when lancelot said oh say did bring down good then will go immediately see car perhaps be new one must afford to recall after long interval have have roaring day over place a lancelot said afterwards to friend then there have be parting with urquhart in dark at open door of queendon court be going to stop dear remembered being amused with be even coming in be not good bye enjoyed oh immensely be what like have said pushed off a own phrase went atop of that return to james to nothingness for nothing happened except that have be in good temper throughout may easily have be because have be in one herself until easter holiday when have be very cross indeed poor james to get to begin to understand lancelot bluntness intensity passion for something other did seem hopeless be at wycross on urgent entreaty james be bored at wycross sometimes thought because loved so much jealousy man wife ought to devote must love nothing husband have spent day at golf course not coming home to lunch urquhart be asked for sunday on lancelot account must come said so at least then on saturday when must have be there james suddenly kissed in garden of course in dark have known that be in house yet have contracted habit of having tea at club house talking on till dark did that a believed because always read to lancelot in evening gave up holiday entirely to well lancelot that afternoon have be otherwise engaged with friend of neighbour have cried off on score of seeing something of father at lancelot have winked james be not in to tea at six sign of yielded to liquid calling of thrush in thickening lilac have gone out there stayed till be dark in favourite place circular garden of contriving with pond golden privet hedge so arranged a to throw yellow reflection in water standing there grew perfectly dark deeply softly dark night have come down warm wet like manifold blue black gauze heard quick light step heart hammered did not move came behind clasped held close oh have come wondered oh how sweet how sweet then love have be said have be kissed in moment be gone have stayed on motionless enthralled by beauty of act when have withdrawn at last have tiptoed to house saw lamp on table reading spectator before wood fire recalling that remembered happy little breath of laughter have caught if be so perfectly sweet beautiful must be most comic thing in world have said to herself telegram from jimmy urquhart came that night just before dinner arriving to morrow say ten thirty for hour so urquhart be sent from st james street lancelot have said stout fellow james took quite well remembered feeling of annoyance how clearly foresaw interrupted reverie hampered sunday also how easily have falsified prevision there have be animated morning of garden inspection in course of have shown with softly fluttering heart perhaps enhanced colour hedged oval of last night romance pony race game of single cricket in paddock lancelot badly beaten lunch great debate with james about aeroplane wherein lancelot showed bitter unscrupulous adversary of parent finally trial of new car engine of destruction such a lancelot have never dreamed of be admittedly too high powered for england be across county in about minute then have departed in kind of thunderstorm of own making lancelot preternaturally moved said to mother say mamma what man eh lightly be wonderful lancelot with snort man ten rather small men easily james poor james saw nothing kissable in that have be till may of year that lucy began to think about urquhart rather be in may that discovered to be thinking about mabel assisted there mabel be in cadogan square for season sister saw much of other now happened that one day mabel have seen lucy with urquhart walking down bond street at noon thereabouts have passed by on other side with more than wave of hand be all much simpler than looked really because lucy have be to james office be in cork street coming away have met jimmy urquhart in burlington garden have strolled on with be telling that have be waterplaning on chichester harbour be getting rather bitten with whole business of flight be too old know be still as enough to take risk think will get ticket have said what ticket pilot ticket might call expect be too old have said then how old be by way told call forty two exactly james age exactly ten year older than yes too old think must have laughed be certain will appeal to then have told first time saw man flying assure must have shed tear remembered that be out of power odd thing what be gravitation to to gravitation commonplace whereby walk world never mind there be that young man breaking law of planet well be miracle tell might have wept then said to myself man will do perish then have done have not be going to have suddenly said please quick look at remembered suffusion on burnt face oh will do wish to know why because mean because must like if obeyed said gravely ca know that yes do like assume that lucy said may do like because be such a be if obeyed in must cease to be such a be become such a be not never have be might like more might not be too much of risk ca afford have said that be absurd have thought so mabel came to for lunch rallied saw dear must spoil sport right might do much worse be very much alive anyhow doe wear then lucy be hurt oh mabel be horrid know hate to talk like mabel stood rebuked be beastly of know never must stand eyeglass be what call anti social in novel really might a well live in crystal palace then held out hand lucy took after hesitation mabel be irrepressible almost immediately have jumped into fray again with be going to place in hampshire be then lucy have flushed mabel have given queer look be right presently said asked know ca hear that vera nugent be to be hostess rather liked though of course can never tell how such copious conversation will wear think stopped talking for single moment laurence thought be going mad make broody know like hen rub ear say wattle be inflamed be day such day really doe matter day be that mabel drifted into subject of what called james romance did james have james where be standing now lucy whose feeling upon subject be more complicated than have be at first be not very communicative owned there have be repetition mabel who be desperately quick to notice judged that be mildly bored see said see be cried lucy yes indeed mabel said again see lucy who certainly did see be silent then mabel with appalling candour said suppose must have out with if be afraid to lucy be able to cope with kind of thing nothing must induce to do must be able to lift head up if did must not only be well horrible must be very cruel a well must feel brute on mabel shrug be stung into attack of own may say to know that must bring to such point woman must do who respected mabel have worst of in centre by flanking movement recovered most of ground became very vague said a if to herself after know may be mistaken perhaps le say better mistaken le say be grey eye took intense direction please tell what mean dear do think be out of sens do really think have imagined said mabel quickly visibly disturbed of course really know what meant be too confusing for simple people like let talk about something else lucy to whom matter be distasteful agreed thought persisted mistaken le say chapter x at world edge be after queer look after too conscious blush that began to envisage state of affair be going to martley thicket for whitsuntide be old engagement comparatively old that be did want to go now knew that did well how much did want to go ought to want have happened question thronged when once have opened window what did matter to whether urquhart qualified a aviator not what have made ask not to do how have allowed to say assume that like short dialogue stared at in red letter upon dark assume that like may assume do read packed little sentence over over studied with care honestly nothing jarred there be harm did feel tarnish upon yet be looking forward to martley thicket with livelier blood than have felt since easter when james have kissed in shrouded garden livelier blood hazarding looking glass thought that must detect livelier iris too what have happened well of course answer to question be involved in how much be to assume how much did urquhart like hoped against conviction that might have answered question before met again must probably be at martley just now stoutly bearing disapproval be doubtless at byfleet elsewhere risking neck answered question possibly arising out of by shrewd smile of course disapprove know that shiver know be perfectly right may be sure meeting at martley must at very least be extremely interesting left there for moment having once begun to pay attention to such matter a pursued research in out of season be busy time of year james always laid great stress on what called duty of station must edge up crowded stairway behind stand at side in hot humming room where head spun with effort not to hear what other people be saying so much more important always than what partner be james height eyeglass seemed to give impartial air at dreadful ceremony behind glass disk must afford to be impertinent be certainly rude enough to be under secretary without shining buckler of soul must have be simply nobody with be demi god here then under very shadow of immortality lucy pursued research what of romantic hidden eponymous james where did stand now in regard since easter at wycross james have not be veiled eros possibility be all there be not garden god by mean genius of spring january onslow square have not frozen current february opera house have heightened passion at moment might resume devotional habit even here in carlton house terrace what then well be odd ought to have produced state of tension very trying to nerve well have that be at very party in carlton house terrace with band braying under stair fat lord shouting in ear secret soul be trembling on brink be finding out to half rueful dismay be only half that be prepared to be touched prepared to be greatly impressed not prepared to be thrilled a have be if james must kiss again be prepared in fact to present a statesman do when write to sovereign grateful humble duty more in vain band brayed in vain lord j crimson by ear roared about weather in west of ireland lucy soul be peering over edge of old world into stretch of misty new one be bad enough occupied through busy night day there be more disturbing matter to come stirred up to cloud mind by mabel unwonted discretion mabel have be more than discreet have be frightened pushing out into stream of new surmise have suddenly faltered hooked at quay lucy be at first merely curious have doubt certainly fear what have be matter with mabel when hinted that perhaps after james have never done anything what must mabel know guess suspect lucy owned to herself candidly james be incomprehensible after thirteen year be fourteen suddenly with warning symptom to plunge into such devotion a never before when everything have be new only engaged men be like when be engaged be certain of one leave chance james even a engaged man have always be certain have taken everything else for granted remembered how sister not only mabel critical agnes now mr riddell in north have discussed found too cocksure to be quite gallant kissed of course have kissed good heaven yes not a have that night at opera darling darling now james have called darling a often a please never until then darling there be world of difference anybody can see then after beautiful thrilling deeply touching episode moment after there be old indifferent slightly bored james with screwed eye disk not hint not ripple not remains of flush be most bewildering most baffling jig saw of business have ever heard of must have said that be two quite separate people might have said mabel must have said at once that james have have nothing to do with have said so discovery stabbed lucy in eye like flash of lightning left blind quivering with swim of red before hurt vision be why mabel have be frightened now lucy be frightened francis lingen absurd mr urquhart ah be quite thing grew hot grew quite cold suddenly began to sob oh not that flood of tossing thought came rioting racing in flinging crest of foam like white beaten water for time be swept about weed in fury of storm be lost effortless at death threshold awoke from nightmare walked about reason returned be nonsense unwholesome nonsense why first time be in library with james francis lingen second visit to house why when be at opera have be at peltry with mabels a for wycross have wired from st james in afternoon come on next day absurd thank god for poor francis lingen must afford to laugh at francis lingen be a capable of kissing duchess of westbury at whose horrible party have be other night a felt very safe enormously relieved so much so that must afford reflection that if hardihood have be be wanting jimmy urquhart must have have plenty to spare oh yes indeed thank god again be gentleman if ever there be one nobody gentleman must afford to be so simple in dealing having worked out felt that foot at least be on solid ground spirit of adventure be renewed in rather unfortunate contretemps provoked before knew where be be up to neck a urquhart must have said in turbid stream francis lingen elegant unfortunate be certainly responsible if must call one so tentative clinging responsible for anything have proposed flower show to have be a earnest gardener early in morning by herself with note book did not want to go with at moreover have appointment to meet james at wedding affair in queen gate however being ridiculously amiable where pale haired hectic be concerned go did sat about at considerable length have only cared to look at sweet pea passion of hour urged chair upon that might better do what really liked look at talk about so did read poem made great play with tenderness dependence upon judgment cross with world pleaded for tea ordered did not come then hunted for motor finally found for arrived late at queen gate eyeglass glared in horror james indeed be very cross what chance victim of neighbourhood may have endured be not to be known so far a lucy must see did not open mouth once while be there refused nourishment with angry gleam seemed wholly bent upon making self conscious uncomfortable finally indignant upon goodly foundation reared mountain of affront made monument of matter of fact impassivity during drive home arm be folded stared out of window thought once heard humming air did smoke a certainly must have done have relation be easy kept at distance not aggressively lucy be by time very much annoyed apology have be frozen at front by angry glare have intention now of renewing did care to justify a might have done by pointing out that while be hour late be probably quarter of hour too early must have be safe venture for fussiness over appointment tendency to be beforehand with be quite well known to kept best face must upon miserable affair be determined that must force crisis at home come might arrived at onslow square james strode into library shut door behind when crewdson be disposed of on numerous affair lucy followed lord turned stared waited for to speak lucy said think that must be sorry that have treated so feel very much must ask how justify james did best to easy calm apology must be in air must have looked for one hour so ago must have have said if have given time stared out of countenance moment came in anger before have even heard be not nice thing to face james turned pale used most incisive tone be ready to hear explanation perhaps have better say that know lucy showed angry eye if know there be need for to trouble with must also know that be easy to get away from great crowd in minute seemed not to hear have whip in waiting nothing must have kept from use of think must trouble rather think must be relieved by hearing from where crowd be of be one two indeed discovered that be white with rage though have never seen so before what do mean james said know that be at flower show be there with lingen yes said lucy be indeed why must be have told before what view be about intend to repeat at present think must be mad said lucy do mean to tell that object to francis lingen to extent to extent of scene a faced from height do mean that then said out of herself be insulting think can intend to do must like to say also that of men in world be last person to be jealous suspicious of anybody where be concerned have meant to say that when saw that took a commonplace of marital ethic determined to go further still took in fact just so seemed to what wife must say to indignant husband beg pardon said quite follow agree with must be last person beg to point out to must also be first person will go on to add if will excuse must be only person person at said lucy have right reason to suspect of anything to be jealous of of acquaintance did understand suppose because be too angry what meant to remember be how much how very much be bound to believe in now of time in life here then be psyche with lamp in hand here be lucy on limit of world unknown here stood at foot tufted grass field herb dusty homely friendly thing knew beyond beyond cliff edge be dim league of land sea unknown what lay out there beyond in mist what mountain forest land lay there what quiet island what sounding main be done now james gazed blankly angrily puzzled into face have faintest notion what mean said evidently have not must go on though hated be very surprising can hardly think be serious let remind of opera of walkuere gave mind to explored past so entirely failed to understand that looked rather foolish remember that be there then have flash of light shed on god know remember also lingen be in box oh lingen be mad on do not remember that be there before lingen yes do remember stood poor fool revealed lucy voice rang clear very well if be that memory brings have nothing more to say left swiftly went upstairs in possession of astounding truth rapt with in whirlwind of wonder that must do more than clutch to bosom a flew sent out word that be not coming down to dinner locked in with truth to make what must of chapter xi anteros macartney be fool in own world where perfectly clear idea of what want to do combined with nonchalant manner of take leave have always carried through intricacy of business if be fool in supposing that precisely same armoury must defend at home there be excuse for lucy have encouraged to suppose when dashed from room at recent moment sat for time with eye fixed upon foolscap presently found reading same sentence over over again without understanding one word in dropped document rose picked out cigar with deliberation attention disproportionate to business cut stabbed lighted cigar stood by mantelpiece smoking gazing out of window have overdone have stretched regime too far there have be snap now just where have failed be with francis lingen perhaps must admit though good have come out of trouble felt reassured about francis lingen because a judged woman get angry in case of kind unless husband have nothing to be angry about felt very world wise shrewd a propounded woman like husband to be jealous especially if be jealous with reason because then say to well anyhow love still have to fall back upon at event capital gave short guffaw resumed cigar lucy be angry obviously because have wasted good jealousy on mere fancy damn have overdone next thing if did look out must be that must give something to be jealous of must calm there must be difficulty in loss of prestige prestige be thing wanted to maintain discipline be jiggered that might do mischief if drove too hard fact be be little too sharp with lucy be dear gentle creature doubt one fell into habit of pushing willing horse must see now perfectly have be put out when arrived at marchants too early be not there then that old fool vane with saw wife at chelsea thing with lingen looked very settled that have put lid on be how be have be too sharp well one must make mistake wondered what have meant about opera why have harped upon that string be there before francis lingen have said well then have be furious with have said know be if be memory brings off went smoked hard lifted hand dropped smartly to mantelpiece be thing man must fathom lucyism quite clear to herself doubt well 'd leave alone more one tried to bottom water le one fished up must make peace with after dinner heard mr macartney be not dining evening have bad headache doe wish to be disturbed received with curt nod accepted simply better to take woman at word trouble must have simmered down by morning whereas if be to go up now one of two thing 'd be angry enough to let batter at door to purpose feel as for pain must let in make fuss in case must feel still more of as ask mr macartney if can do anything have said to smithers be answered think mr macartney be asleep sir hoped be must do world of good morning in breakfast room faced lucy self possessed with guarded eye if must have seen with implied reproach stiffening line of generosity gratified must have touched keenly came to at once put up face be sorry be so cross james immediate feeling say be one of gratification be right have come in to succeeded wave of kindness dropped glass took strongly in arm dearest behaved very badly be truly sorry kissed for moment clung to avoided further kiss yet have kissed a man must have nothing more to say felt due that must add something while yet held a for poor francis know be absurd admit frankly felt shake guessed indignation will believe dear know like owning fool then have looked up still in arm why must be so stupid how can possibly be of people there be again intended to make peace once for dearest ca be more abject for life of have confessed be abounding as please to believe in ask francis lingen to tea for month of day not word from have laughed rather scornfully tried to free kissed again before let go almost
