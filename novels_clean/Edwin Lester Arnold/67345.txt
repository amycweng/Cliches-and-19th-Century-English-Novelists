streamlet running somewhere in void staggered down hell dark pathway for lonely mile then there loomed up from blackness on right hand moldy broken terrace wall loose cracked with fallen coping slab pedestal displaced hideous stony graven monster here there glowering in blackness at who passed below two hundred pace down wall went then came to opening at same moment pale moon shone out full

voice echo of laughter out of blank courtyard depth old man so strange wild struck rusty spur upon bare sounding rib of beast turned rode through portal for one minute held back twas so grim tragic looking be weak shaken with grief fasting unweaponed alone for one minute held back then red flush of anger burned hot upon forehead to think have be so near to fearing tossed back black phrygian lock with angry stride spirit roused by moment weakness strode sternly across threshold down white gravel way twined loose neglected path gleaming wet with night dew brushed by thicket of dead garden thing

country lay outside deep wooded undulating with pastoral meadow in between hanger beyond in open streamlet whose prattle have be heard night before lay spread into broad rushy tarn overgrown with green weed water thing then running on through flat soft meadow of hollow where house be built wound into far distance where joined something that shone in low white light like gleam of broader river be not cheerful morning for have rained much chilly mist hung low still about somber wooded thicket long grass between sleepy rook in nest upon bare treetop be later to wing than usual cawing melancholy from sodden bough a though loth to leave down below nothing sang moved dark black merle fluttering along covert side mavis tuning plaintive uncertain note from off wet fir top when have stared full learned little from outlook donned clothes have borrowed be happy choice fitted like lady glove a laced hooked belted before yellow mirror let into black panel of chamber door must not feel looked goodly fashion for one of make build have not seemed so stalwart so sleek so straight in limb broad in shoulder since be saxon thane then belted on pretty sword round nicely tapering middle ran finger through black eastern lock arranging trimly inside high standing frill took look two into glass then with derisive smile little scornful at secret pleasure fine feather gave went forth surely never did mortal mason build house before deepest densest forest path that ever hunter foot have trodden be simple to maze of curly stair dim passage wooden alley led by tedious way to nothing creaking rotten step beguiled wanderer by sinuous repetition from desolate wing to wing flight to flight time wrestled with labyrinthine maze in struggle to reach latitude knew not sign must see of host not whisper must catch of human voice familiar sound in dusty desolate wilderness impenetrable stagnation hung over empty habitation that crow of distant cock yelp of village cur must have be blessed interruption broke vault like solemn stillness from room to room went opening countless door at random leading into spacious moldy chamber bare tenantless feeling way by damp neglected wall dangerous broken flooring to endless cobwebbed window unbarring wooden casement letting in watery light that only made inner desolation more ghostly conspicuous nothing human must find prospect same one have seen before of damp woodland marshy water meadow out beyond perhaps for hour have adventured thus hopelessly lost in dusty bowel of stupendous building then just a be near despairing of exit meditating leap from casement on to stony terrace below opening one final door might well have be household cupboard for storing of linen raiment there at foot be great main staircase leading by many turn staging to central hall below put with point of sword cross upon outside of cupboard door so might know again if need be then descended have seen coming down tudor step in tudor finery hand upon hilt of long steel rapier perked behind great ruffle curled mustache strong soldier limb squeezed into sweet fitting satin hose sleeve so stern grim so lonely silent in white glimmer of morning shine came from distant lattice painted oriel well might have thought scarcely flesh blood old tudor ancestor of old tudor hall stepped from painter canvas just a be in life come with beatles foot to see what cheer gross descendant made of where have once lived so noisy so jolly down step came into banquet hall empty deserted like else so sauntered to table head where have supped evening before not one trace of humankind have seen since night yet little thing quite startled supper have be cleared away napkin spread plate put out with fruit bread large beaker of good new milk stood by to flank stared hard at simple seeming meal must not comprehend be near sure old man have not set yet if have why be there one plate one place one chair one beaker be meant for what finger have pulled that fruit drawn that milk still warm from source must wait thought strolled off to window down slowly in turn then back again to idly hum favorite tune have sung yesterday at crecy still nothing came stirred then went into hall examined that trophy of weapon tried then unbarred great door went out upon terrace there to dangle satin leg over balustrade during long interval of gloomy speculation not leaf be moving not sign whisper must see of strange old fellow who have brought hitherto now did duty by guest so quaintly at last went back to dining place regarded that mysterious meal with fixed attention now thought be surely spread for if be not then must be master of house may get food how when like guest share be put ready to hand have waited long hour more sun be high surely that learned pedant must not mean to belay courtesy by starving stranger visitor no be certainly affectation to wait longer at worst there must be more where good thing came from being hungry having thus appeased conscience clapped sword upon table fell to work in short space have made light though sufficient meal cleared everything eatable completely from table be better for yet strange solitude began to weigh upon few hour since surely be more have be in busy camp bright with panoply of war active bustling here why white mist seemed creeping through be so damp melancholy tawny mildew of wall seemed settling down upon spirit jove felt by comparison of what have be be already touched with clammy rottenness of place slowly turning into piece of crumbling lumber such a lay about on hand tarnished faded monument to life be bygone oh must not stand house taking cap sword strolled down garden full of pensive thought morose uncaring so out into wood beyond over hill dale long walk set stagnant blood flowing in sleepy vein did tonic good leaving hall where so strange night have be spent strode out strongly over hill dale for mile after mile without thought of where path might lead stalked on day came back in evening yet only thing worthy of note upon round be familiarness of scene certain feeling of old acquaintance with plain valley possessed when have gone to farthest limit of walk at one hilltop stopped looked over wide gently swelling plain of verdure with grassy knoll two in sight wood new wheat field shining emerald in april sunlight while far away long cloud be lying steady over dim shine of distant sea thought to myself surely have seen before yonder knoll standing tall among lesser one why doe appeal so to distant flash of water there among misty woodland few mile to westward of jove must somehow have sworn there have be river there even before saw shine sense within know swell hollow of fair country here yet know not be not saxon glade spread out beneath distant stream swept round such steep a castled mount wherefrom have set out for crecy must not justify that spark of vague remembrance long sat wondered how when in wide life have seen that valley fruitlessly yet fancy did not err though be not for many day knew then after time turned homeward homeward be well be a much thitherward a way knew though indeed marveled a went why foot must turn so naturally back to gloomy mansion peopled only by shadow smell of sad suggestion perhaps mind just then be too inert to seek new road accepted easiest after manner of weak thing a inevitable be a may went back that wet misty afternoon alone with melancholy listlessness through damp dripping wood coppice where dead fern looked red a blood in evening glow be so heedless lost way once twice when at dead front of old house glimmered out of mist ahead early night be setting in that lank dejected garden ruined terrace hundred staring empty window frowning down on grave green courtyard stone seemed more forsaken more mournful looking even than have night before found front door ajar exactly a be left groping about presently discovered tinder steel made light laughed little bitterly to think how much indeed be at home then in bravado mockery unsheathed sword went from room to room in gathering dusk stalking sullen watchful with gleam of light held above head down clammy corridor vault like chamber rapped with hilt on casement panel listening to gloomy echo rumbled down ghoulish palace pricked with rapier point swelling rotting curtain punctured ghostly swinging arras stabbed black shadow in score of dim recess nothing found until in one of sword point struck something soft yielding sank in jove startled twas wondrous like true good stab through flesh bone finger tightened upon pommel sent blade home through yielding unseen something span deep into rotten wall beyond then looked to see what have got faugh twas woman dress left on rusty nail splendid raiment once such a noble girl might wear princess give padded quilted wondrously with yard of stitching down front wherefrom rude hand have torn gold filigree pearl embroidery where wearer heart have beat rough finger have left faded rose still tied there by love knot on strand of amber silk lovely gown once on time doubt now sword have run through through from back to bosom lord how smelled of dead rose must moth shook angrily from weapon left there upon rotten board went on with quest high low far near be there to be found smallest trace of host living mortal at last weary wet oppressed with vast echoing solitude went back to great hall passed untouched litter have made in morning so to banquet place walked up long black table set solemn with double row of empty chair lit lamp stood at top burned up brightly in minute there beneath saw morning meal have be removed supper napkin neatly laid bread wine cheese laid out afresh for one so unexpected be that neat array so quaint so out of keeping with desolate mansion that laughed aloud then paused for down in great vaulty interior of house echo took laughter up lone merriment sounded wicked infernal in soulless corridor well there be supper while be tired hungry must not be balked of though hell be laughing outside in vast empty grate made merry fire with old broken chair jolly roaring blaze curled about mighty iron dog a though glad to warm chilly hearth again went flaming twisting up spacious chimney in right gallant kind then lifted stopper of wine jar finding full of good rhenish vintage set to work to mull fetched steel gorget from trophy in hall poured liquor therein put by blaze to warm to make drink more complete spit apple on rapier point toasted pippin by ember thus making wassail bowl of most superior sort ate drank supped very pleasantly that evening while strong wind whistled among chimney stack rattled with unearthly persistence upon casement opened shut now soft now fiercely score of creaking distant door spluttering rain came down upon fire by sat in quaint finery warming tudor leg by tudor blaze tall spectral thing of garden beyond curtainless window nodded bent before storm loose strand of ivy beat gently upon pane like wet long finger of ghostly vagrant imploring admission water fell with measured beat upon empty courtyard stone from broken gargoyle spout like fall of gently pattering foot strangest sobbing noise came from hollow wainscoting of strange old dwelling place do think feared who have lived so long known so much who four time have seen substantial world dissolve into nothing have awoke to find new earth born from dusty ash of past who have stocked four time void air with loved for whom shadowy field of unknown be so thickly habited to whom teeming material world again be so unpeopled so visionary desolate mocked wild gossip of storm grimly wove infernal whisper of place into thread of fancy hour by hour sat thought thought of rosy picture of past of bright beam of love have seen shine for in maiden eye wild glitter delight of twenty fiery combat joy success sorrow pleasure of wondrous life thus thought thought until wore out even storm went sighing away over distant woodland fire died down to handful of white ash wine pot ran dry empty with last flame in grate then took sword taper leaving care of to morrow to coming sunrise went up solemn staircase threw upon first dim couch in first black chamber met with threw upon bed dressed a be must not sleep a soon a wished instead heavy drowsiness possessed now must dream for minute two then start up listen a distant door be opened to quaint gust that roamed about corridor seemed now then to hold whispered conclave outside door be like child knew to be so restless yet who life near to unknown grows by nature watchful did not seem possible have fathomed mystery there be in gloomy mansion so dozed waked wondered waiting in spite of for something more in deep shadow of rotten bed hanging now speculating upon host why tenanted life forsaken cavern ate drank from ancient crockery have store of moldy finery rusty weapon then idly guessing who have last slept on creaking somber bed why pillow smelled so much of moldiness mildew again listening to wail of expiring wind among chimney overhead dismal sodden drip of water falling somewhere perhaps have amused like hour be a near a might be midnight low white moon be just glimpse over sighing treetop in wilderness outside have be dozing lightly when on sudden soldier ear distinctly caught footfall in passage without starting up upon elbow in black shadow of bed gripped hilt of sword lay along under pillow held breath a slowly door be opened wide before astounded eye tall dark figure entered be done so quietly that beyond first footfall soft click of lifting latch think sound broke heavy stillness between two pause of wind reigned throughout empty house very gently that dusky shadow by portal shut door behind might have be only outer air entered with something in presence cold damp breath of air pervaded room a latch fell back did not fear yet heart set off thumping against rib finger tightened upon fretted hilt of toledo blade a thing came slowly forward from door big tall so far indistinct stalked slowly to bed foot touching post like one who in uncertain light reassures by feel of well known landmark so went round toward latticed window did not stir held breath stared hard at black form that unconscious of presence slowly sauntered to light took form shape in minute be by lattice to stern wondering awe there in pale white moonshine looking down into desolate garden beyond with melancholy steadfastness be figure of tall black spanish gallant in white radiance against ebony setting of room be limned with extraordinary clearness indeed be great silver column now of stenciled brightness against black void beyond must see point detail in dress feature a though be broad daylight be must say have be tall slim man long jointed sparse after manner of nation to night wore something like fashion of time black hose shoe black seeming waistcoat loose outdoor hood above slouch cap white ruffle broad black leather belt with dagger dangling from so much be ordinary about jove face in uncertain twilight be frightful be cadaverous beyond expression tawny mean shadow on be black strong out of dreary parchment mask making lifelessness more deadly by glitter shone two restless sunken eye kept yellow orb turned upon garden then presently put up hand began stroking small pointed beard still seeming lost in thought next stretching out finger hoth what wicked looking talon did seem shape began drawing sign upon mistiness of diamond pane at same time began to mutter there be something quaintly gruesome about disconnected syllable in midnight stillness yet though leaned forward peered listened nothing must learn of what wrote said fascinated forgot to speak act must only regard with dumb wonder outlined figure in moonlight long dead face so dreadfully ashine with life so bewitched be that have vision turned spoken must have made best shift to answer be possible there be tie felt between more than showed upon surface of chance meeting of ours something even a write feel be not yet quite explained though that shadow now know other well instead of speaking presence man spirit from outer space left off scratching on window with shrug of spanish shoulder malediction in guttural bisque turned from window cell walked across room a did so noticed what have be invisible before in left hand canvas bag by shape weight of bag seemed full of money watched a stalked across room watched disappear into shadow then listened with sense alert to click of latch creak of door a left chamber by opposite side to whereat entered illustration kept yellow orb turned upon garden a faint ghostly footstep died away slowly down corridor native sense came back in trice be on foot dressed a have lain down snatching sword cloak in fever of expectation ran over to window looked upon writing be figure figure sum in ancient moorish arabesque long sharp nail mark of hideous midnight mathematician be still penciled clearly on moonlit dew blood be now coursing finely in vein hot eager to see more of grim stranger strode across room stepped out into passage at first seemed that have gone completely for be so still silent white light outside be throwing square of silver brightness from many narrow window on dusty floor there be in moment crossing farthest patch tall silvery in radiance with long slim black leg great ruffle flapping cloak looking most wicked went forward making a little noise a might be seeing ghostly friend now then until when have traversed perhaps that deserted mansion lost where three way divided went plunging tripping forward striving to be a silent a must though why know not making instead at false step noise must have startled even ghostly ear be now well off trail nothing showed answered be black a hell in shadow white a day where moonbeam slanted in from oriel through chilly checker went feeling on by damp old wall worm eaten wainscoting slipping down crumbling stair be a rotten a banister went to dust beneath touch opening sullen oaken door peering down dreary waste within listening prying wondering nowhere must find that shadowy form again followed chase for many minute far into lonely desert wing of old house then paused irresolute what be to do have cloak upon one hand naked rapier be in other light mean of making one vision have gone found now that chase have ended blood began to tread sober measure be dank chilly dismal in black draughty corridor worse still have lost count reckoning of where bed have be though be small matter in house yet somehow felt be well to reach vantage ground of more familiar place wherein to wait morning so a nearly a be possible groped back upon footstep by tedious way empty chamber low in heart angry now stopping to listen to fitful moaning of wind pattering rain spot on grass distant panel creaking in distant chamber half thinking that after have be fool cozened by sleepy fancy so went back dejected dispirited until presently came to gloomy arch in long corridor tapestried across with heavy hanging unthinkingly lifted there there a curtain parted thirty pace off bright moonlit doorway gently opened into light stepped that same black browed foreigner again did what other must have done though be not valiant stepped back against niche drew tapestry fold about so hidden waited down sauntered leisurely straight for hiding place a came there be full time to note wrinkle furrow on sullen ashy face hoth might have be decent gentleman by daylight in nightshine looked more like week dead corpse than aught else with eye glued to twinkling eye of bated breath irresolute finger hard set upon pommel hilt waited came on without pause sign to show knew that be watched a crossed last patch of light saw bag of gold be gone hand have carried be wrapped in bloody handkerchief minute be not yard apart what good be valor there thought what good be weapon courage against malignity of such infernal shadow held back while passed in minute be too late to stop yet must follow half ashamed of moment weakness with courage budding up again started from hiding place brandishing rapier cloak curled on other arm a though went to meet famous fencer ran after spaniard now heard with one swift look over shoulder startled guttural cry set off down passage from light to light flashed shadow to shadow hot after courage rampant now again bitterness disappointment of last few day nerving heart until felt must exchange thrust two with black arch fiend twas brief chase at bottom of corridor stood solid oak partition have safe enough saw come to black barrier hesitate whereon shouted fiercely leaped forward in minute be there where have be corridor be empty paneled partition be doorless unmoved not sound broke stillness of old house save own angry cry that hollow echo be bandying about from ghostly room to room corridor to empty corridor chapter xx bright dazzle of sunshine roused with following sunrise rubbed sleepy lid sat up vaguely gazing round upon tarnished hanging immovable white face of picture on wall dusty floor whereon in grayness of countless year be marked just outline of last night foot nothing more however be truly lovely morning moved by subtle tonic come with sunshine felt brighter more confident having dressed went down old staircase again to breakfast must certainly be ready unbarring a passed casement setting wide great hall door that cool breath of spring morning might sweep away mustiness of old house even humming snatch of old camp song learned in picardy to myself while thus gained dining hall in good spirit saw a have be expected new meal set with modest food drink for alone other sign trace of human presence sat ate vowing a did so riddle have gone far enough unanswered before shiny sparkling world outside tear laughter like young maid face be few hour older must know who be host who served thus persistent invisible what might be service be looked to to pay for such quaint entertainment therefore a soon a meal be done belted on sword straightened down finery have lost crease sat extremely well smoothing thick mass of black eastern hair under velvet tudor cap sallied forth there be nothing new about garden save sunshine having intently regarded broad terraced mullioned front of house without learning one single atom more than knew before resolved to force way round to rear if be possible be not so easy on one hand be thicket of shrub bramble laced into dense impenetrable barrier on other great yew hedge in solemn rank with vast mass of ivy holly forbidding passage nothing daunted walked down to yew peering about soon perceived tangled pathway leading into fastness be narrow little way begrudgingly left between sullen hedge thick grown with dank weed below arched over by neglected growth so that sun must not shine into dusky alley path be wet chilly still well pushed on now to right now to left amid tangle of one of old maze that gardener love to grow until only tall smokeless chimney stack of deserted house shone red under sunshine over bough top in distance then paused be so strangely quiet so lonesome have be solitary so long seemed doubtful whether one be alive in world why surely be thinking there be human being at least about shadow haunted spot be idle to seek for must give up just a be meditating that have half turned to go yet be standing irresolute jove right from air in front of right out from black bosom of shadowy yew ivy there burst wild elfin strain of laughter merry bubbling peal ringing cascade of fairy merriment sparkling avalanche of disembodied mirth like sweet essence permeated on instant that gloomy place thrilled down damp alley shook thousand colored drop of dew from bent leaf vibrated in misty prismatic sunshine up above then be gone leaving rooted to ground with suddenness of half delighted half amazed only for moment then leaped forward saw turning found at bottom of gap plunged headlong through be pretty scene staggered into in front of spread open center of maze grassy space twenty pace about lying clear to sunshine falling warm strong upon in midst of fair opening shut off from wind outer barrenness have once be fountain with basin though jet played longer yet white marble pool below stained golden green with moss weather held from brim to brim little lake of sparkling water about fountain bright in decay green fern be unwinding while great clump of gold narcissus hung trembling over own reflection in broken basin overhead there be blossoming almond tree cloud of pale pink bud wherefrom constant cheerful hum of bee came forth pale rain of petal fell on to ground beneath tinted like rosy snow other way existed in out of delightful circle save where have entered little path ran here there among grass industrious love have marked out with pretty country flower pale primrose damp cool among shadow

whiteness from quill to fringe saving last outer row of gorgeous eye shone in gold purple amethyst refulgent in spotless field magnificent bird indeed fully wotting of that kneeling maid be dipping water for in rosy palm great bird be perched upon marble rim dropping ivory beak into sweet chalice lifting lovely throttle flashing coronet to sky ever anon while thrill of girl light laughter echoed about place almond blossom showered down on bee hummed sweet incense of spring be drawn from warm budding earth flower glittered sun shone sky be blue a intruder stood silent surprised before dainty picture illustration great bird be dropping ivory beak into sweet chalice in moment girl looked up saw in amber suit ruffle rapier cap standing there against black framing of maze then did a have done stared rubbed eye stared again in moment seemed to understand be something more than fancy whereat with little scream of fear sprang to foot crossing kerchief closer on bosom pulled down sleeve backed off toward almond tree have that comely apparition fairly at bay after so many hour without company did not feel mind to let go too easily whether proved fay fairy nymph naad just plain country flesh
