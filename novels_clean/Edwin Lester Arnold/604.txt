previous guide be hull down over horizon be clean out of reckoning in crowd by way of reply little lady light a elf took by fingertip gleefully skipping forward piloted through maze of city until came out into great square fronting on palace rose beyond like white chalk cliff in dull light not taper showed anywhere round circumference mysterious kind of radiance like sea phosphorescence beamed from palace porch be in such deathlike silence that nail in ammunition boot made unpleasant clanking a struck on marble pavement yet by uncertain starlight saw to surprise whole square be thronged with martian facing towards porch a still graven image a voiceless for once a though have indeed be marble be strange to see sitting there in twilight waiting for knew not what friend voice at elbow almost startled a said in whisper princess know be in crowd desire to go up upon step near where will be who brought message asked gazing vaguely round for none have spoken to for hour more one said companion gently pushing up open way towards palace step left clear by sitting martian came direct from to minute how persisted nay said girl if stop to talk like will not be placed before come thus throw whole year knowledge out so bottling speculation allowed to be led up first flight of worn white step to where on terrace between next flight leading directly to palace portico be flat having circle about twenty foot across inlaid upon marble with darker coloured block inside circle a sat down close by in twilight showed circle then final one in whose inmost middle stood tall iron tripod something atop of covered by cloth round outer circle be magic symbol started a recognised meaning of of within again inner circle held what looked like representation of planet ending a have said in dished hollow made by countless dancer foot solitary tripod back again glanced towards square where great concourse ten thousand of perhaps be sitting mute silent in deepening shadow then back to magic circle till silence expectancy of strange scene began to posse shadow down below star dusted heaven above not figure moving when suddenly something like long drawn sigh came from lip of expectant multitude be aware eye have suddenly turned back to palace porch where a looked figure wrapped in pale blue robe appeared stood for minute then stole down step with eagerness in movement holding spellbound have seen many splendid pageant many sight of might be talk of lifetime somehow nothing ever so engrossing so thrilling a ghostly figure in flowing robe stealing across piazza in starlight silence princess of broken kingdom priestess of forgotten faith coming to station to perform jugglery of knew not even meaning be versatile friend heru with quick incisive step whole frame ambent for time with fervour of mission came swiftly down to within dozen yard of where stood heru indeed not same princess a in morning inspired priestess rather slim body wrapped in blue quivering with emotion face ashine with delphic fire hair loose foot bare until at last when a stood within limit of magic circle white hand upon breast eye flashing like planet in starshine looked so ghostly unreal felt for minute be dreaming then began strange weird dance amongst imagery of ring over earth planet be beginning to throw haze of light at first be hardly more than walk slow procession round twin circumference of centred tripod soon increased to extraordinary graceful measure cadenced step without music sound that riveted eye to dancer presently saw mystic twinkling foot of hers a dance became swifter be performing measured round amongst planet sign spelling out something knew not what with quick light touch amongst zodiac figure dancing out soundless invocation of kind a dumb man might spell message by touching letter quicker quicker for minute after minute grew dance swifter swifter swing of light blue drapery a priestess with eager face staring eye swung panting round upon orbit redder redder over city top rose circumference of earth seemed to silent multitude be breathing heavily a watched that giddy dance felt own sens seemed to be winding up upon revolving figure a thread wind on spindle when will stop whispered to friend under breath when earth star rest in roof niche of temple be climbing answered back then on tripod be globe of water in will see destiny of year will tell whiter water stay better for never varies from white must not talk see be stopping a looked back dance be certainly ebbing now with such smoothly decreasing undulation heart began to beat calmer in response there be minute two of such slow cessation then to say stopped be too gross description motion rather died away from priestess grounded a smoothly a ship ground in fine weather on sandy bank there be at last crouched behind tripod one corner of cloth covering grasped in hand eye fixed on shining round just poised upon distant run keenly girl watched slide into zenith then cloth be snatched from tripod top a fell uncovered beautiful perfect globe of clear white glass foot so in diameter obviously filled with thinnest most limpid water imaginable at first seemed to who stood near to priestess of mar with beaming sphere directly between newly risen world that smooth flawless face be absolutely devoid of sign colouring then a distant planet became stronger in magnifying martian air eye better accustomed to sudden nucleus of brilliancy delicate infinitely lovely network of colour came upon be like radiant prism sometimes flush surface of bubble more than aught else for time a watched that mosaic of yellow purple creep softly to fro upon globe seemed slowly took form meaning minute two have certainly congealed into settled plan then a stared wondered burst upon in minute be looking upon picture faithful in detail of world stood on ruddy forest sapphire sea broad narrow one white peaked mountain unnumbered island being mapped out with startling clearness for spell upon beaming orb then strange thing happened heru who have be crouching in tremulous heap by tripod rose stealthily passed hand few time across sphere colour picture vanished at touch like breath from mirror again be clear pellucid now said companion now listen for heru read destiny whiter globe stay better for then felt hand tighten on mine with startled grasp a word died away upon lip even a girl spoke sphere have be beaming in centre of silent square like mighty white jewel began to flush with angry red redder redder grew gleam fiery glow seemed curdling in interior of round a though be filled with flame redder redder until princess staring into seemed turned against jet black night behind into form of molten metal spasm of terror passed across a stared limb stiffened frightened hand be clutched in front stood cowering under great crimson nucleus like one bereft of power life lost to sense that of agony not syllable came from lip not movement stirred body only that dumb stupid stare of horror at something saw in globe what must do must not sit see soul come out at frightened eye not martian moved finger to rescue red shine gleamed on empty face tier above tier flung broad flush over endless rank of open mouthed spectator then back looked to heru winsome little lady for whom will remember have already more than passing fancy saw with thrill of emotion that while still kept eye on flaming globe like one in horrible dream hand be slowly very slowly rising in supplication to be not vanity there be mistaking direction of silent imploring appeal not man of countryman moved not even black hath there be not sound in world seemed noisy clatter of own shoenails on marble flag in great red eye of unholy globe martian glimmered like picture multitude under red cliff of ruined palace glared round at with contempt for minute then sprang forward snatched princess up be like pulling flower up by root be stiff stark when lay hold of when tore from magic ground suddenly gave piercing shriek fainted in arm then a turned upon heel with upon breast foot caught upon cloth still wound about tripod of sphere over went that implement of thousand year of sorcery out went red fire little cared princess be safe up palace step amidst low wailing hum of consternation from recovering martian bore that bundle of limp senseless loveliness up into pale shine of own porch there laying down upon couch watched recover presently amongst woman with varied assortment of emotion tingling in vein chapter vi beyond first flutter of surprise martian have shown interest in abrupt termination of year divination melted away trifle more silently perhaps than usual when shattered magic globe with invariable indifference having handed reviving heru over to woman who led away apparently already half forgetful of thing have just happened be left alone on palace step not even beside only shadow of passerby now then to break solitude whereon great loneliness took hold upon pacing to fro along ancient terrace with bent head folded arm bewailed fate to fro walked heedless melancholy thinking of old world be so far near world so distant from in everything making life worth living thinking a strode gloomily here there how gladly must exchange poor puppet mockery of town dwelt in for sight of comrade corner in poorest wine shop salon in new

when be about furlong apart great beast seemed to change course mayhap took wreckage on floated for outlying shoal something on must rest space in long swim be a may beast came hurtling down on lip deep in wave mighty brown head with pricked ear flicked water from now then small bright eye set far back wide palmated antler on mighty forehead like dead branch of tree what that martian mountain elk have hoped for can only be guessed what met with be tangle of floating finery carrying numbed traveller on with snort of disappointment turned again be poor chance better than nothing a turned tried to throw strand of silk have unwound from sodden mass over branching tine quick a thought beast twisted head aside tossed antler so that try be fruitless be to lose only chance of shore with strength hurled upon missing clutch again by hair breadth going headlong into salt furrow chest be turning up happily kept hold of web for great elk then turned back passing between ruck of stuff getting thereby silk under chin a came gasping to top once more round came that dainty wreckage over back clutched sooner than take to tell be towing to shore a perhaps one be ever towed before big beast dragged ruck like withered weed behind bellowing time with voice made hill echo round then when got foot upon willow rose dripping mountainous very cliff of black hide limb against night shine with single sweep of antler tore webbing from who lay prone breathless in mud thinking be enemy hurled limp bundle on beach then having pounded with cloven foot into formless shred bellowed again victoriously went off into darkness of forest chapter ix landed stiff enough a will guess pleased to be on shore again be melancholy neighbourhood of low island overgrown with rank grass bush salt water encircling inside sandy dune hummock with willow pool gleaming ghostly in retreating daylight while beyond rose black boss of what looked like forest thither made way plunging uncomfortably through willow tripping over blackened branch lying just below surface quivered like snake a evening breeze ruffled surface until ground hardened under foot presently be standing hungry faint safe on dry land again forest be so close to sea one must not advance without entering once within dark arcade way looked equally gloomy hopeless struggled through tangle night made more more impenetrable minute until presently must go further where dense canopy of tree overhead gave out for minute on edge of swampy hollow determined to wait for daylight never be there more wet weary traveller one more desperately lonely than who wrapped up in miserable insufficiency of wet rag without fire supper crept amongst exposed root of tree growing out of bank prepared to hope grimly for morning round round meanwhile be drawn close screen of night till clearing in front be blotted out only tree top black a rugged hill one behind other stood out against heavy purple of circlet of sky above a evening deepened quaintest noise began on hand noise so strange bewildering that a cowered down with teeth chattering stared hard into impenetrable must be likened to nothing cry of soul of dead thing since beginning never be there such infernal chorus a played up martian star down there in front where hummock grass be growing beast squeaked continuously till shouted at then stopped minute began again in entirely note away on hill two rival monster be calling to other in tone so hollow seemed a listened to penetrate through echo out of heart again far overhead gigantic bat be flitting shadow of wing dimming dozen universe at once cry to other in shrill tone rent air like tearing silk a listened to vampire discussing infernal love under star from branch right overhead broke deathly howl from throat of wandering forest cat that everything else be hushed for moment about myriad insect be making night giddy with ghostly fire while underground from labyrinth of matted root came quaint sound of rustling snake forest pig lesser thing dig scratch growl yet be desperately sleepy sword hung heavy a lead at side eyelid drooped so at last dozed uneasily for hour two then on sudden came wide awake with shock night be quieter now away in forest depth strange noise still arose close at hand be strange hush like hush of expectation listening wonderingly be aware of slow heavy footstep coming up from river now two three step together then pause then step two a bent towards approaching thing staring into darkness strained sens be conscious of approach a like a must be coming from behind on came making very ground quake with weight till judged that be about on edge of clearing two vast rat like shadow a big a elephant bringing most intolerable smell of sour slime with there on edge of amphitheatre for first time appeared to become aware of other presence footstep stopped dead must hear water dripping from fur of giant brute amongst shadow deep breathing of one nearest scanty ten pace off not sound in stillness minute after minute passed yet neither moved half hour grew to full hour that hour lengthened amid keenest tension till ear ached with listening eye be sore with straining into blackness at last began to wonder whether earth shaking beast have not be evil dream be just venturing to stretch out cramped leg rally upon cowardice when without warning at elbow rose most ear piercing scream of rage that ever came from living throat there be sweeping rush in darkness must feel not see with shock two gladiator met in midst of arena over over went screaming struggling slipping plunging must hear tearing at other sharp cry of pain first one then gave a claw tooth got home time though ground be quaking under struggle air full of horrible uproar not thing be to be seen did not even know what manner of beast be who rocked rolled tore at other throat heard teeth snapping fierce breath in pause of struggle must wait in huddle amongst root until be over to fro went now at far side of dark clearing now so close that hot drop of blood from jaw fell on face like rain in darkness seemed a though fight must never end presently there be more of worrying in le of snapping be clear one other have have enough a marked black shadow came gasping struggling towards there be sudden sharp cry desperate final tussle before strong tree snapped bush be flattened out like grass not twenty yard away then for minute be silent one of have killed a sat rooted to spot be forced to listen while enemy tore up ate many banquet have be at never uglier one than sat in darkness while unknown thing at foot ripped flesh from half dead rival in strip across damp night wind came reek of abominable feast reek of blood spilt entrails until turned away face in loathing be nearly starting to foot to venture rush into forest shadow be spellbound remained listening to heavy munch of blood stained jaw until presently be aware other lesser feasters be coming there be twinkle of hungry eye about limit of area shine of green point of envious fire circled round in decreasing orbit a little fox jackal came crowding in one fellow took for rock so still sat putting hot soft paw upon knee for space others passed so near must touch big beast have taken off by time there must have be several hundred of newcomer merry time have of whole place be full of green hurrying eye amidst snap of teeth yapping quarrelling must hear flesh being torn from red bone in direction one wolf like individual brought mass of hot liver to eat between foot gave kick sent away much to surprise gradually however sound of unholy feast died away though may hardly believe fell off into doze be not sleep served purpose when in hour two draught of cool air roused awoke feeling more again slowly morning came black wall of forest around became full of purple interstice a east brightened glimmer of light between bough trunk turned to yellow red day shine presently stretched like canopy from point to point of treetop on side of sleeping place arose limb be stiff with cold vein emptied by hunger wound for space have not even strength to move little rubbing softened cramped muscle presently limping painfully down to place of combat surveyed trace of midnight fight will not dwell upon be ugly grim trampled grass giant footmark enringing pool of curdled blood broken bush grooved mud slide where unknown brute have slid in deadly embrace hollow splintered bough ragged point tufted with skin hair be sickening to yet so hungry be that when turned towards odious remnant of vanquished shapeless mass of abomination thought flew at once to breakfasting went down inspected victim cautiously huge rat like beast a far a might be judged from bare uprising rib be left of looking like framework of schooner yacht heart lay amongst offal knife came out to cut meal from must not do three time essayed task hunger disgust contending for mastery three time turned back in loathing at last must stand sight more slamming knife up again turned on heel fairly ran for fresh air shore where sea be beginning to glimmer in light few score yard through forest stem there once more out on open on pebbly beach stripped spreading thing out to dry on stone laying down with lapping of wave in ear first yellow sunshine thawing limb tried to piece together hurrying event of last few day what be gay martian doing lazy dog to let stranger be only one to draw sword in defence of own princess where be poor heru sweet maiden wife thought of in hand of ape men be odious yet be not mad to try to rescue even to follow alone if by chance must get off beast haunted place catch up with ravisher have to look for from except speedy extinction likely enough by most painful process be acquainted with other alternative of going back empty handed be terribly ignominious have lectured amiable young manhood of seth so soundly on subject of gallantry set good example on two occasion that must be bathos to saunter back hand in pocket confess knew nothing of lady fate have be daunted by first night alone in forest besides how dull must be in beautiful tumble down old city without heru with expectation day by day of seeing sylph like form hearing merry tinkle of fairy laughter a scoffed at unknown learning collected by ancestor in thousand laborious year must go on for certain be young in love angry before qualification difficulty became light meanwhile first essential be breakfast of kind arose stretched put on half dried clothes mounting low hummock on forest edge looked around sun be riding up finely into sky sea to eastward shone for league league in loveliest azure where rippled on own beach of low island noted over night wonderful fire of blue red played on sand a though broken water be full of living gem sky be full of strange gull with long forked tail lovely little flying lizard with transparent wing of palest green like of grasshopper be flitting about picking up insect straggler be very charming what kept saying to myself be streaky rasher hot coffee rasher coffee roll indeed have gate of paradise opened at moment fear first look down celestial street within must have be for restaurant did not be just turning away disconsolate when eye caught ascending from behind next bluff down beach thin strand of smoke rising into morning air be nothing so much in thin spiral creeping upwards mast high then flattening out into mushroom head meant everything to where there be fire there must be humanity where there be humanity ay to very outlayers of universe there must be breakfast be splendid thought rushed down hillock went gaily for blue thread amongst reed be not two hundred yard away soon below be tiny bay with bluest water frilling silver beach in midst of fire on hearth dancing round pot simmered gloriously of owner there be nothing to be seen peered here there on shore nothing moved while out to sea water be shining like molten metal with not dot upon did matter laughed a pleased hungry slipped down bank strode across sand pleased fate to play bandy with if sent supperless to bed why here be restitution in way of breakfast took up morsel of stuff in kettle on handy stick found good indeed knew at once a very dainty mess made from root of herb martian greatly liked have piled platter with when supped that night in market place of seth sweet white stuff have melted into corporal essence seemed without gross intermediate process of digestion here be again hungry sniffing fragrant breath of full meal not soul in sight must have be fool not to have eaten so thinking down sat taking pot from place when be little cool plunging hand into feasting with a good appetite a ever man have before be gloriously ambrosial deeper deeper went with tall stalk of smoke in front growing from hearth stone like strange new plant pleasant sunshine on back never thought for anything task in hand deeper deeper oblivious of else until to get very last drop lifted pipkin up putting back head drank in fashion be only when with sigh of pleasure lowered slowly again that over rim a sank there dawned upon vision of martian standing by empty canoe on edge of water regarding with calm amazement be in fact so astonished that for minute empty pot stood still before face over edge stared at other in mute surprise then with dignity might be laid vessel down between foot waited for newcomer to speak be girl by yellow garb fisherwoman seemed for in prow of craft be piled net upon scale of fish be twinkling martian obviously something more robust than most of savour of honest work about sunburnt face pallid friend away yonder be lacking in when have stared at other for few moment in silence came forward step two said without trace of fear shyness be spirit sir why answered about a much more le than most of aye said thought be for none spirit live here upon island be for good evil far better for breakfast of fear have robbed wandering along shore finding pot boiling with owner ventured to sample be so good appetite got better of manner girl bowed standing at respectful distance asked if must like fish a well have not many if must eat must cook for in minute be not often added lightly have met one of kind before in fact be obvious that simple person did actually take for being of world be for to say be wrong so adopting dignity worthy of reputation nodded gravely to offer fetched from boat four little fish of daintiest kind imaginable be about a big a hand pale blue when looked down upon so clear against light bone vein in body must be traced be wrapped just a be in broad green leaf then martian taking pointed stick made hollow in white ash laid in side by side drew hot dust over again while cooked chatted a though acquaintance be most casual thing in world found be indeed island be on not mainland a have hoped at first seth told be far away to eastward if woodman have gone by in ship must have passed round to north west of where be spent hour two with amiable individual be to be hoped sustained character of spiritual visitant with considerable dignity in one particular at least that namely of appetite did honour to supposed source a entertainer must not hear of payment in material kind must do be to show conjuring trick greatly increased belief in supernatural origin to teach new hitch knot using fishing line a mean of illustration demonstration called from natural observation that must be good sailor up aloft since knew so much about cordage then parted have seen nothing of woodman though have heard have be to seth thought from nicety of geographical calculation must not follow must have crossed to north a just stated of island there told with much surprise at desire for information how might by following forest track to westward coast make way to fishing village where must give canoe direct since such be extraordinary wish to place where if anywhere wild men have touched on way home filled wallet with dried honey cake mouth with sugar plum from little store then down on knee went that poor waif of worn out civilisation kissed hand in humble farewell blushing to be so saluted after sailor got by rosy finger lifted up shoulder high getting one hand under chin other behind head kissed twice upon pretty cheek so say parted chapter x off into forest went feeling boyish elation to be so free taking heed count of reckless adventure before martian weather for moment be lovely many coloured grass lush soft under foot mile after mile went heeding distance lightly air be so elastic now pressing forward a main interest of errand took upper hand remembrance of poor heru like crushed white flower in red grip of cruel ravisher came upon then pausing to sigh with pleasure stand agape forgetful even of in wonder of unknown loveliness about well might stare everything in forest be wonderful there be plant turned from colour to colour with varying hour of day while others have growth so swift be dangerous to sit in neighbourhood since long succulent tendril clambering from parent stem must weave into helpless tangle while gazed fascinated upon there be plant climbed walked sighing plant who called winged thing of air to with noise so like to girl sobbing again again stopped in tangled path to listen there be green bladder moss swam about surface of still pool like gigantic frog brood there be on ridge warrior tree burning in vindictiveness of long forgotten cause blaze of crimson scimitar thorn from root to topmost twig down again in cool hollow be lady bush making twilight of green gloom with cloudy ivory blossom filling shadow with heavy scent that head heart reeled with fatal pleasure a one pushed aside branch river bed be full of mighty reed whose stem clattered together when wind blew like sword on shield now then bit of forest be woven together with ropey stem of giant creeper till man beast must have passed save for path constant use have kept open through maze day long wandered on through wonderful woodland in fact loitered so much over infinite marvel that when sundown came too soon there be still undulating forest everywhere vista of fairy glade on hand peopled with incredible thing echoing with sound excited ear a much a other thing fascinated eye sign of sea fishing village anywhere did not matter little of martian leisureliness be getting into blood if not today why then tomorrow a must have said with for comfort selected warm sandy hollow under root of big tree made brief arrangement for night ate honey cake be soon sleeping blissfully woke early next morning after many hour of interrupted dream having nothing to do till white haze have lifted made possible to start again rested idly time on elbow watched sunshine filter into recess very pretty be to see thick canopy overhead by star light so impenetrable open chink fissure a searching sun came upon to see pin hole gap shine like spangle presently space broaden into lesser sun even thick leafage brighten shine down on with soft sea green radiance sunward side of tree stem took glow dew ran dripping down mossy side trickled blood red to earth elsewhere shadow be still black strange thing began to move in thing in middle aged world have never seen likeness of beast half bird bird half creeping thing creeping thing seemed to passed through lesser creation down to basest life crawl without interruption division be not for sailor to know much of such thing yet must not fail to notice on one grey branch overhead jutting from tree stem where patch of velvet moss made in morning glint fairy bed wonderful flower unfolded be splendid bud ivory white cushioned in leaf secured to place by naked white root clipped branch like finger of lady hand even a looked opened pale white star hung pensive inviting on mossy cushion from came ravishing odour even at further end of great scale of life felt pulse quicken eye brighten with cupidity be in very act of climbing tree before must move hand foot two thing happened whether take word for firstly up through glade in underwood attracted by odour came ugly brown bird with capacious beak shining claw perched near by peeped peered until made out flower pining on virgin stem whereat off hopped to branch there with cynical chuckle strutted to fro between main stem like ill genius guarding fairy princess surely heaven must not allow to tamper with so chaste bud hand reached for stone to throw at when happened second thing there came gentle pat upon woodland floor from tree overhead dropped down living plant like to one above yet not exactly similar male instinct told in full solitary blossom like above cinctured with leaf supported by score of thick white root worked a looked like limb of crab in twinkling parti coloured gentleman vegetable near be off to stem upon grew lady love running scrambling dragging finery of tasselled petal behind be laughable to watch eagerness got grip of tree up went hand over hand root over root have just time to note others of specie have dropped here there upon ground be hurrying with frantic haste to same destination when reached fatal branch be straddling victoriously down blind to love longing that ill omened bird who stood above maiden flower let come within stalk length so near that white splendour of sleeping lady gleamed within arm reach then great beak be opened great claw made clutch gallant head be yanked from neck a went tumbling down maw of feathered thing white leg fell spinning through space lay knotting in agony upon ground for minute two before relaxed became flaccid in repose of death vegetable suitor made for fatal tryst a came up snap of brown bird beak be obsequies at last more came then that nemesis of claw quill walked over to girl flower stomach feather ruffled with repletion green blood of lover dripping from claw pulled golden heart out tore white limb one from other swallowed piecemeal before very eye then up in wrath jumped yelled at till wood echoed too late to stay sacrilege by time sun be bathing everything in splendour turning away from wonder about set off at best pace along well trodden path led without turning to west coast village where canoe be proved far closer than expected a matter of fact forest in direction grew right down to water edge salt loving tree actually overhanging wave one of pleasantest sight in nature thus came right out on top of hamlet before there have be indication of presence occupied two side of pretty little bay third side being flat land given over to cultivation of enormous specie of gourd whose characteristic yellow flower green succulent leaf be discernible even at distance branched off along edge of surf down dainty little flowery path noticing meanwhile how whole bay be filled by hundred of empty canoe while score of others be drawn up on strand then first thing chanced upon be group of people youthful of course with eternal martian bloom in splendid simplicity of almost complete nakedness first idea be that be bathing fixing eye on tree top with great propriety gave warning cough at sound instead of getting to cover clothes started up stood staring for time like herd of startled cattle be highly embarrassing be right in path round dozen of naked so little ashamed that when edged away modestly began to run after farther came forward more retired till be playing kind of game of hide seek round tree stem in middle of heel caught in root down went very hard very ignominiously whereon laughing light hearted folk rushed in with smile jest helped to foot be traveller who have come from seth yes oh then be well have heard traveller be on road have come little way down path a far a might be without fatigue to meet must eat with amiable stranger asked pushing soft warm finger into mine ringing round with circle firstly might help out of clothes be hot thing be cumbersome a to eating be agreeable enough seeing how casual meal have be with lately clothes though heaven know be getting horribly ragged travel stained clung to desperately new friend shrugged dimpled shoulder argument being tedious at once squatted round in dappled shade of big tree produced store of never failing provision after pleasant little meal taken thus in open with simplicity martian delight in got to talking about yellow canoe be bobbing about on blue water of bay must like to see where be grown asked individual basking by side grown answered with incredulity built mean never in life did hear of growing boat then sir observed girl a sucked honey out of stalk of azure convolvulus flower threw remains at butterfly sailed across sunshine know so little have come from afar from barbarous barren district here undoubtedly grow boat though know thither folk such uncultivated race make craft by cumbrous method of flat plank yet prefer own way for one thing because save trouble a murmured that sufficient reason gentle damsel nodded reflectively one of companion more lively for moment tickled with straw until roused then said let take stranger to boat garden now current will drift round bay can come back when turn if wait will have to row in direction even walk again planetary slothfulness carried day so down to beach strolled launched one of golden hued skiff upon pretty dancing wavelet just where ran lipped with jewelled spray on shore then only have chance to scrutinise material patted that one be upon inside out noted with seaman admiration lightness elasticity supreme sleekness marvellous buoyancy fairy like line after minute consideration suddenly flashed across that be of gourd rind a if to supply confirmation flat land be approaching on opposite side of bay be covered by characteristic verdure of plant with touch here there of splendid yellow blossom of gigantic proportion ay said martian damsel lying on bottom taking kissing hand a spoke in simple hearted way of people see have guessed how make boat be same in distant country girl what be more be bit uneasy a to what fellow on carolina will say if ever hear went to sea in hollowed out pumpkin with young lady well dressed a be for crew even now can not imagine how get ship so trim shapely there be not seam patch anywhere look a if have run into mould be just what have done sir now will witness mould at work for here be little skiff be pulled ashore martian jumped out on shelving beach hauled boat up high dry there right over like great green umbrella spread frond of outmost garden of strangest of ship building yard briefly not to make part of story too long gilded boy girl took ashore chattering like finch in evening showed how planted gourd seed nourished gigantic plant a grew with brackish water burnt ash then when flowered mated male female blossom glorious funnel of golden hue big enough for one to live in when young fruit be of bigness of ordinary bolster how slipped into double mould of open reed work something like two half of walnut shell how growing day by day in soon took curve line chose to give even hanging keel below strengthened bulwark tall prow piece be so ingenious yet simple confess laughed over first skiff on stalk fell to bantering martian asking whether be good season for navy whether cunarders be spreading nicely if must give pinch of barge seed yacht in bud to show to friend at home lazy people took matter seriously enough led down green alley arched over with huge melon like leaf led along innumerable byway making peep peer through chequered sunlight at ocean growing craft have budded twelve month before already filling mould to last inch of space told that when growing process be sufficiently advanced loosened casing cutting hole into interior of giant fruit scooped out seed thereby checking more advance throwing into rind strength must otherwise have gone to reproductiveness said fruit made two vessel upper half be always best used for long salt water journey lower piece being for punting fishing on lake cut in half while still green scraped out light remaining pulp when dry dragged down with minimum of trouble light a feather tenacious a steel plate already in form fashion of dainty craft from five to twenty foot in length when process be completed by time have explored strangest of ship building yard have seen last year crop on stock being polished fitted with seat gear sun be going down martian twilight owing to comparative steepness of little planet side being brief strolled back to village there gave harbourage for night ambrosial supper deep draught of wine of forgetfulness under gauzy spell of real unreal melted into vista of rosy oblivion slept chapter xi with new morning came fresh energy spasm of conscience a thought of poor heru shabby sort of rescuer be to lie about with pretty trifler while remained in peril so have bath swim breakfast to shame be acknowledged sort of farewell merry go round dance on yellow sand with dozen young person light hearted a morning beautiful a flower bound hair in extremity of statuesque attire then at last got to give sea going canoe stock of cake fresh water with many parting injunction how to find woodman trail since must not listen to reason lie rest of life with in sunshine pushed off on lonely voyage over blue water shouted in chorus a dipped paddle into diamond crested wavelet six hour adventurous stranger with sun behind then into broad river behind yellow sand bar not black northward river not strong black river above thing stranger for be river of dead by many go none come back goodbye waving adieu sternly turned eye from delight behind faced fascination of peril in front in four hour for martian have forgotten in calculation that muscle be something better than rose further shore then question be where ran that westward river of theirs turned out afterwards that knowing nothing of tide have drifted much too far to northward consequently coast have closed up estuary mouth must have entered not sign of opening showed anywhere having nothing whatever for guidance turned northward eagerly scanning endless line of low cliff a day lessened for promised sand bar inlet about dusk canoe flying swiftly forward at own sweet will brought into bight bare desolate looking country with vegetation save grass sedge on near marsh stony hill rising up beyond with others beyond mounting step by step to long line of ridge peak still covered in winter snow outlook be anything cheering not trace of habitation have be seen for long time not single living being in whose neighbourhood must land ask way nothing living anywhere monstrous kind of sea slug a big a dog battening on waterside garbage gaunt bird like vulture who croaked on mud flat half spread wing of funereal blackness a gambolled here there where be poor heru where pink shouldered where wild men who have taken princess from lastly not least where be first star of martian sky be strange to boat whirling round round on current confused what little geography might otherwise have retained be cheerless look out again again cursed folly for coming on fool errand a sat chin in hand staring at landscape grew more more depressing mile to go on looked like destruction to go back be almost impossible without guide while be still wondering of two might be lesser evil stream be on turned corner in moment be upon water ran with swift oily smoothness straight for snow range now beginning to loom unpleasantly close ahead by time night be coming on apace last of evil looking bird have winged way across red sunset glare though be clear enough in mid river under bank now steep unclimbable be already evening with darkness came wondrous cold breath from off ice field blowing through lowland wrapping a though be tissue munched bit of honey cake took cautious sip of wine though will not own be frightened yet one will deny that circumstance be discouraging standing up in frail canoe looking around at second glance object caught eye coming with stream rapidly overtaking on strong sluice of water be raft of sort something extra ordinarily like sitting martian on nearer nearer came bobbing to rise fall of wavelet with last icy sunlight touching up with red gold nearer nearer in deadly hush of forsaken region then at last so near showed quite plainly on purple water raft with one sitting under canopy with thrill of delight waved cap aloft shouted ship ahoy hullo messmate where be bound to never answer came from swiftly passing stranger so again hailed put up helm mr skipper have lost bearing chronometer have run down without pause sound that strange craft went slipping by silence be more than must stand be against sea courtesy last chance of learning where be passing away so angrily paddle be snatched from canoe bottom roaring out again stop say d lubber stop by god will make plunged paddle into water shot little craft slantingly across stream to intercept newcomer single stroke sent into mid stream second brought within touch of strange craft be flat raft undoubtedly though so disguised by flower silk trailer that shape be difficult to make out in centre be chair of ceremony bedecked with greenery great pale bud hardly yet withered oh where have seen chair raft before riddle did not long remain unanswered upon seat a swept up alongside laid sunburnt hand upon edge be girl look told be dead such sweet pallid martian maid fair head lolling back against rear of chair gently moving to fro with rise fall of craft face in pale light of evening like carved ivory not le passionless still arm bare poor finger still closed in lap upon beautiful bud have put into fairly gasped with amazement at dreadful sweetness of solitary lady must hardly believe be really corpse ala there be doubt of stared at half in admiration half in fear noting how last sunset flush lent hectic beauty to face for moment then how fair ghostly stood out against purpling sky how light drapery lifted to icy wind how dreadfully strange soft scented flower trapping seemed a sped along side by side into country of night snow then of sudden true meaning of being there burst upon with start cry looked around be flying swiftly down river of dead have told of have outlet returning with frantic haste snatched up paddle again tried to paddle against great black current sweeping forward worked until perspiration stood in bead on forehead time worked river like black snake hissed twined that pretty lady rode cheerily along at side overhead star of unearthly brilliancy be coming out in frosty sky while on hand bank be high shadow under black a ink in shadow now then noticed with horrible indifference other raft be travelling presently a stream narrowed came out joined dead martian budding boy girl older voyager with age quickening upon in martian manner just a fruit only ripens after fall yellow girt slave staring into night in front quite merry crew clustered about gentle lady more far ahead more behind bobbing jostling forward a hurried to dreadful graveyard in martian region of eternal winter none have ever seen one came to cried aloud in desolation fear hid face in hand while icy cliff mocked cry dead maid tripping alongside rolled head over stared at with stony unseeing eye well be fine writer sat down to tell plain unvarnished tale will not let weird horror of ride get into pen careened forward lost martian until pretty near on midnight by time great light giving planet be up never chance did fate give time of parting company with about midnight be right into region of snow ice not actual polar region of planet a afterwards guessed one of long outlier follow course of broad waterway almost into fertile region cold though intense be somewhat modified by complete stillness of air be just then began to be aware of low rumbling sound ahead increasing steadily until there must not be doubt journey be nearly over be approaching great fall have told of over dead tumble to perpetual oblivion there be opportunity for action luckily little time for thought remember clapping hand to heart a muttered imperfect prayer laughing little a felt in pocket between that organ envelope containing corn plaster packet of unpaid tailor bill then pulled out that locket with poor forgotten polly photograph while be still kissing fervently dead girl on right be jealously nudging canoe with corner of raft plunged into narrow gully a black a hell shot round sharp corner at tremendous pace moment afterwards entered lake in midst of unbroken amphitheatre of cliff gleaming in soft light round even to moment can recall blue shine of terrible ice crag framing weird picture in on hand strange effect upon mind a passed out of darkness of gully down have come into sepulchral radiance of place though fixed with one instantaneous flash impression on mind forever there be time to admire a swept on to lake surface glance of light coming over dip in ice wall to left lit up dead face half withered flower of fellow traveller with startling distinctness noticed with new terror at lower end of lake towards be hurrying water suddenly disappeared in cloud of frosty spray be from thence came low ominous rumble have sounded up ravine a approached be fall beyond stream dropped down glassy step after step in wild pool rapid through boat must live for moment to black cavern entrance where be swallowed up in eternal night must not go way with yell such a solitude have probably never heard since planet be fashioned out of void seized paddle again struck out furiously from main current with result of postponing crisis for time finding bobbing round towards northern amphitheatre where light fell clearest from planet overhead be like great ballroom with constellation for taper ghastly crowd of martian be doing cotillion waltz about on raft a troubled water icy cold clear a glass eddied here there in solemn confusion on narrow beach at cliff foot be hundred of wrecked voyager wall flower of ghostly assembly room went jostling twirling round circle a though looking for likely partner until brain spun heart be sick for twenty minute fate played with then deadly suck of stream got down again close to where water began to race for fall vowed savagely must not go over if must be helped struggled furiously on left in shadow narrow beach seemed to lie between water cliff foot towards fought at very first stroke fouled raft occupant thereof came tumbling aboard nearly swamped now be fight for life so seized without ceremony by clammy neck leg threw back into water then playful martian butted behind part of canoe set spinning so that star seemed to be dancing giddily in sky with yell shoved off only to find comrade be closing round in solid ring a sucked down to abyss at ever increasing speed then fought like fury hacking pushing paddling shorewards cry out in excitement spinning bumping twisting ever downwards for foot gained pushed on yard a though determined fate must be mine also crowded round in compact circle poor flower girt head nodding a swift current curtsied craft hemmed in with desperate persistency a spun through ghostly starlight in swirling mass down to destruction in minute be so close to edge of fall must see water break into ridge a felt solid bottom give way under be so close that already foremost raft ten yard ahead be tipping occupant one by one waving arm about tumbling from funeral chair a shot into spray veil went out of sight under faint rainbow be arched over there symbol of peace only lovely thing in gruesome region minute must have gone with be too late to think of getting out of tangle then water behind be heavy with trailing silk flower be jammed together almost like one huge float in latter fact lay one chance on left be low ledge of rock leading back to narrow beach already mentioned ledge came out to within few foot of where outmost boat on side must pas be only chance poor one already first rank of fleet be trembling on brink without stopping to weigh matter bounded off own canoe on to raft alongside rocked with weight like tea tray from leapt with such hearty good will a have never have before on to second third jumped from footstool of one martian to knee of steadying by free use of nodding head a passed time jumped ship collapsed behind a staggered with spring into last outermost boat ledge be still six foot away hidden in smother of foam rim of great fall just under then drew sailor agility together just a little vessel be going bow up over edge leapt from came down blinded with spray on ledge rolled over over clutched frantically at frozen soil be safe for moment only few inch from vortex below a soon a picked up got breath walked shorewards found with great satisfaction that ledge joined shelving beach so walked on in blue obscurity of cliff shadow back from fall in bare hope that beach might lead by way into gully through have come open country beyond after couple of hundred yard hope ended a abruptly a spit in deep water there be a far a darkness must allow to ascertain a utterly trapped a mortal must be will not dwell on next few minute for one like to acknowledge that have be unmanned even for space when minute be over calmness consideration returned be able to look about opposite cliff rising sheer from water be in light cold blue white surface rising far up into black starfields overhead looking at intently from vantage point saw without at first understanding that along horizontally tier above tier be row of object like like why good heaven be like men woman in sort of strange posture position rubbing eye looking again perceived with start strange creepy feeling down back that be men woman hundred of thousand in row a cormorant stand upon sea side cliff myriad myriad now looked about in conceivable pose attitude never sound never movement amongst vast concourse then turned back to cliff behind yes ere there too dimmer by reason of shadow there for certain from snowfield far above down down good heaven to very level where stood there be one of not ten yard away half in half out of ice wall setting teeth walked over examined there be further in behind a peered into clear blue depth behind one behind just like cherry in jelly be startling almost incredible yet so many wonderful thing have happened of late that wonder be losing sharpness be soon examining cliff almost a coolly a though be only trivial geological section new kind of petrified sea urchin have caught attention not whole nation in ice huge amphitheatre of fossilised humanity stared down on matter be simple enough when came to look at with philosophy martian have sent dead down here for many thousand year a came be frozen in band zone in sat indicating perhaps alternating season then after nature have be storing like for long age upheaval happened cleft lake opened through heart of preserve probably river once ran far up there where starlight be crowning blue cliff with silver diadem of light only when hollow opened did slowly deepen lower course spreading out in lake eventually tumbling down icy step lose in dark root of hill be very simple doubt incredibly weird wonderful to who stood sole living thing in immense concourse of dead humanity look where must be same everywhere endless row of frozen body lying sitting standing stared at from niche cornice almost seemed a light veered slowly round a though smiled frowned at time never word be there amongst million silence be audible save dull low thunder of fall so monotonous ear became accustomed to soon disregarded there be not sound anywhere not rustle not whisper broke eternal calm of great caravansary of dead very rattle of shingle under foot jingle of navy scabbard seemed offensive in perfect hush too awed to be frightened presently turned away from dreadful shine of cliff felt way along base of wall on own side there be mean of escape way presently shingle beach gave out a stated where cliff wall rose straight from surface of lake so turned back finding grotto in ice determined to make a comfortable a might be until daylight came chapter xii fortunately there be good deal of broken timber thrown up at high water mark with stack of at mouth of little cave pleasant fire be soon made by help of flint pebble steel back of sword be hearty blaze lit up near cliff with ruddy jumping glow gave occupant marvellous appearance of life heat also brought off dull rime upon side of recess leaving clear a polished glass be little startled to see only inch so back in ice standing a erect a ever have be in life figure of imposing grey clad man arm be folded chin dropped upon chest robe of finest stuff very flower have decked head with frozen with immortality under round crisp iron grey simple band of gold with strange rune figure engraved upon there be something very simple yet stately about though face be hidden a gazed long intently idea got hold of that have be king over undegenerate martian race have stood waiting for dawn very very long time wished little that have not be quite so near glassy surface of ice down warmth be bringing quick moisture drop have be back there in blue depth where others be sitting crouching must have be much more comfortable be sailor misfortune make strange companion so piled up fire again lying down presently on dry shingle with back to stared moodily at blaze till slowly fatigue of day told eyelid dropped with many fitful start turn at length slept be hour before dawn fire have burnt low be dreaming of angry discussion with tailor in new york a to sit of last new trouser when faint sound of moving shingle caught quick seaman ear before must raise head lift hand man weight be on heavy strong man who bore down with irresistible force felt slap of ice cold hand upon throat teeth in back of neck in instant though half awake with yell of surprise anger grappled with enemy exerting strength rolled over over over went struggling towards fire when got within foot so of came out on top digging knuckle into throttle banged head upon stony floor in reckless rage until of sudden seemed to be done for relaxed grip other man never moved shook again like terrier with rat never resented have killed how limp cold be then of sudden uneasy feeling came upon reached out throwing handful of dried stuff upon ember fire danced gaily up into air blaze showed be savagely holding down to gravel kneeling on chest of long dead king from grotto wall be man out of ice without doubt there be very niche have fallen from under influence of fire heat very recess exactly in shape in detail whence have stood gazing into vacuity year left go hold after flutter in heart have gone down apologetically set up against wall of cavern whence have fallen then built up fire until twirling flame danced to very roof in blue light of dawn hobgoblin shadow leapt capered about then once more sat down on opposite side of blaze resting chin upon hand stared into frozen eye of grim stranger who with chin upon knee stared back at with irresistible remorseless steadfastness be a fresh a if have died yesterday yet by clothing something in appearance be not that of martian of to day knew might be

a be sometimes said other traveller have done when picturesque fact be deficient yes have forgotten about day save that be sultry hot that took off coat waistcoat to be cooler carrying like tramp be across arm thus dishevelled passed time in afternoon encampment of forest folk wherefrom almost men be gone woman shy surly in very social humour walked round woodland village on outskirt by brook just a be wishing there be one to eat solitary lunch with chanced upon fellow busily engaged in hammering stone into weapon upon flint anvil be ugly looking individual at best yet be hard up for

caution from hurling crude pebble to fashioning such a be long stride who first edged pointed primitive malice what man with soul of thousand unborn fighter in notched sharpened natural rock whereon

having now become damp in falling broke branch off incident be only important from what follows picking up perhaps little shaken by jolt set off again upon what seemed plain road being by time displeased by surroundings determined to make push for civilization before rapidly gathering darkness settled down hand in pocket collar up marched forward at good round pace for hour constantly straining eye for sight of hill ear for indication of living being in deathly hush of shrouded wood at end of time feeling sure habitation must now be near arrived at what looked like little open

retreated then hesitating moment where divided in two took left one to chagrin presently began to trend upwards whereas knew heru be making for river down below be impossible to go back whenever stopped in deserted passage must hear wolflike patter of men foot upon trail on again into stony labyrinth of old palace ever upwards in spite of desire to go down until at last pursuer off track for
