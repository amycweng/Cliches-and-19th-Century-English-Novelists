be crowded into one man voice bishop of caerleon call friend be at loss to know to what may attribute honour of eminency presence manner in will allow to receive hope mr rose that will accept blessing a well a dr talacryn cardinal archbishop replied in voice where hauteur strangely struggled with timidity extended hand george instantly took respectfully kneeled again noting that ring contained cameo instead of cardinalitial sapphire then caused guest to become seated atmosphere seemed to laden with invigorating aroma of possibility zmnts wish to ask few question young bishop began thought must not take amiss if be present a friend george shot glance of must be affectionate gratitude at speaker turned saying have be imagining eminency in rome in conclave be there until fortnight ago

have cleared obstacle archiepiscopally pranced along have recently be brought very forcibly to remembrance that be at one time candidate for holy order mr rose be cognizant of unpleasantness attended that portion of career be only lately that have realised fact that have never accepted acquiesced in adverse verdict of superior never have accepted never have acquiesced in never will accept never will acquiesce in must mind telling reason must have to say very disagreeable thing eminency never mind tell truth try to feel that be confiding in spiritual father whose only desire be to do justice may even say to do justice at eleventh hour be inclined indeed to believe that because have condescended to come to wish in fact to believe be advisable to rake up old grievance be desirable to scarify half healed wound how did eminency find after year feline temper of produced dalliance certainly be difficult matter at first have completely disappeared object to george interrupted suddenly saw that be one chance of life of saying right thing to right person determined to fight step of way with cardinal before death claimed object to that repeated neither disappeared hid in way there be question of concealment found most perfidiously deserted went on way alone neither altering habit changing appearance there be implication of kind mr rose be very glad to hear eminency say so such

wrote to at publisher letter be returned unopened marked refused be in accordance with own explicit direction few year ago opportunity be given of drawing sharp line across life mean allude to series of libel be directed against in newspaper especially in catholic newspaper dirty keltic wood pulp precisely why be that occasion for drawing what call sharp line across life eminency said george calming down setting out to be concise categorical score of people who have known life must have seen that attack be libellous false must have seen that stretched out hand opened shut a though claw protruded from velvet retired yet only single one out of score came forward to assure of friendship in dreadful moment rest spewed bile licked lip in unctuous silence be left to bear brunt alone except for one be not catholic except from have sympathy comfort know case in reading to say nothing of experience where man have better clearer more convincing test of trueness falseness of friend not to do man injustice that one might call rash precipitate in decision waited two year two whole year bishop of caerleon came to in period of isolation one other catholic man of own trade later that one betrayed again so will say more of woman of course neglect rest unanimously held aloof then published book told publisher to refuse letter might be addressed to for sharp line be drawn wanted more

circumstance throw in path squash cockroach effect on own soul effect on own soul be perfectly ghastly positively loathe distrust catholic known unknown with one exception have become rudderless derelict have lost faith in man have lost power of loving how terrible cardinal sighed be there none of for whom have kindly feeling at time mean can not always be in state of white hot rage know there must be interval when tension of anger be relaxed perhaps from sheer fatigue for anger be deliberate effect of exertion in interval have never caught thinking kindly of of former friend yes eminency there be very many clerk laics with whom strange to say when anger be not dynamic sometimes wish to be reconciled however never will approach afford opportunity come to a have come voice softened little smile be alluring illumination must meet with vituperation naturally want to expose to affront oh of course if sense of duty to say nothing of decency doe not teach to risk affront will not say before hand how must meet beyond must depend on demeanour to must do a be done by for example turned to ruddy bishop did heave chair china ware at lordship indeed did not although thoroughly deserved yrmnts young prelate continued believe understand mr rose frame of mind have be hit very hard be badly bruised be burnt child dread fire be only natural be firmly convinced that have be more sinned against than sinning though be sorry to see practically keeping at arm length really know what else can expect until treat a must like to be treated true true cardinal conceded be pity same bishop concluded cardinal audibly thought have perhaps not many very kindly feeling towards personally mr rose have kindly feeling at toward eminency believe to be aware of reason trust that never must be found wanting in reverence to sacred purple apart from indignant recollection stiffened inflamed speaker indeed only be speaking civilly to now because be successor of augustine theodore

personality if not name be certain to be known to at least one of if still remained catholic know if still remained catholic george growled with contemptuous ire people in position mr rose have be known to commit apostasy be precisely because people in position habitually commit apostasy decline to do what be expected of will follow cat example of exclusive singularity must be too obliging too silly to give catholic weapon to use against eminency rest assured that rather will be nuisance poor a be than apostate rich a might be cardinal raised eyebrow trust have worthier motive than mentioned be not in revolt against faith against faithful grace of god oh of course grace of god george hastened in common courtesy conventionally to adjoin fine dark brow came down again cardinal continued a soon a have issued mandate to suffragan dr talacryn at once furnished desired information see said george then where must eminency like to begin tell own tale in own way dear child george softly swiftly stroked little cat compelled to think intensely to marshal salient fact on have brooded day night unceasingly for year to try to eliminate trace of acerbity of devouring fury with still inspired perhaps 'd better tell mr rose yrmnts that have already gone very deeply into case bishop said will make easier for to speak when know that be not information be seeking personal point of view indeed will said george sincerely thank lordship if already know fact will be able to check narrative have to do be to state said fact to best of knowledge belief will begin with career at

to old stager orezzo be pleased took ball of conversation set rolling be fortunate event holiness said that divine leo may soul rest in cool place never carried out intention of nominating successor ah pope responded remember reading about in english newspaper pall mall gazette few year back perhaps eminency can tell truth there be in report fact holy father be leo so firmly believed that policy have seen fit to pursue during long reign be essential to welfare of church that wished to be assured of continuance must have have of to promise that upon election must not depart from example of

indicated very vivid ardent studiose concern perfect perception of being among doctor hadrian seemed to be treating matter too impersonally too much from view point of outsider gave sign whatever that be conscious how very nearly thing touched reminds one of surgeon probing for bullet in body be not said mundo to fiamma will find bullet archbishop of bologna replied hadrian who must see a far through brick wall a most men great deal further than be not by mean unconscious of situation be avidly curious after information pursued inquiry many thought must have be more delicate to drop yes be

by christianity to suffer revilings persecution saying of manner of evil falsely forgot that in vindicating behaved not a minister of god a common human animal however besides so called triumphant vindication of monsignor cateran slab glorifies in three separate column same number bristle with impropriety on p have dominican jesuit controversialist calling other liar otherwise politely hating abusing one oh jesuit dominican pope put down paper looked cardinal collected for sally in force holiness will permit to say that be extremely unusual myself be consecrated bishop in fourteen year before be christian seems to that must give senior credit for having conscience at least dear lord cardinal if have seen sign of said conscience cardinal tottered made one more thrust be not only member of sacred college who think that holiness attitude partakes of will say singularity have arrogance singularity oh sincerely hope so arrogance can not call arrogance to assume that know more of particular subject eagerly have studied from childhood than do who never have studied at eminency began by saying that desired to establish relation with now have shewn something of frame of mind certainly holy father wish to wish to act upon sum of word conduct in order that england may have good not bad example from english catholic more than that may call christendom till be black in face true character of christendom be wanting to because great promise of prophecy still fulfilment barque of peter have be trying to reach harbour muting within storm without have driven hither thither be a far off from port to day a ever who know new captain be trying to set course again from old chart look be no longer backward onward lord cardinal can captain count on loyal support of lieutenant holy father assure that may count on be immense effort when came to so fine point nature pride of man gave way to grace of divine vocation well now only one more blow from flail then will take up crook do stop catholic from toadying german emperor read that be perfectly absurd for to tell that whole catholic world must be delighted if protection of catholic in orient be confided to be admirable person be not going to confide protection of catholic in orient to england be only power can manage oriental what right have erse gaelic catholic to speak for 'the whole catholic world ' do england italy count do make pious fat wit mind own business make understand that when tell kaiser that will exert to remove misunderstanding between germany england england last note must be comical if be not impertinent entirely stupid of course disloyal a usual hadrian collected document book of newspaper cut swept into portfolio abruptly changed subject will eminency be good enough to tell circumstance led to extraordinary election barely recovered from commotion of mind posed point blank like cardinal courtfield hesitated said something about act of conclave aboriginally tardy temperament be incapable of keeping pace with feline agility of pontiff hadrian perceived difficulty intently pursued inquiry from footing know about act of conclave will read at leisure want more human light eminency can throw upon subject perhaps will be simpler if use sokratic method by what mean did name did mere fact of existence become known to sacred college by mean holiness understand that eminency actually proposed to conclave be so infer that also recommended at least described in way that cardinal knew whom be electing yes holy father why did eminency propose pope purred cardinal seemed to be at loss again appeared to have difficulty in expression not lack of material for expression hadrian made dash for rudiment there be other name before college why be none of owner chosen be impossible to agree about merit holiness several attempt doubt be made way of scrutiny access be tried seven time then then came deadlock none of candidate obtained sufficiency of suffrage none of elector be willing to change opinion then way of compromise be tried through eminency mean compromissaries be induced to impose on sacred college yes holiness eminency at time when conclave first be immured hardly can have be in mind be improbable that must have thought of then in connection at what point did come into calculation ought perhaps to say that name have be brought before week before demise of holiness predecessor must be in connection with matter of treated in london yes precisely in what way be name brought before eminency be brought before in letter from edward lancaster perfectly frantic letter accusing of sort of crime holiness perhaps be aware what queer person be rather inclined to be scrupulous most impulsive yes know must have said 'unscrupulous ' eminency us word becrupulous ' in catholic sense whereas prefer frank english mean that be given to tormenting about fancied sin mean that a rule doe nothing of kind like good many others be singularly successful in lulling conscience at least for fifteen year contrived to do so in case however now have made amends there be nothing more to be said let continue received self accusing letter from edward lancaster then not one letter holiness dozen at least injustice of have be victim be on nerve wrote several letter came to see several time be a know person of importance great benefactor to church so be obliged to take matter up promised to investigate case yes did instituted inquisitorial process among of person who have have to do with holiness be bound to say that reply gave ground for thought why differed materially a to detail of history yet opinion of seemed to be fairly unanimous be not desirable opinion holiness must not be never be able to arrange to be loved to be disagreeable be sort of habit of ours be eminency able from memory to give idea of difference in regard to fact opinion matter cardinal pondered for minute yes holiness can give three example from oxford fr benedict bart said that have met twice personally that have heard much of from friend priest a well a layman stated that must be done for have be done that be have holiness will pardon very incapable ungrateful person pope gave little leaden weight of pallium swing beamed with delight cardinal went on fr perkins who received into church said `` m afraid be genius poor fellow ' what rank blasphemy blasphemy holiness yes blasphemy almighty god happens to make something little out of common instead of praising for privilege of tending singular work of fr perkins actually bewails fact continue confess never thought of in light before did fr perkins continue also took opinion of certain dr strong who appears to be one of superior of university be senior public examiner in honour great if know what mean quite so well said that have be intimate valued friend for more than twenty year that have have influential friend to encourage that ability be le distinguished than moral character pope laughed again dr strong be experienced writer of testimonial must hardly think that man in position certainly not dr strong be one of two honest men known to well how did discrepancy between statement fr benedict strike struck in way how did so many worthy priest arrive at practically same opinion for what fr benedict said others said also when knowledge of fact seemed to be so superficial so doubtful mean fr benedict rest spoke from exceedingly casual acquaintance dr strong from more than twenty year intimacy however just when be pondering contradictory statement holiness predecessor died be obliged to come to rome did eminency ever note that very few clergyman be capable capable of forming unprejudiced proper original opinion of judging on evidence before on nothing else have excellent reason to believe that what holiness say be correct be so much easier to echo than to discriminate now if please will go back to compromise what brought again to eminency remembrance in conclave holy father be most strange compromissaries be quite a unable to agree a sacred college have be then at end of one of session be struck by extraordinary likeness of cardinal della volta to someone whom remembered having seen whose name have forgotten be merest accident came away wracking brain about curious thing happened same night having paper to sign happened to go to dispatch box quite by accident came across edward lancaster letter about holiness call thing 'accidents do holy father now well for want of something better to do suppose looked over dozen of letter determined to go further into matter on return to england early very next morning suddenly flashed across mind that have seen holiness in ah yes in that cardinal della volta be holiness double sent back to letter again became more more convinced that immense almost irreparable wrong have be done can not tell how strongly felt that holy father what made well practically impose on compromissaries can not say although in own mind there be very little doubt that however be fact be so full of case narrated at morning conference a instance of fallibility of what think be holiness who gave name yes be a instance of fallibility of machine will never forget effect of word upon cardinal mundo be most extraordinary said will remember what said a long a live said bey lord cardinal owe to man to propose for paparchy yes owe ' rather upset replied that holiness be not even in sacred order answered 'whose fault be that ' may say that point be very keen one one must fail to perceive relevancy to use vulgar expression touched thing with needle others did not help at considered matter for few minute mundo went on 'if that man have real vocation will have persevered if have persevered twenty year more of waiting will have purified pray quote cardinal mundo well in short be irresistibly moved to propose holiness then because other candidate be forthcoming because understand came to found persistent yes holiness well will take little stroll in garden say office cardinal courtleigh jumped be sure if holiness doe mind walking by side of bath chair oh do be invariable custom to walk behind bath chair push indeed must not for one moment permit for hour will submit nonsense man do suppose that one never have pushed bath chair before now sit down quietly open breviary read office

artistic merely valuable on account of weight character fifthly instantly will publish everywhere note to effect that sale at fixed price of thing will take place here from first to sixth of january following paused for saw that people wanted to speak conceded word to gentilotto have holiness considered said red pope that most of treasure be consecrated to service of church yes also have considered that church exists for service of god in creature that doe not serve either by keeping pretty costly thing shut up in cupboard that church set thing apart by consecration also can restore to usefulness by desecration technically thing consecrate can become desecrate by tapping with intent to desecrate soon will descend to treasury will tap sacred thing into gem bullion can be done cardinal prefect of propaganda said heart pulled one way heredity ecclesiastical prejudice other there be one thing think right to mention put in della volta present official of treasury building what

treasury being no longer there building will remain sacristy must like to get word in edgeways if may said semphill doe holiness think that italian government will interfere be there law prevents work of art from going out of italy must like to see italian government interfere with hadrian responded with strong illuminating smile italian government be fenian fool cardinal pursued eminency need fear opposition from quarter be nothing to be exempted from sale sterling thoughtfully asked there will be exemption pope turned to cardinal della volta will reserve one silver gilt chalice paten for priest in palace one silver gilt pyx for tabernacle one plain set of pontifical regalia will indicate to nothing more hereafter court can use ornament be private possession of individual must say that
