so full of loyalty to old master in watteau chamber seem to see antony of whom jean baptiste dare not yet speak to come very near work understand great part so jean baptiste work in nearness to may stand for future a central interest of life bury in february if understand anything of matter antony watteau paint delicate life of paris so excellently with so much spirit partly because after look down upon despises to persuade myself of be womanly satisfaction for preference apparent preference for world so different from mine coquetry vain perishable grace can be rendered so perfectly only through intimate understanding of for to understand must be to despise while think know why nevertheless undergoes fascination hence discontent with keep pace with fame must have be better for must have enjoyed purer more real happiness have remained here obscure a might have be better for be altogether different with jean baptiste approach that life pretty nothingness from level no higher than own beginning just where antony watteau leaf off in disdain produce solid veritable likeness of of way march there be point in painting apprehend through own persistently modest observation at work out purpose more excellently than watteau of whom have trusted to speak at last with wonderful self effacement pointing out in of picture for rest so just true how antony must have managed with what easy superiority have done thing better done impossible february there be good thing attractive thing in life meant for one not for not meant perhaps for a there be pretty clothes be not suitable for
