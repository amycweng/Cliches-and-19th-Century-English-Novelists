scythian bowman a speed along can pierce bird on wing let leave plato others at rest be not for to contend against let rather search out together if truth of philosophy be a say why summon athlete archer from persia yes let go if think in way now do speak really look a if have something wonderful to deliver well then lucian to seems quite possible for one who have learned doctrine of stoic only to attain from knowledge of truth without proceeding to inquire into various tenet of others look at question in way if one told that twice two make four must be necessary for to go whole round of arithmetician to see whether one of will say that twice two make five seven must not see at once that man tell truth at once why then do find impossible that one who have fallen in with stoic only in enunciation of what be true must adhere to seek after others assured that four must never be five even if fifty plato fifty aristotle said so be beside point hermotimus be likening open question to principle universally received have ever met one who said that twice two make five seven only madman must say that have ever met on other hand stoic epicurean who be agreed upon beginning end principle final cause of thing never then parallel be false be inquiring to of sect philosophic truth belongs seize on by anticipation assign to stoic alleging what be by mean clear that be for whom twice two make four epicurean platonist might say that be in truth who make two two equal four while make five seven be not so when think virtue only good epicurean pleasure when hold thing to be material while platonist admit something immaterial a said resolve offhand in favour of stoic very point need critical decision if be clear beforehand that stoic alone make two two equal four then others must hold peace so long a be very point of debate must listen to sect alike be well assured that will seem partial in judgment think lucian that altogether understand meaning to make clear then let suppose that two men have entered temple of aesculapiussay bacchus that afterwards one of sacred vessel be found to be missing two men must be searched to see of have hidden under garment for be certainly in possession of one other of well if be found on first there will be no need to search second if be not found on first then other must have again there will be no need to search yes so let be too lucian if have found holy vessel in possession of stoic will no longer have need to search other philosopher having attained that be seeking why trouble further need if something have indeed be found knew to be that lost thing if at least must recognise sacred object when saw truly a matter now stand not two person only have entered temple one other of whom must need have taken golden cup whole crowd of person then be not clear what lost object really iscup flagon diadem for one of priest avers that be not even in agreement a to material will have to be of brass others of silver gold thus becomes necessary to search garment of person who have entered temple if lost vessel be to be recovered if find golden cup on first of will still be necessary to proceed in searching garment of others for be not certain that cup really belonged to temple might there not be many such golden vesselsno must go on to one of placing that find in midst together then make guess of thing may fairly be supposed to be property of god for again circumstance add greatly to difficulty that without exception one searched be found to have something upon himcup flagon diadem of brass of silver of gold still while be not ascertained of be sacred thing must still hesitate to pronounce one of guilty of sacrilegethose object may be own lawful property one cause of obscurity being a think that there be inscription on lost cup if cup be have name of god even that of donor be upon at least must have have le trouble having detected inscription must have ceased to trouble one else by search have nothing to reply to hardly anything plausible so that if wish to find who be have sacred vessel who will be best guide to corinth must need proceed to one examine with utmost care stripping off garment considering closely scarcely even so will come at truth if be to have credible adviser regarding question of philosophywhich of philosophy one ought to followhe alone who be acquainted with dictum of one of can be such guide others must be inadequate must give credence to if lacked information a to one only if somebody introduced fair person told be fairest of men must not believe that unless knew that have seen people in world fair might be fairest of allnone must know unless have seen too desire not fair one fairest of unless find will think have failed be casual beauty will content what be seeking after be that supreme beauty must of necessity be unique what then be one to do if matter be really thus perhaps know better than see be very few of must have time to examine various sect of philosophy in turn even if began in early life know not how be though seem to to speak reasonably yet must confess have distressed not little by exact exposition of yours be unlucky in coming out to day in falling in with who have thrown into utter perplexity by proof that discovery of truth be impossible just a seemed to be on point of attaining hope blame parent child not rather blame mother nature for giving seventy eighty year instead of making a long lived a tithonus for part have led from premise to conclusion nay be mocker know not wherefore have grudge against philosophy be entertainment to make jest of lover ah hermotimus what truth may be philosopher may be able to tell better than so much at least know of that be one by mean pleasant to who hear speak in matter of pleasantness be far surpassed by falsehood falsehood have pleasanter countenance nevertheless being conscious of alloy within discourse with boldness to men who therefore have little love for see how
