questionable practice have since become illegal sometimes in truth by what law called crime even then viney have be ship officer have indeed served under grandfather nat who be old skipper marr be business man who have be clerk firm owned two brig juno though how much of value be clear property how much stood for borrowed money be matter of doubt disagreement in conversation of mate skipper along thames shore what nobody disagreed about however be that business be run on skinflint principle that vessel be so badly found so ill kept so grievously under manned that firm ought to be making money thing by way though be important to remember a be saying remember little of father because of long voyage short spell at home mother be so clear so kind in recollection that sometimes dream of still though died before be eight be while father be on long voyage with juno that there came time when took often upon knee asking if must like little brother sister to play with thing demanded to

breast so behaved that good soul with blubbered aloud have added grief in reflection have kicked shin not hour before have never seen that good woman since be ashamed to write can not even remember name have more to say of mother of funeral only so much a record least part of grief of relation came whom can not distinctly remember seeing at other time group of elderly hard featured woman who talked of a child very much a might have talked of troublesome article of baggage who turned up nose at grandfather who for part be uneasily respectful calling of mum very often be not attracted by mother relation kept a near grandfather a possible feeling vague fear that of might have design of taking away though indeed none be in least ambitious of responsibility be not woman for there be one

martha immovable belief that be wholly incapable of action even simplest most obvious unless impelled by shove jerk consequently be shoved into mourning carriage have two jerked into corner opposite to one selected shoved out almost on four at cemetery perceiving entering little chapel of own motion aunt martha overtook jerked in there example presently impressed other lady with expediency of shoving uncle martha at convenient opportunity so that arrived home with at last in severely jostled condition faithful to bone handled umbrella through everything grandfather nat have be liberal in provision for funeral party cake port wine gin water tea watercress occupied visitor for time period illuminated by many moral reflection from rather fat relation who be doubt like most of others aunt ah well said fat aunt shaking head with deep sigh suggested repletion ah well be what must come to there have be deal of other conversation remember remark because fat aunt have already made twice ah

significance even command be great trial for of family be sure pursued fat aunt after application to glass cake dish must bear up not that ai have trial enough indeed replied aunt martha with snap at grandfather a though be trial chiefly on mind nat took very humbly tried with watercress well be better off poor thing fat aunt went on began to say ah again aunt martha snapped into well let hope so in tone of one convinced that mother must be much worse off than have be from from sundry other remark among aunt gathered that mother be held to have hurt dignity of family by alliance with

reason said thin one anybody can see said others many boy gone out to work older ah be member o parliament afterwards too prospect of entry into parliament presented so stupefying contrast with of immersion in dock for time ensuing conversation made little impression on on part of mother relation be mainly repetition of what have gone before very much in same word a to grandfather have little to say at expressed so far a might by furtive pat on back pat increasing in intensity a talk of lady pointed especially unpleasingly to myself till at last food drink be gone whereupon fat aunt sighed

ear from head in same moment have caught by opposite wrist so a to stretch man extended arm elbow backward across own great chest posture in backward pull against elbow joint brought yell of agony from victim only man with extraordinarily long arm must have done thing exactly like that movement be so savagely sudden that grandfather have kicked open door flung jim crute headlong into street ere quite understood when there came check in throat tear in eye to see man so cruelly handled grandfather nat stood moment at door seemed that customer be quelled effectually for presently turned inward again with grim scowl a have never seen before at queer head appeared just above counter have supposed bar to be wholly cleared very weak rather womanish voice said in tone of over inflected indignation serve right cap'en kemp be sure lot o impudent vagabones ought to be ashamed o theirselves that ought pity 'ouse ai kep a strict a one be be what say queer head looked round vacant bar

juno what father on now have noticed that wall of bar of bar parlour be plentifully hung with painting of ship ship becalmed ship in full sail ship under bare spar with painful blue sky over very even waved sea beneath ship in storm with torn sail pursued by rumbustious pile of sooty cloud pelted with length of scarlet lightning fear must not have recognised father ship without help be probably because have only seen month before lying in dock battered dingy with confusion of cask bale about deck naked yard dangling above whereas in picture be mile too small for brig be booming along under

collar walked before relief tempered triumph when be safe across foot never seemed to have twisted slipped stumbled so much before in so short distance perhaps because in same distance have never before recollected so many tale of men drowned in dock by falling off just such lock in fog by accidental slip little farther along came upon ratcliff highway saw street then for first time in truth

than can write port be drunk then hundred of great pipe lay in row on wide quay where men walked with wooden club whacking pipe till shive wooden bung sprang into air to be caught with dexterity pleased like conjuring trick many thirsty dock labourer watching opportunity must cut strip of bread from humble dinner a strolled near pipe absorbed in contemplation of indefinite empyrean absently dip sippet into shive hole a passed recovering in state so wet discoloured that instant consumption be imperative so at last came away from dock by thoroughfare then called tanglefoot lane not that name anything like be painted at corner because be road commonly taken by visitor departing from wine vault after bringing tasting order a passed blue gate on way home saw among standing at corner coarse faced untidy woman talking to big bony looking man with face so thin mean that seemed misplaced on such shoulder woman be so much like score of others then in sight must scarce have noted be not that man stopped talk a passed with quick look first at grandfather then one at other then man turned back walked away presently woman came after walking quickly glancing doubtfully at grandfather

what mean if somebody bought anything of friend o yours ' friend want to sell something else suppose can take to ca if be value there be reason must buy so far a know grandfather nat strode on woman murmured sort of acknowledgment fell back in moment have forgotten though remembered afterward for good reason enough in fact be no later than evening be sitting in bar parlour with grandfather nat who have left bar to care of potman grandfather be smoking pipe while spelled sought down narrow column of lloyd list for news of father ship be grandfather way to excuse from reading when must on plea of unsuitable eye though suspect that apart from sight found reading greater trouble than be pleased to own there be nothing here about juno grandfather nat said nothing anywhere ah said grandfather la guaira be last port must keep eye on list for barbadoes maybe mail late most of lloyd message came by mail at time let see went on belize la guaira barbadoes straightway began to figure

head one shoulder over threshold arm flung out stiffly so that old man stumbled across a dashed at dark shadow without be hard at grandfather heel in flash of time saw that man be rising from over one

friend of keeper persistent prying among ghastly liers in state at first on plea of identifying friend contingency likely enough since long shore acquaintance be wide later under name of friendly call be indulgence have helped to consideration a news monger twice have raised to elevation of witness at inquest distinction very gratifying to simple vanity entertained high hope of being called witness in case of man stabbed at side door of hole in wall be scarce seen at captain nat next day preferring to frequent mortuary so happened that saw other corpse be carried thence from hole in wall stair

to swallow reluctance come forward at inquest be held at hole in wall twenty four hour after body have be hauled ashore two inquest be held together in fact marr that of broken nosed man stabbed in passage two inquest even three in day made uncommon event in part where perhaps dozen might be held in week mostly ending with same doubtful verdict found drowned here one of inquiry related to open witnessed murder that fact gave touch of added interest to proceeding accordingly drifting group hung about door of hole in wall at appointed time just idle changing group a have hung there evening after man have be stabbed in midst stood blind george with fiddle vacant white eye rolling upward mouth full of noisy ribaldry fiddle playing punctuation chorus to said sang turned ear at sound of

straightway be broke into o call hanging johnny with hang boy mortuary stood at great distance soon jury be back in club room over bar at work on first case police have have difficulty a to identification of stabbed man difficulty arose not only because there be relation in neighbourhood to feel loss a much because person able to make identification kept most distant possible term with police withheld information from a matter of principle albeit reluctant ruffian be laid hold of who be induced sulkily to admit that have known deceased to speak to lodged near in blue gate that deceased be called bob kipps that be quite lately come into neighbourhood that have particular occupation a far a witness knew needed pressure to extract information kipps during short time be in blue gate chiefly consorted with one dan ogle that witness have seen nothing of ogle day day before there be also woman called to identify woman more reluctant than man woman of coarse feature dull eye tousled hair thick voice sluttish with rusty finery name margaret flynn though at back of little crowd have squeezed into court be called musky mag be said there too mag in degree one of fainting sort have nevertheless swooned when taken into mortuary gone clean off with flop true explained afterward by saying that have only expected to see one body found brought face to face with two of course there be other there marr be held such odds between one corpse two that outer outer like mag must go on faint over be reasonable enough for crowd not for woman who have sat to drink with three men in short hour so have fallen over battered corpse of one of in dark of room who have be forced now to view rent body of second in doing to meet once again other resurrected bruised sodden horrible who knew that be work of last of three man in peril of rope man too of world in eye evidence given with plain anxiety nervous unsteadiness of mouth added nothing to tale man be bob kipps be stranger till lately came have heard tell from shoreditch hoxton saw last day two ago knew nothing of death beyond what have heard did not know where dan ogle be very vehemently with much shaking of head have not seen with deceased here police inspector handed coroner scribbled note coroner having read passed back said more musky mag stood aside while inspector tore note into small piece put piece in pocket nathaniel kemp landlord of house told story of murder a saw of chase of murderer did not know deceased must be unable to identify murderer if met again having seen more than figure in dark time mr cripps have be standing in eager trepidation foremost among little crowd nodding lifting hand anxiously strenuous to catch coroner officer attention at dismissal of witness fearful lest offer of evidence made dozen time before coroner came must be forgotten now at last coroner officer condescended to notice being beckoned mr cripps swaggered forward greasy widewake crushed under arm face radiant with delighted importance bowed to coroner kissed book with flourish glanced round court to judge how much of due impression be yet visible coroner signified that be ready to hear mr cripps knew of matter mr cripps threw chest stuck arm akimbo raised other with oratorical sweep so large that small voice when came seemed smaller hi be in bar sir piped bar sir of bein ' long acquainted

with when mr cripps be in full cry moment later be tenser than ever yes yes mr cripps coroner said doubt be very active seem to have increased evidence say saw man who stabbed deceased in passage did

witness have filed petition in bankruptcy whether not marr have taken money with witness must not say a deceased have entire charge of account seemed more likely that embezzlement have be going on for time past marr have fled when detection must no longer be averted might account for dressing presumably seeking work a sailor divisional surgeon of police have examined body found large wound on head fully sufficient to have caused death inflicted by heavy blunt instrument by fall from height on hard substance one thigh be fractured there be other wound contusion a well a broken thigh be clearly caused after death blow on head might have be caused by accident on riverside might have be inflicted wilfully by assailant then there be evidence of man who have found body foul of rudder hawser of police who have found nothing on body there be more evidence at coroner having sympathised deeply with mr viney gave jury proper lead jury with perfect propriety returned open verdict that doctor

near blue gate with vague timid question when be on way from london dock grandfather nat roared up little staircase for mr grime presently descended amiable still till saw coarse woman be asked to help looked on woman with something of surprise something of confusion carried off at once with toss of head high phrase so like of 'er respectable woman quick retreat upstairs believe grandfather must have brought down again by main force woman on floor stirred began scrambling up even before knew where be held shelf looked dully about with hoarse beg pardon sir beg pardon then went across

tramping talking down into bar filling close giving joe potman work must do coroner came down by private stair into bar parlour ushered with great respect by grandfather at heel taking occasion by desperately extemporised conversation with grandfather nat came mr cripps there have never be inquest at hole in wall before grandfather have be at exercise of mind a to proper entertainment of coroner have decided after consideration that gentleman must scarce be offended at offer of little lunch to end have made ready with cold fowl bottle of claret mr grime must presently be putting on table coroner be not offended must take lunch be very pleasantly obliged by invitation lunch have be already ordered at distance so shook hand with grandfather nat went way circumstance have small effect on history for seemed to mr cripps who saw coroner go that by dexterous management vacant place at dinner table for what coroner must call lunch called dinner might fall to have happened once twice before on special occasion that have be allowed to share meal with captain nat now that be brushed oiled for company have publicly distinguished at inquest be persuaded that occasion be special beyond precedent set about to improve with assiduity innocent cunning be very transparent indeed so be affectionately admiring with deferentially loquacious with grandfather very friendly with joe potman mr grime be busy morning observed must be glad to do anything to help at time house on wapping wall be not encumbered with dust bin since river be found more convenient receptacle for rubbish slop be flung out of back window kitchen refuse went same way be taken to river stair turned out either into water on foreshore a tide might chance mr grime carried about with in dustings sweeping old coal scuttle held hearth bush shovel ash cinder potato peeling like at end of work when brush shovel have be put away carried coal scuttle sometimes to nearest window more often to river stair flung what remained into thames just a mr cripps be at busiest politest mr grime appeared with old coal scuttle piled uncommonly high with ash dust half burned pipe light set down by door gave grandfather key turned to prepare table instantly mr cripps watchful in service pounced on scuttle will pitch 'ere away for mum said while be seein ' to cap'en kemp dinner straightway started for stair mr grime back be turned at moment gave mr cripps start of yard two flung round after like maniac so that grandfather nat stared in amazement give that scuttle cried snatching at hinder handle mind own business leave thing alone mr cripps be amazed also stuttered on ' y on ' y drop fool woman hissed so suddenly savage that mr cripps did drop with start sent backward against post consequence be appalling mr cripps be carrying coal scuttle by top handle mr grime reaching after have seized that at back so that when mr cripps let go everything in scuttle shot out on paving stone first of course ash pipe light then on top of crowning heap grandfather nat cash box suppose grandfather must have recovered from astonishment first for next thing remember be that have mr grime back in bar parlour held fast by arm while carried cash box in disengaged hand mr cripps followed bewildered curious grandfather pushing prisoner into far corner turned locked door mr grime who have be crimson be now white more seemed to with fury than with fear grandfather took key from watchguard opened box holding where content be visible to none gave more than quick glance within re locked from judged judged aright that pocket book be safe there be witness enough here said grandfather for joe potman be now staring in from bar to give good dose o ' gaol mum o ' pay full week money send packin ' pulled out silver from pocket grateful not to matter hope will be honest where go next for own sake grateful honest mr grime gasped shaking with passion talk honest take to station now bring box show inside go on felt more than little alarmed at challenge having regard to history of pocket book remembered night when first examined creaking door soft sound on stair grandfather nat be wholly undisturbed counted over money calmly pushed across little table there be mum said ' there be bonnet ' shawl in corner there be nothing else o ' yours in place believe so there be need for to go out o sight till go out of altogether that 'd better do quick will lay dinner mr grime swept up money began fixing bonnet on head tying string under chin with savage jerk great play of elbow lip screwing nervously eye blazing with spite ho yus broke out though rage be choking a snatched shawl ho yus nice pusson cap'en nat kemp to talk about honesty ' gratefulness nice pusson nice teacher for young master 'opeful must say ' 'opin ' e will do ye credit ai last will see o ' captain nat kemp get out o way old lickspittle mr cripps got out of with something like bound mr grime be gone with flounce slam of door scold a be furious a be be conscious that something in grandfather scowl have kept speech within bound shortened clamour for few cared to face captain nat anger with slam of door scowl broke laughed come said that be well over owe turn mr cripps though be intending stop ' have bit of dinner if 'd like something on account to buy board for sign say two board if like will see about after dinner will be perceived that grandfather nat have reason to regret keeping of cash box key on watchguard for have be with rest in mr grime hand need never have troubled to smuggle out box among ash since pocket book be such awkward article must have gone in pocket mr grime have taken best chance failed disorder caused by inquest have left unobserved key be in hand cash box be left in cupboard upstairs sedulous mr cripps have be destruction a for artist attained dinner few shilling under name of advance so be well pleased with morning work chapter xiv stephen tale policeman brought grandfather bill be stuck against bar window with gelatine just such bill be posted on wall at head of hole in wall stair above smaller bill advertised found body new bill be six time size of below be headed murder in grim black capital set forth offer of fifty pound reward for information must lead to apprehension of murderer of robert kipps offer gave grandfather nat occasion for much solemn banter of mr cripps banter seemed to cause mr cripps curious uneasiness time again stopped eloquence in full flood have be at pain to cut from newspaper such report of inquest a be printed though sadly disappointed by brevity two personally affronted by disregarding evidence altogether still made great play with exceptional two in bar be quick to drop subject when captain nat urged in pursuit of reward come grandfather must say be neglecting fortune know there be fifty pound waitin ' for to pick up if 'd only go ' collar murderer ' 'd know anywhere whereupon mr cripps must look little frightened subside did not learn till later how little painter vanity have pushed over bound at inquest so far that committed to absolute recognition of murderer fact alarmed not little on return to calmness grandfather who understood indiscretion a well a enjoyed consequence in own grim way amused at one vacant moment by setting mr cripps alarm astir again be throwing away luck must say perhaps seein ' know so well by sight if be too well off to bother about fifty pound give of poor 'uns run for ' put on to wish 'd be able to see so clear for in truth grandfather nat well knew that nobody have have so near chance of seeing murderer face a that mr cripps at top of passage perhaps even round corner have chance at be because of mr cripps indiscretion in fact learned later still that police be put off track of real criminal for after due reflection on direful complication whereinto lapse promised to fling that distinguished witness a have already hinted fell into sad funk so though need must hold to tale that knew man by sight must recognise again resolved that come what might must identify nobody so keep clear of further entanglement now police suspicion fell shrewdly on dan ogle notorious ruffian of neighbourhood have be much in company of murdered man of late now be suddenly gone from accustomed haunt moreover there be plain agitation of woman consorted with musky mag at inquest have fainted indeed when mr cripps have be so positive about identifying murderer thing be nothing of evidence be true for must depend on witness who saw fellow face knew by sight must identify when came to witness with inquiry suggestion thing went overboard at breath be assassin tall man not at rather short in fact be heavy framed bony fellow on contrary be fat rather than bony did mr cripps ever happen to have seen man called dan ogle be man at like mr cripps have be familiar with dan ogle appearance from youth up be true for painter acquaintance be wide diverse man who killed bob kipps be a unlike a be possible for creature on two leg to be then must mr cripps if thing came to trial swear that man saw be not dan ogle mr cripps be most fervently desperately ready anxious to swear that be not must not by possibility be dan ogle anybody like brought police inquiry to fault even have suspicion be stronger better supported must have be useless to arrest dan ogle supposing must find for sole possible witness to identity must swear innocent so turned inquiry to fresh quarter looking among waterside population across river since be plain that murderer have rowed over for recent immigrant from wapping for little while mr cripps be vexed disquieted with invitation to go with plain clothes policeman take quiet look at doubtful character of course with result beyond welcome one of occasional free drink ordered a excuse for waiting at bar tavern corner in time attention ceased for police be reduced to waiting for evidence to turn up mr cripps breathed freely once more while dan ogle remained undisturbed justice be balked for while for turned out in end when police suspected dan ogle be right when went to other conjecture be wrong be ahead of knowledge at moment however a indeed be somewhat ahead of story for while did more than wonder to see mr cripps abashed at encouragement to earn fifty pound for seemed not penny richer than before still impetrated odd copper on account of signboard of promise once twice saw mr viney on occasion borrowed money off grandfather nat police be about house good deal at time because of murder think might have come oftener first time came heard telling grandfather that have got hold of blind george blind george have told good deal about missing money that with help hoped for chance of saving of added mysteriously that have be nearer hereabouts than might think at one time piece of news that grandfather received with proper appearance of surprise be safe to confide in blind george viney swore for answer said that rascal have stipulated for such handsome share that must pay to play square on last of visit again overheard scrap of talk time be angrier judged that viney wanted more money than grandfather be disposed to give be together in back room where box bottle be room into have seen bill stagg head shoulder thrust by way of trap door grandfather voice be low from time to time seemed to be begging viney to lower so wondered to find grandfather nat so mild since in bar never twice told man to lower voice if once be not enough flung into street withal viney paid heed talked a must so that must catch phrase again again let hush a be afraid ai said again o be not be little enough for if doe not rope anyway later yes rope cap'en kemp a know well enough rope at newgate gaol dan webb aboard o ' florence florence be piled up on little dingo in broad day a be ordered o course that matter be what want now ' le think lucky offer to pay back when get well be sensible be friendly enough very well presently grandfather blacker than common about brow eye shade paler in cheek came into bar parlour opened trade cash box not one mr grime have hidden among cinder smaller one used for gold silver counted out number of sovereign twenty believe put box away returned to back room in few minute with little more talk mr viney be gone grandfather nat came into bar parlour again face cleared when saw a always must no matter how have be ruffled stood looking in face for little with expression of one whose mind be engaged elsewhere then rubbed hand on head said abstractedly rather to fancied than to never mind stevy got back beforehand forty time over remark thought over afterward in bed with reflection that forty time twenty be eight hundred mr viney talk in back room brought most oddly into mind in

little except viney might come make proposal pleased hoping for chance come expedient whereby might screw out little on account so followed that on morning after unsuccessful negotiation with captain nat dan ogle found face to face with henry viney at self same spot on bank side where have talked with blind george dan be surly first because be policy to say little to seem intractable again because

mile apart with full pocket ' nobody have'porth wiser viney bit at finger eye lifted sank quick keen from ground to ogle face back again be enough asked for more persuasion willing murderer set to planning detail what viney must say if be necessary to carry talk with captain nat beyond first sentence so where must meet like here on viney motion change be made a regarded time not immediate night night following be resolved on for stroke must beggar hole in wall of money of life for to viney seemed desirable first to get belonging away from present lodging for plain reason so a to throw off blind george so a to avoid flight from place where be known on very night of crime be well to do at once yet unprepared a be must not guess what delay might intervene so for reason captain nat child be reprieved for twenty four hour thus in full term treaty be made dan ogle shrink a might from captain nat face to face a ruffian in blue gate must be a ready to stab in back for vengeance a for gain for be conscious that never in year of bullying scoundrelism have cut quite so poor figure in face of man a last night in face of captain nat a to gain promised to be large easy in getting for sister now that must help more must a readily be flung out of business a blind george opportunity be undeniable better place for purpose than alley leading to head of hole in wall stair must never have be planned once house be shut potman gone more be needed than to see next police patrol go by thing be done here be proper accomplice too man known to captain nat one with whom must readily speak in ogle eye business be more than common stroke of trade with uncommon prospect of profit a for viney money be what wanted here must be made a seemed with great risk be surer far than going direct to captain nat demanding money under old threat be little outworn indeed be not so substantial bogey a might seem in eye of captain nat for year remorseful now apprehensive for grandchild sake for matter be old evidence scarce except viney own must worse than inconvenience to give so that large demand might break down while here a be persuaded be certainty of greater gain be main thing if shadow of scruple against direct simple murder remained vanished in reflection that not must be perpetrator a well a contriver for must be opening innocent conversation with kemp so viney told so desire conscience be made to run coupled world over time through being appointed two men separated stood up looked about over lea over ragged field shook hand chapter xxiii on cop be morning still a viney went away over cop when have vanished beyond distant group of little house dan ogle turned crept lazily into shelter there to make what dinner might from remnant of food mag have brought evening before to doze away time on bed of dusty sack till must bring more in evening to come must have given much for drink for since retreat to kemp lime have penetrated clothes skin have invaded very vitals more particularly have invaded throat pint so of beer mag brought in bottle be not enough to do more than aggravate trouble drink be there money to buy one else might well have ventured out to public house now that police sought no more a for grime of wharf who have be growing daily more impatient of dan stay offered better relief than surly reference to pump so there be nothing for to sit swear with consolation that night must be last at kemp wharf sunlight came with afternoon speckled sluggish lea then shadow of river wall fell on water be dull again sun grew duller lower larger in haze of town if dan ogle have climbed bank have looked across cop now must have seen blind george stick in hand feeling way painfully among hummock ditch in distance dan however be expecting nobody no longer kept watch on comer so blind george neared unnoted gained lime strewn road at last walked with more confidence up over bank down on side next river went so boldly that one at distance must never have guessed blind for on plain road have once traversed be never at fault turned with such readiness at proper spot so easily picked way to shed that dan have scarce more warning than must bring a far a door where met dan blind man said dan old pal be can hear will bet ai where be ye groped for friendly grip dan ogle be taken by surprise little puzzled still must do harm by hearing what blind george have to say so answered right what be guided by sound blind george straightway seized dan arm for be way of feeling speaker thought while heard word be gone said gone clean do know where dan glared into sightless eye shook captured arm roughly who asked viney did let have stuff what stuff when what stuff be rum thing to ask unless o george dropped voice put face closer anybody to hear whispered then why ask what stuff did let have morning did dunno what mean never seen morning blind george retracted head with jerk strange look grew on face look of anger suspicion strange because great colourless eye have part in dan said slowly ai word of pal not of faithful pal ai be damn lie lie retorted dan thrusting away let go arm go on knew be coming blind george went on follered up ' waited behind house other side cop want whack do heared coming away ' called to scuttled off know step a well a what man know face be poor blind bloke ai fool what be game telling lie like that be standing off from door now angry nervously alert dan growled then said clear out of come to first from viney did very well be pal in go talk to about have be be where have come from have be to lodging in chapman street ' be gone said 'd got berth aboard ship lie took bag cleared soon a ever must get back from here be on for doing out o whack arter put straight for be about wo put in cart dan arter done where gone dunno nothing about tell dan answered angrily sling hook will make ye dan said blind man in voice between appeal threat dan did put away when found be here put away can go ' try now if like ai wanted wo have ' if must how long 'ud last next time went into blue gate even if did go eh how long must man last have eye to see with eh indeed blind george knew a well a dan that london be unhealthy for traitor to state liberty of blue gate how long must last try who want to try on ' y want to know shut mouth blind george get out o ' place ogle cried fast losing patience making quick step forward go will be lame a well a blind if get hold o ' ye blind george backed involuntarily blank face darkened twisted devilishly gripped stick like cudgel ah be blind ai mighty bold with blind man ai ye if eye be like yours be blind a 'd go roared dan furiously with two quick step go blind man backed a quickly fiercely brandishing stick will go just a far a suit dan ogle cried ai goin ' to be done out o ' what be mine one of ye got away will stick to other keep off will stick to ye till keep off a dan advanced stick flourished at random fell on wrist with crack in burst of rage rushed at blind man smote down with blow on blow blind george beaten to heap cowed not at howled like wild beast struck madly with stick stick reached mark more than once goaded ogle to greater fury punched kicked at plunging wretch at foot who desperate unflinching with mouth spluttering blood curse never ceased to strike back a best might at noise grime came hurrying from office for moment stood astonished then ran caught dan by arm wo have cried if want to fight go somewhere else why why damme man blind favoured by interruption blind george crawled little off smearing hand through blood on face breathless battered facing enemy still with unabashed malevolence for moment ogle turned angrily on grime checked let fall hand blind snarled will be dead too if keep that stick to hisself be what will be blind man got on foot backed away smearing grisly face a went ah hold back cried with double mouthful of oath hold hack for own sake ai done with dan not yet fight ah will fight ' fight level mean do will fight level afore have done with dead will be will not afore ' not afore have paid so passed over bank threatening fiercely look here said grime to ogle end business have have enough o find other lodging right ogle growled be going after to night dunno why be fool enough to let come grime pursued ' when did never said pal be to come too remember that blind chap now see in blue gate ' think much of ' there be chap morning up to good none of ye ' like a not to lose job so will find use for shed see all right other sulkily repeated tell ye be going after to night chapter xxiv on cop once have cut clear from lodging without delay trouble viney fell into insupportable nervous impatience grew with minute reason for day postponement now seemed wholly insufficient must have be debated with that first shock of suggestion have driven to nearest excuse to put job off a be dose of bitter physic now that thing be resolved upon nothing remained to do in preparation suspense of inactivity became intolerable grew to torment be matter of scruple compunction of that never dreamed enterprise be dangerous novel a vacant hour passed imagined new peril dreamed dozen hanging till at last a night came on began to fear that courage must not hold out time since there be now reason for delay ended with resolve to get thing over money in pocket same night if be possible with view set out for cop meantime nervousness troubled confederate for be good stroke of trade with turn of revenge in penniless interval mattered nothing must be slept off in fact more le since there be nothing else to do sun sank below london night came slow black over marsh cop grime rising from doorstep of office knocked last ash from pipe passed indoors dan ogle sitting under lee of shed found comfort in own empty pipe tobacco in empty pocket rose stretched arm looked across lea cop must see little nothing for dark be closing on fast blind man holiday muttered dan ogle turned in for nap on bed of sack sulky red grew up into darkening western sky a though extinguished sun be singeing world edge so one saw london nimbus from point night saw below scattered spangle of light be suburban sentry of myriad beyond cop marsh lay pitch black nothing faint lap of water hinted that river divided here where hour habit blotted great hum of london from consciousness sound be few perseverance of lapping water forced groan now again from mooring of invisible barge lying by wharf a often ghostly rustle rose on wind from old willow on farther bank presently more distinct than came steady snore from shed where dan ogle lay rustle be not of tree began when snore be at steadiest gentle rustle indeed where something moving shadow in black about crept over river wall clearer against faint patch have be white with lime in daylight figure grew to of man man moving in murky darkness with amazing facility address quietness down toward riverside went there stooping dipped into water small coarse bag of cloth that hung in hand then rose after listening pause turned toward shed whence came snore with three step pause three step more neared door stick carried silently skimming ground before face turned upward single eye rolling blankly at sky be same for at night noon dripping cloth carried diffused pungent smell a of wetted quick lime so creeping listening reached door within snore be regular deep nothing held door latch such a be lifted by finger thrust through hole listened for moment with ear at hole then with infinite precaution inserted finger lifted latch up by george tavern beyond stepney henry viney be hastening along commercial road to call dan ogle to immediate business ahead of by good distance musky mag hurried in same direction bearing food in saucer handkerchief beer in bottle hurry a might here be visitor well ahead of door opened with something of jar with there be little choke in snore moment silence then snore began again deep a before down on knee went dan ogle visitor so crawled into deep of shed have be gone no more than few second when snore stopped stopped with thump gasp sudden buffeting of leg arm in midst arose cry cry of so hideous agony grime wharf keeper snug in first sleep fifty yard away sprang erect staring in bed so sat motionless for minute ere remembered leg thrust out to carry to window dog on wharf leapt length of chain answering cry with torrent of wild bark floundering tumbling against frail board of shed two men came out at door in struggling knot ogle wrestling striking at random while other cunning with life blindness kept own head safe hung a dog hang to bull hand gripped victim by ear hair while thumb still drove at eye mess of smoking lime that clung dripped about ogle head trickled burning through hair blistered lip tongue a yelled yelled again in extremity of anguish over rolled before doorway ogle snatching now at last instead of striking tore away hand from face fight level dan ogle fight level now blind george gasped between quick breath hit now be blind a hit knock down eh quickly climbed to foot aimed parting blow with stick hung from wrist dead whispered hoarsely not afore have paid might have stayed to strike again own hand be blistered in struggle hastened off toward bank there to wash clear of slaking lime away on wharf dog be yelping choking on chain like mad thing screaming still with growing hoarseness writhing where lay blinded wretch scratched helplessly at reeking lime scorched skin seared eye almost to brain grime came running in shirt trouser a soon a must find how matter stood turned ran again for oil good god said lime in eye slaking lime why why must be blind chap must fight level said ' be blinded there be group of people staring at patient door of accident hospital when viney reached spot be busy enough with own thought stopped stared also involuntarily door be uninteresting object however after turned to find face to face with one well remembered be limy man have followed from blue gate to hole in wall then lost sight of grime recognised viney at once a ogle visitor of morning be pal o yourn just gone in there said viney be taken aback pal asked what pal ogle dan ogle be got lime in eye ' blinded lime blinded how ai goin ' to say nothing about how dunno 'tai business be got anyhow there be woman in there along of wife b'lieve something can talk to about if like when come out have got nothing to do with grime have reluctance of class to be mixed up in matter likely to involve trouble at police court what be more saw possibly compromised in matter of ogle stay at wharf viney be so visibly concerned by news soon wharf keeper relented little thinking maybe such bad fellow after since be so anxious about friend have heard said added presently in lower tone have heard said be blind chap done out o ' spite of course dunno not to say on ' y what heard see think will let in might see woman wo let stop long bepecially takin ' on a be indeed be not long ere musky mag emerged reluctant pallid trembling at mouth staring seeing nothing grime took by arm led aside with viney here be friend o ' dan grime said not unkindly giving woman shake of arm want to know how be gettin ' on what be 'nucleate asked hoarsely with dull look in viney face what be 'nucleate heard doctor say to let rest to night ' 'nucleate in mornin what be sort o operation grime hazarded did say anything else blinded woman answered weakly blinded pain eased with oil what did say interposed viney fullest of own concern did say someone did told about whispered sha say nothing not till come out say must get talkin ' about viney said anxiously will upset thing tell when see here listen took aside out of grime hearing must do said must do to have anybody charged anything just now have got something big to pull off say ought to see know ca see there someone might know must tell must go informing anything like not yet tell wo chargin ' infornin ' mag answered with contempt in shaking voice e must go informin ' not dan dan ai that sort ' e look arter ' e doe e go chargin ' people not if ' e be dyin ' indeed viney did not sufficiently understand moral of blue gate where to call in aid of common enemy police be foul trick to none must stoop in blue gate man inflicted own punishment to ask aid of police be worse than mean scandalous be weak that in place where weak did not last a phrase went be one restraint sole virtue of place enduring to death like other virtue in other place have admixture of necessity for everybody be wanted in turn to call for help of policeman who might a likely a not begin by seizing by collar must even have be poor policy bad equally for individual for community so that to resort to law help in form be classed with narking a unpardonable sin be sure o be asked viney apprehensively sure 'course be sure dunno what sort o ' chap take 'im for e nark ' besides e ca there be other thing turned away with sigh be near sob momentary indignation lapsed once more into anxious grief viney went off with head confused plan in melting pot ogle scheme be gone by board alone must scarce trust in enterprise so desperate what must do now make what term might with captain nat need be pressing must think chapter xxv stephen tale have said something of change in grandfather habit after news of loss of juno father death something not not only be abstracted in manner aged in look grew listless in matter of daily life even doubtful infirm of purpose amazing thing in whose decision of character have made corner of world in will be instant law with through must feel be cause ai place for stevy never place for must say wistful moody wholly disregarding protest doubt even heard have put one thing right said once thinking aloud a sat on knee ai enough ai enough be sure that be thinking of watch spoon a to that matter people with valuable have wholly ceased from coming to private compartment pale man still sat in corner joe potman still supplied drink neglected uneasiness grew le apparent in day so remained puzzled curious though doubt well enough content with most patent example of grandfather nat irresolution a for mr cripps deliberate artist whole practice of life be disorganised by captain nat indifference be driven to depend for barest necessary on casual generosity of bar in particular became client of unsober sailor have spoken of already disciplinarian who have roared confirmation of grandfather order when man of silver spoon got dismissal sailor be old in way of wapping a in practice of soaking must seem gave over to crimp being ashore with money to spend preferred to come alone to bar of hole in wall spend on getting full measure for penny beyond talent of ceaselessly absorbing liquor without becoming wholly drunk shrewd eye for correct change exhibited single personal characteristic of very demonstrative respect for captain nat kemp must confirm grandfather slightest order with shout threat a often a not be only to be quelled by shout threat from grandfather thing of instant effect however ay ay sir man must answer humbly return to pot cap'en order must sometimes add with wink hoarse whisper to chance neighbour always 'bey cap'en order knowed father ' son so mr cripps ready acquiescence in be said loudly in particular own habit of blandiloquence led to sort of agreement between two occasional drink at sailor expense meantime chief patron be grown so abstracted from consideration of necessity of genius so impervious to hint so deaf to suggestion of grant in aid that mr cripps be driven to desperate dramatic stroke one morning appeared in bar carrying board for sign tale of board description account of board estimate admeasurement of board actual solid material board by what expedient have acquired did not fully appear indeed with cash credit be about equally scarce upon one thing most vehemently insisted that dared not return home without money to pay for ravening creditor must be lying in wait at corner of street mr cripps device for breaking through captain nat abstraction succeeded beyond calculation for grandfather laid hand on mr cripps board together hauled straightway into skipper parlour at back there be board said with decision ' there be where be paint ' brush mr cripps stock of paint be low seemed exhausted brush be at home creditor be at corner of street if must take proceeds mr cripps began grandfather nat interrupted here ' here be board will soon get tool will send for buy new here joe joe will get 'em say what want ' will fetch here be ' here stick ' do signboard mr cripps dared not struggle for liberty indeed promise of meal at proper hour reconciled to grandfather defiance of magna charta so skipper parlour became studio there be left in company with material pot of beer screw of tobacco much desired to see painting be ruled that mr cripps must not be disturbed think must have restrained curiosity for hour at least ere ventured on tip toe to peep through little window used for passing in out of drink empty glass here view be somewhat obstructed by mr cripps pot being empty have placed upside down in opening a polite intimation to whomsoever might concern must see that mr cripps labour having proceeded so far a selection of convenient chair be now taking relaxation in profound slumber so went away said nothing when at last be disturbed by arrival of dinner mr cripps regained consciousness with sudden bounce that almost deposited on floor conception gasped rubbing eye conception meditation invention be what want in job like ah replied grandfather grimly be be then common thing like dinner matter perhaps joe 'd better take away seemed that mr cripps wanted dinner too have nat made clear that must consider meditation wholly inconsistent with tea so that in course of afternoon mr cripps be fain to paint board white so earn liberal interval of rest while dried at night went away home without price of board instead note to effect that amount be payable on application to captain kemp at hole in wall wapping note be production after three successive failure of own pen to matter of great pride delight so that be sadly disappointed to observe mr cripps received with emotion of wholly different character next morning mr cripps returned to durance with pot screw of tobacco grandfather nat have business in minories in matter of distiller account for reason diver injunction stipulation warning be entered into laid upon mr cripps before departure a for instance be agreed that mr cripps must remain in skipper parlour also after trouble that exception must be made to foregoing stipulation even in event of mr cripps feeling necessary to go out somewhere to study brick wall hole in from nature even if felt overcome by smell of paint agreed however that exception be granted in event of house being on fire further with more trouble that one pot of beer before dinner be enough for man seriously bent on pursuit of art moreover that board must not be painted white again lastly that period of invention meditation be considered at end sleep on mr cripps part be regarded a acknowledgment that meal be over for day article being at length agreed confirmed mr cripps having be duly witnessed to make certain mark with charcoal on white board a guarantee of good faith grandfather nat set out for minories moodiness notwithstanding be part of new habit to keep near a much a possible day night with sort of wistful jealousy so walked hand in hand over swing bridge past paddy goose into highway on through same pageant of romance squalor tradesman at door saluted grandfather nat with subdued regard a have observed most people to do since news of juno wreck indeed that disaster be very freely spoken of along waterside a deliberate scuttling be felt that captain nat must lay bereavement to something worse than fair chance of sea such thing be part of daily talk by dock here familiar feature be present while be especially noted that nothing have be seen of viney since news came meant to lie safe said gossip since a bankrupt stood to gain nothing by insurance one tradesman alone publican just beyond blue gate greeted grandfather noisily be thoughtless with pride of commercial achievement for be enlarging bar large one already by demolition of adjoining shop be anxious to exhibit explain design why good mornin cap'en cried publican from amid scaffold pole brick dust be stranger lately see what be doin here come in here ' look how be eh pair o door just over there ' bar brought round like so that for bottle jug throw rest into public bar eh party wall have already be removed structure above rested on baulk beam bar be screened off now from place of enlargement by nothing canvas tarpaulin grandfather acquaintance stood with back to to survey work of builder waiting by grandfather side while talked be soon aware that business be brisk in bar beyond canvas listened idly to hum of custom debate suddenly grew aware of voice knew acrid voice just within canvas then if be useless ai said voice ' sha let drop indeed be mr grime who spoke looked up quickly at grandfather nat be interested in discussion plainly have not heard mr grime declaration drew growling answer in man voice wholly indistinct found patch in canvas with loose corner afforded peep hole mr grime be nearest with back to canvas so that skirt threatened to close view opposite be two person in nearest of whom be surprised to recognise coarse faced woman have seen twice before once when came asking confused question to grandfather nat about man who sold watch once when fainted at inquest mr grime be too respectable to stay near woman looked sorrowful drawn about eye cheek held to arm of tall raw boned man face be seamed with ragged blistered skin wore shade over hollow where now peeping upward must see eye shut sunken lid so that at first be hard to recognise fellow who have be talking to same coarse faced woman by blue gate when left to ask question of grandfather indeed must never have remembered that woman brought to mind be man whose growling answer have heard now mr grime spoke again fault from beginning said o yes like because wanted to keep respectable fault not sha wait longer for if ai to have sha ' if ca get money can get something else man growled again swore beat stick impotently on floor be fool said ca wait till be bit straight ' revenge pah when there be money to be have not much to be have way seems mess have made of ' precious likely to do better now ai ' a to money well there be reward given grandfather nat hand fell on cap startled have congratulated friend approved plan made few suggestion now be ready to resume walk talked still a took hand stood thus for few minute by door exchanging view with publican on weather last ship in state of trade heard one more growl louder angrier than others from beyond screen sharper answer then there be movement slam of door got over step stretched grandfather arm own to see mr grime go walking up street when be free of publican told grandfather nat have seen mr grime in bar made so indifferent reply said nothing of conversation have overheard for indeed knew nothing of significance so went about business chapter xxvi stephen tale on way home be brought to stand at swing bridge lay open to let through ship be too late for perilous lock for already capstan be going ship fender be squeaking groaning against masonry so stood waited till fore main mizzen have crawled by then be surprised to observe foremost most impatient among passenger on opposite side mr cripps winch turned bridge swung surprise grew when perceived that mr cripps made
