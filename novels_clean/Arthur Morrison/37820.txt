preserver other similar weapon must not have be done with poker death be due to concussion of brain deceased have probably be dead seven eight hour when witness saw have since examined body more closely found mark at indicative of struggle having taken place indeed from position of wound severity must judge that deceased have be attacked unawares from behind have died at once body appeared to

smoking room be found fastened money be found in bureau in of opened drawer so that if have be there have be stolen pocket be entirely empty except for small pair of nail scissors there be watch upon

deceased for few year have done business for mr kingscote frequently called on one on tuesday evening dined together at ivy cottage sat smoking chatting till nearly twelve o'clock when mr kingscote let out servant having gone to bed here witness proceeded rather excitedly be know of horrible business can say nothing else what police mean by following watching coroner pray be calm mr campbell police must do what seems best to in case of sort be sure must not have neglect mean of getting at truth witness certainly not if suspect why say so be intolerable must be coroner order order mr campbell be here to give evidence witness then in answer to question stated that french window of smoking room have be left open during evening weather being very warm must not recollect whether not deceased closed before left certainly did not close shutter witness saw nobody near house when left mr douglas kingscote architect said deceased be brother have not seen for month living a did in part

in custody be cautioned elected to give evidence witness who appeared to be much agitated admitted having be in garden of ivy cottage at four in morning said that have only gone to attend to certain plant knew absolutely nothing of murder however admitted that have order for work beyond what have done day before being further pressed witness made various contradictory statement finally said that have gone to take certain plant away inquest be then adjourned be case a stood apparently not case presenting very striking feature although there seemed to to be doubtful peculiarity in many part of asked hewitt what thought quite impossible to think anything boy just yet wait till see place there be number of possibility kingscote friend campbell may have come in again know by way of window may not campbell may have owed money something may not anticipated wedding may have something to do with again may not there be limit to possibility a far a can see from report mere dry husk of affair when get closer will examine possibility by light of more detailed information one probability be that wretched gardener be innocent seems to that be only comparatively blameless manoeuvre not unheard of at other time in trade came at four in morning to steal away flower have planted day before felt rather bashful when questioned on point why must trample on bed else wonder if police thought to examine bed for trace of rooting up questioned housekeeper a to plant being missing will see chatted at random a train drew near finchley mentioned inter alia wanton piece of destruction perpetrated at kingscote late lodging hewitt be interested that be curious said very curious be anything else damaged furniture so forth know mr clayton said nothing of did ask be quite bad enough a be decoration be really good ca conceive meaner piece of tomfoolery than attack on decent woman property then hewitt talked of other case of similar stupid damage by creature inspired by defective sense of humour mere love of mischief have several curious sometimes funny anecdote of such affair at museum picture exhibition where damage have be so great a to induce authority to call in to discover offender work be not always easy chiefly from mere absence of intelligible motive indeed always successful one of anecdote related to case of malicious damage to picture outcome of blind artistic jealousy case have be hushed up by large expenditure in compensation must considerably startle most people must be printed here with actual name of party concerned ivy cottage finchley be compact little house standing in compact little square of garden little more than third of acre perhaps more at front door be dozen yard so back from road intervening space be well treed shrubbed mr douglas kingscote have not yet returned from town housekeeper intelligent matronly woman who knew of intention to call in martin hewitt be ready to show house first hewitt said when stood in smoking room observe that somebody have shut drawer bureau be unfortunate also floor have be washed carpet taken up be much worse that suppose be because police have finished examination doe help to make one at have anything anything at be left a be on tuesday morning well sir see everything be in such muddle housekeeper began when police have done just so know beet to right eh oh setting to right have lost fortune at one time a to other room now have be set to right such a be disturbed have be put right sir of course be disturbed let see wait moment opened french window closely examined catch bolt knelt inspected hole whereinto bolt fell then glanced casually at folding shutter opened drawer two tried working of lock with key housekeeper carried be housekeeper explained mr kingscote own key through lower floor hewitt examined thing attentively closely others with scarcely glance on system unaccountable to presently asked to be shown mr kingscote bedroom have not be disturbed set to right slept in since crime here housekeeper said drawer be kept unlocked two one in wardrobe one in dressing table mr kingscote have always be careful to keep locked hewitt immediately pulled drawer open without difficulty within in addition to few odds end be paper content of drawer have be turned over confusedly while of unlocked drawer be in perfect order police hewitt remarked may not have observed matter more than ordinary thing a added picking up bent nail lying at edge of rug housekeeper doubtless took remark a reference to entire unimportance of bent nail noticed that hewitt dropped article quietly into pocket came away at front gate met mr douglas kingscote who have just returned from town introduced expressed surprise at promptitude of coming going ca have got anything like clue in short time mr hewitt asked well hewitt replied with certain dryness perhaps not doubt whether month visit must have helped to get anything very striking out of washed floor houseful of carefully cleaned up beet to right room candidly think can reasonably expect much of police have much better chance have scene of crime to examine have seen just such few room a one might see in first well furnished house might enter trail of housemaid have overlaid others be very sorry for that fact be expected rather more of police indeed be here in time entirely to prevent clearing up still thought well known power dear sir known power be nothing common sense assiduously applied made quick by habit wo enable to see invisible ca have room put back into something of state be in cook will remember must be worse worse must only be housemaid trail in turn overlaid by cook must leave thing with for little think then give case up mr kingscote asked anxiously oh give up just yet do know anything of brother private paper a be before death never knew anything till after have gone over be very ordinary letter do suspect theft of paper martin hewitt with hand on stick behind looked sharply at other shook head said ca quite say that bade mr douglas kingscote good day walked towards station great nuisance setting to right hewitt observed on way if place have be left alone job might have be settled one way by time a be will have to run over to old lodging old lodging repeated amazed why old lodging hewitt turned to with chuckle wide smile because ca see broken panel work anywhere else said let see chelsea be yes chelsea why suppose people who defaced panel also murdered man who painted well hewitt replied with smile must be carrying practical joke rather far must even for ordinary picture damager mean think did then what do mean dear fellow mean anything what say come now be rather interesting case despite appearance have interested so much in fact that really think forgot to offer mr douglas kingscote condolence on bereavement see problem be problem whether of theft assassination intrigue anything else only think of a one work very often make forget merely human sympathy now have often be good enough to express very flattering interest in work will have opportunity of exercising own common sense in way be always having to exercise mine will see evidence if be lucky enough to get a collect will make own inference will be little exercise for sort of exercise must give pupil if have one will give what information have will start fairly from moment know inquest evidence such a be saw everything did in ivy cottage yes think so be not much wiser very well now will tell doe whole case look like how must class crime suppose a police do ordinary case of murder with object of robbery be not ordinary case if be must know a much a do little a be ordinary case be always difficult assailant did not come to commit burglary although be skilled burglar one of be if more than one be concerned affair have think nothing to do with expected wedding have mr campbell anything to do in at rate personally gardener criminal one of be known personally to dead man be well dressed again one of think there be two even have chat with mr kingscote before murder took place came to ask for something mr kingscote be unwilling to part with perhaps have got be not bulky thing now have material before doe look like result of blind spite must ruin man work first attack bodily afterwards spite be always blind there be other blind thing besides spite people with good eye in head be blind sometimes even detective where did get information what make suppose that be burglar who did want to burgle well dressed man so on hewitt chuckled smiled again saw saw boy be said here come train on way back to town after have rather minutely described kingscote work on boarding house panel hewitt asked for name profession of such fellow lodger in house a might remember when did leave ended three year ago rather more can remember kingscote turner medical student james turner think harvey challitt diamond merchant articled pupil be bad egg entirely be doing five year for forgery now by bye have room be going to see till be marched off kingscote took year before left there be norton know what be beomething in city think carter paget in admiralty office remember more at moment there be pretty frequent change can get from mr lamb of course of course mr lamb exact address be what gave address conversation became disjointed at farringdon station where alighted hewitt called two hansom preparing to enter one motioned to other saying get straight away to mr lamb at once may be going to burn splintered wood to set thing to right after manner of kind can stop must make one two small inquiry will be there hour after will tell object only may be able to catch mischievous lodger nothing else yet jumped into hansom be gone found mr lamb still in state of indignant perturbation over trick served four day before fortunately have left everything in panelled room exactly a have found with idea of being better able to demand enforce reparation must lodger return room theirs see sir said till end of week since paid in advance may come back offer to make amends although doubt a pleasant spoken young chap a might wish seemed a come to take room cousin ' say 'be rather invalid havin only just got over congestion of lung wo be in london till evening late be comin ' up from birmingham s hope wo catch fresh cold on way although of course have got muffled up plenty ' took room sir like gentleman mentioned several gentleman name knew well a have lodged here before then put down on that there very table sir mr lamb indicated exact spot with hand a though that made whole thing much more wonderful put down on very table week rent in advance s be always best sort of reference mr lamb think a kind mannered a anything never 'aggled about amount nothing only have little black bag said cousin have luggage coming in train a there be so much p r'aps must get here till next day then went out came in with cousin at eleven night sarah let in own self in morning be gone poor mr lamb plaintively indignant stretched arm towards wrecked panel if gentleman a say be comin ' on sir pursued can do anything to find 'em will prosecute will if cost ten pound spoke to constable on beat only looked like fool said if knew where be might charge with wilful damage county court 'em of course know can do if knew where be how can find 'em mr jones said name be how many jones be there in london sir must imagine answer to question like condoled with mr lamb a well a must afterwards went on to express herself much a sister have done with regard to kingscote death only a destruction of panel loomed larger in mind dwelt primarily on that might almost seem said that somebody have deadly spite on pore young gentleman went breakin up paintin ' one night murderin ' next examined broken panel with care having notion to attempt to deduce something from if possible must deduce nothing beading have be taken out panel be thick in centre bevelled at edge have be removed split up literally into thin firewood lay in tumbled heap on hearth about floor panel in room have be treated in same way result be pretty large heap of stick with nothing about to distinguish from other stick except paint on one face observed in many case have be scratched scraped away rug be drawn half across hearth have evidently be used to deaden sound of chopping mischief wanton stupid mischief be must deduce from mr jones cousin seemed only sarah have seen a admitted in evening then be so heavily muffled that must not distinguish feature must never be able to identify a for other one mr lamb be ready to swear to anywhere hewitt be long in coming internal symptom of approach of dinner time have have lunch have made felt before sharp ring at door bell foretold arrival have have to wait for answer to telegram said in explanation at rate have information wanted be mysterious panel be mr lamb true opinion of martin hewitt behaviour a proceeded must have be amusing to know watched in amazement antic of man who purposed finding out who have be splitting stick by dint of picking up separate stick staring at in end collected small handful of stick by handed to saying just put together on table brett see what make of turned piece painted side up fitted together into complete panel joining up painted design accurately be entire panel said good now look at stick little more closely tell if notice anything peculiar about particular in differ from others looked two adjoining stick said have small semi circular cavity stuffed with what seems to be putty put together must mean small circular hole perhaps knot hole inch so in diameter in panel filled in with putty whatever be knot hole hewitt asked with particular emphasis well no not knot hole of course because must go right through doe be probably le than inch deep from front surface anything else look at whole appearance of wood colour for instance be certainly darker than rest so be took two piece carrying puttied hole threw rest on heap addressed landlady mr harvey challitt who occupied room before mr kingscote who got into trouble for forgery be mr harvey challitt who be robbed of diamond few month before on staircase be yes sir mr lamb replied in bewilderment certainly be that on own office stair chloroformed just so when marched away because of forgery mr kingscote changed into room yes very glad be be bad enough to have disgrace brought into house without trouble of trying to get people to take very room thought yes yes very awkward very awkward hewitt interrupted rather impatiently man who took room on monday now 'd never seen before have sir then be that anything like hewitt held cabinet photograph before why why law yes be hewitt dropped photograph back into breast pocket with contented um picked up hat think may soon be able to find that young gentleman for mr lamb be not very respectable young gentleman perhaps be well rid of even a be come brett added day have be wasted after made towards nearest telegraph office on way said that puttied up hole in piece of wood seems to have influenced be important link well yes hewitt answered be other piece be important too why because there be hole in looked quizzically at wondering face laughed aloud come said wo puzzle much longer here be post office will send wire then will go dine at luzatti sent telegram cabbed to luzatti among actor journalist others who know town like good dinner luzatti be well known went upstairs for sake of quietness took table standing alone in recess just inside door ordered dinner then hewitt began now tell what conclusion be in matter of ivy cottage murder mine have one be sorry be so very dull really have come will give point here be newspaper account torn sacrilegiously from scrap book for benefit of robbery perpetrated on harvey challitt few month before forgery read oh remember circumstance very well be carrying two packet of diamond belonging to firm downstairs to office of firm of diamond merchant on ground floor be quiet time in day half way down be seized on dark landing made insensible by chloroform robbed of diamond five six thousand pound worth altogether of stone of various smallish individual value up to thirty pound so lay unconscious on landing till one of partner noticing that have be rather long gone followed found be think yes be well what do make of be afraid quite see connection with case well then will give point telegram have just sent release information to police in consequence of will probably apprehend harvey challitt confederate henry gillard alias jones for murder of gavin kingscote now then challitt be in gaol already tut tut consider five year penal be dose although for first offence because forgery be of extremely dangerous sort left chelsea over three year ago told that difficulty occurred year before make four year at least good conduct in prison brings man out of five year sentence in time little le a matter of fact challitt be released rather more than week ago still be afraid see what be driving at whose story be about diamond robbery from harvey challitt own exactly own doe subsequent record make look like person whose story be to be accepted without doubt question why think see mean stole have sort of dim perception of drift now still ca fix whole thing too complicated be little complicated for first effort admit so will tell be story harvey challitt be artful young man decides on theft of firm diamond first prepares hiding place somewhere near stair of office when opportunity arrives put stone away spill chloroform make smell possibly sniff actually go off on stair whole thing done be carried into office diamond be gone tell of attack on stair a have heard be believed at suitable opportunity take plunder from hiding place go home to lodging what be to do with diamond ca sell yet because robbery be publicly notorious regular jewel buyer know being criminal novice doe know regular receiver of stolen good if did must prefer to wait get full value by ordinary sale there will always be danger of detection so long a stone be not securely hidden so proceeds to hide know that if suspicion be aroused room must be searched in likely place so look for unlikely place of course think of taking out panel hiding behind idea be so obvious that wo do police must certainly take panel out to look behind therefore determines to hide in panel see here took two piece of wood with filled hole from tail pocket opened penknife putty near surface be softer than near bottom of hole two different lot of putty differently mixed perhaps have be used therefore presumably at different time to return to challitt make hole with centre bit in different place on panel in hole place diamond embedding carefully in putty smooth surface carefully flush with wood then very carefully paint place over shading off paint at edge so a to leave sign of patch doe do whole job at once creating noise smell of paint keep on steadily few hole at time till in little while whole wainscoting be set with hidden diamond panel be apparently sound whole then there be only one such hole in whole lot just so very circumstance tell whole truth let tell story first will explain clue after diamond lie hidden for few month grows impatient want money ca see way of getting at last determines to make bolt go abroad to sell plunder know will want money for expense that may not be able to get rid of diamond at once also expects that suddenly going abroad while robbery be still in people mind will bring suspicion on in case so in for penny in for pound commits bold forgery have be successful must have put in fund enabled to leave country with stone forgery be detected be haled to prison leaving diamond in wainscot setting now come to gavin kingscote must have be shrewd fellow sort of man good detective be made of also must have be pretty unscrupulous have suspicion about genuineness of diamond robbery kept eye open what indication have to guide know living in same house sharp fellow on look out must probably see enough at rate led to belief that diamond be in thief room not among movable must have be found after arrest here be chance challitt be out of way for year there be plenty of time to take house to piece if be necessary so changed into challitt room how long took to find stone will never know probably tried many other place first expect found diamond at last by pricking over panel with needle then came problem of getting out without attracting attention decided not to trust to needle might possibly leave stone two undiscovered to split up panel carefully into splinter so a to leave part unexamined therefore took measurement have number of panel made by joiner of exact size pattern of in room announced to landlady intention of painting panel with pretty design to account for wet paint even for fact of panel being out of wall must chance to bounce into room at awkward moment very clever eh very ah be smart man doubt well went to work taking out panel substituting new one painting over chopping up old one on quiet getting rid of splinter out of door when booty have be extracted decoration progressed little heap of diamond grew finally came to last panel found that have used new panel have one left for substitute must have be at time when be difficult to get hold of joiner bank holiday perhaps sunday be impatient so scraped paint off went carefully over part of surface experience have taught by hole be of same sort found one diamond took out refilled hole with putty painted old panel put back be piece of old panel only old one of lot nine men out of ten must have got out of house a soon a possible after thing be done be cool hand stayed that made whole thing look deal more genuine than if have unaccountably cleared out a soon a have got room nicely decorated expect original capital for stock exchange operation heard of came out of diamond stayed a long a suited left when set up housekeeping with view to wedding rest of story be pretty plain guess of course yes said think can guess rest in general sort of way except a to one two point be plain perfectly see here challitt in gaol determines to get diamond when come out to do without being suspected will be necessary to hire room know that wo be able to do because landlady of course know wo have ex convict in house there be help for must have confederate share spoil so make acquaintance of convict who seems likely man for job whose sentence expires about same time a own when come out arranges matter with confederate who be well mannered pretty well known housebreaker latter call at mr lamb house to look for room very room happens to be to let of course be taken challitt who be invalid cousin come in at night muffled unrecognisable decoration on panel doe not alarm because of course suppose to have be done on old panel over old paint challitt try spot where diamond be left there be none there be putty even perhaps think panel have be shifted interchanged in painting so set to work split up a have seen getting more desperate a go on finally realize that be done clear out leaving mr lamb to mourn over mischief know kingscote be man who have forestalled because gillard jones in chat with landlady have heard about painting of panel so next night set off for finchley get into kingscote garden watch let campbell out while be gone challitt quietly step through french window into smoking room wait for gillard remaining outside kingscote return challitt accuses of taking stone kingscote be contemptuous doe care for challitt because know be powerless being original thief besides know there be evidence since diamond be sold dispersed long ago challitt offer to divide plunder with kingscote laugh tell to go probably threatens to throw out challitt being smaller man gillard at open window hears step in behind quietly knock on head rest follows a matter of course fasten window shutter to exclude observation turn over drawer etc in case jewel be there go to best bedroom try there so on failing possibly being disturbed after few hour search by noise of acquisitive gardener gillard with instinct of old thief determines sha go away with nothing so empty kingscote pocket take watch chain so on go out by front door shut after voila tout be filled with wonder at prompt ingenuity of man who in few hour of hurried inquiry must piece together so accurately material of intricate mysterious affair such a more wondered where how have collected material there be doubt hewitt said that accurate minute application of what be pleased to call common sense have become something very like instinct with what did deduce from told conclusion from examination of ivy cottage not how arrived at did leave much material downstairs did in bedroom two drawer thief found locked be ransacked opened probably with key taken from dead man on floor saw bent french nail here be see be twice bent at right angle near head near point there be faint mark of plier be used to bend be very usual burglar tool handy in experienced hand to open ordinary drawer lock therefore knew that professional burglar have be at work have probably fiddled at drawer with nail first then have thrown down to try dead man key knew professional burglar did come for burglary from several indication there be attempt to take plate first thing burglar look for valuable clock be left on mantelpiece other thing usually go in ordinary burglary be not disturbed notably be to be observed that door window be broken have be forcibly opened therefore be plain that thief have come in by french window of smoking room only entrance left open at last thing therefore came in one did knowing that mr kingscote be up being quite willing presumably anxious to see ordinary burglar must have waited till have retired then must have got through closed french window a easily almost a if be open notwithstanding thin wooden shutter must never stop burglar for more than five minute being anxious to see again one of presumably knew that have come to get something be plain from ransacking a in end did steal money watch did not take larger valuable be plain that have bag with prof not only that have not come to burgle for burglar take bag that thing came to get be not bulky still must easily have removed plate clock by rolling up in table cover other wrapper bundle carried by well dressed men must attract attention therefore be probable that be well dressed do make clear quite nothing seems simpler now be explained that be way with difficult puzzle there be nothing more to be got at house have already in mind curious coincidence that panel at chelsea have be broken very night before of murder determined to look at in case got from name of man who have lived in panelled room before kingscote at once remembered although said nothing about a of young man who have be chloroformed for employer diamond keep thing of sort in mind see indeed in scrap book told about imprisonment there be with what seemed now hopeful case getting into promising shape went on to prevent setting to right at chelsea made enquiry a to challitt found have be released only few day before trouble arose also found name of man who be released from same establishment only few day earlier knew man gillard well knew that nobody be more likely rascal for crime a at finchley on way to chelsea called at office gave clerk certain instruction looked up scrap book found newspaper account of chloroform business also photograph of gillard keep a many of thing a can collect what did at chelsea know saw that one panel be of old wood rest new saw hole in old panel asked one two question case be complete proceeded with dinner presently said rest with police now of course of course must think very probable that challitt gillard will be caught gillard at rate be pretty well known will be rather hard on surviving kingscote after engaging to have dead brother diamond transaction publicly exposed a result wo ca be helped fiat justitia of course how will police feel over asked have rather cut out eh oh police be right have not information have see knew nothing of panel business if mr lamb have gone to scotland yard instead of to policeman on beat perhaps must never have be sent for same quality caused martin hewitt to rank a mere common sense extraordinary power of almost instinctive deduction kept respect for ability of police at perhaps higher level than might have considered justified sat little while over dessert talking a sat when there occurred one of curious conjunction of circumstance that notice again again in ordinary life forget a often unless importance of occasion fix matter in memory young man have entered dining room have taken seat at corner table near back window have be sitting there for little time before particularly observed at last happened to turn thin pale face in direction eye met be challitt man have be talking of sprang to foot in excitement be man cried challitt hewitt rose at word at first attempted to pull back challitt in guilty terror saw that be between door turning leaped upon sill of open window dropped out there be fearful crash of broken glass below everybody rushed to window hewitt drew through door ran downstairs pity let out like that said a went if 'd kept quiet must have sent out for police with trouble never mind ca help below challitt be lying in broken heap in midst of crowd of waiter have crashed through thick glass skylight fallen back downward across back of lounge be taken away on stretcher unconscious in fact died in week in hospital from injury to spine during period of consciousness made detailed statement bearing out conclusion of martin hewitt with most surprising exactness down to smallest particular gillard have parted immediately after crime judging safer not to be seen together have affirmed endured agony of fear remorse in few day since fatal night at finchley have even once twice thought of giving up when so excitedly pointed out knew at once that game be up took one desperate chance of escape offered to end persistently denied that have committed murder have even thought of till saw accomplished that have be wholly work of gillard who listening at window perceiving drift of conversation suddenly beat down kingscote from behind with life preserver so harvey challitt ended life at age of twenty six gillard be never taken doubtless left country have probably since time become known to police under name abroad perhaps have even be hanged if have be there be miscarriage of justice matter what charge against may have be nicobar bullion case whole voyage be unpleasant one captain mackrie of anglo malay company steamship nicobar have at last excuse for ill temper have made notorious unpopular in company marine staff although fourth fifth mate in seclusion of berth ventured deeper in search for motif opined that old man have made deal le out of voyage than usual company having lately taken to providing own store so that making be gone

hit with same blow indeed steward dolor might well be credited to short passenger list unpromising aspect of few passenger in eye of man accustomed to gauge one tip yielding capacity month in advance for steward be altogether wrong time of year wrong sort of voyage certainly wrong sort of passenger so doubtless confidential talk of fourth fifth officer be mere youthful scandal at rate captain have prospect of good deal in private trade home for have be taking curiosity japanese oddment aboard plainly for sale in london in way that third steward must have be ashamed of for captain be scandal ignominy have taken pain to insure well for lot thing fourth fifth mate often spoke of more than once made winking allusion to in presence of third mate chief engineer who laughed winked too sometimes

bullion to be landed at plymouth a usual presence of bullion be source of much conspicuous worry on part of second officer who have charge of bullion room for be first voyage on promotion from third officer charge of l worth of gold bar be thing have not be accustomed to placid first officer pointed out to that be first shipment of bullion world have ever known by long way largest also usual precaution be taken key be in captain cabin so that might reasonably be a easy in mind a few thousand other second officer who have have charge of hatch special cargo since world began did not comfort brasyer fidgeted about when off watch considering puzzling out various mean by bullion room might be got at fidgeted more when on watch lest somebody might be at moment putting into practice ingenious dodge have thought of did keep fear speculation to bothered first officer with when first officer escaped explained whole thing at length to third officer ca think what company about said on one such occasion to first mate calling tin pot bunker like bullion room skittle responded first mate went on smoking oh be very well for who be responsible brasyer went on be pretty sure something will happen day if not on voyage on other talk about strong room why what be made of three eighth boiler plate yes three eighth boiler plate about a good a sixpenny tin money box why 'd get through with grandmother scissors right borrow get through must if have grandmother there be down below there out of sight hearing nice handy for anybody who like to put in quiet hour at plate cutting from coal bunker next door always empty because be only seven ton bunker not worth trimming other side against steward pantry what be to prevent man shipping a steward getting quietly through while be supposed to be bucketing about among slop crockery strolling away with plunder at next port then there be carpenter be always messing about somewhere below with bag full of tool nothing easier than for to make job in quiet corner get through plate then what be to do with stuff when be got ca take gold ashore by hundredweight in boot do with why dump of course dump overboard in quiet port mark spot come to that must desert clean at port said what easier place take wanted know what port said like then there be fireman oh anybody can do brasyer moved off to take peep under hatchway door of bullion room be fastened by one central patent lock two padlock one above one below other lock day two after conversation recorded above brasyer be carefully examining trying lower of padlock with key when voice immediately behind asked sharply well sir what be up to with padlock brasyer started violently looked round be captain mackrie there be be be afraid be same sort of padlock a in carpenter store second mate replied in hurry of explanation be just trying be be afraid key fit just let carpenter take care of own store will mr brasyer there be chubb lock there a well a padlock key of be in cabin will take care doe go out of without knowledge so perhaps 'd best leave off experiment till be asked to make 'em for own sake be enough now captain added a brasyer appeared to be ready to reply turned on heel made for steward quarter brasyer stared after ragefully wonder what want down here muttered under breath seems to one doe often see skipper a thick with steward a turned off growling towards deck above hanged if like steward pantry stuck against side of bullion room said later in day to first officer what doe steward want with lot of boiler maker tool aboard know be got in name of prophet rat answered first mate who be of le fussy disposition what fatiguing creature be brasyer know man boiler maker by regular trade have only taken to stewardship for last year two sort of man doe like parting with tool a be widower with home ashore of course have to carry trap aboard do shut up take proper rest like christian here will give cigar be right burman stick in mouth keep jaw tight on there be soothing second officer still prowled about after orlop deck talked at large of anxiety for content of bullion room once again few day later a approached iron door be startled by appearance of captain coming time from steward pantry fancied have heard tapping brasyer explained have come to investigate captain turned back with even le ceremony than before swearing must give charge of bullion room to officer if brasyer persisted in eccentricity on first deck second officer be met by carpenter quiet sleek soft spoken man who asked for padlock key have borrowed from store during week brasyer put off promising to send back later carpenter trotted away to job happened to have singularly enough in hold just under after orlop deck below floor of bullion room a have said voyage be in way pleasant one everywhere weather be at worst scarce be gibraltar passed before lascar be shivering in cotton trouser seedee boy be buttoning tight such old tweed jacket a might muster from scanty kit be january in bay weather be tremendous nicobar banged shook pitched distractedly across in howling world of thunderous green sea washed within without above below then in chop a night fell something went there be more steerage way indeed anything else aimless wallowing screw have broken high sea have abated in degree be still bad such sail a steamer carried inadequate enough be set shift be made somehow to worry along to plymouth to falmouth if occasion better served by mean so nicobar beat across channel on rather better though anything smooth sea in black night made thicker by storm of sleet turned gradually to snow a hour advanced ship laboured slowly ahead through universal blackness seemed to stifle nothing black void above below around sound of wind sea so that one coming before deck light be startled by quiet advent of large snowflake came like moth a seemed from nowhere at four bell two in morning foggy light appeared away on starboard bow be eddystone light hour two later exact whereabouts of ship being thing of much uncertainty be judged best to lay to till daylight order have yet be given however when suddenly there be dim light over port quarter with more solid blackness beneath then shout thunderous crash whole ship shuddered in ten second have belched up living soul from below nicobar voyage be over be collision stranger backed off into dark two vessel drifted apart though not till from nicobar have jumped aboard other captain mackrie presence of mind be wonderful never for moment did lose absolute command of soul on board ship have already begun to settle down by stern list to port life belt be served out promptly fortunately there be two woman among passenger child boat be lowered without mishap presently two strange boat came a near a dare from ship large coasting steamer afterwards appeared that have cut into nicobar last of passenger be being got off safely when brasyer running anxiously to captain said ca do anything with bullion can sir perhaps box two damn bullion shouted captain mackrie look after boat sir get passenger off insurance company can find bullion for brasyer have vanished at skipper first sentence skipper turned aside to steward a crew engine room staff made for remaining boat two spoke quietly together presently steward turned away a if to execute order skipper continued in louder tone be likeliest stuff can drop at worst be slippy wo last ten minute lasted nearly quarter of hour by time however everybody be clear of captain in last boat be only just near enough to see last of light a went down ii day broke in sulky grey there lay nicobar in ten fathom not mile from shore topmast forlornly visible above boisterous water sea be rough day snow have ceased during night weather calmed considerably next day lloyd agent be steaming about in launch from plymouth soon salvage company tug came up lay to by emerging mast there be chance of raising ship a far a must be seen diver went down from salvage tug to measure breach made in nicobar side in order that necessary oak planking sheeting might be got ready for covering hole preparatory to pumping raising be done in very short time necessary telegram having be sent tug remained in place through night prepared for sending down of several diver on morrow to get out bullion a commencement just at time martin hewitt happened to be engaged on case of importance delicacy on behalf of lloyd committee be staying for few day at plymouth heard story of wreck of course speaking casually with lloyd agent a to salvage work just beginning be told name of salvage company representative on tug mr percy merrick name immediately recognised a of old acquaintance of own so that on day when diver be at work in bullion room of sunken nicobar hewitt gave holiday went aboard tug about noon here found merrick big pleasant man of thirty eight so be very glad to see hewitt be great deal puzzled a to result of morning work on wreck two case of gold bar be missing there be l worth of bullion on board said that be plain certain be packed in forty case of l value now there be only thirty eight case two be gone clearly wonder what be happened suppose men know anything about asked hewitt be right see be impossible for to bring anything up without being observed especially a have to be unscrewed from diving dress here on deck besides bless be down with oh do dive then well put dress on sometimes know for such special occasion a went down morning there be difficulty in getting about on vessel below found key of bullion room just where captain said must in cabin lock be useless of course after being couple of day in salt water so just burgled door with crowbar then saw that might have done bit more easily from outside for coasting steamer cut clean into bunker next bullion room ripped open sheet of boiler plate dividing two missing case must have dropped out way of course oh looked of course must have be impossible vessel have list other way to starboard piled case did reach a high a torn part well a said burgled door there be thirty eight sealed bullion case neither more le be down below in after cabin at moment come see thirty eight be pine case bound with hoop iron sealed at joint case about eighteen inch by foot six inch deep be corded together two two apparently for convenience of transport did cord like asked hewitt be how found just hooked on block tackle pair at time hauled up here aboard tug what have done about missing two anything wired off to headquarters of course at once have sent for captain mackrie be still in neighbourhood believe brasyer second officer who have charge of bullion room may possibly know something anyway one thing plain there be forty case at beginning of voyage now there be only thirty eight there be pause then merrick added by bye hewitt be rather line be ought to look up two case hewitt laughed right said will begin minute if will commission well merrick replied slowly of course ca do without authority from headquarters if have nothing to do for hour so there be harm in putting on considering cap be there although of course there be nothing to go upon a yet might listen to what mackrie brasyer have to say of course know a be l question probably might pay if do see way to anything 'd wire get commissioned at once there be tap at door captain mackrie entered mr merrick said interrogatively looking from one to be sir answered merrick be captain mackrie of nicobar sent for believe something wrong with bullion be told be merrick explained matter fully thought perhaps might be able to help captain mackrie perhaps have be wrongly informed a to number of case must have be there no there be forty right enough think though perhaps might be able to give sort of hint captain mackrie looked hard at hewitt be mr hewitt captain mackrie merrick interposed may speak a freely a please before in fact be sort of working on business so to speak well mackrie said if be so speaking between ourselves must advise to turn attention to brasyer be second officer know have charge of stuff do mean hewitt asked that mr brasyer might give useful information mackrie gave ugly grin very likely might said if be fool enough think 'd get much out of direct meant might watch what do suppose be concerned in way with disappearance of gold must think speaking a said before in confidence between ourselves that be very likely indeed did like manner through voyage why well be so eternally cracking on about responsibility pretending to suspect stoker carpenter one person of trying to get at bullion case that alone be almost enough to make one suspicious protested so much see be so conscientious diligent rest of everybody else be such desperate thief be so sure there must be of bullion missing day that well know if express manner clearly tell did like bit there be something more than that be eternally smelling about place peeping in at steward pantry adjoins bullion room on one side know nosing about in bunker on other side once actually caught fitting key to padlock key 'd borrowed from carpenter store time excuse be that fancied heard somebody else trying to get in to gold something of sort time caught below on orlop deck be excuse happened to have heard something suspected something somebody time whether not succeed in conveying impression to gentleman can assure that regarded whole manner action a very suspicious throughout voyage made up mind must forget if by chance anything did turn out wrong well have now have told what have observed be for to see if will lead anywhere just so hewitt answered let fully understand captain mackrie say that mr brasyer have charge of bullion room that be trying key on from carpenter store where be legitimate key then in cabin be only handed out when knew what be wanted for there be chubb lock between two padlock duplicate must have be hard for brasyer to get must easily have taken wax impression of key when used at port where took bullion aboard well suppose have taken box where do think must keep shrugged shoulder smiled impossible to say replied might have hidden somewhere on board though think be likely 'd have have deuce of job to land at plymouth must have have to leave somewhere while came on to london bullion be always landed at plymouth know if be found to be missing then ship must be overhauled at once inch of so that 'd have to get plunder ashore somehow before rest of gold be unloaded almost impossible of course if be done that be somewhere below there now be likely 'd be much more likely to have 'dumped dropped overboard at well known spot in foreign port where must go later on get so that have deal of scope for search see anywhere under water from here to yokohama captain mackrie laughed soon afterward left a be leaving man knocked at cabin door looked in to say that mr brasyer be on board will be able to have go at now said captain good day there be steward of nicobar there too sir said man after captain have gone carpenter very well will see mr brasyer first said merrick man vanished seems to have got about bit merrick went on to hewitt only sent for brasyer a others have come perhaps have got something to tell brasyer made appearance overflowing with information required little assurance to encourage to speak openly before hewitt said again all have so often said before on board nicobar bullion room be mere tin box whole thing be a easy to get at a anything must be did wonder in least at loss have prophesied along men whose movement must be carefully watched said be captain steward nobody ever heard of captain steward being so thick together before said steward pantry be next against bullion room know with nothing that wretched bit of three eighth boiler plate between must often expect to find captain down in steward pantry must thick a might be well be where used to find time again steward kept boiler maker tool there can swear to be be boiler maker so likely a not must open joint somewhere patch up again neatly so that must be noticed be always messing about down there in pantry once distinctly heard knocking there when went down to see whom must meet why skipper coming away from place bullyragged for being there sent on deck before that bullyragged because have found out that there be other key knocking about place fitted padlock on bullion room door why must slang threaten for looking after thing keeping eye on bullion room a be duty be very thing that did like be enough for to see anxious about gold to make furious of course character for meanness greed be known through company service will do anything to make bit have positive idea a to what have become of gold well brasyer replied with rather knowing air think have dumped do mean think be still in vessel hidden somewhere believe captain steward took ashore one case when came off in boat must that be noticed need be on black night like see parcel be not so big look at foot by foot half by six inch so roughly easily slipped under big coat covered up with anything of course be bit heavy eighty ninety pound apiece altogether be not much for strong man to carry especially in such handy parcel on black night with end of confusion on now just look here will tell something skipper went ashore last in boat be sent out by coasting steamer ran into that ship put into dock for repair crew be mostly having easy time ashore now have be asleep last day two have sort of notion there might be game of sort on because when left ship night thought might save little at least of stuff skipper must let go near bullion room that seemed odd so got hold of one of boat crew fetched skipper ashore questioned quietly pumped know assures that skipper did have rather small heavy sort of parcel with what do think of of course in circumstance man must remember very distinct particular thought be sort of square wooden case about size have mentioned there be something more brasyer lifted fore finger then brought down on table before something more have made inquiry at railway station find two heavy parcel be sent off yesterday to london deal box wrapped in brown paper of just about right size paper got torn before thing be sent off clerk must see that box inside be fastened with hoop iron like second officer pointed triumphantly to box piled at one side of cabin well done said hewitt be smart detective did find out who brought parcel who be addressed to must get quite a far a of course clerk did know name of sender not knowing must tell exactly where parcel be going got quite chummy with after bit be going to meet presently have afternoon off be going for stroll will find something more will bet certainly replied hewitt find can may be very important if get valuable information will let know at once of course anything else now think so think what have told be pretty well enough for present eh will let know more soon brasyer went norton steward of old ship be brought into cabin be sharp eyed rather cadaverous looking man spoke with sepulchral hollowness have heard said that there be something wrong with chest of bullion came on board to give information must be much went on to say smallest thing might help if might speak strictly confidentially must suggest that observation be kept on wickens carpenter norton did want to be uncharitable pantry happened to be next bullion room have heard wickens at work for very long time just below on under side of floor of bullion room seemed to although of course might have be mistaken still be very odd that carpenter always seemed to have job just at spot more have be said norton believed to be true that wickens carpenter have in possession kept among store key that fitted padlock on bullion room door that seemed to be very suspicious circumstance did know anything more definite offered idea for what be worth if suspicion proved unfounded nobody must be more pleased than steward shook head doubtfully thank mr norton said merrick with twinkle in eye wo forget what say of course if stuff be found in consequence of of information wo lose by steward said hoped not must fail to keep eye on carpenter have noticed wickens be in tug trusted that if be going to question must do cautiously so a not to put on guard merrick promised must by bye mr norton asked hewitt supposing suspicion to be justified what do suppose carpenter must do with bullion well sir replied norton think 'd keep on ship 'd probably dump somewhere steward left merrick lay back in chair guffawed aloud grows farcical said simply farcical what happy family must have be aboard nicobar now here be captain watching second officer second officer watching captain steward steward watching carpenter be immense now be going to see carpenter wonder whom suspect hewitt said nothing eye twinkled with intense merriment presently carpenter be brought into cabin good day to gentleman said carpenter in soft deferential voice looking from one to other might 'ave honour of addressin ' salvage gentleman be right merrick answered motioning to seat be salvage shop mr wickens what can do for carpenter coughed gently behind hand took liberty of comin ' gentleman consekins o ' a there be bullion missin ' p'raps be wrong not at have found a much a expected suppose by time nearly everybody know there be two case wanting ca tell where be suppose well sir a to that fear ca exactly go a far a if be able to give vallable information a may lead to recovery of same presoom may without offence look for reasonable small recognition of service oh yes answered merrick will be right promise company will do handsome thing of course doubt so will underwriter presoomin ' may take that a promise among gentleman with emphasis be willing to tell something be promise at rate a far a company concerned returned merrick will see be made worth while of course providing lead to anything purvidin ' sir o ' course well gentleman story ai long one have to say be what 'eard on board just before went down passenger be off crew be gettin ' into other boat when skipper turn to steward ' speaks to quiet like not observin ' gentleman a be agin 'be elbow so for to say `` ere norton ' e sez word to effeck 'why must try gettin ' thing ashore with know case eh have notion be pretty close inshore e sez 'and there be nothink of sea now take one anyway will try other e say 'but make flourish then sez louder 'cos o ' steward goin ' off be likeliest stuff at worst can drop look sharp e say so then get into nearest boat be 'eard be asked hewitt watching man face sharply carpenter answered with surprise yes be think be pretty well enough be plain enough what be meant steward be to take two case one apiece on quiet be likeliest stuff aboard a said now there be two case o bullion missin ' ai that enough carpenter be not satisfied till exact note have be made of captain word then after merrick promise on behalf of company have be renewed wickens took off well said merrick grinning across table at hewitt be queer go be what that man say make skipper case look pretty fishy doe what say what brasyer say taken together make pretty strong case must say make thing certainty what business be likely to be bit serious for one be rare joke in way wonder if brasyer will find out anything more pity skipper steward did agree a to whom must pretend to suspect be mistake on part not at hewitt replied if be conspiring know what be about will avoid seeming to be in tale bullion be in bar understand yes five bar in case weight believe sixteen pound to bar let see hewitt went on a looked at watch be now nearly two o'clock must think over thing if be to do anything in case in meantime if must be managed must like enormously to have turn under water in diving dress have always have curiosity to see under sea must be managed now well merrick responded there be not much fun in can assure be none pleasanter in weather 'd better have try later in year if really want to unless think can learn anything about business by smelling about on nicobar down below hewitt raised eyebrow pursed lip might spot something said one never know if do anything in case always make rule to see hear everything can possibly be seen heard important not clue lie where least expected beyond probably may never have chance of little experience in diving dress so if can be managed 'd be glad very well will go if say so since be first venture will come down with myself men be ashore think most of come along hewitt be put in woollen then in india rubber leaden soled boot of twenty pound weight be strapped on foot weight be hung on back chest be dress gullen usually have merrick remarked be very smart fellow usually send first to make measurement so on excellent man bit too fond of diver lotion what be asked hewitt oh will try if like afterwards be bit too heavy for rum gin mixed think red nightcap be placed on martin hewitt head after copper helmet secured by short turn in segmental screw joint at neck in end felt vast difficulty in moving at merrick have be meantime invested with similar rig out then be provided with communication cord incandescent electric lamp finally front window be screwed on helmet be ready merrick went first over ladder at side hewitt with much difficulty followed a water closed over head sensation altered considerably there be le weight to carry arm in particular felt light though slow in motion down down went slowly round about be fairly light once on sunken vessel among lower deck electric lamp be necessary enough once twice merrick spoke laying helmet against hewitt for purpose instructing to keep air pipe life line lamp connection from fouling something at step here there shadowy swimming shape came out of gloom attracted by lamp to dart into obscurity again with twist of tail fish be exploring nicobar hatchway of lower deck be open down passed to orlop deck little way along came to door standing open with broken lock hanging to be door of bullion room have be forced by diver in morning merrick indicated by sign how case have be found piled on floor one of side of room of thin steel be torn thrust in length of whole upper half when backed out of room passed open door stood in great breach made by bow of strange coasting vessel steel iron wood everything stood in rent splinter through great gap looked out into immeasurable ocean hewitt put up hand felt edge of bullion room partition where have be torn be just such tear a might have be made in cardboard regained upper deck hewitt placing helmet against companion told that meant to have short walk on ocean bed took to ladder again where lay over side merrick followed bottom be of tough slimy sort of clay rock be found in many place about coast be dotted here there with lump of harder rock clump of curious weed two diver turned at bottom of ladder walked few step looked up at great hole in nicobar side seen from here be fearful chasm laying open hold orlop lower deck hewitt turned away began walking about once twice stood looked thoughtfully at ground stood on be fairly flat turned over with foot whitish clean looking stone about a large a loaf then wandered on slowly once twice stopping to examine rock beneath presently stooped to look at stone nearly a large a other weedy on one side only standing on edge of cavity in claystone pushed stone into hole filled then stood up merrick put helmet against hewitt shouted satisfied now seen enough of bottom in moment hewitt shouted back straightway began striding out in direction of ship arrived at bow turned back to point started from striding off again from there to white stone have kicked over from there to vessel side again merrick watched in intense amazement hurried a well a might after light of hewitt lamp arrived for second time at bow of ship hewitt turned made way along side to ladder forthwith ascended followed by merrick there be halt at deck time two made there way up up into lighter water above so to world of air on tug a men be unscrewing from there waterproof prison merrick asked hewitt will try 'lotion now hewitt replied wo go quite so far a will have little whisky if have in cabin give pencil piece of paper thing be brought on paper martin hewitt immediately wrote few figure kept in hand might easily forget figure observed merrick wondered said nothing once more comfortably in cabin clad in usual garment hewitt asked if merrick must produce chart of part thereabout here be be reply coast big enough be have already marked position of wreck on in pencil lie pointing north by east a nearly exact a anything a have begun said hewitt will take liberty of making few more pencil mark on with spread out crumpled note of figure began much ciphering measuring presently marked certain point on spare piece of paper drew through two line forming angle angle transferred to chart placing ruler over one leg of angle lengthened out till met coast line there be said musingly nearest village to be lostella indeed only coast village in neighbourhood rose bring sharpest eyed person on board said that be if be here day yesterday what be up what be mathematical business over going to find bullion by rule of three hewitt laughed yes perhaps said where be sharp look out want somebody who can tell everything be visible from deck of tug day yesterday well really believe very sharpest chap be boy be most annoyingly observant sometimes will send for came bright snub nosed impudent looking young ruffian see here boy said merrick polish up wit tell gentleman what asks yesterday said hewitt doubt saw various piece of wreckage floating about yessir be hatch grating mostly nothin ' much else there be knockin ' about now saw now remember did see hatch grating floating yesterday be different from others painted one for instance out there now be not painted know yessir see little white painted bobbin ' about away beyond foremast of nicobar be sure of certain sure sir be only painted thing floatin to day be washed away somewhere so noticed be smart lad here be shilling for keep eye open perhaps will find good many more shilling before be old man be boy disappeared hewitt turned to merrick said think may a well send wire spoke of if get commission think may recover bullion may take little time on other hand may not if will write telegram at once will go in same boat a messenger be going to take walk down to lostella now be only two three mile along coast will soon be getting dark what sort of clue have got did never mind replied hewitt with chuckle officially know have right to clue just yet be not commissioned when be will tell everything hewitt be scarcely ashore when be seized by excited brasyer here be said be coming aboard tug again have got more news remember said be going out with railway clerk afternoon meant pumping well have done rushed away know what will think up a be going along saw steward on other side of way clerk recognised a one of men who brought case to be sent off other be skipper have doubt from description played artfully know then let out that case be addressed to mackrie at address in london looked up entry said after left when first questioned feeling curious be about enough think eh be off to london now believe mackrie going to night will have keep dark zealous second officer dashed off without waiting for reply hewitt looked after with amused smile turned off towards lostella iii be about eleven next morning when merrick received following note brought by boatman dear merrick be commissioned if not trouble if be be just outside lostella at turning before come to smack inn at two o'clock bring with light cart policeman two perhaps will be better man with spade there will probably be little cabbage digging be fond of sport yours martin hewitt p keep men aboard bring spade artist from town merrick be off in boat at once principal have replied to telegram after hewitt departure day before giving free hand to do seemed best with little difficulty got policeman with none at got light cart jobbing man with spade together drove off to meeting place be before time martin hewitt be there waiting be quick said sooner better gave earliest appointment thought must keep considering what have to do have got stuff then merrick asked anxiously no not exactly yet have got hewitt held up point of walking stick protruding inch so from be sharp end of small gimlet in groove thereof be little white wood such a commonly remains after gimlet have be used why what be never mind let move along will walk think be about at end of job be be fairly lucky one quite simple will explain after just beyond smack inn hewitt halted cart got down looped horse rein round hedge stake proceeded small remaining distance on foot with policeman behind to avoid premature scare turned up lane behind few small rather dirty cottage facing sea with patch of kitchen garden behind hewitt led way to second garden pushed open small wicket gate walked boldly in followed by others cabbage covered most of patch seemed pretty healthy in situation with exception of dozen singularly enough together in group be drooping yellow wilted towards hewitt straightway walked dig up wilted cabbage said to jobbing man be really useless now will probably find something else six inch down so man struck spade into soft earth wherein stopped suddenly with thud at moment gaunt slatternly woman with black eye handkerchief over head skirt pinned up in front observing invasion from back door of cottage rushed out like maniac attacked party valiantly with broom upset jobbing man over spade knocked off one policeman helmet lunged into other face with broom be making second attempt to hit hewitt who have dodged when merrick caught firmly by elbow from behind pressed together held screamed people came from other cottage looked on peter peter woman screamed come 'ee come'ee here davey be come grimy child came to cottage door seeing woman thus held stranger in garden set up piteous howl meantime digger have uncovered two wooden box eighteen inch long so bound with hoop iron sealed one have be torn partly open at top broken wood roughly replaced when be lifted bar of yellow metal be visible within woman still screamed vehemently struggled grimy child retreated then there appeared at door staggering hazily rubbing eye shaggy unkempt man in shirt trouser looked stupidly at scene before jaw dropped take man cried hewitt be one policeman promptly took so that have handcuff on wrist before have collected faculty sufficiently to begin swearing hewitt other policeman entered cottage in lower two room there be nobody climbed few narrow stair in front room above found man younger fast asleep be other said hewitt take one be handcuffed before woke then recovered gold be put into cart with help of village constable who brought own handcuff for benefit adornment of lady with broom procession marched out of lostella a have never be dreamed of by oldest inhabitant in worst nightmare recorded in whole history of cornwall now said hewitt turning to merrick must have fellow of yours what be name gullen be one went down to measure hole in ship have kept aboard of course what gullen exclaimed merrick gullen well a matter of fact went ashore last night have come back mean to say do replied hewitt now have lost iv tell about now have little time to ourselves asked merrick hour two later a sat smoked in after cabin of salvage tug have got stuff thanks to in least see how got how found out well there did seem to be great deal way in tale told by men from nicobar cancelled one out so to speak though seemed likely that there might be something in in one two respect brasyer must see tried to prove too much if captain steward be conspiring to rob bullion room why must steward trouble to cut through boiler plate wall when captain kept key in cabin if captain have be stealing bullion why must stop at two case when have voyage to operate in forty case to help to of course evidence of carpenter gave colour to theory think can imagine very reasonable explanation of told of course that be down with men when opened bullion room door got out case so that there must be suspicion of at same time told that breach in nicobar side have laid open bullion room partition that might more easily have got case out way told of course that case must have fallen out way because of list of vessel position of rent in boiler plate so on reflected that day before diver have be down alone in fact that business have be with very hole that extended partly to bullion room have to measure that diver might easily have got at case through breach then a told diver ca bring thing up from below unobserved diver must know might therefore hide booty below so that made up mind to have look under water before jumped to conclusion did think likely that have hidden case mind because must have have to dive again to get must have be just a awkwardly placed in fetching to light of day then a ever besides must come diving here again in company dress without explanation so what more likely than that must make ingenious arrangement with accomplice whereby might make gold in way accessible to went under water kept eye open observed among other thing that vessel be one of kept bewell one on hatch grating so on be in plain oak teak kept holystoned with other thing put by in mind in case must be useful when went over side looked at great gap saw that must have be quite easy to get at broken bullion room partition from outside yes remarked merrick must be trouble at ladder go down just by side of breach one descending by might just step off at one side on to jagged plating at level of after orlop reach over into bullion safe just so well next turned attention to sea bed be extremely pleased to see be of soft slimy claystone walked about little getting farther farther away from vessel a went till came across clean stone turned over with foot do remember yes well that be noticeable be only clean bare stone to be seen other be covered with green growth to most clump of weed clung obvious explanation of be that stone be new comer lately brought from dry land from shingle on sea shore probably since be washed so clean such stone must not have come mile out to sea by somebody have brought in boat thrown over did did take trouble for nothing then shape told tale be something of form rather exaggerated of loaf sort be called 'cottage ' most convenient possible shape for attaching to line lowering line have gone so somebody must have be down there to detach also be unreasonable to suppose that there might have be hook on end of line then be theory man have gone down alone to take measurement have stepped into broken side a have explained must reached into bullion room lifted two case probably unfastened cord brought out one at time for convenience in carrying then carried case one at time a have said over to white stone lay there sunk with hook line attached by previous arrangement with confederate detached rope from stone be probably fixed by attached piece of cord tightened round stone with what call timber hitch easily loosened replaced cord round two case passed hook under cord left to be pulled up from above then must not have be pulled up there in broad daylight under very nose confederate must wait till night meant that other end of rope be attached to floating object so that might be readily recovered whole arrangement be set one night to be carried away next why did gullen take more than two case must afford to waste time in first place case removed meant journey to from vessel be waiting above for measurement then be probably doubtful a to weight too much at once must easily be drawn up might upset small boat well so much for white stone there be more close by stone noticed although think did mark in claystone be triangular depression pit sharp at bottom just hole must be made by sharp impact of square corner of heavy box if shod with iron a bullion case be be one important thing seemed to indicate that box have not be lifted directly up from sea bed have be dragged sideways at event at first so that sharp corner have turned over dug into claystone walked little farther found more indication slight scratch small stone displaced so on convinced of also pointed out direction in case have be dragged followed direction presently arrived at stone rather smaller than clean one case have evidently caught against have be displaced by momentum perhaps by possible wrench from above green growth covered part have be exposed to water rest of stone fitted hole beside from have be pulled clearly thing be done recently sea must have wiped out trace in soft claystone rest of what did under water of course understood suppose so took bearing of two stone in relation to ship by pacing distance be so kept figure in head till must make note of a saw on paper rest be mere calculation what judged have happened be gullen have arranged with somebody identity unknown certainly somebody with boat at disposal to lay line take up following night now anything larger than rowing boat must not have got up quite so close to in night although tug be at other end of wreck without risk of being seen rowing boat must have dragged case forcibly along bottom must act a anchor to therefore be what have happened thief have come in large boat fishing smack lugger something of sort with small boat in sailing boat have lain to at convenient distance in direction in be afterwards to go so a to save time if observed man have put off quietly in small boat to pick up float whatever be there must have be lot of slack line on for purpose a also for purpose of allowing float to drift about fairly freely not attract attention by remaining in one place man pulled off to sailing boat took float line aboard then sailing boat swung off in direction of home line be hauled in with plunder at end of one must think have seen done merrick remarked with laugh nothing else must have happened see chain of event be only one will explain circumstance rapid grasp of whole circumstance perfect appreciation of be more than battle in such work a well know got exact bearing of wreck on chart worked out from that lay of two stone with scratch mark between then be obvious that straight line drawn through carried ahead must indicate approximately at rate direction thief vessel have taken line fell on coast close by village of lostella indeed be only village for few mile way indication be not certain be likely only one available therefore must be followed up what about painted hatch how did guess well saw there be hatch grating belonging to nicobar floating about seemed probable that thief must use for float something similar to other wreckage in vicinity so a not to attract attention nothing must be more likely than hatch grating then in small vessel such a fishing lugger so on fitting be almost always painted ca afford to be such holystoning swell a on nicobar so judged grating might be painted must possibly have be noticed by sharp person made shot hit boy remembered white grating have gone 'washed away a thought that be useful to a will see made off toward lostella tide be low be getting dusk when arrived number of boat smack be lying anchored on beach there be few people to be seen began looking out for smack with white painted fitting in there be not so many of among fishing vessel brown red be more likely sheer colourless dirt over paint unrecognisable there be only two that saw last night first might have be one wanted there be nothing to show second be one be half decked have small white painted hatch shifted hatch found long line attached to grating at one end carrying hook at other have neglected to unfasten apparatus perhaps have idea that there might be chance of using again in few day went to transom read inscription peter david garthew lostella ' then business be to find garthews wandered about village for little time presently got hold of boy made simple excuse for asking about garthews wanted to go for sail to morrow boy with many grin confided to that of garthews be 'on booze must find at smack inn where have be day drunk a fiddler seemed likely sort of thing after haul have made went to smack inn determined to claim old friendship with garthews although did know peter from david there be one sleepy drunk other loving cry drunk got a friendly a possible with under circumstance at closing time stood gallon of beer carried home for while carried other took care to have good look round in cottage even helped peter 'old woman ' lady with broom to carry up to bed nowhere must see anything that looked like bullion case hiding place for one so came away determined to renew acquaintance in morning to carry on a long a might be necessary also to look at garden in daylight for sign of burying with view fixed that little gimlet in walking stick a saw morning be at lostella before ten took look at garthews cabbage seemed odd that dozen in clump together looked withered limp a though have be dug up hastily root broken perhaps then replanted altogether particular cabbage have dissipated leaning different way look a though have be on loose with garthews so seeing grubby child near back door of cottage went towards walking rather unsteadily so a if be observed to favour delusion be not yet quite got over last night diversion b boy ' said li ' l b boy look here ' plunged hand into trouser pocket brought out full of small change then making great business of selecting penny managed to spill over dissipated cabbage be easy then in stooping to pick up change to lean heavily on stick drive through loose earth a have expected there be box below so gouged away with walking stick while collected copper finally swaggered off after few civil word with 'old woman carrying with evident proof that be white wood recently buried there rest saw for think may congratulate other on having dodged that broom hit others what be wild about said merrick be having let that scoundrel gullen get off be artful chap without doubt saw go over side know after have gone came into cabin for instruction pencil note chart be on table doubt put two two together be more than must not knowing what have happened concluded to make safe for bit have leave night just pulled away on quiet why did give tip to keep must have done in first place there be legal evidence to warrant arrest ordering to keep aboard must have aroused suspicion did know at time how many day week must take to find bullion if ever found in time gullen might have communicated in way with accomplice so spoilt whole thing yes certainly seems to have be fairly smart in way knew must probably be sent down first a usual alone to make measurement conceived plan made arrangement forthwith now what want to know be what about nicobar people watching suspecting one more especially what about case captain steward be said to have fetched ashore hewitt laughed well said a to that presence of bullion seems to have bred sort of mutual suspicion on board ship brasyer be over fussy continual chatter started probably so that spread like infection a to captain steward of course know anything that rescued case be not bullion case probably be doing little private trading be generally case when captain steward seem unduly friendly for relative position perhaps case contained something specially valuable vas bronze from japan for instance possibly most valuable thing of size have aboard then if have insured thing captain mackrie who have reputation of sharp not very scrupulous man might possibly think rather stroke of business to get good insurance money too must lead to keep parcel a quiet a possible be a may be case be much a hewitt have surmised zealous brasyer posting to london in hot haste after mackrie spent day in watching at last captain steward with two box took cab went to bond street with brasyer in cab behind two entered shop window of be set out with rare curiosity much old silver gold brasyer must restrain no longer grabbed passing policeman rushed with into shop there found captain steward with two small packing case opened before trying to sell couple of very ancient looking japanese bronze figure of curious old workmanship varied colour of metal that in genuine example mean nowadays high money value brasyer vanished there be too much chaff for to live through in british mercantile marine after adventure fact be steward have come across bargain have not sufficient spare cash to buy so called in aid of captain speculated in bronze a partner there be much anxious inspection of prize on way home much discussion a to proper price to ask finally be said got three hundred pound for pair now again hewitt meet merrick still sometimes merrick say now wonder after whether not of nicobar men who be continually dodging suspiciously about bullion room did mean having dash at gold if there be chance hewitt reply wonder holford will case at one time in common perhaps with most people took sort of languid amateur interest in question of psychology be impelled there by to plunge into page of many curious rather abstruse book attempt to deal with phenomenon of mind soul sense three thing of real nature of be convinced man will ever learn more than know at present be nothing from strayed into many volume of transaction of psychical research society with occasional by excursion into mental telepathy theosophy last thing whereof philistine intelligence obstinately refused to make head tail be while thing be occupying part of attention chanced to ask hewitt whether in course of diver odd out of way experience have met with such weird adventure a be detailed in such profusion in book of authenticated spook doppelganger poltergeist clairvoyance so forth well hewitt answered with reflection have be such wallower in uncanny a of worthy people who talk at large in book of yours a matter of fact little adventure curious a of may seem have be on whole of most solid matter of fact description one two thing have happened that perhaps 'psychical people might be interested in have mostly be found to be capable of disappointingly simple explanation one case of genuine psychological interest however have have although there be nothing even in be matter of well known scientific possibility proceeded to tell story have set down here a well a can from recollection think have already said in place that hewitt professional start a private investigator dated from connection with famous will case of bartley v bartley others in then principal messrs crellan hunt crellan chiefly through exertion established extremely high reputation a solicitor be ten year so after case mr crellan senior head of firm retired into private life by odd chance hewitt first meeting with after event be occasioned by will difficulty be term of telegram brought hewitt again into personal relation with old principal can run down at once on matter of private business will be at guildford to meet eleven thirty five from waterloo if later prevented please wire crellan day state of hewitt engagement suited there be full hour to catch train taking therefore small travelling bag always stood ready packed in case of sudden excursion presented possibility of night from home got early to waterloo by half past twelve be alighting at guildford station mr crellan hale white haired old gentleman wearing gold rimmed spectacle be waiting with covered carriage how d 'ye do mr hewitt how d 'ye do old gentleman exclaimed a soon a met grasping hewitt hand hurrying toward carriage be glad have come very glad be raining might have preferred something more open brought brougham because want to talk privately have be vegetating to extent for last few year down here that little occurrence out of ordinary excites be sure must have kept quiet till have got indoors be be bad enough keeping thing to myself already door shut brougham started mr crellan laid hand on hewitt knee hope said have dragged away from important business hewitt replied have chosen most excellent time indeed did think of making small holiday to day telegram yes yes do know be almost ashamed of having sent after have gone because after matter be probably really very simple sort of affair that ca possibly help in few year ago must have thought nothing of nothing at a have told have got into dull vegetable state of mind since retired have nothing to do that little thing upset have mental energy enough to make up mind to go to dinner sometimes be old friend be sure will forgive dragging down here on matter will perhaps seem ridiculously simple to man in thick of active business if have known so well must have have impudence to bother never mind will tell do ever remember speaking of intimate friend mr holford well be long time ago perhaps never happened to mention be most excellent man old fellow like know two three year older a matter of fact be chum many year ago in fact lodged in same house when be articled clerk be student at guy retired from medical profession early having come into fortune came down here to live at house be going to a matter of fact wedbury hall when retired came down took up quarter not far off be very excellent pair of old chum till last monday day before yesterday when poor old friend died be pretty well in year seventy three man ca live for ever assure have upset terribly made greater fool of than ever in fact just when ought to have wit about reason particularly want wit just now reason have requisitioned yours be ca find poor old holford will drew up for year ago by be appointed sole executor be perfectly convinced that can not have destroyed because told everything concerning affair have always be only adviser in fact be sure must have consulted a to change in testamentary intention before made moreover there be reason why know must not have wished to die intestate be queried hewitt a mr crellan paused in statement be holford be widower with child of own wife who have be dead nearly fifteen year now be most excellent woman model wife must have be model mother if have be one at a be adopted little girl poor little soul who be left orphan at two year of age child father unsuccessful man of business of name of garth maddened by sudden ruinous loss committed suicide wife died of shock occasioned by calamity child a have said be taken by mr holford made daughter of old friend daughter have be ever since practically speaking poor old fellow must possibly have be more attached to daughter of own on part must possibly have be better daughter than be stuck by night day during last illness until became rather ill although of course there be regular nurse always in attendance now in will mr holford bequeathed rather more than half of very large property to miss garth be to say a residuary legatee interest in will came to about that rest be distributed in various way holford have largely spent leisure of retirement in scientific pursuit so there be few legacy to learned society servant be remembered left certain number of book there be very fair sum of money for nephew mr cranley mellis only near relation of mr holford still living so that see what loss of will may mean miss garth who be to have taken greater part of adoptive father property will not have one shilling worth of claim on estate will be turned out into world without cent one two very old servant will be very awkwardly placed too with nothing to live on very little prospect of doing more work everything will go to nephew said hewitt of course of course be unless attempt to prove rough copy of will may possibly have by even if have thing find long costly litigation must be called for result must probably be against say feel sure mr holford did not destroy will be quite sure must never have done so without telling of indeed be sure must have consulted first moreover can never have be intention to leave miss garth utterly unprovided for must be same thing a disinheriting only daughter did see frequently there be scarcely be day when have seen since have lived down here during illness lasted month saw day said nothing of destroying will nothing at on contrary soon after first seizure indeed on first visit at found in bed said after telling how felt 'everything a want know in case go under seemed to to mean will be still a desired to be well yes must seem so counsel on other side supposing there be side might quite a plausibly argue that meant to die intestate have destroyed will so that everything must be a wanted in sense what do want to do find will certainly if can seemed to that with clever head might be able to form better judgment than a to what have happened who be responsible for because if will have be taken away one have taken seems probable have told one of difficulty not soul came over a soon a must after mr holford death miss garth gave key because a executor case being peculiar one wished to see that be in order a know estate be legally vested in executor from death of testator so be responsible for everything although of course if there be will be not executor thought best to keep difficulty to myself till saw quite right be wedbury brougham have passed lodge gate approached by wide drive fine old red brick mansion carrying heavy stone dressing coping distinctive of early eighteenth century domestic architecture yes said mr crellan be place will go straight to study think then can explain detail study told tale of late mr holford habit interest be library half scientific laboratory pathological curiosity in spirit retort two test tube on writing table fossilized lizard mounted in case balanced many shelf case of book disposed about wall in recess between two book case stood heavy old fashioned mahogany bureau now be in bureau mr crellan explained indicating with finger that mr holford kept document be in smallest degree important valuable have seen at hundred time always maintained be a secure a iron safe may not have be altogether fact bureau be certainly tremendously heavy strong one feel hewitt took down front pulled out drawer mr crellan unlocked for purpose solid spanish mahogany inch thick be verdict heavy hard seasoned not sort of thing can buy nowadays lock chubb patent early pattern not easily to be picked by anything short of blast of gunpowder if there be mark on bureau have be tampered with well mr crellan pursued a say be where mr holford kept will have often seen when have be here together be drawer top on right that kept in will be mere single sheet of foolscap be kept folded of course in blue envelope when did last actually see will saw in friend hand two day before took to bed merely lifted in hand to get at something else in drawer replaced locked drawer again of course there be other drawer bureau so on about place have examined carefully take have turned out ever possible receptacle for will in house positively assure there be trace of have thought of secret drawer suppose yes there be two in bureau always knew of here be mr crellan pressed thumb against partition of pigeon hole at back of bureau strip of mahogany flew out from below revealing two willow drawer with small ivory catch in lieu of knob nothing there at other a have said be drawer where will be kept other paper kept in same drawer be here a usual did anybody else know where mr holford kept will everybody in house must think be frank above board sort of man adopted daughter knew butler knew there be absolutely reason why other servant must know probably did first said hewitt will make quite sure there be more secret drawer about bureau lock door in case anybody come hewitt took out drawer of bureau examined part of before laid aside then produced small pair of silver calliper ivory pocket rule went over inch of heavy framework measuring comparing tapping adding subtracting dimension in end rose to foot satisfied there be most certainly nothing concealed there said drawer be put back mr crellan suggested lunch at hewitt suggestion be brought to study so far hewitt said arrive at mr holford have destroyed will have most effectually concealed somebody have stolen first of possibility favour believe be possibility for moment have told why knew holford so well know for same reason be sure never concealed very well then somebody have stolen question be who be so seems to that one in house have direct personal interest in preserving will servant have something left say without will go of course miss garth have greatest possible interest in will only person have heard of a yet who must benefit by loss destruction must be nephew mr mellis there be other relative say who must benefit by intestacy not one well what do think now have suspicion mr crellan shrugged shoulder have more right to suspicion than have suppose said of course if there be to be suspicion can only point one way mr mellis be only person who can gain by disappearance of will just so now what do know of know much of young man mr crellan said slowly must say never particularly took to be rather clever fellow believe be called to bar time ago afterwards studied medicine believe with idea of priming for practice in medical jurisprudence took good deal of interest in old friend research be told at rate said did may have be thinking of uncle fortune have small tiff on medical question know exactly what be mr holford objected to something method of research something of kind a being dangerous unprofessional there be actual rupture between understand mellis visit slacked off there be coolness where be mr mellis now in london believe have be in house between day last saw will in drawer yesterday when failed to find only once came to see uncle two day before death last saturday in fact did stay long did see yes what did do merely came into room for few minute visitor be allowed to stay long spoke little to uncle went back to town did hing else see anybody else miss garth went out of room with a left must think talked for little before went away to judge by time be gone know be sure went then saw in drive a looked from window miss garth say have kept key since beginning of mr holford illness yes until gave up to yesterday indeed nurse who be rather peppery customer be jealous of miss garth presence in sick room along made several difficulty about having to go to for everything there be doubt of bureau having be kept locked time none at have asked miss garth indeed good many other thing without saying why wanted information how be mr mellis miss garth affected toward one be friendly oh yes indeed while ago rather fancied that mellis be disposed to pay serious address in quarter may have have fancy way may have be attracted by young lady expectation at rate nothing definite seems to have come of a yet must say between ourselves of course have more than once noticed decided air of agitation shyness perhaps in miss garth when mr mellis have be present at rate scarcely matter be twenty four year of age now can do a like although if have anything to say in matter well never mind take have known miss garth long time bless yes danced on knee twenty year ago have be 'uncle leonard life well think must at least let miss garth know of loss of will perhaps when have cleared away plate will come here for few minute will go ask mr crellan answered having rung bell proceeded to find miss garth presently returned with lady be slight very pale young woman doubt rather pretty in ordinary now not looking best be evidently worn nervous from anxiety want of sleep eye be sadly inflamed a wind slammed loose casement behind started nervously placed hand to head sit down at once dear mr crellan said sit down be mr martin hewitt whom have taken liberty of inviting down here to help in very important matter fact be dear mr crellan added gravely ca find poor father will miss garth be not surprised thought so said mildly when asked about bureau yesterday of course need not say dear what serious thing may be for if will can not be found so hope will try tell mr hewitt here anything want to know a well a can without forgetting single thing be pretty sure that will find for if be to be found understand miss garth hewitt asked that key of bureau never left possession during whole time of mr holford last illness that bureau be kept locked yes be so did ever have occasion to go to bureau have not touched then can answer for presume that bureau be never unlocked by one from time mr holford placed key in hand till gave to mr crellan yes be sure of very good now be there place on whole premise that can suggest where will may possibly be hidden there be place that mr crellan doe know of be sure be old house observe hewitt pursued do know of place of concealment in structure secret door mean know sliding panel hollow door frame so forth miss garth shook head there be not single place of sort speak of in whole building so far a know said have lived here almost life knew purport of mr holford will take understand what loss may mean to perfectly now must ask to consider carefully take mind back to two three day before mr holford illness began tell if can remember single fact occurrence word hint from day to in way bearing on will anything connected with miss garth shook head thoughtfully ca remember thing being mentioned by anybody except perhaps by nurse who be rather touchy sort of woman once twice took upon to hint that recent anxiety be chiefly about poor father money once when have done small thing for father have always called father know said that must forget must be rewarded something of sort nothing else that can remember in remotest degree concerned will mr mellis said nothing about then miss garth changed colour slightly answered only saw to door thank miss garth wo trouble further just now if can remember anything more in course of next few hour may turn out to be of great service miss garth bowed withdrew mr crellan shut door behind returned to hewitt doe carry much further said more certain seems that will can not have be got at more difficult position be from legal point of view what will do now be nurse still about place yes believe so then will speak to nurse came in response to mr crellan summons sharp featured pragmatical woman of forty five took seat offered waited for hewitt question be in attendance on mr holford believe mr turton since beginning of last illness since october th be present when mr mellis came to see uncle last saturday yes can tell took place a to what gentleman said to mr nurse replied bridling slightly of course know anything not being business not intended for ear mr crellan be there know a much a do so doe miss garth only know that mr mellis stayed for few minute then went out of room with miss garth how long be miss garth gone know ten minute quarter of hour perhaps now mr turton want to tell in confidence be very important whether at time heard mr holford during illness say anything of wish a to how property be to be left in case of death nurse started looked keenly from hewitt to mr crellan back again be will mean asked sharply yes did mention mean ca find will be that well suppose be what then suppose wo do nurse answered shortly do know something about will believe ca find be sure mr turton that if know anything about will will tell mr crellan in interest of right justice who be to protect against spite of will offend if tell mr crellan interposed tell mr turton said will be held in strictest confidence source of information will not be divulged for give word of honour need scarcely add will see that come to harm by anything may say then will be lost may understand hewitt feature be impassive impenetrable in mr crellan disturbed face nurse saw plain answer in affirmative yes said see be trouble well know who took then who be miss garth miss garth nonsense cried mr crellan starting upright nonsense may be nonsense nurse replied slowly with monotonous emphasis on word may be nonsense be fact saw take mr crellan simply gasped hewitt drew chair little nearer if saw take said gently closely watching woman face while then of course there be doubt tell saw take nurse repeated what be in what game be in taking know be in bureau be yes probably in right hand top drawer yes white paper in blue envelope yes then saw take a said before unlocked that drawer before eye took out locked drawer again mr crellan turned blankly to hewitt kept eye on nurse face when did occur asked how be on saturday night rather late everybody be in bed miss garth have be down to dining room for something mr holford be asleep so a wanted to re fill water bottle took up went a be passing door of room that be in now heard noise looked in at door be open there be candle on table have be left there earlier in evening miss garth be opening top right hand drawer of bureau mr turton stabbed finger spitefully toward piece of furniture a though owed personal grudge saw take out blue foolscap envelope a flap be open must see enclosed paper be white shut drawer locked came out of room with envelope in hand what did do hurried on came away without seeing went in opposite direction toward small staircase perhaps mr crellan ventured at blurt perhaps be walking in sleep that be nurse replied for came back to mr holford room almost a soon a returned there asked question about medicine be nothing new for must say be very fond of interfering in thing be part of business be quite certain suppose hewitt remarked that must not have be asleep quite certain talked for about quarter of hour wanted to kiss mr holford might have wakened before went to bed in fact may say have disagreement hewitt did not take steady gaze from nurse face for second after have finished speaking then only said thank mr turton need scarcely assure after what mr crellan have said that confidence will not be betrayed think be unless have more to tell mr turton bowed rose there be nothing more said left room a soon a have gone be mr turton at interested in will hewitt asked there be nothing for be new comer see perhaps mr crellan went on struck by idea may be jealous something seems spiteful woman really ca believe story for moment why well see be absurd why must miss garth go to secret trouble to do injury to make beggar of herself besides be not in habit of telling barefaced lie distinctly assured remember that have never be to bureau for purpose nurse have honest character have yes character be excellent indeed from account be very excellent woman except for desire to govern everybody habit of spite if be thwarted of course that sort of thing sometimes lead people rather far so doe hewitt replied consider now be not possible that miss garth completely infatuated with mr mellis think be doing noble thing for by destroying will giving up whole claim to uncle property devoted woman do just such thing know mr crellan stared bent head to hand considered so do so do said insane foolery really be sort of thing can imagine doing be honour generosity then lie resumed sitting up slapping leg ca believe 'd tell such tremendous lie a for anybody with such calm face too be sure must well be a may be can scarcely set limit to length woman will go on behalf of man love suppose by bye miss garth be not exactly what must call betrong minded woman be not that 'd never get on in world by be good little soul nervous very month of anxiety grief want of sleep seems to have broken up mr mellis know of death suppose telegraphed to at chamber in london first thing yesterday tuesday morning a soon a telegraph office be open came here a have forgotten to tell a yet first thing morning before be over here in fact have be staying not far off at ockham think telegram have be sent on saw miss garth must stay having to get back to london met going away a came about eleven o'clock of course said nothing about fact must find will will probably be down again soon may ask question yes hewitt replied speaking of matter can doubt talk with miss garth on very intimate familiar term oh yes yes have told what old friend be wish must manage at favourable opportunity to day to speak to alone without referring to will in way get to know a circumspectly delicately a can how stand in regard to mr mellis whether be accepted lover likely to be one know answer may get may judge expect by manner how thing really be very good will seize first chance meanwhile what to hing be afraid except perhaps to examine other piece of furniture a closely a have examined bureau other bureau desk table chest be examined fruitlessly be not until after dinner that mr crellan saw favourable opportunity of sounding miss garth a have promised hour later came to hewitt in study more puzzled than ever there be engagement between reported secret open ever have be seems from what can make out going to work a diplomatically a possible that mellis did propose to something very near time ago be point blank refused altogether miss garth sentiment for appears to be rather dislike than otherwise that rather knock hole in theory of self sacrifice doe hewitt remarked will have to think over sleep on be possible that may be necessary to morrow for to tax miss garth point blank with having taken away will still hope not hope not too mr crellan said rather dubious a to result of such experiment have be quite upset enough already by bye did seem better more composed after mellis ' visit morning still then will be gone yes so hewitt mr crellan talked on late into evening turning over apparent possibility finding reason in none household went to bed at ten soon after miss garth came to bid mr crellan good night have be settled that martin hewitt mr crellan must stay night at wedbury hall soon be still ticking of tall clock in hall below must be heard a distinctly a though be in study while rain without dropped from eaves sill in regular splash twelve o'clock struck mr crellan be about to suggest retirement when sound of light footstep startled hewitt alert ear raised hand to enjoin silence stepped to door of room mr crellan following there be light over staircase seven eight yard away down stair came miss garth in dressing gown slipper turned at landing vanished in passage leading to right where doe that lead to hewitt whispered hurriedly toward small staircase other end of house mr crellan replied in same tone come quietly said hewitt stepped lightly after miss garth mr crellan at heel be nearing opposite end of passage walking at fair pace looking to right left there be light over smaller staircase at end without hesitation miss garth turned down stair till about down flight then stopped pressed hand against oak wainscot immediately vertical piece of framing against have placed hand turned on central pivot top bottom revealing small recess three foot high little more than six inch wide miss garth stooped felt about at bottom of recess for several second then with sign of extreme agitation horror withdrew hand empty sank on stair head rolled from side to side on shoulder bead of perspiration stood on forehead hewitt with difficulty restrained mr crellan from going to assistance presently with sort of shuddering sigh miss garth rose after standing irresolute for moment descended flight of stair to bottom there stopped again pressing hand to forehead turned began to re ascend stair hewitt touched companion arm two hastily noiselessly made way back along passage to study miss garth left open framing a be reached top of landing without stopping proceeded along passage turned up main staircase while hewitt mr crellan still watched from study door at top of flight turned to right up three four more step toward own room there stopped leaned thoughtfully on handrail go up whispered hewitt to mr crellan a though be going to bed appear surprised to see ask if be well if can manage to repeat question of mine about secret hiding place in house mr crellan nodded started quickly up stair way up turned head a went on why nelly dear said what be matter be well mr crellan acted part well waiting below hewitt heard dialogue uncle feel very well be nothing think room seems close can scarcely breathe oh be close to night will be catching cold dear go have good sleep must worry wise little head of yours know mr hewitt have be making quite night of be off to bed now hope have made quite comfortable uncle oh yes capital capital have be talking over business doubt will put matter in order soon by bye suppose since saw hewitt have happened to remember anything more to tell still ca remember hiding place panel sort of thing in wainscot anywhere be sure know of believe for moment that exist quite sure of suppose oh yes right now go to bed will catch cold in draughty landing come wo move step till see door shut behind good night good night uncle mr crellan came downstairs again with face of blank puzzlement must have believed assured martin hewitt positively must have believed 'd have told lie with such confidence too there be something deep horrible here be afraid what doe mean will talk of afterwards hewitt replied come now take look at recess went quietly still to small staircase there with candle closely examined recess be mere box three foot high foot little more deep six seven inch wide piece of oak framing pivoted to stair at bottom to horizontal piece of framing at top stood edge forward dividing opening down centre there be nothing whatever in recess hewitt ascertained that there be catch plank simply remaining shut by virtue of fitting tightly so that nothing pressure on proper part be requisite to open have closed plank turned to speak to mr crellan when interruption occurred on floor two staircase be joined by passage ground floor passage from foot of flight be on led to entrance hall distinct amid loud clicking of hall clock hewitt now heard sound a of person foot shifting on stone step mr crellan heard too glanced at other then hewitt shading candle with hand led way to hall there listened for several second almost hour seemed then noise be repeated there be doubt of be at other side of front door in answer to hewitt hurried whisper mr crellan assured that there be window from in dark view must be got of person standing outside door also that other way out must be equally noisy must entail circuit of house front door be fastened by three heavy bolt immense old fashioned lock bar must take nearly minute to open at least even if everything went easily a there be other way hewitt determined to try handing candle to companion first lifted bar conceiving that might be done with least noise went easily handling carefully hewitt let hang from rivet without sound just then glancing at mr crellan saw that be forgetting to shade candle whose ray extended through fanlight above door probably through wide crack under be too late at same moment light be evidently perceived from outside there be hurried jump from step for instant sound of running on gravel hewitt tore back bolt flung door open dashed out into darkness leaving mr crellan on doorstep with candle hewitt be gone perhaps five ten minute although to mr crellan standing there at open door in state of high nervous tension with notion of what be happening what meant time seemed eternity when at last hewitt reached door again what be asked mr crellan much agitated did see have caught shook head have chance said wall be low over there there be plantation of tree at other side think yes begin to think may possibly be able to see way through business in little while see on top step in sheltered porch there remained wet print of two foot hewitt took letter from pocket opened out spread carefully over more perfect of two mark pressed lightly lifted then when door be shut produced pocket scissors with great care cut away paper round wet part leaving piece of course shape of boot sole come said hewitt may get at something after ask to tell anything now know anything a matter of fact hope be end of night entertainment be afraid case be rather unpleasant business there be nothing for to do now to go to bed think suppose there be handy man kept about place yes be gardener

read mellis did not sleep at chamber last night be out of town for day past kerrett mr crellan looked up who be kerrett asked lad in office sharp fellow see mellis did go to town after a matter of fact believe be nearer place than thought said have disagreement with uncle because of scientific practice old gentleman considered 'dangerous unprofessional ' think yes be case ah then key to mystery of will be in room where there hewitt pointed to book case read bernheim suggestive therapeutic one two book of heidenhain bjoernstroem will see thing more clearly than can without must be rather long sort of job so why who be somebody coming up drive in fly be yes mr crellan replied looking out of window presently added be cranley mellis ah said hewitt wo trouble for little will bet penny cake go first by to small staircase try secret recess if get little way along passage will be able to see will scarcely matter can see guess now what be driving at in least told name of book in must read matter up must be too long for present purpose thing be fairly well summarised see in encyclopaedia there in corner have put marker in volume seven do mind opening at place seeing for mr crellan doubtful bewildered reached volume opened readily in place where opened lay blue foolscap envelope old gentleman took envelope drew from white paper stared first at paper then at hewitt then at paper again let volume slide from lap gasped why why be will ah so thought said hewitt catching book a fell lose place in encyclopaedia read name of article what be mr crellan looked absent mindedly at title holding will before time then mechanically read aloud word hypnotism hypnotism be hewitt answered dangerous terrible power in hand of unscrupulous man how understand be real will suppose look at know best mr crellan looked yes said certainly be will where did come from have be in book time have did tell put there a marker come will understand explanation better if first read few line from article see here now 'although hypnotism have power for good when properly used by medical men be exceedingly dangerous weapon in hand of unskilful unscrupulous crime have be committed by person who have be hypnotised just a person when hypnotised be rendered extremely impressionable therefore capable of receiving beneficial suggestion so be nearly a liable to receive suggestion for evil be quite possible for hypnotic subject while under hypnotic influence to be impressed with belief that be to commit act after influence be removed that act be safe to commit acting at time a automaton suggestion may be thus made of subject in subsequent uninfluenced moment have idea will proceed to carry out automatically at time appointed in case of complete state of hypnotism subject have subsequently recollection whatever of what have happened person whose will nerve power have be weakened by fear other similar cause can be hypnotised without consent on part ' there now what do make of why do mean that miss garth have be hypnotised by by cranley mellis think be case indeed be pretty sure of notice on occasion of of last two visit be alone with miss garth for little time on evening following of visit doe something afterwards know nothing about something connected with disappearance of will only thing standing between mr mellis whole of uncle property who must have be in weaker nervous state than miss garth have be lately remember too on visit of last saturday while miss garth say only showed mellis to door nurse speak of being gone little time miss garth must have forgotten what took place then when mellis hypnotised impressed on suggestion that must take mr holford will night long after mellis have gone when must not be suspected of knowing anything of further that must at time when movement must be le likely to be observed secrete will in place of hiding known only to dear dear what rascal do really think did that not only that believe came here yesterday morning while be out to get will from recess recess by bye expect discovered by accident on one of visit have be here pretty often suppose altogether kept secret in case might be useful yesterday not finding will there hypnotised miss garth once again conveyed suggestion at midnight last night must take will from wherever have put pas to under front door what do mean be chased across ground last night be thing be pretty certain of if have mr mellis boot here must make sure by comparing with piece of paper cut out a will remember in entrance hall a have will though will scarcely be necessary what will do now expect will be to go to recess again on vague chance of will being there now after assuming that second dose of mesmerism have somehow miscarried if miss garth be here might try trick again be why got to send out where did find will now come to practical detail will remember that asked about handyman tool house well paid visit at six o'clock morning found therein very excellent carpenter tool in chest took selection of to small staircase took out tread of stair one that pivoted framing plank rested on found will there will a rather expected when examined recess last night have slipped down rather wide crack at end of stair timber know formed so to speak floor of recess fact be stair tread did quite reach a far a back of recess opening be very distinct to see soon felt with finger when miss garth in hypnotic condition on saturday night dropped will into recess shot straight to back corner fell down slit be why mellis found empty why miss garth also found empty on returning there last night under hypnotic influence observed terrible state of nervous agitation when failed to carry out command haunted be frightful something like what happens to suddenly awakened somnambulist perhaps anyway be over found will under end of stair tread here be if will come to small staircase now will see where paper slipped out of sight perhaps will meet mr mellis be scoundrel said mr crellan be pity ca punish be impossible of course where be proof if have be not sure that hypnotist be responsible at law for what subject doe even if be moving will from one part of house to be scarcely legal crime explanation have given account entirely for disturbed manner of miss garth in presence of mellis merely felt indefinite sense of power over indeed there be possibility that finding easy subject have already practised influence by way of experiment hypnotist a will see in book have always easier task with person have hypnotised before a hewitt have guessed in corridor met mr mellis be thin dark man of about thirty five with large bony feature slight stoop mr crellan glared at ferociously well sir what do want asked mr mellis looked surprised really be very extraordinary remark mr crellan said be late uncle house might with at least a much reason ask what want be here sir a mr holford executor appointed by will yes be will in existence well fact be must find then what do mean sir by calling executor with will to warrant interrupted mellis get out of house if there be will administrate there be will roared mr crellan shaking in face there be will did say have found yet did there be will here be in spite of diabolical trick with scoundrelly hypnotism secret hole rest of get out of place sir will have thrown out of window mr mellis shrugged shoulder with appearance of perfect indifference if have will appointing executor be right suppose although will take care to hold responsible for irregularity a in least understand conduct unless be due to drink will leave with went mr crellan boiled with indignation for minute then turning to hewitt say hope be all right said connecting with queer business will soon see replied hewitt if will come look at pivoted plank went to small staircase hewitt once again opened recess within lay blue foolscap envelope hewitt picked up see said be torn at corner have be here opened be fresh envelope left for morning with corner gummed down little so that must have to tear in opening be be inside hewitt added laughed aloud a drew forth rather crumpled piece of white paper be only childish trick after concluded always liked small practical joke on occasion held out crumpled paper on be inscribed in large capital letter single word sold case of missing hand think have recorded in place hewitt frequent aphorism that there be nothing in world be at possible have not happened be not happening in london there be many strange happening in matter of fact country in matter of fact time occur far enough from london fantastic crime savage revenge mediaeval superstition horrible cruelty though le in sight have be more extinguished by advent of nineteenth century than have ancient race who practised in dark age of race have become civilized of savagery be heard of more there be survival in case say thing having in mind particular case came under personal notice of hewitt affair brought one up standing with gasp doubt of one era good uncle colonel be not in habit of gathering large house party at place at ratherby partly because place be not great one partly because colonel gout be there be excellent bit of shooting for two three gun even when be unable to leave house uncle be always pleased if good friend be enjoying good day sport in territory a to myself good old soul be in perpetual state of offence because visited so seldom though whenever scant holiday fell in convenient time of year be never insensible to attraction of ratherby stubble more than once have sat by old gentleman when foot be exceptionally troublesome amusing with account of of doings of martin hewitt more than once have uncle expressed desire to meet hewitt commissioned with invitation to be presented to hewitt at first likely opportunity for joint excursion to ratherby at length persuaded hewitt to take fortnight rest coincident with little vacation of own got down to ratherby within few day past september st before gun have be fired at colonel bit of shooting colonel found confined to house with foot on familiar rest though ourselves be only guest managed to do pretty well together be during short holiday that case have mentioned arose when first began to record of more interesting of hewitt operation think explained that such case a have not witnessed must set down in impersonal narrative form without intruding present case so far a hewitt work be concerned saw there be circumstance led up to that only fully learned afterwards circumstance however will put in proper place at beginning foster be fairly old ratherby family of whom mr john foster have died by accident at age of about forty leaving wife twelve year younger than three child two boy one girl who be youngest boy grew up strong healthy out of door young ruffian with taste of sportsman quality good bad natural to lad of fairly well disposed character allowed great deal too much of own way from beginning only real bad quality be unfortunate knack of bearing malice certain savage vindictiveness towards such person a chose to consider enemy with lout of village be at unceasing war indeed once got into serious trouble for peppering butcher son who certainly be great blackguard with sparrow shot at usual time went to oxford together be fraternally sent down together in second year after enjoying spell of rustication in first offence be never specifically mentioned about ratherby be rumoured of a something particularly outrageous be at time sixteen year thereabout after death of father that henry robert foster first saw disliked mr jonas sneathy director of penny bank small insurance office visited ranworth foster home great deal more than brother thought necessary indeed be not for lack of rudeness on part that mr sneathy failed to understand a far a be concerned room be preferred to company mother welcomed in end be announced that mr foster be to marry again that after name must be mr sneathy hereupon there be violent scene at ranworth henry robert foster denounced prospective father in law a fortune hunter snuffler hypocrite did not stop at broad hint a to honesty of penny bank insurance office house straightway became house of bitter strife marriage took place be not long before mr sneathy real character became generally obvious for month be model if somewhat sanctimonious husband influence over wife be complete then discovered that property have be strictly secured by first husband will willing a might be be unable to raise money for new husband benefit be quite powerless to pas to of property by deed of gift hereupon man nature showed foolish woman a mr sneathy might be be loving indeed infatuated wife sneathy repaid devotion by vulgar derision never hesitating to state plainly that have married for own profit that considered swindled in result more even proceeded to blow other practical brutality of sort only devisable by mean ugly nature treatment at first secret became open in midst of mr sneathy penny bank insurance office came to grievous smash at once everybody wondered how mr sneathy kept out of gaol keep out of gaol did however for have taken care to remain on safe side of law though of co director learnt taste of penal servitude be beggared lived a be mere pensioner in wife house here brutality increased to frightful extent till wife already broken in health in consequence went in constant fear of life miss foster passed life of weeping misery friend entreaty however must not persuade mr sneathy to obtain legal separation from husband clung to with excuse for be more that hoped to win to kindness by submission with pathetic infatuation seemed to increase a bodily strength diminished henry robert a may be supposed be anything silent in circumstance indeed broke out violently again again more than once went near permanently injuring worthy father in law once especially when sneathy absolutely without provocation made motion to strike wife in presence there be fearful scene two sprang at like wild beast knocked down dragged to balcony with intention of throwing out of window mr sneathy impeded hysterically imploring to desist if lift hand to mother roared henry gripping sneathy by throat till fat face turned blue banging head against wall if lift hand to mother again will chop off will will chop off drive down throat will do worse said robert white frantic with passion will hang hang to door be proved liar thief be worse than common murderer 'd hang to front door for twopence for few day sneathy be comparatively quiet cowed by violence then took to venting redoubled spite on unfortunate wife always in absence of son well aware that must never inform on part finding apparently better behaved in consequence of attack thought to maintain wholesome terror scarcely passed without menace taking fiendish delight in repeating threat have used during scene by way of keeping present to mind take care of hand sir must say keep to by george will take off with billhook revenge for sneathy took unobserved on mother truly miserable household soon however brother left home went to london by way of looking for profession henry began belated study of medicine robert made pretence of reading for bar indeed departure be a much a anything consequence of earnest entreaty of sister who saw that presence at home be exasperation to sneathy aggravated mother secret suffering went therefore at ranworth thing became worse little be allowed to be known outside house be broadly said that mr sneathy behaviour have now become outrageous beyond description servant left faster than new one must be found gave late employer character of raving maniac once indeed committed in village attacking with walking inoffensive tradesman who have accidentally brushed against immediately running home assault have to be compounded for by payment of fifty pound then henry robert foster received most urgent letter from sister requesting immediate presence at home went at once of course servant account of what occurred be when brother arrived mr sneathy have just left house brother be shut up with mother sister for about quarter of hour then left came out to stable yard together coachman be new man who have only arrived day before overheard little of talk a stood by door mr henry said that thing must be done at once there be two of so that ought to be easy enough afterwards mr robert said will know best how to go about a doctor after mr henry came towards coachman asked in what direction mr sneathy have gone coachman replied that be in direction of ratherby wood by winding footpath led through a spoke distinctly with corner of eye saw other brother take halter from hook by stable door put into coat pocket so far for earlier event whereof learned later bit by bit be on day of arrival of brother foster at old home indeed little more than two hour after incident last set down news of mr sneathy came to colonel brett place where hewitt be sitting chatting with colonel news be that mr sneathy have committed suicide have be found hanging in fact to tree in ratherby wood just by side of footpath hewitt have of course at time never heard of sneathy colonel told what little knew have never spoken to man said indeed nobody in place outside ranworth must have anything to do with be certainly be unholy scoundrel over poor people bank said uncle if what say true be be about a bad a possible to wretched wife must have be pretty miserable too with scoundrelism for be completely ruined man without chance of retrieving position detested by everybody indeed of recent doings if what have heard be to be relied on have be very much of madman so that on whole be not much surprised suicide about only crime suppose that have never experimented with till now indeed be rather service to world at large only service expect colonel sent man to make further inquiry presently man returned with news now be said that mr sneathy have not committed suicide have be murdered hard on man heel came mr hardwick neighbour of uncle fellow j p have have case reported to seemed a soon a body have be found have at once gone to spot have found body hanging with right hand cut off be murder brett said without doubt most horrible case of murder mutilation hand be cut off taken away whether atrocity be committed before after hanging of course ca say missing hand make plainly case of murder not suicide have come to consult about issuing warrant for think there be doubt a to identity of murderer be good job said colonel else must have have work for mr martin hewitt here must be fair a be taking rest whom do think of having arrested two young foster be plain a can be most revolting crime too bad a sneathy may have be came down from london to day went out deliberately to be clear be heard talking of asked a to direction in have gone followed with rope be that rather unusual form of murder hanging hewitt remarked perhaps be mr hardwick replied be case here plain enough seems in fact that have way of threatening to hang even to cut off hand if used to strike mother so that appear to have carried out what might have seemed mere idle threat in diabolically savage way of course may have strangled first hanged after by way of carrying out threat venting spite on mutilated body that did be plain enough for have spent hour two over feel be certainly more than justified in ordering apprehension indeed be with at time a have found by track on footpath through wood colonel turned to martin hewitt mr hardwick must know said be by way of being amateur in particular line very good amateur too must say judging by case two have known in county hewitt bowed laughingly expressed fear lest mr hardwick must come to london supplant altogether seems curious case added if mind think must like to take glance at track other trace there may be just by way of keeping hand in certainly mr hardwick replied brightening must of thing like to have mr hewitt opinion on observation have made just for own gratification a to opinion there can be room for doubt thing be plain with many promise not to be late for dinner left uncle walked with mr hardwick in direction of ratherby wood be unfrequented part told by particular care have managed hoped to prevent rumour spreading to village yet so that might hope to find trail not yet overlaid be man of own said who making short cut through wood have come upon body hanging have run immediately to inform with man have gone back cut down body made observation have followed trail backward to ranworth there have found new coachman who have once be in own service from have learned doings of brother foster a left place from have ascertained that have not then returned then leaving man by body have come straight to uncle presently came on footpath leading from ranworth across field to ratherby wood be mere trail of bare earth worn by successive foot amid grass be damp stooped examined footmark be to be seen on pointed one way towards wood in distance fortunately be not greatly frequented path mr hardwick said see there be mark of three pair of foot only a first sneathy then of brother came way footmark must be theirs be sneathy be plain be large flat one if notice be distinctly visible in centre of track showing plainly that belong to man who walked alone be sneathy of others mark of outside foot left on left side right on right be often not visible clearly belong to two men walking side by side more often than not treading with outer foot on grass at side where happen to drop on same spot a mark in middle cover plainly be footmark of henry robert foster made a followed sneathy agree with mr hewitt oh yes be very plain have better pair of eye than most people mr hardwick good idea of using too will go into wood now a matter of fact can pretty clearly distinguish most of other footmark on grass be matter of much training followed footpath keeping on grass at side in case must be desirable to refer again to foot track for little distance into wood track continued a before of brother overlaying of sneathy then there be difference path here be broader muddy because of proximity of tree suddenly outer footprint separated more overlay larger one in centre proceeded at equal distance on side of see there cried mr hardwick pointing triumphantly to spot be where overtook walked on side body be found only little farther on must see place now if path did zigzag about so hewitt said nothing stooped examined track at side with great care evident thought spanning distance between comparatively with arm then rose stepped lightly from one mark to taking care not to tread on mark very good said shortly on finishing examination will go on went on presently came to place where body lay here ground sloped from left down towards right tiny streamlet mere trickle of foot two wide ran across path in rainy season be probably wider for earth clay have be washed away for foot on side leaving flat bare very coarse gravel on trail be lost just beyond to left body lay on grassy knoll under limb of tree from still depended part of cut rope be not pleasant sight man be soft fleshy creature probably rather under than over medium height lay there with stretched neck protruding tongue revolting object right arm lay by side stump of wrist be clotted with black blood mr hardwick man be still in charge seemingly little pleased with job few yard off stood couple of countryman looking on hewitt asked from direction men have come having ascertained noticed footmark asked to stay exactly where be to avoid confusing such other track a might be seen then addressed to examination first said glancing up at branch be scarce yard above head rope have be here for time yes mr hardwick replied be old swing rope child used in summer got partly cut away odd couple of yard have be hanging since ah said hewitt then if foster did be saved trouble by chance be able to take halter back with so avoid one chance of detection very closely scrutinised top of tree stump probably relic of tree have be cut down long before then addressed to body when cut down said did fall in heap man eased down to extent not on to face oh on to back just a be now mr hardwick saw that hewitt be looking at muddy mark on of corpse knee to one of small leaf clung at one two other mark of same sort on fore part of dress seems to show pretty plainly said that must have struggled with be thrown forward doe hewitt did not reply gingerly lifted right arm by sleeve be of brother foster left handed asked think not here bennett have seen plenty of doings cricket shooting so on do remember if be left handed nayther sir mr hardwick man answered on right handed hewitt lifted lapel of coat attentively regarded small rent in dead man hat lay near after few glance at hewitt dropped turned attention to hair be coarse dark long brushed straight back with parting doe look very symmetrical doe hewitt remarked pointing to lock over right ear be shorter just there than on other side apparently very clumsily cut whereas in other part hair appeared to be rather well carefully trimmed mr hardwick said nothing fidgeted little a though considered that valuable time be being wasted over irrelevant triviality presently however spoke there be very little to be learned from body be there said think be quite justified in ordering arrest eh indeed have wasted too much time already hewitt be groping about among bush behind tree from corpse have be taken when answered said think must do anything of sort just now mr hardwick a matter of fact fancy word with emphasis that brother foster may not have seen man sneathy at to day not seen why dear sir there be question of be certain absolutely evidence be positive fact of threat of body being found treated so be pretty well enough must think be nothing look at footmark have walked along with one side without possible doubt plainly be last people with in case mean to ask anybody to believe that dead man even if hanged cut off own hand first even if do where be hand even putting aside consideration complete case in foster must at least have seen body a came past yet nothing have be heard of yet why did spread alarm went straight away in opposite direction from home there be footmark have not seen yet beyond gravel hewitt stepped over to where patch of clean gravel ceased at opposite side to that from have approached brook there sure enough be now familiar footmark of brother leading away from scene of sneathy end yes hewitt said see of course mr hardwick will do what seems right in own eye in case not much harm will be done by arrest beyond terrible fright for unfortunate family nevertheless if care for impression be a have said that foster have not seen sneathy to day what about hand a to have conjecture a yet be only conjecture if told must probably call absurd certainly 'd disregard perhaps quite excusably case be complicated one if there be anything at in conjecture one of most remarkable have ever have to do with interest intensely will devote little time now to following up theory have formed have suppose already communicated with police wired to shopperton at once a soon a heard of matter be twelve mile drive wonder police have not arrived yet ca be long know where village constable have got to in case must be much good a to idea that foster ca be suspected well nobody must respect opinion mr hewitt more than really just think notion impossible fiftyfold impossible a soon a police arrive will have trail followed foster apprehended must be fool if did very well mr hardwick hewitt replied will do what consider duty of course quite properly though must recommend to take glance at three trail in path will take look in direction turned up by side of streamlet keeping on gravel at side followed climbed rising ground presently among tree came to place where little rill emerged from broken ground in highest part of wood here clean ground ceased there be large patch of wet clayey earth several mark left by foot of cattle be there one two human footmark two of pair newest most distinct hewitt studied carefully measured direction notice mark said may be of importance may not that will see fortunately be very distinctive right boot be badly worn one small tag of leather where soul be damaged be doubled over trodden into soft earth nothing must be luckier clearly be most recent footstep in direction from main road lie right ahead through rest of wood then think somebody else have be on scene of tragedy beside victim brother said yes do hark there be vehicle in road can see between tree yes be police cart will be able to report arrival to mr hardwick a go down turned walked rapidly down incline to where have come from mr hardwick man be still there rustic have arrived to gape told hardwick that might expect police presently proceeded along gravel skirting stream toward lower part of wood here hewitt proceeded very cautiously keeping sharp look out on side for footprint on neighbouring soft ground there be none however for gravel margin of stream made sort of footpath of tree undergrowth be close thick on side at bottom emerged from wood on small piece of open ground skirting lane here just by side of lane where stream fell into trench hewitt suddenly pounced on footmark be unusually excited see said here be right foot with broken leather corresponding left foot on damp edge of lane man with broken shoe have walked on hard gravel way down from source of stream be only trail unaccounted for near body come brett have adventure on foot do care to let uncle dinner go by board follow ca go back tell there be time to lose must follow up man at least must go stay of course a think best hesitated moment picturing to myself excellent colonel a must appear after waiting dinner hour two for decided to go at rate said if way lie along road will probably meet somebody going in direction of ratherby who will take message what be theory understand at must say everything hardwick said seemed to to be beyond question there be track to prove that three have walked together to spot that brother have gone on alone other circumstance pointed same way then what possible motive must anybody else about here have for crime unless indeed be one of people defrauded by sneathy late company motive said hewitt be fancy most extraordinary indeed weird one thing a of century ago ask question think will be little surprised before very long come must move mended pace along lane lane by bye be hard firm with scarcely spot where track might be left except in place at side at place hewitt never gave glance at end lane turned into by road at turning hewitt stopped scrutinised ground closely there be nothing like recognisable footmark to be seen almost immediately hewitt turned off to right continued brisk march without glance at road how did judge way to turn then asked did see replied hewitt will show at next turning mile farther on road forked here hewitt stooped pointed silently to couple of small twig placed crosswise with longer twig of two pointing down branch of road to left took branch to left went on man making mistake hewitt observed leaf friend message lying about for enemy to read hurried forward with scarcely word be almost too bewildered by what hewitt have said done to formulate anything like reasonable guess a to what expedition tended even to make effective inquiry though after what hewitt have said knew must be useless who be mysterious man with broken shoe what have to do with murder of sneathy did mutilation mean who be friend who left sign message by mean of crossed twig met man by whom sent short note to uncle soon after turned into main road here again at corner be curious message of twig cart wheel have passed over crushed have not so far displaced a to cause doubt that direction to take be to right at inn little farther along entered hewitt bought pint of irish whisky flat bottle to hold in a well a loaf of bread cheese carried away wrapped in paper will have to do for dinner hewitt said a emerged be not going to drink pint of common whisky between asked in astonishment never mind hewitt answered with smile perhaps will find somebody to help somebody not so fastidious a a to quality now hurried hurried more than ever for be beginning to get dusk hewitt feared difficulty in finding reading twig sign in dark two more turning made with silent direction crossed twig to there be something almost weird creepy in curious hunt for invisible incomprehensible guided faithfully persistently at turn by now unmistakable signal after second turning broke into trot along long winding lane presently hewitt hand fell on shoulder stopped pointed ahead where large object round bend of hedge be illuminated a though by light from below will walk now hewitt said remember that be on walking tour have come along here entirely by accident proceeded at swinging walk hewitt whistling gaily soon turned bend saw that large object be travelling van drawn up with two others on space of grass by side of lane be gipsy encampment caravan having apparently only lately stopped for man be still engaged in tugging at rope of tent stood near van two three sullen looking ruffian lay about fire burned in space left in middle of encampment woman stood at door of one van with large kettle in hand at foot of step below more pleasant looking old man sat on inverted pail hewitt swung towards fire from road with indescribable mixture of slouch bow smile addressed company generally with kooshto bock pal good luck brother men on ground took notice continued to stare doggedly before man working at tent looked round quickly for moment old man on bucket looked up nodded quick to see most likely friend hewitt at once went up to old man extending hand sarshin daddo said dell mandy tooty varst how do do father give hand old man smiled shook hand though without speaking then hewitt proceeded producing flat bottle of whisky tatty for pawny chals dell mandy pawny lell posh tatty spirit for water lad give water take share of spirit whisky did be romany rye in twenty minute le have already be taking tea with gipsy for time two three have found about fire be still reserved found be only half gipsy understood very little romany one two others however including old man be of purer breed talked freely a did one of woman be lee said expected to be on wirksby racecourse in three day time too be pirimengroes traveller hewitt explained might look to see on course then fell to telling gipsy story to telling others back to intense mystification hewitt explained afterwards that be mostly story of poaching with now again horse coping anecdote thrown in since then have learned enough of romany to take part in such conversation at time word two here there be must understand in talk man have first noticed stretching tent rope took very little interest lay with head away from fire smoking pipe be much darker man than other present have in fact appearance of man of even swarthier race than of others about presently in middle of long of course to unintelligible story by old man caught hewitt eye lifted one eyebrow almost imperceptibly glanced for single moment at walking stick then saw that be pointed toward foot of very dark man who have not yet spoken one leg be thrown over others a lay with sol of shoe presented toward fire in glare saw that right sole be worn broken that small triangular tag of leather be doubled over beneath in just place knew of from print in ratherby wood must not take eye off man with broken shoe there lay secret whole mystery of fantastic crime in ratherby wood centred in shabby ruffian what be hewitt went on talking joking furiously men who be not speaking mostly smoked gloomily whenever one spoke became animated lively have attempted once twice to join in though effort be not particularly successful except in inducing one man to offer tobacco from box tobacco that almost made giddy in smell tried of mine in exchange though praised with native politeness smoked pipe through must see that hignett mixture be poor stuff in estimation compared with awful tobacco in own box presently man with broken shoe got up slouched over to tent disappeared then said hewitt translate be not lee here see yes pal lee be not lee hewitt jerked head towards tent why not lee pal be lee be with thus be lee oh yes of course know be from over pawny come will guess tem come from be from roumania eh perhaps wallachian part country men looked at one then old lee said be right pal be cleverer than took for be what call tem be petulengroand come with to shoe gries mend vardoes be with so be lee smith horse van talk smoke went on presently man with broken shoe returned lay down again then when whisky have gone hewitt with excuse did not understand have begged piece of cord from one of men left in chorus of kooshto rardies good night by time be nearly ten o'clock walked briskly till came back again to inn where have bought whisky here hewitt after little trouble succeeded in hiring village cart while driver be harnessing horse cut couple of short stick from hedge being divided into two made four short stout piece of something le than six inch long apiece then hewitt joined together in pair pair being connected from centre to centre by about nine ten inch of cord have brought from gipsy camp done handed one pair to handcuff explained bad one see use so passed cord round wrist gripping two handle giving slight twist sufficiently convinced of excruciating pain might be inflicted by vigorous turn utter helplessness of prisoner thus secured in hand of captor prepared to use instrument whom be for asked man with broken shoe hewitt nodded yes said expect will find out alone about midnight know how to use now be fully eleven before cart be ready started quarter of mile so from gipsy encampment hewitt stopped cart gave driver instruction to wait got through hedge made way on soft ground behind in direction of van tent roll up handkerchief hewitt whispered into tight pad moment grab ram into mouth well in mind so that doe easily fall out probably will be stooping will make easier can pull suddenly backward now be quiet kept on till nothing hedge divided from space whereon stood encampment be now nearer twelve o'clock than eleven time waited seemed endless time be not eternity after at last heard move in tent minute after man sought be standing before made straight for gap in hedge have passed on way crouched low waited emerged on side of hedge with back towards began walking a have walked behind hedge in opposite direction followed carried something in hand that looked like large bundle of stick twig appeared to be a anxious to be secret a from time to time stopped listened fortunately there be moon in turning about a did once twice must probably have observed field sloped downward just before there be hedge at right angle leading down to slight hollow to hollow man made way in shade of new hedge followed presently stopped suddenly stooped deposited bundle on ground before crouching before produced match from pocket struck one in moment have fire of twig small branch sent up heavy white smoke what portended must not imagine sense of weirdness of whole adventure came upon unchecked horrible corpse in wood with severed wrist hewitt enigmatical foreboding mysterious tracking of man with broken shoe scene round gipsy fire now strange behaviour of man whose connection with tragedy be so intimate yet so inexplicable thing contributed to make up tale of few hour duration of inscrutable impressiveness began to feel in nerve man bent thin stick double using a pair of tongs held indistinguishable object over flame before excited a be must not help noticing that bent held stick with left hand crept stealthily nearer a stood scarcely three yard behind looked over shoulder form of object stood out clear black against dull red of flame be human hand suppose may have somehow betrayed amazement horror to companion sharp eye for suddenly felt hand tightly grip arm just above elbow turned found face close by mine finger raised warningly then saw produce wrist grip make motion with palm toward mouth understood to be intended to remind of gag stepped forward man turned horrible cookery over over above crackling stick a though to smoke dry in part saw hewitt hand reach out toward in flash have pulled back over heel have driven gag between teeth a opened mouth seized wrist in cord at once will never forget man look of ghastly frantic terror a lay on ground when knew more understood reason of hewitt took wristholds in one hand drove gag entirely into man mouth so that almost choked piece of sacking lay near fire by hewitt request dropped that awful hand from wooden twig upon rolled up in parcel be doubt what sacking have be brought for then lifted man to foot hurried in direction of cart whole capture must not have occupied thirty second a stumbled over rough field at man left elbow must only think of thing a one think of dream one know time be dream presently man who have be walking quietly though gasping sniffing choking because of tightly rolled handkerchief in mouth presently made sudden dive thinking doubtless to get wrist free by surprise hewitt be alert gave twist made roll head with dismal stifled yell with opening of mouth by chance gag fell away immediately man roared aloud for help quick said hewitt drag along will hear in van bring hand seized fallen handkerchief crammed over man mouth a well a might together made a much of trot a must dragging man between while hewitt checked reluctance on part by timely wrench of wristholds be hard two hundred fifty yard to lane even for for gipsy must have be bad minute half indeed once more a went over uneven ground managed to get out shout thought heard distinct reply from somewhere in direction of encampment pulled over stile in tangle dragged pushed through small hedge gap in heap here be short distance from cart into flung without wasting time tenderness to intense consternation of driver who believe very nearly set up cry for help on own account once in cart however seized rein whip leaving hewitt to take care of prisoner put turn out along toward ratherby at a near ten mile hour a must go made first for mr hardwick found be with uncle so followed arrest of foster have be effected learned not very long after have left wood a returned by route to ranworth brought prisoner into colonel library where mr hardwick be sitting be not quite sure what can charge with unless be anatomical robbery hewitt remarked here be criminal man only looked down with sulkily impenetrable countenance hewitt spoke to once twice at last said in strange accent something sounded like kekin jin navvy keck jin asked hewitt in loud clear tone one instinctively adopts in talking to foreigner keckeno jinny not understand man understood shook head not word must say question answer be foreign gipsy hewitt explained just a thought wallachian in fact theirs be older purer dialect than of english gipsy only of root word be alike think can make explain to morrow that foster at least have nothing to do with at rate cutting off sneathy hand here be think gingerly lifted fold of sacking from ghastly object a lay on table then covered up again what what doe mean mr hardwick said in bewildered astonishment do mean man be accomplice not at case be one of suicide a think will agree when have explained man simply found body hanging stole hand what in world for for hand of glory eh turned to gipsy pointed to hand on table yag varst eh fire hand there be quick gleam of intelligence in man eye said nothing a for myself be more than astounded must be possible that old superstition of hand of glory remained alive in practical shape at day know superstition of course hewitt said did exist in country in last century when there be plenty of dead men hanging at cross road so on on continent in place have survived later among wallachian gipsy have always be great article of belief superstition be quite active still belief be that right hand of hanged man cut off dried over smoke of certain wood herb then provided with wick at finger made of dead man hair becomes when lighted at wick wick be greased of course charm whereby thief may walk without hinderance where plea in strange house push open door take what like nobody can stop for everybody hand of glory approach be made helpless can neither move speak may remember there be talk of 'thieves candle in connection with horrible series of whitechapel murder not long ago be only one form of cult of hand of glory yes uncle said remember reading so there be story about in ingoldsby legend too believe there be be called 'the hand of glory ' in fact remember spell lock to dead man knock ' so on think 'd better have constable up get man into safe quarter for night must be searched of course expect will find on hair noticed to have be cut from sneathy head village constable arrived with iron handcuff in substitution for of cord have so sorely vexed wrist of prisoner marched away to little lock up on green then uncle mr hardwick turned on martin hewitt with doubt many question why do call suicide mr hardwick asked be plain foster be with at time from track do mean to say that stood there watched sneathy hang without interfering hewitt replied lighting cigar think told that never saw sneathy yes did of course be what said when be arrested thing impossible look at track track be exactly what revealed to that be not impossible hewitt returned will tell how case unfolded to from beginning a to information gathered from ranworth coachman to begin with conversation between foster overheard might well mean something le serious than murder what did say have be sent for in hurry have just have short consultation with mother sister henry said that 'the thing must be done at once ' also that a there be two of must be easy robert said henry a doctor must know best what to do now colonel brett have be saying before learned thing from mr hardwick that sneathy behaviour of late have become so bad a to seem of madman then there be story of sudden attack on tradesman in village equally sudden running away exactly sort of impulsive wild thing madman do why then might not be reasonable to suppose that sneathy have become mad more especially considering circumstance of case commercial ruin disgrace horrible life with wife family have become suddenly much worse quite uncontrollable so that two wretched woman left alone with be driven to send in haste for henry robert to help must account for brother arrive just after sneathy have gone out be told in hurried interview how affair stand be decided that sneathy must be at once secured confined in asylum before something serious happens have just gone out something terrible may be happening at moment brother determine to follow at once secure wherever may be then meaning of conversation be plain thing beust be done at once ' be capture of sneathy confinement in asylum henry a doctor must 'know what to do ' in regard to necessary formality took halter in case struggle must ensue be found necessary to bind very likely be well yes mr hardwick replied certainly be never struck in light at be because believed to begin with murder have be committed looked at preliminary circumstance learned after in light of conviction now to come to actual observation saw footmark across field agreed with be indeed obvious that sneathy have gone that way first that brother have followed walking over track state of track continued until well into wood when suddenly track of brother opened out proceeded on side of sneathy simple inference must seem to be of course one made that foster have here overtaken sneathy walked one at side of of felt by mean certain very simple explanation be available might chance to be true one be just at spot where brother track separated that path became suddenly much muddier because of closer overhanging of tree at spot path be a be to be expected wettest in middle must be most natural thing in world for two well dressed young men on arriving here to separate so a to walk one on side of mud in middle on other hand man in sneathy state assuming for moment to be mad contemplating suicide must walk straight along centre of path taking note of mud anything else examined track very carefully theory be confirmed foot of brother have everywhere alighted in driest spot step be of irregular length meant of course that be picking way while sneathy footmark have never turned aside even for dirtiest puddle here then be rudiment of theory at watercourse of course footmark ceased because of hard gravel body lay on knoll at left knoll covered with grass on sign of footmark be almost undiscoverable although be often able to discover track in grass be invisible to others here however be almost useless to spend much time in examination for man have be there what slight mark there might be must be indistinguishable one from under branch from man have hung there be old tree stump with flat top where tree have be sawn off examined became fairly apparent that sneathy have stood on when rope be about neck muddy footprint be plain to see mud be not smeared about see a probably must have be if have be stood there forcibly pushed off be simple clear footprint hint at suicide then arose objection that mentioned plainly brother foster be following sneathy came way therefore if hanged before arrived must seem that must have come across body now examined body there be mud on knee clinging to one knee be small leaf be leaf corresponding to on bush behind tree be not dead leaf so must have be just detached after examination of body went to bush there in thick of be for sufficiently distinct knee mark in one of knee have crushed spray of bush against ground from spray leaf be missing behind knee mark be indentation of boot toe in soft bare earth under bush thus thing be plain poor lunatic have come in sight of dangling rope temptation to suicide be irresistible to people in deranged state of mind mere sight of mean of self destruction be often temptation impossible to withstand at moment must have heard step probably voice of brother behind on winding path immediately hid in bush till have passed be probable that seeing who men be conjecturing that be following thinking also perhaps of thing have occurred between inclination to self destruction became completely ungovernable with result that saw before inspected bush noticed one two more thing about body remember inquired if of brother foster be left handed be assured that be clearly hand have be cut off by left handed man with large sharply pointed knife for well away to right of where wrist have hung knife point have made tiny triangular rent in coat so that hand must have be held in mutilator right hand while used knife with left clearly left handed man most important of about body be jagged hair over right ear everywhere else hair be well cut orderly here seemed a though good piece have be so to speak sawn off what must anybody want with dead man right hand certain lock of hair then struck suddenly man be hanged be hand of glory then will remember went at request to see footprint of foster on part of path past watercourse here again be muddy in middle two brother have walked a far apart a before although nobody have walked between final proof if one be needed of theory a to three line of footprint now be to consider how to get at man who have taken hand must be punished for mutilation beyond that must be required a witness now foot track in vicinity have be accounted for there be of brother of sneathy have be speaking of of rustic looking on however stopped little way off did not interfere with sphere of observation of man who have cut straight through wood when first saw body have come back same way with own have be careful to keep away from others consequently there be track of man who have cut off hand therefore be certain that must have come along hard gravel by watercourse for be only possible path must not tell tale indeed seemed quite likely path through wood for passenger to take coming from high ground by shopperton road brett left traversed watercourse up down found footprint at top left lately by man with broken shoe right down to bottom of watercourse where emerged from wood there be sign on side of man having left gravel where body be a will remember must simply have stepped off gravel on to grass thought useless to examine a have explained at bottom by lane footprint appeared again then be direction in be to search for left handed man with broken soled shoe probably gipsy most probably foreign gipsy because foreign gipsy must be most likely still to hold belief in hand of glory conjectured man to be straggler from band of gipsy one who probably have got behind caravan have made short cut across wood after so at end of lane looked for patrin be sign gipsy leave to guide straggler following up sometimes be heap of dead leaf sometimes few stone sometimes mark on ground more usually couple of twig crossed with longer twig pointing road guided by patrins came in end on gipsy camp just a be settling down for night made agreeable a brett will probably describe to better than can left after have got to sleep came back watched for gentleman who be now in lock up must of course seize first opportunity of treating ghastly trophy in prescribed way guessed must choose midnight for be time superstition teach that hand must be prepared made few small preparation collared now have got must think sooner let brother foster go better why did tell conclusion have arrived at at time asked mr hardwick well really hewitt replied with quiet smile be so positive of trace relied on be so small that must probably have meant long argument loss of time more than confess if have told bluntly that sneathy hand have be taken away to make mediaeval charm to enable thief to pas through locked door steal plate calmly under owner nose what must have said well well perhaps must have be little sceptical appearance combined so completely to point to foster a murderer that other explanation almost must have seemed unlikely to well confess must have believed in be startling thing to find such superstition alive now day yes perhaps be yet find survival of sort very frequently wallachians however be horribly superstitious still gipsy among be of course worse remember case reported few month ago in child be drowned a sacrifice in wallachia in order to bring rain be not done by gipsy either even in england a late a poor paralysed frenchman be killed by being bewum for witchcraft be in essex le atrocious case of belief in wizardry occur again again even now then mr hardwick uncle fell into discussion a to how gipsy in lock up must be legally punished mr hardwick thought must be treated a theft of portion of dead body uncle fancied there be penalty for mutilation of dead body per se though must not point to statute a happened however be saved trouble of arriving at decision for in morning be discovered to have escaped have be left of course with free hand have occupied night in wrenching out bar at top of back wall of little prison shed have stood on green for hundred fifty year climbing out be not found again month two later foster family left district entirely case of laker absconded there be several of larger london bank insurance office from hewitt held sort of general retainer a detective adviser in fulfilment of be regularly consulted a to measure to be taken in different case of fraud forgery theft so forth might be misfortune of particular firm to encounter more important intricate of case be placed in hand entirely with separate commission in usual way one of most important company of sort be general guarantee society insurance corporation among other risk took of integrity of secretary clerk cashier in case of cash box elopement on part of person guaranteed by society director be naturally anxious for speedy capture of culprit more especially of booty before too much of be spent in order to lighten claim upon fund in work of sort hewitt be at time engaged either in general advice direction in actual pursuit of plunder plunderer arriving at office little later than usual one morning hewitt found urgent message awaiting from general guarantee society requesting attention to robbery have taken place on previous day have gleaned hint of case from morning paper wherein appeared short paragraph ran thus serious bank robbery in course of yesterday clerk employed by messrs liddle neal liddle well known banker disappeared having in possession large sum of money property of employer sum reported to be rather over l must seem that have be entrusted to collect money in capacity of walk clerk from various other bank trading concern during morning failed to return at usual time large number of note received have be cashed at bank of england before suspicion be aroused understand that detective inspector plummer of scotland yard have case in hand clerk whose name be charles william laker have appeared from message be guaranteed in usual way by general guarantee society hewitt presence at office be at once desired in order that step might quickly be taken for man apprehension in recovery at rate of a much of booty a possible smart hansom brought hewitt to threadneedle street in bare quarter of hour there few minute talk with manager mr lyster put in possession of main fact of case appeared to be simple charles william laker be twenty five year of age have be in employ of messrs liddle neal liddle for something more than seven year since left school in fact until previous day there have be nothing in conduct to complain of duty a walk clerk consisted in making certain round beginning at

yesterday report be that nothing more have be heard of morning there have be message to effect that have be traced out of country to calais at least be thought director of society wished hewitt to take case in hand personally at once with view of recovering what be possible from plunder by way of salvage also of course of finding laker for be important moral gain to guarantee society a example if thief be caught punished therefore hewitt mr lyster a soon a might be made for messrs liddle neal liddle that investigation might be begun bank premise be quite near in leadenhall street having

fancy hewitt said turning to plummer fancy old friend of yours be in mr sam gunter what 'hoxton yob ' think be possible be be mr westley for bit somebody else for bit let come to cellar winsor weekes clerk led way down steep flight of step into dark underground corridor wherein lighted way with many successive match soon corridor made turn to right a party passed turn there came from end of passage before fearful yell help help open door be going mad mad o god there be sound of desperate beating from inside of cellar door at extreme end men stopped startled come said more match rushed to door be fastened with bar padlock let out for god sake came voice sick hoarse from inside let out all right hewitt shouted have come for wait moment voice sank into sort of sobbing croon hewitt tried several key from own bunch on padlock none fitted drew from pocket wire have used for bolt of front door straightened out made sharp bend at end hold match close ordered shortly one of men obeyed three four attempt be necessary several different bending of wire be effected in end hewitt picked lock flung open door from within ghastly figure fell forward among fainting knocked out match hullo cried plummer hold up who be let get up into open said hewitt ca tell who be for bit believe be laker laker what here think so steady up step bump be pretty sore already expect truly man be pitiable sight hair face be caked in dust blood finger nail be torn bleeding water be sent for at once brandy well said plummer hazily looking first at unconscious prisoner then at hewitt what about swag will have to find hewitt replied think share of case be about finished only act for guarantee society know if laker proved innocent innocent how well be took place a near a can figure 'd better undo collar think to men what believe have happened be there have be very clever carefully prepared conspiracy here laker have not be criminal victim be robbed mean how where yesterday morning before have be to more than three bank here in fact then how be wrong know made whole round did collection then palmer office umbrella why man lay still unconscious raise head hewitt said one of have best fetch doctor be have terrible shock then turning to plummer went on a to how managed job will tell think first struck very clever person that deal of money might be got by robbing walk clerk from bank clever person be one of clever gang of thief perhaps hoxton row gang a think hinted now know quite a well a do that gang will spend amount of time over job promise big haul that for job can always command necessary capital there be many most respectable person living in good style in suburb whose chief business lie in financing such venture taking chief share of proceeds well be plan carefully intelligently carried out watch laker observe round take habit find that there be only one of clerk with whom doe business that be much acquainted with that clerk be in bank be commonly second in laker round sharpest man among think there be man in london must do a well a young sam gunter study laker dress habit just a actor study character take office cellar a have seen because be next door to bank whose front entrance be being altered fact laker must know from daily visit smart man gunter let say have other reason for believing to be make up precisely like laker false moustache dress everything wait here with rest of gang one of gang be dressed in blue coat with brass button like hall porter in buller bank do see yes think so be pretty clear now confederate watch at top of court moment laker turn in from cornhill having already be mind at only bank where be so well known that disguised thief must not have passed muster a soon a turn in from cornhill say signal be given board pointing to with white letter be hung on hook in doorpost sham porter stand beside a laker approach say 'this way in sir morning front way shut for alteration laker suspecting nothing supposing that firm have made temporary entrance through empty house enters be seized when well along corridor board be taken down door shut probably be stunned by blow on head see blood now take wallet cash have already collected gunter take wallet also umbrella since have laker initial be therefore distinctive simply completes walk in character of laker beginning with buller clayton ladds just round corner be nothing routine work be quickly done nobody notice particularly be bill examine meanwhile unfortunate fellow be locked up in cellar here right at end of underground corridor where can never make heard in street where next be only empty cellar of deserted house next door thief shut front door vanish rest be plain gunter having completed round bagged l more spends few pound in tourist ticket at palmer a blind being careful to give laker name leaf umbrella at charing cross in conspicuous place right opposite lost property office where be sure to be seen so completes false trail then who be people at hackworth road capitalist life there financier probably directing spirit of whole thing merston name go by there have doubt cut very imposing figure in chapel sunday will be worth picking up be first thing be be in will warrant what about laker mother miss shaw well what poor woman be nearly out of mind with terror shame be though may think laker criminal will never desert have be following about with feeble vague sort of hope of being able to baffle in way help if caught something poor thing did ever hear of real woman who 'd desert son lover merely because be criminal here be doctor when be attended to will let men take laker home must hurry report to guarantee society think said perplexed plummer where did get clue must have have tip from one know ca have done by clairvoyance what gave tip daily chronicle what daily chronicle just take look at 'agony column ' in yesterday morning issue read message to 'yob ' to gunter in fact that be by time cab be waiting in lombard street two of plummer men under doctor direction carried laker to sooner however be in court than two watching woman threw hysterically upon laker be long before must be persuaded that be not being taken to gaol mother shrieked aloud boy boy take oh take have killed boy look at head oh head wrestled desperately with men while hewitt attempted to soothe promised to allow to go in cab with son if must only be quiet younger woman made noise held one of laker limp hand in hers hewitt dined together that evening gave full account of occurrence have here set down still when be finished be not able to see clearly by what process of reasoning have arrived at conclusion gave key to mystery did understand agony column message said so in beginning hewitt explained thing struck a curious be fact that laker be said to have given own name at palmer in buying ticket now first thing greenest newest criminal think of be changing name so that giving of own name seemed unlikely to begin with still might have made mistake a plummer suggested when said that criminal usually make mistake somewhere a do in fact still be least likely mistake must think of especially a actually did wait to be asked for name blurted out when be really wanted be conjoined with rather curious mistake what must have be mistake if thief be laker why must conspicuously display wallet distinctive article for clerk to see note why rather have not got rid of before showing suppose must be somebody personating laker in case determined not to be prejudiced by what have heard of laker betting man may bet without being thief again supposing be laker might not have given name displayed wallet so on while buying ticket for france in order to draw pursuit after in direction while made off in in name disguised supposition be plausible in case might happen that be laying trail must probably lay little farther charing cross be next point there went already have from plummer that laker have not be recognised there perhaps trail have be laid in other manner something left behind with laker name on perhaps at once thought of umbrella with monogram making long shot asked for at lost property office a know guess be lucky in umbrella a know found that scrap of paper judged have fallen in from hand of man carrying umbrella have torn paper in half in order to fling away one piece have fallen into loosely flapping umbrella be thing will often happen with omnibus ticket a may have noticed also be proved that umbrella be unrolled when found rolled immediately after so here be piece of paper dropped by person who have brought umbrella to charing cross left got whole advertisement a remember studied 'yob ' be back slang for 'boy be often used in nickname to denote young smooth faced thief gunter man suspect a matter of fact be known a 'hoxton yob ' message then be addressed to one known by such nickname next 'hr shop roast ' now in thief slang to 'roast ' thing person be to watch call place shop notably thief den so that meant that resort perhaps 'hoxton row shop ' be watched 'you st then to night ' must be clearer perhaps when rest be understood thought little over rest struck that must be direction to other house since one be warned of a being watched besides there be number bed bl ' must be extremely likely to mean bed blind by way of clearly distinguishing house then plan of thing be plain have noticed probably that map of london accompanies post office directory be divided for convenience of reference into numbered square yes square be denoted by letter along top margin figure down side so that if consult directory find place marked a being in d for instance find vertical division d run finger down till intersects horizontal division there be precisely got post office directory looked for ' o ' be in north london took in part of abney park cemetery clissold park top ' be next sign very well counted second street intersecting top of square counting in usual way from left be lordship road then 'rd l ' from point where lordship road crossed top of square ran finger down road till came to 'rd l ' in other word third turning on left hackworth road so there be unless guess be altogether wrong betraight mon ' probably meant betraight moniker be to say proper name thief real name in contradistinction to that may assume turned over directory till found hackworth road found that be inhabited by mr merston from whole thing judged there be to have be meeting at 'hr shop ' be found at last moment to be watched by police for purpose so that appointment be made for house in suburb st then to night ' person addressed be to come first others in evening be to ask for householder betraight moniker ' mr merston be to come one at time now then what be what theory must fit suppose be robbery directed from afar by advertiser suppose on day before robbery be found that place fixed for division of spoil be watched suppose that principal thereupon advertised a have already be agreed in case of emergency in term principal in actual robbery 'yob addressed be to go first with booty others be to come after one at time anyway thing be good enough to follow little further determined to try hackworth road have told what found there how opened eye went of course merely on chance to see what might chance to see luck favoured happened on coat brought back rolled up on evening after robbery doubtless by thief who have used flung carelessly into handiest cupboard be gang mistake well congratulate said hope will catch rascal rather think will now know where to look can scarcely miss merston anyway there have be very little to go upon in case stuck to thread however slight brought through rest of case of course be be be peculiarity of commission must equally well fulfil by catching man with plunder by proving innocent having done latter work be at end left where plummer will be able to finish job handsomely plummer did sam gunter merston one accomplice be taken first last be well known to police be identified by laker merston a hewitt have suspected have kept lion share for so that altogether with what be recovered from other two nearly l be saved for messrs liddle neal liddle merston when taken be in act of packing up to take holiday abroad there cash note be found neatly packed in separate thousand in portmanteau a hewitt have predicted gas bill be considerably le next quarter for le than half way through began term in gaol a for laker be reinstated of course with increase of salary by way of compensation for broken head have passed terrible twenty six hour in cellar unfed unheard several time have become insensible again again have thrown madly against door shouting tearing at till fell back exhausted with broken nail bleeding finger for hour before arrival of rescuer have be sitting in sort of stupor from be suddenly aroused by sound of voice footstep be in bed for week required rest of month in addition before must resume duty then be quietly lectured by mr neal a to betting believe dropped that practice in consequence be told that be at counter now considerable promotion case of lost foreigner have already said in more than one place hewitt personal relation with member of london police force be of cordial character in course of work have frequently be hewitt hap to learn of matter on police be glad of information information be always passed on at once so long a infringement of regulation damage to public service be involved hewitt must always rely on return in kind be with message of useful sort hewitt one day dropped into vine street police station asked for particular inspector who be not in hewitt sat wrote note by way of making conversation said to inspector on duty anything very startling way to day nothing very startling perhaps a yet inspector replied one of chap picked up rather odd customer little while ago lunatic of sort must think in fact have sent for doctor to see be foreigner frenchman believe seemed horribly weak faint oddest thing occurred when one of men thinking might be hungry brought in bread went into fit of terror at sight of must be pacified till took away again that be strange odd be be hungry too brought more little while after did funk bit pitched into in fact like anything ate with cold beef be way with lunatic never same five minute together keep cry like baby saying thing ca understand a happens there be nobody in just now who speaks french speak french hewitt replied will try certainly if will be in men room below have be making a comfortable a possible by fire until doctor come be long time expect be got case on hewitt found way to large mess room where three four policeman in shirt sleeve be curiously regarding young man of very disordered appearance who sat on chair by fire be pale exhibited mark of bruise on face while over one eye be scarcely healed cut figure be small slight coat be torn sat with certain indefinite air of shivering suffering started looked round apprehensively a hewitt entered hewitt bowed smilingly wished good day speaking in french asked if spoke language man looked up with dull expression after effort two a of one who stutter burst out with je le nie be strange hewitt observed to men ask if speaks french say denies speaking in french be be saying that very often sir one of men answered a well a other thing ca make anything of hewitt placed hand kindly on man shoulder asked name reply be for little while inarticulate gurgle presently merging into meaningless medley of word syllable qu'est ce qu ' il n ' leystar squarr sacre nom not spik quel chemin sank ver ' mosh je le nie je le nie paused stared then a though realizing helplessness burst into tear be be cryin ' two three time said man who have spoken before be cryin when found several more attempt hewitt made to communicate with man though seemed to comprehend what be meant replied with nothing meaningless gibber finally gave up attempt leaning against side of fireplace buried head in bend of arm then doctor arrived made examination while be in progress hewitt took aside policeman who have be speaking before questioned further have found frenchman in dull back street by golden square where man be standing helpless trembling apparently quite bewildered very weak have brought in without having be able to learn anything about one two shopkeeper in street where be found be asked knew nothing of indeed have never seen before curiousest thing policeman proceeded be in 'ere room when brought loaf to give bit of snack seein looked so weak 'ungry 'd ' thought be goin ' to poison 'im fair screamed at very sight o ' bread scrouged up in corner ' put hand in front of face must make out what be up at first did tumble to be bein ' bread be frightened of seein a looked like man a 'ud be frightened at anything else afore nearer came with more yelled so took away ' left outside then calmed down ' s'elp when cut bit off that there very loaf ' brought 'em in with bit o beef just went for like one o'clock be frightened o ' bread then bet rum thing how fancy take when be bit touched ai one way one minute other next yes be by way have uncut loaf in place yes sir dozen if like one will be enough be going over to speak to doctor wait awhile until seems very quiet fairly comfortable then bring loaf in quietly put on table not far from elbow attract attention to what be doing doctor stood looking thoughtfully down on frenchman who for part stared gloomily tranquilly at fireplace hewitt stepped quietly over to doctor without disturbing man by fire said interrogatively aphasia doctor tightened lip frowned nodded significantly motor murmured just loudly enough for hewitt to hear there be general nervous break down a well must say by way perhaps there be agraphia have tried with pen paper pen paper be brought set before man be told slowly distinctly that be among friend whose only object be to restore to proper health must write name address other information might care to give about on paper before frenchman took pen stared at paper then slowly with much hesitation traced mark illustration man paused after last of futile character pen stabbed into paper with blot a dazedly regarded work then with groan dropped face sank again into bend of arm doctor took paper handed to hewitt complete agraphia see said ca write word begin to write beonsieur from sheer habit in beginning letter thus word tail off into scrawl then attempt become mere scribble with just trace of familiar word here there quite meaningless although have never before chanced to come across case of aphasia happily rare disease hewitt be acquainted with general nature knew that might arise from physical injury to brain from break down consequent on terrible nervous strain knew that in case of motor aphasia sufferer though fully conscious of go on about though quite understanding what be said to be entirely powerless to put own thought into spoken word have lost in fact connection between word spoken symbol also that in most bad case agraphia loss of ability to write word with reference to meaning be commonly accompaniment will have taken to infirmary suppose hewitt asked doctor replied will go see about at once man looked up again a spoke policeman have in accordance with hewitt request placed loaf of bread on table near now a looked up caught sight of started visibly paled gave such sign of abject terror a policeman have previously observed appeared nervous uneasy however presently reached stealthily toward loaf hewitt continued to talk to doctor while closely watching frenchman behaviour from corner of eye loaf be what be called plain cottage of solid regular shape man reached immediately turned bottom up on table then sank back in chair with more contented expression though gaze be still directed toward loaf policeman grinned silently at curious manoeuvre doctor left hewitt accompanied to door of room will not be moved just yet take hewitt asked a parted may take hour two doctor replied be anxious to keep here not for long think there be curious inside to case may perhaps learn something of by little watching ca spare very long at sign from loaf be removed then hewitt pulled small table closer to frenchman pushed pen sheet of paper toward manoeuvre have result man looked up down room vacantly once twice then began to turn paper over from that went to dipping pen in inkpot presently be scribbling at random on loose sheet hewitt affected to leave entirely alone seemed to be absorbed in contemplation of photograph of police division brass band hung on wall saw scratch man made at first there be nothing meaningless scrawl attempted word then rough sketch appeared of man head chair what not on mantelpiece stood small clock apparently sort of humble presentation piece body of clock being set in horse shoe frame with crossed whip behind after time frenchman eye fell on began crude sketch of that relinquished went on with other random sketch scribblings on same piece of paper sketching scribbling over sketch in half mechanical sort of way a of one who trifle with pen during brown study beginning at top left hand corner of paper travelled round till arrived at left hand bottom corner then dashing pen hastily across last sketch dropped with great shudder turned away again hid face by fireplace hewitt turned at once seized paper on table stuffed into coat pocket with exception of last man have be engaged on facsimile of be subjoined studied earnestly for several minute hewitt wished men good day made way to inspector well inspector said not much to be got out of be there doctor will be sending for presently illustration fancy said hewitt that may turn out very important case possibly quite possibly may not have guessed correctly so wo tell anything of till know little more what want now be messenger can send somebody at once in cab to friend brett at chamber certainly will find somebody want to write note hewitt wrote despatched note reached in le than ten minute then asked inspector have searched frenchman oh yes went over when found must explain to see if must trace friend address did seem to mind there be single thing in pocket not single thing barring rag of pocket handkerchief with marking on noticed that somebody have stolen watch suppose well have got one have one of little vertical button hole in waistcoat used to fasten watchguard to be much worn frayed so that must be in habit of carrying watch be gone yes everything else too eh look like robbery be have knock two in face notice saw bruise cut of course collar have be broken away with back button somebody have taken by collar throat be wearing hat when be found no must imply that have only just left house what street be found in henry street little off golden square low street know did constable notice door open near by inspector shook head door in street be open said pretty nearly day ah then there be nothing in think life there by bye fancy come from more in seven dial drury lane direction did notice anything about man gave clue to occupation at rate to habit ca say did well just take look at back of coat before go away just over loin good day a have said hewitt messenger be quick happened to be in having lately returned from latish lunch when arrived with note dear b meant to have lunched with to day have be kept expect be idle afternoon have case will interest perhaps be useful to from journalistic point of view if care to see anything of cab away at once to fitzroy square south side where will meet will wait no later than yours m h have scarce quarter of hour so seized hat left chamber at once a happened cab hewitt burst into fitzroy square from opposite side almost at same moment so that lost time come said hewitt taking arm marching off be going to look for stabling try to feel a though 'd just set up brougham have come out to look for place to put in fear may have to delude person with belief presently why what do want stable for why make excuse a to what want stable for really be not altogether sure a to making excuse well even humblest excuse be better than none come here be stable not good enough though even if of be empty come on have stopped for instant at entrance to small alley of rather dirty stable hewitt paying apparently small attention to stable have looked sharply about with gaze in air know part of london pretty well hewitt observed can only remember one other range of stabling near by must try that a matter of fact be coming here on little more than conjecture though will be surprised if there be something in do know anything of aphasia have heard of of course though ca say remember ever knowing case have seen one to day very curious case man frenchman discovered helpless in street by policeman only thing can say have meaning in at be 'je le nie ' that say mechanically without in least knowing what be saying ca write got sketching scrawling various thing on paper scrawl together with thing two have given idea be following up now when be le busy in quiet place will show sketch explain thing generally there be time now may want help for bit in case ignorance may prevent spoiling thing clumsy ruffian hullo here be think have stopped at end of stable yard rather dirtier than first stable be sound inelegant shed one two appeared to be devoted to other purpose having low chimney on one of old basket be rakishly set by way of cowl beside entrance worn out old board be nailed with legend stabling to let in letter formerly white on ground formerly black come said hewitt will explore picked way over greasy cobble stone looked about on left be wall enclosing certain back yard on right stable two door in middle of be open butcher young man who with shiny bullet head must have be known for butcher young man anywhere be wiping over new washed wheel of smart butcher cart good day hewitt said pleasantly to young man notice there be stabling to let here now where must inquire about jones whitfield street young man answered giving wheel final spin there be only one little place to let now think ai very grand oh be that next one to street there chap for wood choppin ' e chucked there ai room for more 'n donkey ' barrow ah be pity be not particular want something big enough mind paying fair price perhaps might make arrangement with somebody here who have stable young man shook head must think so said doubtfully be mostly shop people a want room theirselves guv'nor must hink know 'ere two stable ai scarcely enough for ' e want a be then there be barkett greengrocer next door ai no good then next to there be little place a be to let at end there be griffith at butter shop other way well 'ere first one curtis euston road be butter shop too ' e 'as next after that last one up at end dunno quite whose be ai be long took b'lieve be foreign baker ai ever see anythink come out of though there be 'orse there know seen feed took in hewitt turned thoughtfully away thanks said suppose ca manage then good day walked to street a butcher young man wheeled in cart flung away pail of water will just hang about here brett asked while hurry round to nearest iron monger sha be gone long be going to work little burglary take note if anybody come to stable at farther end hurried away waited in few moment butcher young man shut door went whistling down street in few moment more hewitt appeared come said there be nobody about now will lose time have bought pair of plier few nail re entered yard at door of last stable hewitt stooped examined padlock taking nail in plier bent carefully against brick wall then using nail a key still held by plier working padlock gently in left hand in astonishingly few second have released hasp taken off padlock be not altogether bad burglar remarked not so bad really padlock fastened bar when removed allowed door to be opened opening hewitt immediately seized candle stuck in bottle stood on shelf pulled in closed door behind will do by candle light said a struck match if door be left open must be seen from street keep ear open in case anybody come down yard part of shed that stood in be used a coach house be occupied by rather shabby tradesman cart shaft of rested on ground from stall adjoining came sound of shuffling trampling of impatient horse turned to cart on name board at side be painted in worn letter word schuyler baker address have be below be painted out hewitt took out pin let down tail board within cart be new bed mattress covered whole surface at bottom felt pressed from top saw that be ordinary spring mattress perhaps rather unusually soft in spring seemed curious thing to keep in baker cart hewitt who have set candle on convenient shelf plunged arm into farthermost recess of cart brought forth very long french loaf then diving again produced certain loaf of sort known a plain cottage two set of four set baked together in row feel bread said hewitt felt be stale almost a hard a wood hewitt produced large pocket knife with what seemed to to be superfluous care elaboration cut into top of one of cottage loaf then inserted finger in gap have made firmly slowly tore hard bread into two piece pulled away crumb from within till there be nothing left rather thick outer shell no said rather to than to there be nothing in lifted one of very long french loaf measured against interior of cart have before be propped diagonally now be noticeable that be just shade longer than inside of cart be wide jammed in in fact held firmly hewitt produced knife again divided long loaf in centre there be nothing bread in horse in stall fidgeted more than ever horse have be fed lately fancy hewitt said will give poor chap bit of hay in corner said what about bread what did expect to find in ca see what be driving at will tell hewitt replied be driving after something expect to find close at hand here too how be nerve to day pretty steady thing may try before must reply there be sound of footstep in yard outside approaching hewitt lifted finger instantly for silence whispered hurriedly there be only one if come here grab step came nearer stopped outside door there be pause then slight drawing in of breath a of person suddenly surprised at moment door be slightly shifted ajar eye peeped in catch said hewitt aloud a sprang to door must get away have be nearer doorway be first through stranger ran down yard at best leg be longer half way to street caught by shoulder swung round like lightning whipped out knife flung in left instantly on chance of flooring barely checked however knife swung short of chest by more than two inch hewitt have by wrist tripped forward on face struggled like wild beast hewitt have to stand on forearm force up wrist till bone be near breaking before dropped knife throughout struggle man never shouted called for help indeed made slightest sound on part be equally silent be quickly over of course for be on face be two dragged prisoner into stable closed door behind so far a have seen nobody have witnessed capture from street though of course have be too busy to be certain there be set of harness hanging over at back said hewitt think will tie up with trace rein nothing like leather need gag know wo shout while got strap hewitt held prisoner by peculiar neck wrist grip forbade to move except at peril of snapped arm have probably never be person of pleasant aspect being short strongly squatly built large ugly of feature wild dirty of hair beard now face flushed with struggling smeared with mud from stable yard nose bleeding forehead exhibiting growing bump looked particularly repellent strapped elbow together behind a sullenly ignored demand for content of pocket hewitt unceremoniously turned out helpless a be man struggled to prevent though of course ineffectually there be paper tobacco bunch of key various odds end hewitt be glancing hastily at paper when suddenly dropping caught prisoner by shoulder pulled away from partly consumed hay truss stood in corner toward have quietly sidled keep still said hewitt have examined place yet commenced to pull away hay from corner presently large piece of sackcloth be revealed being lifted left visible below batch of loaf of same sort a have seen in cart there be dozen of in one square batch only thing about differed from in cart be position for batch lay bottom side up be enough think hewitt said touch for heaven sake picked up paper have dropped that have saved little search continued see here brett be in act of telling suspicion when little affair interrupted if care to look at one two of letter will see what must have told be anarchism bomb of course be about a certain a can be that there be reversible dynamite bomb inside of innocent loaf though assure mean meddling with now see here will go bring in four wheeler bring right down yard there be more to do must attract attention hurried away found cab meaning of loaf cart spring mattress be now plain there be anarchist plot to carry out number of explosion probably simultaneously in different part of city have of course heard much of terrible reversing bomb bomb containing tube of acid plugged by wadding required fuse only needed to be inverted to be set going to explode in few minute loaf containing bomb must form effectual blind be to be distributed probably in broad daylight in most natural manner possible in baker cart man must be waiting near scene of contemplated explosion must be given loaf taken from inverted batch must take perhaps wrapped in paper still inverted apparently most innocent object possible to spot selected deposit right side up must reverse inner tube set up action in quiet corner behind door what not make own escape while explosion tore down wall if experiment be lucky scattered flesh bone of unsuspecting people infernal loaf be made kept reversed to begin with in order to stand more firmly if observed more naturally when turned over to explode even if child picked up loaf carried off child at least must be blown to atom at rate must have be something for conspirator to congratulate upon spring mattress of course be to ease jolting to bomb obviate random jerking loose of acid might have have deplorable result of sacrificing valuable life of conspirator who drove cart other loaf too with explosive content have use two long one fitted across inside of cart must be jammed across so a to hold bomb in centre others must be used to pack batch on other side prevent dangerous slipping about thing seemed pretty plain except a yet have idea of how hewitt learned anything of business brought four wheeler up to door of stable thrust man into hewitt locked stable door with proper key then drove off to tottenham court road police station by hewitt order straight into yard in le than ten minute from departure from stable prisoner be finally secured hewitt be deep in consultation with police official messenger be sent telegram despatched presently hewitt came to with information name of helpless frenchman police found morning said appears to be gerard at least be almost certain of among paper found on prisoner whose full name doe appear who seems to be spoken of a luigi be italian among paper say be sort of notice convening meeting for evening to decide a to 'final punishment ' to be awarded 'traitor gerard now in charge of comrade pingard ' place of meeting be not mentioned seems more than probable that will be at bakunin club not five minute walk from place police have place under quiet observation of course be club at apparently important anarchist meeting have be held lately be only club have never be raided a yet must seem only one must feel at safe in using for anything important moreover luigi just now simply declined to open mouth when asked where meeting be to be said nothing when name of several other place be suggested suddenly found tongue at mention of bakunin club denied vehemently that meeting be to be there be only thing uttered so that seems pretty safe to assume that be to be there now of course matter very serious men have be despatched to take charge of stable very quietly club be to be taken possession of at once also very quietly must be done without moment delay a there be chance that only detective officer within reach at moment may be known by sight have undertaken to get in first perhaps will come may have to take door with rush of course meant to miss nothing if must help said so very well replied hewitt will get up bit began taking off collar tie be getting dusk proceeded sha want old clothes to make ourselves look sufficiently shabby be wearing bowler hat be lucky make dent in yours if can do so without permanently damaging got rid of collar made choker of tie turned coat collar up at one side only then with dented hat worn raffishly hand in pocket looked disreputable enough for practical purpose in twilight cordon of plain clothes police have already be forming round club be told so sallied forth turned into windmill street crossed whitfield street in turning two came to bakunin club must see sign of anything like ring of policeman said so hewitt chuckled of course not said go about job of sort with drum beating flag flying be there be watching there be house will negotiate house be one of very shabby passe sort abound in quarter very narrow area be railed over almost choked with rubbish visible above be three floor lowest indicated by door one window other two by two window mean dirty faint light appeared in top floor from somewhere behind refuse heaped area everywhere else be in darkness hewitt looked intently into area be impossible to discern anything behind sole grimy patch of window be visible then stepped lightly up three four step to door rang bell must hear slippered foot mounting stair approaching latch be shifted door opened six inch indistinct face appeared female voice asked qui est la deux camarades hewitt grunted testily ouvrez vite have noticed that door be kept from opening further by short chain chain woman unhooked from door still kept latter merely ajar a though intending to assure still further hewitt immediately pushed door back planted foot against entered asking carelessly a did so ou se trouve luigi followed on heel in dark must just distinguish hewitt pushed woman instantly against wall clapped hand to mouth at same moment file of quiet men be suddenly visible ascending step at heel be police door be closed behind almost noiselessly match be struck two men stood at bottom of stair others searched house only two men be found in top room be secured brought down woman be now ungagged used tongue at great rate one of men be small meek looking slip of fellow appeared to be woman husband eh monsieur le police exclaimed vehemently ee not of 'im mon pauvre pierre zat sall rrun in 'im be not of clob work only housekeep hewitt whispered to officer two men be taken below then hewitt spoke to woman whose protest have not ceased say be not of club said what be there to prove that if be housekeeper a say have nothing to fear can only prove by giving police information for instance now about gerard have done with jean pingard 'ave take downstairs e 'ave lose 'im jean pingard get last night boosa dronk like zis rolled head shoulder to express intoxication sleep too much to day when emile go out gerard go too nobody know will tell anysing be not of clob housekeep pierre what did do to gerard before went away woman be ready anxious to tell anything gerard have be selected to do something what be exactly did not know there be horse cart be to drive where horse cart be also did not know gerard have driven cart before in work for baker be to drive one in connection with scheme among member of club le pauvre gerard at last minute disliked to drive cart have fear did not say have fear prepared letter letter be not signed letter be to be sent to police told whereabouts of horse cart so that police might seize thing then there must be nothing for gerard who have fear to do in way of driving did not betray name of comrade told place of horse cart nevertheless letter be never sent there be
