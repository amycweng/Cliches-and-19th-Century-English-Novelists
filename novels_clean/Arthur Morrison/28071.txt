perhaps eighteen inch long by foot wide arrangement of office be simple in outer room small space be partitioned off by mean of ground glass screen be in there that samuel meant that have waited well

apartment denson laughed at samuel went on 'have have ' say ' never thought of then must see american hat hanging up just by window rum hat ai ' be quite true for have noticed big grey wideawake almost white hewitt nodded approvingly be quite right said to tell everything recollect even of most trivial sort smallest thing may be very valuable so took diamond away first time last week what next well came again just same to day by appointment just same sat in place just same denson took case into inner room be come to buy time can see denson whisper wink 'but will fight hard over price will see off go into other room well waited waited waited long time looked out sideways at window there see american big wideawake hat hanging up just inside other window same a last time so think be long time settling price wait more be such very long time begin to feel uneasy of course know can not sell fifteen t'ousant wort ' of tiamonts in five minute be not reasonable pishness must hear nothing at now not sound boy boy came down to call up be come back there must see big wideawake hat still hanging inside window of course knew there be only one door out of inner room right before so seemed foolish to be uneasy so waited longer still now be so late thought must have come out to lunch before then be fery uneasy fery uneasy inteet so thought must pretend to be new caller opened outer office door banged walked in very loud knocked on boy table thought denson must come when heard that there be not sound so got more uneasy opened window leaned out a far a must to look in at other window there must see nothing big hat back of chair bit of room empty so went banged outer door again called out 'hi mr denson be wanted hi d ' y'ear knocked with umbrella on inner door mr hewitt might have knocked down with feather when got answer at not sound opened door mr hewitt there be nobody there nobody there be leather case on table open empty fifteen t'ousant pound in tiamonts mr hewitt ruin hewitt rose flung wide inner office door be certainly only door said be only window quite well in view from where sat there be wideawake hat still hanging there see be quite new obviously brought for to look at must seem door window be not used chimney be impossible register grate there be one other way there inner wall of of room be wall of corridor into office opened corridor be lighted office partly ventilated by sort of hinged casement fanlight close up by ceiling oblong extending most of length of room plainly active man not too stout might mount chair back climb very quietly through opening be only way said hewitt pointing yes answered samuel nodding rubbing knuckle together nervously saw saw when be too late who 'd have thought o ' such thing beforehand american there be american at got out same way anyway here be tiamonts be gone there be nothing here furniture not worth twenty pound well hewitt said so far think understand though may have question to ask presently go on go on there be more mr hewitt quite enough think there be more be robbed when found empty room case what did do send for police jew face clouded slightly mr hewitt said not for police for reason plain enough police make great fuss want to arrest criminal quite right want to arrest punish too plenty most want tiamonts back because if not ruin if be to make choice between two thing for whether to punish denson get tiamonts then of course take tiamonts let denson go can not be ruined with police if be choice catch thief first hold tight whether loses property not property be only second with with be first second so take more risk than can help mr hewitt have sent for to get first stone afterwards thief if can first property can perhaps find denson make give up rather than go to prison must be better than having taken imprisoned perhaps stone put away safe time ready for when came out still police can do thing ca hewitt interposed stop people leaving landing at port like think must see samuel be anxiously emphatic mr hewitt said certainly not police there be reason not police mr hewitt at rate not till have tried can not haf police just yet martin hewitt shrugged shoulder very well said if be instruction will do best so sent for at once a soon a discovered loss yes at once without telling anybody else haf tolt nobody did look about anywhere for denson in street what not be good be gone there be time for to go mile very good speaking of time let judge how far may have gone how long be kept waiting two hour quarter very near within five minute by watch yes looked often to see if be so long waiting a seemed very good do happen to have piece of denson writing about samuel looked round there be nothing about here said perhaps can find oh here here be post card took card from pocket gave to hewitt there be nothing else to tell then queried hewitt be sure that have forgotten nothing have happened since first arrived nothing at there be meaning in emphasis sharp look in hewitt eye mr hewitt samuel answered hastily there be nothing else can tell then will think over at once have better go back quietly to office think over in case have forgotten something need hardly warn to keep quiet a to what have passed between unless tell police think will take liberty of glance over mr denson office since office boy still stay away will lend clerk for little will keep eye open if caller come ear too wait while fetch ii be at point that humble part in case began for hewitt hurried first to room brett exclaimed be engaged afternoon nothing important will do small favour have rather interesting case want man watched for hour so have soul to do kerrett may be known be known besides there be job for kerrett of course expressed willing to do what must capital replied hewitt come along like adventure know must have asked know dodge in sort of observation man be one samuel jew of hatton garden diamond dealer will tell more afterwards kerrett be going into office next door want to wait thereabout presently will come downstairs with will go away hour so will be enough probably followed hewitt downstairs took kerrett with locked office door saw disappear within large new building waited near convenient postal pillar box prepared to seem very busy with few old letter from pocket until man back be turned in very few minute hewitt reappeared time with man jew obviously whom remembered having seen already at door of office more than hour before a have passed on way from bookseller at corner man walked briskly up street on opposite side did same little in rear turned corner at once slackened pace looked about took peep back along street have left then hailed cab for hundred yard more be obliged to trot till saw cab drop fare just ahead managed to secure give cabman instruction to follow cab in front before turned corner chase be difficult for horse drew be poor one dozen time thought have lost sight of other cab altogether cabman be better than animal from high perch kept chase in view turning corner picking out cab ahead among dozen others with surprising certainty went across charing cross road by way of cranborne street past leicester square through coventry street up quadrant regent street at oxford circus jew cab led to left along oxford street chased past bond street end suddenly cab pulled up with jerk driver spoke through trapdoor fare getting down sir said at corner o ' duke street thrust half crown up through hole sprang out ' e crossing road sir cabman finally reported hurried across street accordingly man be watching be strikingly jewish enough easy to distinguish in crowd have almost overtaken before have gone dozen yard up northern end of duke street walked on into manchester square there small neat brougham with blind drawn be being driven slowly round central garden saw samuel walk hurriedly up to brougham stopped a approached stepped quickly into carriage shut door behind brougham resumed slow progress loitered keeping in view though blind be drawn so close that be impossible to guess who might be samuel companion if have one think have said that when jew came to office door with hewitt perceived that be man have seen before day be now convinced that have also seen that same brougham at same time of presently carriage made one slow circuit then samuel got out shut door quickly again took precaution of turning back letting overtake pas on way back through duke street at end of street mounted omnibus going east took seat in same vehicle rest be uninteresting went direct to hatton garden there remained read name on door post among score of others after twenty minute wait returned to room have doubt that be meeting in brougham hewitt wished reported remembered rule be never to watch man moment after main object be secured hewitt be out did not return till after dusk then came straightway to room well brett said what be report a matter of fact samuel be client a will explain presently like spying on client a rule be convinced that be keeping something back from there be something odd about whole story what did see told hewitt tale of pursuit a have told here came away concluded after seemed that be settled in office for bit there be thing must know when first came out with recognised at once a man have seen at same door little after two o'clock say quarter past yes answered hewitt saw there little sooner something like two must say what be doing well replied be doing pretty well what did in manchester square for a matter of fact brougham also be here then just outside next door office think might swear to same brougham though of course did notice so particularly that first time hewitt whistled oh said tell about did get into brougham time yes came out of office door with black leather case in hand very scared look on face popped into brougham leather case scared look ho ho said hewitt thoughtfully whistled again black leather case eh come come plot thickens what happened did carriage go off saw nothing more must have noticed so much in fact if whole thing have looked trifle curious nervous pallid jew with black case a though thought be dynamite might go off at moment closed brougham blind drawn jew skipped in banged door brougham did move fancied perhaps only fancied that saw woman black veil inside then turned in here saw more hewitt sat thoughtfully silent for few moment then rose said come next door will tell how stand housekeeper will let in will see if can identify black case anywhere seemed that hewitt have by established good understanding with housekeeper next door nobody be sir man said a admitted closed heavy door office boy not come back nothing went up to denson office on third floor door of housekeeper opened having turned on electric light left now be that anything like case hewitt asked when housekeeper be gone lifted from under table very black case have seen samuel take into brougham said felt a sure of case a of brougham then hewitt told whole tale of samuel loss of fifteen thousand pound worth of diamond just a appears earlier in narrative now see here said hewitt when have made acquainted with client tale there be something odd about see post card samuel gave be from denson make morning appointment see down below at eleven sharp ' be message came waited just two hour quarter a tell being certain to time within five minute brings to quarter past one time when find be robbed came downstairs in very agitated state at quarter past one a have since ascertained at two pas see still dancing distractedly on front step certainly very much like man who have have serious misfortune expects one at quarter past two be about think nodded at quarter past two see still agitated diving into brougham with black case in hand little afterward after mind tell story of robbery of diamond from very case assures that sent for moment discovered loss be to say at quarter past one positive lie have told nobody else further assures that have told everything have happened up to moment meet then go away to office a tell find posting to manchester square in cab there once more plunging into same mysterious closed brougham now why must do that have seen person in brougham presumably hour before there can be nothing more to communicate except result of interview with thing warned to keep to be odd be be what can be motive want to know motive object to working for client who deceives indeed be unsafe may be making accomplice in criminal scheme observe that never called for police natural impulse in robbed man indeed expressly veto communication with police of course gave reason reason be not good enough ca stop man leaving country anywhere round coast except by going to police can be suggested that samuel denson be working in collusion have perhaps insured stone now want help to make out case of loss scarcely that think for more than one reason first be risk insurer must take in circumstance next insurer must certainly want to know why police be not informed at once there be more have not be idle while a must know will tell of thing have ascertained to begin with samuel be known in hatton garden only a dealer on very small peddling scale dabbler in commission in fact rather than buyer seller of diamond in quantity on own account office be nothing desk in small room share with two others small dealer like when spoke to people most likely to know of offering fifteen thousand pound worth of diamond on own account laughed investment of two three hundred pound in stone be about limit said now that fact offer fresh suggestion doe hewitt looked at significantly mean said after little consideration that samuel may have be entrusted with diamond to sell by real owner have made arrangement with denson to get gem for represent a stolen hewitt nodded thoughtfully there be possibility said though even in case owner must certainly want to know why police have not be told know what satisfactory answer samuel must make more find that such robbery have be reported to of principal dealer in hatton garden to day so far a can ascertain none of have entrusted samuel with anything like so large quantity of diamond a talk of lately at rate be possible that diamond be purely imaginary suggested might there be trick played on basis perhaps trick on american customer if there be one hewitt be thoughtful there be many possibility said must consider diamond may even be stolen property to begin with must account for great deal though perhaps not whole thing be so oddly suspicious that unless client be willing to let great deal further into confidence to morrow morning will throw up case did direct inquiry after denson of course brings to other thing have ascertained have not be here long few month can not find that have be doing particular business time with anybody except samuel with however seems to have be very friendly housekeeper speaks of a being havery thick together ' room be cheaply furnished a see here be thing to consider housekeeper vow that never left glass box at foot of stair from time samuel went upstairs first to time when came down again vastly agitated at quarter past one sent message during time denson never passed box main door be only way out be there at yes be there certainly when samuel came note now observe sequence of thing a know now first there be denson in office can find nothing of american visitor be convinced that be total fiction of denson samuel denson together denson be in office to come samuel leaf place till samuel come down at quarter past one o'clock told sent sort of message housekeeper tell that called passing commissionaire gave something though whether be telegram note did not see doe know commissionaire number though must easily be found if became necessary doubt samuel sends message wait on step watching in agitated manner a must be natural perhaps in man engaged in anxious ticklish piece of illegality for hour when mysterious brougham appears take black case into brougham obviously brings out again for here be have happened brings out empty then sends housekeeper for when at length arrive denson have certainly gone there be opportunity for while housekeeper be absent on message to office after samuel agitation after have carried case to from brougham whole thing be odd enough certainly suspicious enough have found anything else yes denson life lived in boarding house in bloomsbury have only be there two month however know practically nothing of to day came home at unusual time letting in with latchkey went away at once with bag account of exact time be contradictory one servant thought be before twelve insisted that be after one have not be back office boy ca get information out of have be seen since morning expect denson told to take whole holiday ca find where life at moment doubt will turn up to morrow not that expect to get much from sha bother unless mr samuel will answer satisfactorily very plain question will ask expect will will throw up commission called by way not long ago be out will see in morning expect look round denson office taught more than have taught hewitt already there be two small room one inside other with ordinary cheap office furniture be quite plain that man of ordinary activity size must have got out of inner room into corridor by mean samuel suggested through hinged wall light near ceiling hewitt have meddled with nothing must do more till be satisfied of bona fides of client certainly must not commit to breaking open desk cupboard so time for attendance at office approaching be working on morning phoenix then ten at night saw work begin shut office went away iii in morning be awakened by impatient knocking at bedroom door going to bed at two three be naturally late riser be about nine scrambled sleepily out of bed turned key hewitt be standing in sitting room with newspaper in hand sorry to break morning sleep brett said something interesting have happened in regard to business helped with yesterday may like to know crawl back into bed if like be already in dressing gown groping for clothes come in tell said what be hewitt sat on bed will tell in due order said first saw samuel again last night after have gone away remember went back to office have letter two to write have set aside in afternoon well wrote letter shut up went downstairs opened outer door there be samuel in act of ringing housekeeper bell said be very anxious must sleep without coming to hear if have made progress have called before be out half thought of taking back to office decided that be worth while so walked along to corner of strand till got well under light then stopped talked to 'you ask about progress in case mr samuel ' said 'now have sometimes met people who seem to consider sort of prophet seer diviner a matter of fact be nothing professional investigator even if be possessed of such amazing genius a lay claim to must never succeed in case even make progress in if client started with false information only told truth more when find such be state of affair that if be to succeed must begin by investigating client before proceed with case throw case up on instant invariably do understand now must tell have made progress with case none for very reason ' protested of course vowed have told simple truth so forth replied by asking certain definite question first asked whose diamond be repeated that be own to simply replied 'good evening mr samuel turned away came after beseechingly prevaricated said something about party having interest matter being confidential to responded by asking with whom have communicated before sending for who be person in brougham have twice entered that flabbergasted said that must answer question without bringing other party into matter to answered that be just other party meant to know about if be to move step in matter at got into sad state imploring actually imploring not to desert said must do something desperate something terrible night if did relieve mind undertake case what meant 'd do did know of course did move said finally must deal only with principal that until have personal instruction of actual owner of diamond in addition to complete explanation of brougham incident must hing recommended to go to police with left got nothing more from than nothing more be something see admitted to intent that diamond be not own now see here suppose left about ten o'clock here be paragraph in one of morning newspaper be only in one paper matter seems to have occurred rather late for press hewitt gave paper in hand pointing to following paragraph horrible discovery shocking discovery be made just before midnight last night near york column where police constable found dead body of man lying on stone step body be fully clothed in ordinary dress of labouring man bore plain mark of strangulation be evident that brutal murder have be committed singular circumstance be presence of curious reddish mark upon forehead at first taken for wound soon discovered to be mark apparently drawn impressed on skin at time of going to press arrest have be made so far affair appears mystery well said certainly seems curious especially in matter of mark on forehead what have to do to do with samuel diamond mean will tell that dead man be denson denson exclaimed denson how get from housekeeper next door seems that when police came to examine body found among other thing money watch like piece of addressed envelope used to hold few pin pin stuck in paper rolled up know there be just enough of to guess address by of office next door be only clue have so came along here at once knocked up housekeeper went with instantly recognised denson disguised in labourer clothes denson say unmistakably mark on forehead be very odd be outlined triangle rather le than inch along side be quite red say seems to be done in greasy sticky sort of ink colour be anything found diamond no say there be money two three five pound note believe small change watch key so forth there be not word of diamond paused in dressing doe that mean that murderer have got asked hewitt pursed lip shook head may mean that said doe look altogether like when five pound note be left on other hand there be disguise only reason that know of for must be that be bolting with diamond really puzzling thing be mark on forehead why of course picturesque romantic thing to suppose be that be mark of criminal club society criminal association such a exist do silly thing like when criminal rob murder go leaving track behind purposely leave nothing must possibly draw attention to if can help also leave five pound note be off to have look at mark inspector plummer be in charge of case remember plummer in stanway cameo case two three others well plummer be old friend of mine not only be interested in matter now that becomes case of murder must tell police know merely a loyal citizen have idea will want to ask friend mr samuel very serious question will go now yes must waste more time get breakfast look out for for message hewitt be off to vine street devoted to toilet breakfast vastly mystified by tragic turn in matter already puzzling enough be not messenger hewitt who came back in le than hour come said plummer be below be going next door to denson office have idea that may get at something at last police be after samuel hot foot think must be made sure of in case without delay must say have reason on face of joined plummer at once have already spoken of plummer in account of several of hewitt case in met turned into office next door there found very frightened bewildered office boy whom denson have given holiday yesterday after sending down to samuel have come to work a usual only to meet housekeeper tale of murder of master end of business prospect have little information to impart have only be employed for month six week during time work have be practically nothing plummer nodded at information sniffed comprehensively at office furniture know sort o ' stuff said be way fit up long firm office such place be taken for job be plain by one of boy address be taken be given final holiday asked to send up housekeeper a went out plummer passed bunch of key housekeeper entered now hutt said martin hewitt be saying yesterday think that main front door be only entrance exit for building be so sir only one a anybody can use except oh then there be then well not exactly to say entrance sir there be small private door at back into court behind be only opened to take in coal such always have key house be like yours sir have back way into court a have be convenience sometimes ah have doubt do happen to have key with be on bunch hanging up in box sir will fetch must like to see if will housekeeper disappeared presently returned with large bunch of key be one mr hewitt explained lifting from among rest hewitt examined closely then placed beside one from bunch plummer have given seems be not only person who ever have key exactly like hutt said see here be found in mr denson pocket plummer nodded sagaciously in plant said see be brand new clean a new pin file mark still on take to back door hutt hewitt pursued will try key be there back staircase there be small back staircase leading to coal cellar only used by servant down went on lower landing stopped before small door hewitt slipped key in lock turned door opened easily there before be little courtyard think have mentioned in one of other narrative courtyard with narrow passage leading into next street martin hewitt seemed singularly excited see there said be how denson left building without passing housekeeper box now be going to make shot see here key on denson bunch attracted attention because of noticeable newness compared with most of others most of others say because there be one other just a bright see small one now hutt do happen to have key like also hutt turned key over in hand glanced from to own bunch why yes sir said presently yes sir be same a key of fire hose cupboard doe that key fit how many fire hose cupboard be there two on floor sir one at end just against main one key fit lot show nearest to door short narrow passage led to main ground floor corridor where cupboard lettered fire hose stood next main fitting have to keep hose cupboard locked housekeeper explained apologetically 'cause o ' mischievous boy in office key fitted a well a other long coil of brown leather hose hung within in corner lay piece of chamois leather evidently used for polishing brass fitting hewitt pulled aside there beneath lay cleaner piece of chamois leather neatly folded tied round with cord hewitt snatched up unfastened cord unrolled leather be sewn into sort of bag satchel when at last spread wide mouth of satchel light seemed to spring from out of for there lay glittering heap of brilliants what cried plummer who first got speech diamond samuel diamond diamond at rate replied hewitt whether samuel somebody else ca have be there long how often be cupboard opened saturday reg'lar sir replied housekeeper just to dust out see thing be right now see here said martin hewitt have have luck in conjecture a yet will try again here be what believe have happened word that samuel told about theft of diamond be true except a to ownership denson have planned all along to rob of a big collection of diamond a must prompt to get together have played up to for month smaller dealing one way be ground bait very artfully let samuel take diamond safely away once in order that must be le watchful le suspicious second time second time doe trick exactly a see hang up imaginary american hat escape by fanlight go out by back way to avoid housekeeper observation have arranged beforehand for too have seized opportunity when housekeeper have be out of box to get wax impression of two key have made copy of here come on curious thing be easy enough to understand why must foresee get key for back door in order to make escape why key of hose cupboard why indeed must leave diamond behind at be plain that meant to come back for probably at night must have be wholly free from observation in quiet courtyard must let in get diamond leave again without exciting smallest alarm suspicion why take trouble why not stick to plunder from beginning plain inference be that feared somebody something feared being stopped searched feared being waylaid sometime during yesterday by whom there be puzzle ca see bottom of confess if must perhaps might know something of last night murder a to samuel prevarication there be only one explanation will fit now that rest be made clear must have be entrusted with diamond by private owner for sale secretly lady of conspicuous position in difficulty probably perhaps unknown to husband such thing occur day common expedient be to sell stone have good paste substituted in same setting samuel must be just man to carry through transaction of sort must account for everything jewel be en suite cut unset taken from set of jewellery paste substituted samuel arranges for lady find customer denson who treat exactly a have told when realises loss samuel doe know what to do must call police being bound to secrecy on lady behalf sends hasty message remains keeping watch by denson office hurry to with possible secrecy keeping carriage blind down dash into brougham to describe disaster taking case with in frantic desire to explain thing fully lady fear publicity wo hear of police instructs to consult consequently of course when recommend communicating with police wo listen to suggestion samuel have arranged with lady to hurry off report progress a soon a have consulted doe lady having appointed manchester square for interview perhaps hint suspicion of samuel honesty rather natural perhaps in circumstance terrifies more than ever lead to frantic appeal to when throw case up come there guess at fact of case will back with twopence bit more eh plummer take bet answered plummer thing plain enough except murder there be something deeper there hewitt became grave be true said something can see way into a yet come take parcel of diamond a representing law here come one of men think have be approaching front door during talk now police constable appeared saluted plummer samuel just be brought in sir reported be half dead with fright be sent message to lady h in p square say want mr martin hewitt to come speak for poor samuel hewitt commented come will go make happy here be diamond safely accounted for there be evidence to connect with murder will get out of mess a soon a possible so did hewitt reading of case be correct to tittle a turned out with very little delay samuel be released with message from police station fat be in fire a regarded lady h husband necessarily became acquainted with everything there be serious domestic trouble samuel be glad enough to get quit of business with worse than bad fright a may well be supposed showed most grateful to hewitt in after time giving excellent confidential advice information more than once in matter connected with diamond trade be still in business believe in much larger way have doubt be wiser for experience for lesson hewitt did not forget to rub well in be useless worse to place confidential matter in hand of man of hewitt profession at same time withhold particular of case however unessential may appear to be meantime on way to vine street asked hewitt what led to suppose that new key on denson bunch fitted lock in particular office building call lucky guess if like hewitt answered a matter of fact be prompted by pure common sense plummer showed thing found on body saw at once that key offered only chance of immediate information went through one by one there be latchkey key with have gone into lodging to fetch away disguise there be largish key equally old probably key of office door there be other smaller key also old plainly belonging to bag trunk drawer so forth then there be large perfectly new key what be that be not key of bag drawer clearly be key of door door with lever lock what door have denson other office perhaps have first be best to begin by trying on place be already acquainted with at once thought of denson disappearance unobserved by housekeeper must be key of private exit from office building resolved to test that conjecture first turned out to be right one being successful so far of course turned to other new key tried that a saw what of triangular mark on man forehead martin hewitt became deeply thoughtful that said be matter wholly beyond at present a indeed be whole business of murder whether will ever know more ca guess matter be deep deep difficult dark a to mark seems to have be impressed from engraved stamp of sort be plain equilateral triangle in red outline measuring about inch on side be in greasy sticky sort of red ink may be smeared be very difficult if not impossible to rub away what mean ca at present conjecture have told reason for not thinking sign of gang of criminal whose sign be surely not that of self constituted punisher of crime for person with risk to must have handed denson over to police if knew of offence can have be murdered by accomplice used accomplice if one thing be plain in story of stolen diamond be that denson did thing wholly by besides accomplice must have taken key have gone secured diamond for else why murder at key be taken nothing be taken a far a can tell why be body placed in conspicuous position be pretty certain that crime can not have happened where body be found somebody must have heard seen struggle in place a that a be must say body be probably brought quietly to spot in cab such conveyance mystery envelops crime everywhere so far a can see there be clue beyond red triangle a yet can not understand strangling point to murder being committed by powerful man certainly be form of crime may have be perpetrated silently beyond can see nothing apparent motivelessness of thing make mystery darker circumstance be acquainted with instead of helping seem to complicate puzzle what be that denson feared when left diamond behind when might have carried away why must fear in daytime not at night since must seem plain that meant to have returned for stone at night where did go to disguise yesterday know be not in lodging where have left clothes discarded doubt mystery be destined to be cleared up in more le degree be not till hewitt have witnessed other singular adventure that answer came to problem real meaning of red triangle be made apparent connection with theft of samuel diamond grew clear for indeed connection proved in end to be very intimate indeed once little later be allowed to see shade farther into mystery a will tell in proper place even then real secret remained hidden from till appointed end so ended case of samuel diamond so far a concerned samuel owner case of red triangle have only begun case of mr jacob mason mystery of denson death remained mystery despite police must do coroner jury returned verdict of murder by person person unknown indeed be must be expected of for have more before than bare fact that body disguised in clothes of labourer have be found on step near duke of york column just before midnight by police constable for housekeeper identification even name of victim must have be unknown jury certainly wasted time in idle speculation a to strange triangular mark found on forehead without speck of evidence to help in end returned verdict went home police knew little more than jury though little rather confused than helped exercised judgment at inquest in withholding evidence of theft of diamond on victim have be engaged curious particular of have already related in followed usual course in case where evidence withheld must give jury help in arriving at verdict at same time might easily hamper further investigation if revealed for theft have be frustrated by martin hewitt exertion a have seen in case thief be now dead beyond reach of human punishment one matter now remaining for police be inquiry into murder of same thief one object of exertion apprehension of murderer murderer case a have already said be in hand of inspector plummer intelligent officer old friend of hewitt few day work after inquest yielded plummer so little result that called at hewitt office to talk matter over suppose plummer began be use asking if have heard anything more of matter of denson murder hewitt shook head have heard word said if have must have come on to at once hope have have luck not scrap time wasted few off chance clue tried have led nowhere so that be where be at start thing be quite oddest in experience see how stand here be man denson who have just pulled off one of cleverest jewel robbery ever attempted so arranges that walk safely off with fifteen thousand pound worth of diamond leaving victim samuel stuck patiently in office for hour two before even begin to suspect anything be wrong then unable to set police after for reason discovered denson doe carry plunder off straightway a so easily might have done conceals in very house where robbery be committed taking with key by aid of may return get why a explained be probably because feared somebody feared being stopped searched on day of robbery not after since be plain meant to return for booty at night who must have be why did denson fear mystery number one then denson be found dead same night disguised in clothes of labourer in most conspicuous spot in last place in world one must expect murderer to select for depositing victim body for be evidently not place where murder be committed more on forehead there be extraordinary impressed mark of red triangle now what can mean robbery perhaps one think body be robbed there be three five pound note on besides sovereign two small change watch chain key rest of then one guess at diamond perhaps be accomplice in robbery who find that denson be about to bolt with whole lot if there be one thing plain in amazing business be that denson have accomplice did whole thing alone a discovered needed help more than if be work of accomplice why did get jewel there be key to hand left must such person actually go out of way to put body where must be discovered at once instead of concealing till must get away with diamond of course not there be accomplice be useless to labour that farther argument apply equally against theory that be work of criminal gang must have taken must get note key diamond must have be so foolish a to exhibit body with extraordinary mark criminal gang be not such fool a to take unnecessary chance gratuitously leave track behind a know well enough well then there stand so far do see more in than do hewitt shook head said ca say do consideration have mentioned have already occurred to talked over in fact with friend brett connection with case ceased of course with discovery of jewel about murder know more than have be told never saw body so have opportunity of picking up overlooked clue though doubtless have seen to know not tittle more than have just summarised on alone thing seems mystery pure unadulterated there be beyond be ascertained by divisional surgeon on examination of body man died from strangulation a know natural presumption from be that murderer must have be powerful man surgeon be of positive opinion be certain in fact that denson be strangled with instrument tourniquet tourniquet yes surgeon tourniquet such a be used to compress leg arm so stop flow of blood considers mark unmistakable now that might point to murderer being medical man conjecturally yes though of course justifies nothing more than conjecture precisely well that be something precious little tourniquet be common thing enough more than band with screw fitting there be nothing to show that tourniquet used be different from thousand others can see particular reason why doctor must commit murder like more than other man in divisional surgeon agreed with doctor none red triangle be altogether unaccounted for about too by way divisional surgeon told little very useless little mark be not properly dried owing to slightly greasy nature although be almost impossible to remove wholly be possible to scrape off little of ink colour here be little of on paper quite dried now of course plummer carefully took from pocket small folded paper unfolded revealed smaller paper within on be two little smear of bright red colour there be stuff said surgeon examined report to be rather oddly constituted so a to bear affinity of meaning possibly to triangle for stuff be compound of three substance animal vegetable mineral there be fine vegetable oil say waxy preparation certainly of animal origin mineral cinnabar vermilion in fact though there may be connection between triangle substance representing three natural kingdom give nothing practical nothing to go on martin hewitt have be closely examining mark on paper now answered be not so sure of though plummer think at least that give conjecture must guess that man want a well a being acquainted with use of tourniquet have at time travelled in to china why unless be wider of mark than usual be pigment used on chinese seal chinaman seal act for signature on sort of document be impressed printed by hand pressure from little engraved stone die precisely a triangle seems to have be ink colour be almost always red compounded of vermilion wax oil of sesamum plummer sat up with whistle phew then may have be done by chinaman hewitt shrugged shoulder be possible said of course though sign triangle be not chinese character a character of course be greek delta may be character at in sign of ancient cabala triangle apex upward a be in case be symbol of fire apex downward signified water plummer patted side of head distractedly heaven said tell be to search china greece wherever cabalistic pundit come from well hewitt answered with smile think must at rate begin in country rather think might make beginning at denson be what must do if case be mine see if anything can be ascertained of previous life probably under name name may have be in china yes certainly a stand at present must begin at denson think will inspector replied though there be precious little to begin on there 'd like to have with on job of course be impossible since be purely police matter something information may come way in case will let know at once of course of course will be serious matter a well a strange one wish luck plummer departed to grapple with difficulty in fact be hewitt who first heard fresh news of red triangle that from wholly unexpected quarter be indeed only two day after plummer visit kerrett brought into hewitt private room card of rev james potswood with request for consultation mr potswood name be known to hewitt a indeed be to many people a of most devoted clergyman rector of large parish in north west london who devoted not only time personal strength to work also spent penny of private income on parish be not small income that mr potswood spent in unselfish way for came of wealthy family though good part of parish be inhabited by well to do people there be quite enough poverty distress in poorer quarter to cause excellent man often to regret that resource be not even larger be spare active grey whiskered man of nearly sixty with prominent not very handsome feature though face be full of frank simple kindliness errand mr hewitt said be of rather vague not to say visionary character doubt if can help at rate will explain trouble a well a can in first place be right in supposing that be in way professionally engaged in connection with extraordinary case of murder week so ago case in man named denson be found dead on step by duke of york column yes hewitt answered be professionally engaged on certain matter about will not wish to particularise since be business of client in course of came upon other affair then before ask what know of mysterious event mr hewitt will tell story so that may judge whether be able to reveal anything to do anything of course what say be in strictest confidence of course have parishioner mr jacob mason of whom have seen very little of late year scarcely anything at in fact till few day ago be fairly well to do believe living somewhat retired life in house not far from rectory for many year have laboured at natural science chemistry in particular have very excellently fitted laboratory attached to house be widower with child of own orphan niece miss creswick life under guardianship mr mason be never very regular church goer year ago saw much more of than have of late must be perfectly frank with mr hewitt if be to help therefore must tell that disagreed on point of religion in such way found difficult to maintain former regard for mr mason have curiously fantastic mind be constantly being led to tamper with thing think be best left alone what be called spiritualism for instance that horrible form of modern superstition hear whisper of at time from continent alleged devil propitiation worship be not that did anything thought morally wrong understand except that dabbled be always running after new thing animal magnetism telepathy crystal gazing theosophy one of score of such thing have attraction for mind of sort be characteristic of new enthusiasm with that prompted to try to convert that in such term term often applied to doctrine of religion of be humble minister a must in nowise permit in presence so that friendly intercourse though not interrupted by definite breaking off fell away to almost nothing for reason be little surprised to receive visit from mr mason on afternoon of day on newspaper printed report of finding of body of denson may remember that only one morning paper mentioned matter very briefly there be full report in evening paper yes discovery be made very late previous night so gathered well be told that mr mason have be shown into study there found be in extremely nervous agitated state have evening paper in hand with scarcely preliminary word burst out 'have seen in paper murder there there be report thrust paper into hand have not seen heard anything of matter in fact till moment now gave little leisure to read report walked up down room nervously clasping hand sometimes together sometimes at side sometimes before shaking head in shuddering sort of way bursting out once twice a though word be uncontrollable 'what ought to do what can do looked up from paper went on 'have read be murder horrid murder poor wretched fellow be trying to escape must be murder certainly seems so ' said what did know man denson 'no of course not mason replied 'but there be plain enough here be paper with just same report little shorter pulled second paper from pocket ' got what different paper must be two fullest be plain enough be brutal murder be man be merchant agent something in portsmouth street be found in labourer clothes proof that feared be trying to escape must must no anybody be awful awful understand ' said 'wo sit down ' for mason continued to pace distractedly about room 'what be think unfortunate man be trying to escape what be to do in matter stopped pressed hand to head seemed to control by great effort must excuse ' said `` m bit run down lately nerve be wrong be talking rather wildly be afraid really hardly know why came to except have soul can talk to about well about anything scarcely took chair sat for little while with head forward on hand eye directed towards floor then said in musing way rather a though be thinking aloud than talking to 'you be right after potswood be fool to disregard warning ought to have dabbled must have left thing alone said nothing thinking best not to disturb to leave free to say what wanted to say in own way remained quiet for minute two more then sat up with appearance of much greater composure must mind potswood ' said 'as have told be in bad state of nerve at best be impulsive sort of person a know need have bothered like came rushing round here without thinking if house have be bit farther off must have come to sens before reached after there be nothing so much to disturb one self about man denson may very well have deserved fate think that likely added last question with involuntary eagerness scarcely accorded with indifferent tone with have begun answered guardedly said of course nobody must say what unhappy man sin might have be that be must never justify fearful sin of murder 'and added 'if know anything of matter mason have smallest suspicion a to who be guilty person be sure wo hesitate in duty ' duty ' said 'oh yes of course duty mean of course that law abiding citizen who know of evidence must bring out just so of course have evidence that paper gave first news of thing ' ' think rejoined 'that anybody who be possessed of even le than evidence of suspicion might lead to evidence must go at once place authority in possession of know suspect 'yes said very calmly now though seemed at cost of great effort must so must doubt in ordinary case sometimes there be difficulty know great difficulty stopped looked at furtively uneasily ' man might fear for own safety might even know that to say what knew must be to condemn to sudden death more perhaps more suppose might be know suppose for instance man be placed between alternative of neglecting duty of breaking well oath binding oath of very serious terrible character oath will say made previously without foreknowledge of crime said that such oath taken without foreknowledge of crime must not have contemplated event that however wrong taking of such oath might have be in to assist in concealing such crime a murder be infinitely worse infinitely worse than taking oath infinitely worse than breaking though a to latter repeated that such engagement made without contemplation foreknowledge of such crime must seem to be void in respect went further much further conjured to make secret of anything might know not to burden conscience with complicity for be what concealment must amount to in terrible crime added further exhortation need not repeat now presently assumed calmness departed utterly became even more agitated than when first came must say nothing further however in end went away saying must 'think over matter very seriously ' be quite plain to that poor friend be suffering acutely from burden of terrible secret that in impulsive way have rushed to confide in at first shock of news of murder that afterwards courage have failed conceived duty not to allow matter to stand thus therefore giving mason few hour for calm consideration called on in evening be told that be not very well have gone to bed have however left message in case must call to effect that must come see in morning waited whole of next morning whole of afternoon saw nothing of in evening urgent parish work took away next morning called again at mason house saw time avoided subject tried to dodge in fact be not to be denied result be scene of alternate agitation forced calmness will not weary mr hewitt with useless repetition may say have seen mason twice since then without bringing to definite resolve a matter of fact believe that be restrained from saying anything further by fear sheer terror have even gone so far a to deny absolutely that know anything of matter then have contradicted minute afterwards at last morning have brought degree further in last few day made business to acquaint a far a possible with exact circumstance of tragedy so far a be known in course of inquiry saw housekeeper of office next door man who identified body a denson either must not must not tell very much did say that have be working in way in connection with case that knew a much of a anybody gave idea morning told mason that not only also have duty in respect to matter duty be to see that nothing in connection with crime a must be hushed up on consideration for anybody fancy said that if liked need tell more might take into consultation professionally a client allowing first to see to assure consistently with own safety be anxious to further end of justice said that a client first duty must be to protect that professional practice must keep mouth absolutely sealed that already knew good deal about crime perhaps more than suspected protested that seemed to very least must do warned that if refused to do even must have to consider whether be consistent with character a clergyman loyal citizen longer to conceal fact that be keeping back information might lead to apprehension of murderer frightened between fear of threat fear that might already know more than suspected authorised be even eager about to come see always of course under pledge of strict professional secrecy so far account be quite clear mr potswood hewitt said have done best now must do mine wish to see mason at once doubt arranged to bring to house if be willing engagement permitted at three afternoon will do have be keeping see be past one already will lunch with at club with great pleasure more especially a have few question to ask a go along be far just at end of pall mall will walk if like tell now said hewitt a went anything know about mr mason habit family connection so forth a fully a minutely a please have friend connected with china for instance china why think not except will tell know mr mason have family connection so far a be aware at rate in london except niece miss creswick be within few month of twenty one charming girl horribly shut in for mason have almost visitor miss creswick be sister daughter lost mother first then father be left to guardianship of uncle be also trustee under will have believe discretion to keep charge of property if think fit till reach age of twenty five though in case of death be to inherit in ordinary way on coming of age be very dutiful indeed affectionate niece though must say be scarcely fair to keeping a doe so completely secluded from society of young people of own age mere thoughtlessness think have have child of own mind be wholly occupied with science fad make recluse without thought of girl that brings to what be about to say at first when asked if mr mason have friend connected with china there be young doctor lawson be name very distant connection of family think who have professional appointment of sort in shanghai for year two who be now in london trying to work up small practice of own if have mentioned china must have thought of since never go to house now at rate be supposed not to go doe go to house why be well there be disagreement what be quite know in first place have connection with of mason experiment something lawson declined to help with for professional reason else something declined to do for lawson know thing went further for a matter of fact there be something between young people lawson be only twenty eight mason put end to that have be something like formal engagement think in quarrel mason be always quarrelling with somebody when have friend be why have so few now in quarrel thing be said that ended in rupture whether young lawson be fortune hunting not can not say mason certainly accused of promised to keep back girl money a long a must in meantime mason declared end to engagement poor helen be broken hearted for a have said be affectionate girl have friend to confide in be boring want to know thing surely on contrary ca possibly know too much particular ca possibly be too minute nine case out of ten bring to issue by mean of triviality be saying little while back that there be almost visitor at mr mason house said 'almost that mean there be who be very occasionally rarely in fact there be one two member of learned society with whom have be in correspondence who be old friend there be professor hutton dr burge believe appear once in six month there be mr everard myatt who be more frequent doe not profess to be great man of science be interested in chemistry a amateur be fancy sort of disciple of mason have noticed sad difference in mason just lately even called on yesterday though hardly knew by sight in hope must back up urgent suggestion that mason must go off for change rest beyond think know of single visitor here be at megatherium ii mr jacob mason house stood in own ground in quiet suburban road be not very large house straggled about comfortably in manner of detached house built in suburb at time when space be le valuable than now consisted of two floor only front door be not far from road be clearly visible to passenger who might chance to look through of two iron gate opened one on end of semi circular drive thing martin hewitt noticed a rev mr potswood pushed open one of gate two walked up drive front door stood in portico french window gave access to roof of portico from bedroom dressing room a hewitt companion approached house french window be pushed open man appeared middle aged slightly stoutish man with short grey beard commonplace enough in now convulsed with noisy anger shaking fist stamping on portico roof get out shouted come near house again will have flung out go away take friend with d'you hear go away sir come here annoying go go at once mr potswood absolutely staggered with amazement why gasped be mason be mad clean mad why mason poor friend know get out say cried mason give more of talk wo have here now hewitt caught glimpse of girl face at window behind man pale handsome face drawn with anxiety fear hewitt seized clergyman quickly by arm come whispered hurriedly come away at once there be reason for get away at once if can answer back angrily do so at rate come away hurried back to gate half dragging astounded rector who be too honest soul to be able to counterfeit anger did not feel even if amazement have not made speechless hewitt closed gate behind said a walked where be rectory will go there may have sent message while be out mechanically rector took first turning be protested mad poor fellow merciful heaven mr hewitt whole tale must have be delusion mere madman fancy poor fellow must go back mr hewitt really must ca leave poor girl there alone with raving maniac hewitt insisted come to rectory be madness mr potswood must see colour of man under eye shaking of beard be not anger be not madness be terror mr potswood sheer sick terror terror emotion very much like if terror why outburst what doe mean if be terror why not rather welcome company help see mr potswood answered hewitt guess mason be watched know be acting anger before unseen eye knew be on god be merciful to ejaculated clergyman poor man poor sinner what be unspeakable thing have in clutch what have done to give over to power can tell nothing guess nothing a yet hewitt answered let see if have sent message seems likely if have may help if not then think must do something decisive at once hurry so be hard to restrain one self know there may be eye on mr potswood must not seem to be persisting in errand so went through quiet street for two three furlong seemed so many mile to good parson arrived at rectory mr potswood pushed impatiently through gate be hurrying toward house when perceived bent little old man standing among shrub with own gardener who be digging there be mason gardener rector exclaimed went to meet old man touched hat looked sharply towards hewitt who be waiting near rectory door then disappeared round corner of house rector following in few second mr potswood reappeared with slip of paper in hand here said see old man be told to give to nobody in nobody else presence be be waiting since one o'clock scrawled on paper in trembling straggling letter be word must not bring mr martin hewitt to house afternoon be watched be hopeless desert bring to night after dark at eight will want best skill will know after dark come to back gate in lane will be ajar through conservatory at side where niece will be waiting at eight after dark burn let out of sight first send line by man to say will do a ask say what be for fear of accident send at once do come at eight with mr hewitt must do a say remarked hewitt know nothing of matter must be guided till do just write unsigned note will be a request ' word to effect be sure man give to let out behind through churchyard if possible tell not to go straight from one house to other be intelligent man yes uncommonly shrewd believe say ca have be followed know several gardener hereabout seems to have called on of on way in at front of garden out at back time after few minute conversation gipps be rather cunning old fellow ah said hewitt admiringly be sort of messenger often want will give crown for money to pay for telegram on way know nothing essential of course only that master be in sort of trouble warned that might be followed that be good will telegraph to detective inspector plummer of scotland yard right quite understand that have heard be confidential will tell plummer nothing till may indeed a yet have very little to tell must help think will be well to have police within call may want at moment notice have police power see plummer have denson case in hand will ask to be here at house before quarter to eight if will allow so telegram went to plummer hewitt accepting rector invitation to early dinner before starting on visit resigned to wait did not like waste of time a frankly told mr potswood must have preferred to see mason at once at risk to take what mean thought necessary without delay a seemed that risk be to be chiefly mason a mason knew of rector be ignorant mason must be allowed to choose own time excellent mr potswood endured agony of suspense though also insisted that mason wish must be observed exactly what be what can be ejaculated again again what dreadful influence can thus compass man about here in london in time be autumn night fell early dinner be over at last have scarcely left table when plummer arrived anxious eager will have to trust little plummer hewitt said when have made known to rector can tell nothing now know nothing in fact very little more than nothing fact be be going to see man who promise information to alone in confidence a client know how long may have to keep in dark be where trail lie hot know be where want to be more if be wanted suddenly will be at hand have man two with suppose a suggested three of best of will follow up be far close enough be house in walled garden not high wall go in at gate from lane behind think must wait at gate put men at hand must go in a crowd rector have better go first will follow on opposite side of road so procession be formed be still three minute short of eight o'clock when hewitt plummer joined clergyman at door in garden wall behind mason house door be ajar a have be promised in mason note leaving plummer on guard without martin hewitt rector stepped a silently a possible through little kitchen garden across strip of lawn toward where dull light illuminated conservatory at right hand end of house door of conservatory be ajar also rector pushed open miss creswick rector called in loud whisper miss creswick with girl appeared within oh mr potswood said be so glad have come ca think what be wrong with poor uncle be afraid must be going mad be terrified at something have be getting worse till must hardly speak walk dr lawson have be about hour ago since then uncle have be much quieter in study be entering dimly lighted drawing room now dr lawson queried rector rather unusual visitor be how long have be gone miss creswick flushed slightly through paleness grief know said let out fancy said must not stay long when came did hear go have be upstairs servant be in kitchen say uncle mad be really afraid be left drawing room walked along corridor hall to opposite side of house where study lay miss creswick tapped gently at door there be answer tapped again louder then came faint sound of quick step on carpet then slight scraping noise a when door be closed over carpet will scarcely pas be window into garden said miss creswick why be going out uncle uncle jacob now silence be wholly unbroken hewitt snatched quickly at door handle locked said come quickest way into garden ran out at front door round toward study window be french window exactly at opposite end of house to conservatory now gas light streamed out through one half of stood curtainless ajar while curtain be drawn across other half hewitt be least familiar with place be quickest on leg more seriously alarmed than others reached window first instantly turned thrust rector back against miss creswick quick take away said be too late in same moment even a hewitt dashed over threshold snatched whistle from pocket blew hardest there on floor lay face dreadful staring black tight in neck be band of tourniquet fresh wet on forehead be red triangle hewitt snatched at screw of tourniquet behind neck loosened a quickly a hand must turn be too late too late examining surgeon afterwards said by quarter of hour plummer be at window with men at heel even before tourniquet be half unscrewed round wall of garden shouted hewitt whistle up police be only moment out house be alive with shout scream rector came running back hewitt busy with useless attempt at restoration called now for doctor people be scampering in street hewitt left victim to care of rector joined plummer in fewer second than may be told in plummer men be beaten for nothing not so much a moving shadow be seen in garden about wall worse general trampling must obliterate possible track plummer set guard of police about wall came in for consultation with body be carried into room hewitt plummer began examination of study sign of struggle commented plummer there be noise say be very odd from what have seen heard to day said hewitt be a must have expected believe man be almost killed by terror before be strangled dazed stricken dumb paralysed deafened by everything blinded poor wretch to have be blinded must have be mercy then a made examination systematically calmly without flurry hewitt told whole tale of day adventure together with have heard from rector man dead said confidence be at end indeed never have case so far a be concerned be over before have even touched have have chance plummer thing be deep dark deep dark oh if only man have let come to in daylight spite of might have be averted there have be close search here too see how everything be turned over stay low fire smouldered in grate on lay ash of many burnt paper hewitt passed shovel carefully under ash lifted out placed gently on table under light of gas pendant must leave said plummer there will be inspector here from station in moment wo interfere with if anybody can get information out of room be next thing for be plain must make sure of dr lawson if can be found be quite right without doubt hewitt responded may find anything nothing in room meanwhile be last person known to have be here only visitor be not heard to go out unless heard go when be outside study door more be plainly one familiar with place who be able to get away so quickly by window garden interest in getting rid of mason too girl of age in few month obstacle to getting hold of money removed surgical tourniquet chinese colour everything quite right must make sure of a say will get address from rector meanwhile will try to begin little contribution to case to begin a best can after chance have made useless iii be after nine when plummer returned rector have just rejoined hewitt in study having left poor miss creswick utterly broken down in room in charge of scarcely le terrified servant plummer tapped pushed study door open be done clean sure enough said with professional calmness be cool hand be that dr lawson have found anything more will want can get will hewitt assented will find more than have got now be grievously mistaken tell first what have done removed blotting pad on paper ash still lay very carefully shut away in wide drawer where draught must disturb also shut drawer stood open have difficulty in finding dr lawson plummer began met in fact leaving surgery went back with into gas light there put to plump well be staggered badly man must be of course pulled together wonderfully soon first thing said be that be just on way to mason house thought at first of course that meant to deny that have be there already gave usual warning about what said being used in evidence went on have got safely noted admitted that have be here at about seven o'clock just before said came because mr mason sent for doe seem likely doe on fact a know why said rector last time be here be ordered out know of reason why must have be asked to come to day must ask if anybody be sent have asked replied plummer just now none of servant be sent lawson story be that be sent for came though said must say what mason wanted to see about till knew more of case look a though have quite got story ready yet doe have thought over point about not being seen to go away though said have let out at about half past seven being familiar with way of house said that mason be rather unwell nervously upset when left be be terrible said rector terrible seems impossible to believe of young lawson yet yet then after pause good heaven burst out again why only realise now there be other crime too denson two murder two most certainly by same hand mr plummer ca believe oh there be more behind more behind mr hewitt there be more said hewitt a will see when tell little have be able to ascertain there be more behind though see little of yet first there be sharp knock at front door followed by ring muffled in distant kitchen hewitt started up who be late visitor at unvisited house said if be police well enough if anybody else anybody may call doctor anything please except martin hewitt forget that there be hurried step in hall question two study door be pushed open two servant must not venture from kitchen singly dreadful night made confused announcement of mr myatt be instantly pushed aside by mr myatt anxious agitated late mr mason closest scientific friend be palish black bearded man of above middle height with stooping shoulder very quick pair of eye there be something about face that somehow reminded hewitt of portrait have seen of john knox yet be not such face a seemed oddly unlike in very likeness what be dreadful news mr potswood cried heard people talking in next street on way home be true servant have told so say poor friend there have be arrest have there rector nodded gravely who tell about mr potswood tell think must see how miss creswick be doing said hewitt speaking across to plummer making for door certainly doctor certainly answered plummer with nod hewitt closed door behind leaving rector in full tide of account of day event hewitt way took to kitchen where servant be cowering whispering together frightened bewildered be there paint varnish of sort in place asked sharply give anything there be black if possible brush quickly there be there be brunswick black sir for stove said cook will do be quick oh there be gipps gardener be just man want gipps come find board plank quick a please hewitt pushed old gardener before into garden by kitchen door quarter of hour later mr everard myatt having heard be to be told of friend terrible death arrest of mr lawson turned to go meeting hewitt at study door on way how be poor miss creswick by now doctor asked anxiously hewitt shook head better than must expect said on whole worse must be seen to night of course perhaps if must call round in morning with rector of course of course poor girl dr lawson suspected too what terrible blow for anything can do doctor of course a said to mr potswood anything can do will do a gladly a such sad circumstance permit rector have be coming to door with mr myatt plummer catching sign from hewitt restrained unseen hewitt visitor walked into hall together have put out light seems hewitt said wonder why unless people from crowd have be coming into garden staring in through glass panel wonder if can find door handle yes here be dark outside too good night mind how go on step mr myatt checked stumbled in dark porch reached quickly downward there be board standing across porch said board replied hewitt so there be let move will upset somebody good night mr myatt strode off into dark night hewitt noiselessly lifting board have placed in position hastened back to study swung up board sticky shiny with brunswick black laid across spread newspaper on table there on top in midst of black varnish be print of five finger tip of hand where mr myatt have felt for obstruction in porch hewitt opened drawer have shut little while back took therefrom sheet of writing paper when with lens from pocket began to examine paper in comparison with finger mark on board plummer rector must see that there be also two distinct finger mark on paper one faint one red plummer came to look what be said be what be going to tell about hewitt did not reply for few moment continued examination then rose turned to plummer have still got that piece of paper in pocket suppose said with little red smudge of colour put there by police surgeon yes here be detective took from waistcoat pocket thanks said hewitt now see here be little of red stuff taken from mark on denson forehead week ago found to consist of vermilion oil wax have seen second impression of awful mark on forehead of poor friend mason mr potswood to night room have be searched for paper before began paper have be burnt in search drawer be opened containing a see nothing supply of new headed note paper note paper be hastily lifted to see if anything else lay beneath here on bottom sheet finger mark be left in same adhesive freely marking red sort of stuff stick to mark touch hand lifted that paper be hand impressed ghastly mark hand left print on black varnish be mr everard myatt now compare two plummer have snatched lens be narrowly comparing mark ere hewitt have well finished speaking be cried a rector bent excitedly over be same see forefinger middle finger same line need tell pursued hewitt certainly need tell plummer that be most certain scientific method of identification known police know that use now there be more saw take charred paper from fire sometimes word may be read on charred paper depends on paper ink most of cinder be too much broken to yield information though may try again by daylight one be suggestive see hewitt very carefully pulled out flat drawer held cinder see went on one be different from rest have retained original form better have be le broken because of being of thicker paper be crumpled envelope look at flap have never be closed down moreover on same flap may read in embossed letter still visible part of name of house plain inference be envelope intended for letter never sent so crumpled up dropped into waste paper basket why must such apparently unimportant thing a be carefully brought from waste paper basket burnt somebody be anxious that smallest scrap of paper evidencing certain correspondence must be destroyed look closely at front of envelope ink show rather lighter grey than paper address be incomplete at rate more than of first line little of second be at visible now be plain that first line begin with e letter immediately following be not distinct next there be capital m beginning name be clearly myatt myall now be why when myatt came here took first step to hand to get impression of finger tip in order to compare with mark on paper why asked astonished rector why did come back nothing bold measure to see how thing be going came a own spy be be keen dangerous man remember telling how called on yesterday though hardly knew by sight merely to ask to persuade mason to take holiday struck a little odd at time be pumping mr potswood wanted to find what mason have be saying be not alone plainly be not alone for poor mason knew be watching everywhere come be time for speculation plummer must hold safely will pick up evidence enough when have got must leave plummer 'd take to night be right right a usual mr hewitt plummer agreed more especially a rector be well little incautious in talking to just now what did say mr potswood asked astonished have suspicion how must have mr potswood detective replied have suspicion for very reason in excitement of narrative called martin hewitt by right name at least twice after have called 'doctor too added regretfully be that so asked hewitt poor rector be sadly abashed really be aware of mr hewitt protested hardly think must there perhaps did of course if inspector plummer remembers will be off exclaimed hewitt with hint finding black stuff on hand will smell rat instantly come mr potswood can show nearest way to house at rate come may get yet good rector slip of tongue be fatal myatt be not yet to meet fate fitted house be not far le than mile away be detached house small one smaller than mason plummer blocked exit with man caution be wasted myatt be gone there be house furniture two servant just a might have be day in year when myatt be out for hour now be out for good police watched waited night next day waited watched for week house be under observation after myatt never returned have made plan be plain for just flight whenever necessity might arise when be assured that danger threatened simply vanished in dark of london night search brought information not scrap of telltale paper lay in calton lodge not letter not line though indeed police be to see more of myatt work yet so be hewitt dr lawson detention did not last night out unhappy mason have indeed sent to by chance messenger having grown desperate in long waiting for return of gipps from rectory mason be ready to call in aid to recall of friendship have sacrificed in past lawson be long in coming having received note after long professional round when at last arrived mason be little reassured by promise of hewitt visit therefore did not tell doctor so much a might have done nevertheless talked wildly vaguely so that dr lawson feared disturbance of reason doctor quieted soothed however when left promised to return after consultation hour at surgery be over must have be watched away from house then blow fell sealed for ever lip of jacob mason poor miss creswick be taken from old house in must no longer remain for few month stayed at rectory tended lovingly by rector excellent wife stayed there in fact till wedding day took place early next year so that for dr lawson tragedy ended in happiness after god forgive cried rector in grey of morning when became clear that myatt have escaped god forgive through stupidity horrible creature have be set loose in world to work diabolical will afresh never mind said hewitt be not stupidity mr potswood nothing openness of character be not trained to cunning that must use in profession there will be more than myatt to take be not alone be plain that mason be found to be wavering in horrible allegiance have bound be watched myatt be not alone fear not replied clergyman fear not there be horrible mystery still watching besetting terrified so much fact that seems to have yielded up life without struggle that with help so near connection what must have be between mason other victim denson be deep mystery indeed that horrible sign mr hewitt have done much not replied martin hewitt not nearly be even doubtful whether not will be lot to come across thing again will be in hand of police after have achieved something for know that if myatt can be captured will be at heart of mystery case of lever key in of case now know to have be connected with red triangle there be nothing in first place to show such association in of case connection have become apparent only since final clearing up of whole mystery with case have present concern in others revealed during investigation of case be to second category that next case belonged next at connectible be after of mysterious death of mr jacob mason flight of everard myatt case be remarkable in other respect also first because in one of feature have resemblance to case of samuel diamond first brought red triangle to hewitt notice next because in course hewitt encountered what declared to be most ingenious baffling cryptogram that have ever seen in length of strange experience thirdly because be mean of placing cryptogram in hand owing to one of odd chance arise again again in real life be indeed so common a to pas almost unregarded yet might be thought improbable if offered in guise of mere story hewitt have often alluded to curious persistence of such chance in experience think have elsewhere mentioned certain police officer prolonged search after criminal for whose arrest held warrant ending in discovery because of misdirected call that man have be living time next door to have also told of other detective inspector who being sent in search of criminal of whom have meagrest most unsatisfactory particular whom scarcely hoped ever to run down actually fell over man a be leaving office where have received information in doorway of fellow have stooped to tie shoe lace a hewitt must say nothing exceptional nature of surrounding circumstance make thing seem extraordinary what more ordinary experience for example than to meet friend in london street perhaps one friend of only dozen so have among four million of people about odds against two of million choosing one street of thousand in london to walk down at same minute of time must seem incalculable yet chance come off so often a to be matter of most ordinary experience on occasion be expecting order from editor to produce certain article on subject of london hospital will be remembered that matter be very much in air few year ago a nothing be professionally more uncomfortable than to be called on suddenly for accurate reasonable leading article on subject one know nothing about wrote to friend barton mccarthy who be house surgeon at st augustine replied by offer to tell anything cared to ask if must call at hospital set out accordingly little time after breakfast even later than ordinary called in at hewitt office on way downstairs to say must not be lunching at usual place that day hewitt answered will expect be off to city at once have urgent message to go immediately to kingsley bell dalton in broad street where big bond robbery have just be discovered perhaps can give lift in cab hurried off together accordingly hewitt knew nothing of case have to examine so must tell nothing beyond short urgent request that must come at once that matter involved loss of bond to very large amount dropped at convenient spot whence walk to hospital be short one saw friend mccarthy bothered very successfully for nearly hour getting information have expected more during very interesting walk through great hospital get idea in place like said mccarthy a came at last into receiving room for accident case get idea brett of size of great london machine working about might walk about street for week never see serious accident even accident at yet see here come day long stream of people damaged killed in machine decent workman be having gashed hand dressed strapped navvy with bandage about head be being led away by friend nurse dresser be waiting ready to take orderly turn at incoming casualty a looked more serious case be brought in on ambulance by two policeman patient be ragged disreputable looking fellow of middle age in grimy tattered clothes whose head have be roughly bandaged by policeman who brought have be knocked down kicked on head by butcher cart horse seemed in moorgate street be quite insensible very short examination showed that case be nothing trivial mccarthy sent to sit in private room to wait lunch while gave matter personal attention when returned brought small crumpled envelope in hand case be put to bed said still insensible be very bad asked slight fracture of occipital of course concussion of brain probably contusion too expect will find presently not so over serious for healthy man be afraid be old soaker sort crumple up at touch nobody know there be nothing to identify in pocket few copper old knife so on so ca send to tell friend unless bring in friend martin hewitt to trace out must come too expensive besides mccarthy added dropping into seat before desk if be got friend will come sooner later when miss be only thing 'd got beside what be in pocket 'd be sent on message probably friend held up crumpled envelope took from small key 'd got envelope gripped tightly in hand said there be address on so tore open in hope of finding one inside there be nothing there key if be very promising pupil of friend hewitt must expect to take glance at tell man address at once together with age birthplace when vaccinated residence of maternal grandmother be not so will let off mccarthy turned key idly about in hand tried on lock in desk stopped up remarked withdrawing peeping into barrel not dirt either stopped up with paper what be for took pin to clear barrel paper came away quite readily be tight little roll surgeon pulled out into small strip rather le than three inch long about inch broad hullo exclaimed look here here be job for martin hewitt after figure what doe mean what amazing place to put in key barrel by jove brett look like one of favourite adventure somebody sends key in envelope row of incomprehensible figure rolled up inside key look at took key paper key be of good sort small inscribed tripp patent on bow evidently belonged to superior lever lock paper have come from barrel be very thin tough kind have seen used in typewriter have be very carefully closely rolled then pushed into key so that natural tendency to open out held tightly within written upon with fine pen appeared series of very minute figure thus well inquired mccarthy what do make of not much a yet admitted be pretty certain must be cryptogram code writing of sort if be case think might back to read with little time for well remembered case of flitterbat lancer lesson in cypher reading hewitt then gave come friend replied much interested let see how do meantime will get on with lunch took pencil spare sheet of paper studied figure through lunch for little time after soon became plain that problem be much more difficult than looked said so at first glance said looked fairly easy cypher a matter of fact think be easy at one assumes of course that figure stand for letter on assumption two three peculiarity be noticeable first highest number written here be so that letter indicated in order may come be within compass of twenty six letter of alphabet next number most frequently repeated if except nought be occur seven time now vowel most frequently occurring in average english writing be e will at once perceive that e be number five in alphabet counting from beginning more if go on counting so will find be t be one of most frequently occurring consonant must seem to hint that cypher be of very simplest description consisting of mere substitution of figure for letter in exact order of alphabet what then of nought what can mean more especially when consider in three place there be actually four nought in succession for of course letter be repeated four time successively in english word in foreign word can imagine let put down letter in substitution for figure on supposition that figure stand for letter in alphabetical order leaving nought a be then get rapidly pencilled letter on spare paper thus h n d t r e o s t c h e c w e m n s s t f e t c v o r e h t k r e t l e w n n t see there said now can make nothing of when come to examine comparative frequency of different letter find much a might be expected to be in sentence of normal english change must destroy proportion e t be most frequent then come n r s c a stand mean nothing be possible that may be one of difficult variable letter cypher hewitt might read ca even then if value of letter change a must do must get out of normal proportion of frequency so that variable letter cypher seems unlikely there be oddity look will see that counting nought in letter go in group of eight with semi colon at end of group now be impossible that message can be sentence in word have exactly eight letter at least must think so can scarcely be that semi colon mean letter must be singular for one letter to occur with such curious regularity a there be other visible division between word single one of usual aid by reader of secret cypher be able to take hold of work be afraid must give up for present at rate really think be thing must vastly interest hewitt if might show to suppose must well mccarthy answered perhaps be strictly according to rule think might venture to lend to till to morrow if will do indeed think on second thought may consider quite justified since may lead to man identification will be sufficient answer to inquiry to say have shown to mr martin hewitt for purpose will be careful of wo do want key too think if may will take key envelope together can never tell what may what may not help three thing may hang together perhaps explain other in mysterious way very good here be whole bag of trick be queer business altogether must say feel inquisitive certainly if hewitt can get anything out of figure will be mighty curious to know how doe will come in again to morrow then promised must walked off with crumpled envelope little key puzzling strip of figure since lesson from hewitt have alluded to have often amused with cryptogram reading have never found cypher message in newspaper agony column meaning of must not get at with little trouble be something altogether beyond if have reader who pride on ability to read secret cypher recommend to try skill on one before read further circumstance too seemed a puzzling a writing why if person wished to send note key in closed envelope must take trouble to pack note inside key why especially when note be already written in so baffling cypher whither have ragged messenger be going with mysterious package who have sent why guessing musing reached home found that hewitt have returned before made way into office came on sitting at desk with large lens attentively examining broken brass padlock be bothering asked be on bond robbery now martin hewitt nodded with jerk of hand toward padlock be tough job said will shut up presently think hard over just now ca see way into at what have got there never mind said be too busy now came across something very odd at hospital thought must interest be very well let see have begun bout of cogitation yet show put envelope key paper on table before hewitt with glance of surprise picked up key examined be curious said straightway began fitting key to broken padlock on desk why man alive cried with sudden burst of excitement where did get be article key very thing want sprang to foot stared in face in sheer amazement heaven brett thing almost supernatural have broken lever padlock here of thing in world wanted to find one key fitted calmly walk in clap down very thing under nose where did get told tale of man who have be knocked down in moorgate street explained exactly how paper key envelope be found in relation to other why have brought when be man knocked over hewitt asked time between one two o'clock must say replied brought in well before two at rate hewitt stared into vacancy for moment thinking hard then said brett believe have saved reputation not that must have suffered much perhaps in such desperate case a fact have already advised calling in of police must perhaps even have given up part of case still left ought to put on proper track see one of patent lever lock differs in slight degree from rest only own key will fit here by amazing piece of good luck be one key for very lock man who have be detained in hospital come be off to see insensible say when left yes answered likely to be so for time mccarthy think so probably wo get much information out of just yet cypher will examine cypher a go along think must like to take look at man at rate even if ca tell anything will give note to friend mccarthy of course answered readily sat down to scribble few line necessary to introduce hewitt when have finished hewitt who have be examining cryptogram meanwhile remarked cypher be something out of common brett certainly expect to be able to read in cab journey perhaps not in week of study man who devised be man of ability altogether beyond average have have best try at said beat wholly brought purely a matter of curiosity to show be merest chance brought key a well if have must probably have put cypher aside until case be over so have missed whole thing lesson never to despise what seem like trifle if have studied cypher have doubt observed there will talk that over afterwards whole case if like will go now will tell about business when time permit ii here be case of bond robbery a have be presented to martin hewitt that morning while be at st augustine hospital a learned from later have be little puzzled to hear hewitt say that case have seemed so desperately hopeless that advised calling in of police because experience have rather be that be hewitt who be commonly called in often too late when police be beaten have never before heard of case in order of thing be reversed turned out however a will be seen that in state of matter a first presented only measure seemed possible be such a be in power of police alone to adopt messrs kingsley bell dalton be old established firm of broker whose operation be not enormous much in eye of public who carried on steady reputable business in set of office high up in great building in broad street building so large that notice office to let be permanent fixture in front porch firm client be chiefly steady going investor of old fashioned sort who wished to avoid speculative firework to deal through firm whose habit be conformable to own last kingsley have left firm soon afterward died few year back now head of firm be mr robert stanstead bell gentleman of sixty year of age there be couple of sleeping partner relation one other active partner be mr clarence dalton young man recently advanced to partnership be said likely to become mr bell son in law whenever old gentleman daughter lilian must be married steady even round of business to kingsley bell dalton clerk be accustomed be suddenly interrupted by appalling loss be discovered that bond be missing from safe bond to amount of l whence how when be taken be utter mystery be loss have occasioned urgent message to hewitt when hewitt reached spot be shown at once into inner office where mr bell sat waiting old gentleman be in sad state of agitation be with difficulty that hewitt got from reasonably connected account of trouble loss come at time mr hewitt senior partner explained that know may ruin utterly unless client property can be recovered have have to pay out heavy sum of late to representative of dead retiring partner other circumstance combine with to make matter in way even more terribly serious than very large amount of loss must seem to suggest so beg will do what can that of course responded hewitt please tell a clearly a can precise circumstance of case where be bond taken from safe mr bell answered turning toward very large heavy one might almost have be called small strong room be kept together with others in box one of several a see box be fastened like rest with tripp patent lever padlock only key of kept together with key of safe box indicated be one of ordinary thin sheet iron japanned black something like what be called deed box padlock have be broken open see hewitt observed yes did that morning have be blocked up in way so that key must turn doubtless in order to cause delay when next box must come to be opened a be might have desisted put off opening till later have reason for wishing to refer at once to list be in box so decided to break padlock be more difficult than one might expect with such small padlock then discovered loss then discovered loss mr hewitt though be mere chance even then for see bond have not be taken left be placed on top while space below be filled with dummy hardly know why turned over for list be at top did then mr bell finished with despairing gesture be time morning at about half past eleven when did last open box before ten day ago at least must think even then bond may have be gone for only opened to refer to same list examined nothing else say that bond be left others be gone presume taken be such a must be easy to negotiate left be such a must be difficult be that fact precisely then thief evidently know rope altogether matter must seem awkward for anything short of ten day see quite possibly for even longer time than that bond have be in undisturbed possession of person who must easily dispose of must certainly do so without moment delay mr bell nodded sadly quite true said now tell little more say keep only key of padlock a well a key of safe so that open safe morning close at night just so do never entrust key to anybody else key of safe be on separate bunch from key of box second bunch with key of box be always in pocket not soul else ever touch other bunch with outer key of safe sometimes hand to partner to head clerk mr foster if something be wanted from safe when be busy though a rule safe door be open so long a be about place nothing book can be taken out without use of other key for drawer box keep on private bunch must be possible for anybody anybody at mind to get at private bunch of key in such way for instance a to be able to take wax impression of key of bond box certainly not mr bell answered with decision certainly not at rate not in office added ah not in office anywhere else anywhere else must think other replied though time little more thoughtfully there be only own family at home servant anybody who have access to room of office hewitt asked keenly mr bell seemed little startled why said nobody at home come to office not even visitor except of course junior partner who visit room pretty frequently very well remember ever mislaying key temporarily suppose here at home o mr bell replied slowly ca say that do remember anything of sort believe must be sure to remember if have ah when realised loss what did do told partner first suppose no doe know of discovery went out just before made expect in again to day a mr bell spoke there grew plain in face pallor of new fear martin hewitt observed kept thought to well said did tell partner police mr hewitt see of course first thing police attempt be to catch punish thief make recovery of property subsidiary object for mr hewitt recovery of property a have explained be one great consideration punish thief by mean first save from ruin mr hewitt be why sent for for because thought might be advisable to keep matter quiet till have taken step there be something in consideration certainly so have told nobody of loss except nobody foster head clerk old faithful servant be in fact who suggested sending for a put very forcibly can act for interest while police act for very properly of course a police in interest of community very well see have several clerk in outer office do ever come into room never unless be sent for if partner be out one of clerk came in without being sent for rest must know of course certainly observe three private room opening out of be be sort of extra inner room where have private interview with client be in there with client for hour morning before discovered loss next be mere little box of room where correspondence clerk sits work other be larger place be shared between partner mr clarence dalton head clerk mr foster now let have broken padlock key see have forced up front plate with screw driver will borrow that screw driver if please force off completely hewitt client produced screw driver from drawer in very few moment interior of little padlock lay uncovered hewitt examined lock attentively for few minute trying key several time against lever then stood up said mr bell have made mistake be not lock at not lock exclaimed broker what do mean tell be lock of box broke open yes answered calmly be on box broke open same be not lock let explain be very good little padlock with excellent lever action 'dogged against detent a technical phrase go so that only key properly made for lock will open be so good indeed a lock that must be waste of time to try picking when because of small size be so very easy to break apart just a have done just a must probably have done in time having have rather more experience now be have be done with lock by person who have bond of course broken lock have one disadvantage a compared with skilfully picked lock show at first glance what have happened in case mr bell lock have be broken taken away thief having first provided with padlock of precisely same make size have substituted that locked with proper key so left what then be why of course be why supposed to be out of order when attempted to open with key a matter of fact be even now in perfectly good order except for damage have jointly committed with screw driver now observe that lock be shut by key if man did be a sharp a suppose be will have got rid of key at once perhaps have if not then man who have key be thief at rate key be clue must hunt for let have clerk in one by one look at key be out at lunch by time probably said might be wanted so kept thought might prefer to see before went out very well thought of perhaps scarcely judicious on whole because if there be guilty person among may give hint odds be rather against being very useful considering possibility even probability that bond collateral evidence left here day ago will look at key by mean then may go to lunch a soon a please let do talking perhaps will start scare send for nearest clerk first then others a come in mention name so can hear say 'oh mr brown ' jones what not 'have key about mention name will do rest push to door of safe lock drawer in table mr bell did a hewitt directed then called head clerk mr foster from room with prescribed inquiry about key yes mr foster hewitt added pleasantly be not sure that lock be quite in order promised to open for mr bell so will try mr foster slim active old gentleman grown grey in firm service pulled bunch of key from pocket hewitt scrutinised narrowly said be afraid none of will do stay added suddenly turning back carried bunch to window no concluded a came back to table tried one of key fruitlessly be afraid none of will do thank mr foster happen to have more do mr foster have more retired to room then mr bell called correspondence clerk mr henning mr henning be much younger man than head clerk twenty six so pale blue eyed with weak whisker straggling moustache key be just a readily produced a mr foster again hewitt examination be unsuccessful only other key have belonged to typewriter did not fit then came mr potter book keeper round tubby puffy key went under inspection in same way taking little longer time with two separate dash to light of window then there be mr robson young spruce mr clancy older le tidy four five more key be examined with same lack of success clerk be sent away to take turn at lunch hewitt reported a soon a mr bell be alone again be certainly none of key though indeed little attempt be desperate at best man must be fool to keep that key longer than needed especially to string with others still of course be by just such blunder a nine criminal out of ten be discovered now let take good look at box content lifted box from safe to table narrowly scrutinised exterior especially about hasp where padlock have be either thief be experienced hand said took steady practice with few such padlock a before setting to work there be sign of banging about slipping of tool anywhere of course banging anything violent must have be noticed in place like mr bell remarked in office hour yes responded hewitt must forget office hour be only seven eight out of twenty four suspect burglary do be afraid a yet have precious little ground for suspecting anything definite hewitt answered must keep awake to possibility now let see dummy turned over loosened wherever be tied yes remarked quite neatly done filled in with ordinary blank foolscap such a doubt have in office then be in other office too stationer have by ream mark anywhere old newspaper nothing must give shadow of clue dropped last of paper turned to client mr bell said thing have be thought out to last inch there be something like genius in robbery if genius be capacity for taking pain advice to be to call in scotland yard people at once do mean can hing asked mr bell despairingly tell that mr hewitt mean that hewitt answered mean that until have have time to think thing over very thoroughly ca tell what can ought to do meantime think police must know not because think can see farther into thing than can for indeed think can simply because thief be getting longer start moment police be armed with power be not at disposal can get search warrant stop people at port railway station arrest suspect do score of thing will be necessary send to scotland yard get detective inspector plummer if be available be a good man a have tell that have engaged better still write note to scotland yard authority let have to send not a think best after have turned thing over in mind will take one good look round office then run back to room for hour two hard consideration of may see one two small thing have seen already though 'd rather not mention till have made up mind how bear matter seem likely to have gone so far that perhaps regular police course of catching thief first will be best plan if can be done meantime will be business to keep eye first on recovery of bond think must have police mr bell now will take general look round iii after martin hewitt have rushed off to st augustine hospital with key envelope cypher have brought heard nothing of till dusk fell about six then received telegram cypher read most interesting case if can spare hour be outside broad street at six thirty schewittsc have to be at office between eight nine to keep hewitt appointment must probably have to sacrifice dinner be particularly curious to know meaning of cypher just a curious to know how must be read moreover knew that case hewitt called interesting must probably be interesting above common so took hat sought cab be first at meeting place indeed little before time broad street be great new building of office most if not closed at time fact indicated by shutting of one of half of big front door where char woman be sweeping step under board announced that office be to be let waited nearly quarter of hour then at last hansom stopped deposited hewitt older gentleman before hope have kept waiting brett hewitt said be mr bell of kingsley bell dalton took little longer than expected to reach office be shut clerk gone be going to turn up light for bit lift man be gone too expect so will have good long stair climb a to lift man hewitt be right during long climb received account of loss mr bell firm have suffered have told mr bell hewitt said that be who happened across key in such odd fashion when wired be sure must be glad to let see upshot of strange bit of luck be also pretty sure that must like to see too for really believe that case confess seemed pretty near hopeless few hour ago be coming to issue now here did get information out of man in hospital asked not scrap hewitt replied be still insensible though saw clothes told good deal about gentleman personal habit be not dazzlingly noble to put mildly told nothing else except that have recently be knocked down in mud knew already cypher have told something a will explain presently by time have reached high floor in office stood mr bell wonder pale agitation unlocked outer door turned on electric light now cried hewitt show ventilator there be seemed in top pane of window be not what hewitt wanted there be others in form of upright chamber flue made of metal painted same colour a wall about rose from floor in corner wall angle must be shut opened by mean of lid over upper end be more to hewitt mind went about from one to groping under lid poking down into flue with walking stick there be wire grating diaphragm seemed in of two three foot down must hear end of stick raking on at investigation one after of ventilator hewitt examined till have examined in outer inner room without result must see that be disappointed there must be somewhere said hunted afresh plainly have tried now must do more than try again with a little result be ventilator said positively unless broke off thoughtfully stood silent for few moment ah of course resumed presently will send for housekeeper candle be nearest empty office nearest office to let be there one on floor think not mr bell answered there be one on floor below just opposite lift see bill on door day a come up will try that then will rake out ventilator in palatial edifice before will call beaten come call housekeeper be there speaking tube tell to bring light housekeeper came wonderingly with watch man oil lantern went to floor below lift be glass door from bill have recently be torn why be let said mr bell yes sir assented housekeeper let day two ago to mr catherton hunt at least deposit be paid see door not locked hewitt observed pushing open think will trespass on mr catherton hunt new office since seem quite empty have taken possession come ventilator be small office outer room of moderate size one smaller inner room hewitt at once attacked ventilator in larger apartment there be two of retired disappointed from there be one ventilator only in small room hewitt tilted lid be at about level of eye thrust in hand drew forth bundle of folded paper thrust in hand again drew forth bundle did again drew forth more mr bell fell upon first bundle almost a dog fall upon bone now snatched eagerly at successive paper bundle till hewitt raked grating with stick declared that there be more be that asked mr bell went tremblingly from paper to paper at last said that believed really be can verify by list upstairs added if be sure there be more more repeated hewitt rattling stick in ventilator again let go verify by mean sent puzzled housekeeper away returned to office above presently mr bell now beginning so far to recover from amazement a to express incoherent gratitude reported that bond be correct complete to last least very well said hewitt then part of business be done though must say have have luck rather brett have have for police must come on now think mr bell will go along to scotland yard when leave here will be wanting to see mr catherton hunt expect whoever be somebody in office too if be not sadly mistaken who gasped mr bell that perhaps can help to point out see here do know whose figure be hewitt produced small slip of paper containing cypher be very small remarked mr bell putting on glass very small indeed think why be henning do believe ah one two other little thing seemed to point way henning be correspondence clerk believe expect thin little slip be specimen of typewriter paper have of written figure for comparison well hardly think see typewrites letter although know writing very well ca at moment put hand on figure of never mind be mere matter of curiosity police will ask question in morning what believe have happened be friend henning if be man have friend outside great deal cleverer than though must seem to have share of cunning too between resolved to rob in way have done temporarily henning be to take advantage of position in little inner room to get at safe day when be open when be engaged in own private inner room with client so leaving safe unwatched be provided with spare patent padlock key of sort used on black box confederate have drilled in trick of breaking that particular sort of padlock open with other spare specimen got opportunity morning only morning morning think else must never have got bond back even have heard of again think said be engaged with client for hour yes from about half past ten to eleven be chance took broke padlock took out bond substituted dummy have already prepared in own desk locked box again with new padlock meantime hunt have paid deposit pending reference on office below nearest empty room of course must get key until tenancy be finally accepted never intended must be easily arranged to have door left unlocked for day two on convenient excuse arranging decoration what not bill be taken down so that prospective prospecting tenant be kept away bond being stolen henning took first opportunity of carrying to empty office probably piecemeal thing must easily manage almost under nose before be aware of loss there be to conceal either in chimney under board in ventilator a might find convenient found ventilator most convenient then be to apprise confederate of fact that robbery have be effected in order that hunt might come quietly fetch plunder away message be to take ingenious form hunt be to have fellow waiting about in street a soon a henning must get out say to lunch be just to send key by messenger key with have locked new padlock on black box see advantage of simple arrangement first key be evidence be got rid of in safe effectual way thing must be done a well by merely flinging away on near premise where might be found next message be perfectly secret messenger must never guess what key meant must other person not in confederate confidence at same time key tell be necessary robbery have be effected come remove plunder something unforeseen happens sooner be bond stolen safely hidden than go to box find something wrong with lock break open discover loss be thing that trusted must not happen till after bond be safely got away more be sent for clerk be kept in from lunch so on henning get into funk resolve to send message of special urgency to confederate for purpose us cypher two have agreed upon most ingenious cypher have ever seen used for purpose doe wish to make message more conspicuous than need so writes cypher on scrap of paper roll inside key probably expedient agreed upon in case of necessity then key go into envelope for greater security of cypher message messenger get when henning be at last released for lunch what happened to message know here be now will not weary with detailed account of different way in attacked cypher will take shortest possible cut to true interpretation very short examination of cryptogram show that while number be included above number in relative frequency roughly agree with relative frequency of corresponding letter of alphabet for b for so on here handed hewitt pencilled note have made at hospital with letter substituted for figure thus h n d t r e o s t c h e c w e m n s s t f e t c v o r e h t k r e t l e w n n t hewitt took paper went on if be thing must be childishly simple will see that seem a far from solution a ever for letter a stand mean nothing though in fact be in normal relative frequency so that if mean other letter rule be upset be at standstill admit that for long time thing bothered peculiarity struck not only be figure letter disposed in group of eight there be also eight such group sixty four altogether what did suggest what chessboard chessboard queried just so chessboard eight square way sixty four altogether so drew rough representation of chessboard set out letter on in order like h n d t r e o s t o c h e c w e m n s s t o o f e t o o c v o o o r e h t k r e t l e w n n t now there be chessboard with letter on tried reading downward across upward diagonally in direction of move of different chess piece king queen rook bishop nothing came of did thing be a unreadable a ever there remained one chess move to try eccentric move of knight move of one square forward backward sideways then one square diagonally a have sometimes be more concisely expressed move to next square one of different colour from on rest tried knight move read cypher began at top left hand corner just a one doe in reading book read move downward to w e h found that led to nothing so took one alternative move with little consideration skipped along from to t in second line of square t in top line h in second line e in third r in top e in second gave idea there be letter t t followed by word here tried back from again taking in reverse order w e h have first given up read own name a can see from h on bottom line one moving upward so have word hewitt here need not carry through step will now be plain enough to found that message actually began in right hand corner read thus nought counting for nothing 'invent loss disc take at once martin hewitt here fear watch ' nought be plainly merely inserted to fill in unneeded square keep rest of figure in proper relative place when cypher be written in line at first be little puzzled to understand what seemed to be first word invent be quite clear that loss disc meant discovered ' so concluded that here in beginning be contraction also that in be separate word in case vent must be contraction for other word haventilator ' in accordance with sense of word so concluded that meaning of whole sentence be simply 'the plunder be in ventilator loss be discovered take away booty at once martin hewitt be here fear may be watched there be reading little adventure evening be what have led to of course confederate must go groping about square so painfully a have have to do to reading must be simple enough for order of move must be preconcerted of conspirator must have a guide to reading writing cypher drawn set of square numbered in order of move where have where have n where have v so on with before reading writing in extraordinary cryptogram must be easy quick enough now for scotland yard iv learned late on following day that henning have not appeared at office from that assumed that must have met confederate in evening finding that have not received message sent conceived that something be wrong made safe confederate hunt however made appearance early next morning escaped what happened be best told in plummer word when called on hewitt in afternoon went round morning said a said must last night took good man with got dummy bond have be put in bell box popped in ventilator where real one have be hidden see 'd got nothing legal against catherton hunt a yet if must only grab with dummy bond on might help with other evidence must scrape up especially if must take henning to sustain charge of conspiracy to steal well came so quick be on before be quite ready 'd got dummy in place be in front of door telling man likeliest corner to wait in when suddenly up pop lift right in front of with gentleman in clean shaven looked at looked at have sort of distant notion might have seen before be pretty certain have something more than distant notion about 'down again ' say to lift man before gate be swung `` ve forgotten something ' down lift went will understand have idea be man wanted a

everard myatt catherton hunt be lost again martin hewitt have be wholly successful for have recovered mr bell missing bond police caught of conspirator investigation at henning lodging showed that careful preparation must have be made for immediate flight if must become necessary flight have taken place man in hospital who have be knocked down in carrying from one to other extraordinary message hewitt deciphered remained insensible for few day must not be questioned till time later still then professed to have forgotten about message on be going when met accident medical men in attendance informed police that be quite possible that fellow statement be true said that did carry message sometimes when must get job must remember nothing of message of key of who have sent where be to go nevertheless police although professed to accept statement kept wary eye on after discharge from hospital for have very great suspicion that knew more than chose to tell nothing more be heard of accomplice till case of martin hewitt brought news that in manner strange enough matter began a so many matter of hewitt did with receipt of telegram followed immediately by for first having be handed in at country office not very long before eight previous evening be not delivered at hewitt office till morning in accordance with ancient manner custom observed in telegraphic system of country have be despatched from throckham in middlesex be simply very urgently worded request to hewitt to come at once signed claire peytral second telegram came even a hewitt be reading first on arrival at office ran thus did receive telegram see newspaper matter life death must come personally can not leave mother pray answer scpeytralsc answer went instantly that hewitt must come by next train for have seen morning paper from knew urgency of case consultation of railway guide showed that train to throckham be fewer than one might suppose considering proximity of village to london that next must leave in about hour quarter so saw hewitt before started came up to room in fact a be beginning to breakfast see here said be sent for in throckham case have seen report a leader writer have little business with news side of paper indeed have more than vague recollection of such heading a tragedy in barn in one evening paper of day before murder at throckham in so must claim very exact knowledge of affair here have paper see hewitt said reaching for perhaps report be fuller than in mine gave own newspaper began searching in other no said presently much same news agency report to paper doubt report read ran a follows scsingular tragedysc extraordinary occurrence be reported from throckham small village within fifteen mile of london involving tragic fatality have led to charge of murder on thursday evening old barn for time disused be discovered to be on fire be only by extraordinary exertion on part of villager that fire be extinguished upon examination of place yesterday morning body of mr victor peytral gentleman who have lived in neighbourhood for time who have be missing since shortly before discovery of fire be found in ruin body be burnt almost beyond recognition not so much a to conceal fact that unfortunate gentleman have not perished in fire have be victim of foul play throat be very deeply cut there can be doubt that murderer must have fired barn with object of destroying trace of crime police have arrested mr percy bowmore frequent visitor at house of deceased telegram said hewitt be plainly from relative of mr peytral who be dead perhaps daughter since speaks of being unable to leave mother in case probably only child since there be other to leave unless others be too young suggested just so hewitt replied well brett added to day be saturday saturday be of course off day understood hewitt to hint that if pleased might accompany to throckham saturday be said have engagement must care for to come a please of course can guess very little of case a yet naturally beyond what have read in paper subtle sense of experience tell that there be chance of interesting case in be temptation a for mind admitting especially in country case where resource of civilisation be not always close at hand be never loth to have friend with who be too proud to be made use of temptation persuasion be needed in due time set out together ii be experience that place be to be found within twenty mile of london far more rural far sleepier far le influenced by great city lie so near than place thrice four time a far away be just too far out to be disturbed by suburban traffic too near to feel influence of great railway line main line go by carrying good passenger to place far beyond be only by awkward little branch line with slow rare train that part of mid lying belt be reached even then be odds one must drive good way to destination throckham be just such place a speak of be reason why have such ample time to catch first of half dozen leisurely train by one might reach neighbourhood during day station be redfield throckham be three mile beyond at redfield coachman with dogcart awaited hewitt only one gentleman having be expected a man explained in offering to give of rein hewitt wished to talk to coachman willingly took back seat understanding very well that friend must get better to work if first have a many of fact a possible

tell mr bowmore to go away 'preferred to be alone 'd 'have enough ' of mr bowmore from what grant must make out 'get out o sight sir tell ' old gentleman said at last stamping foot shaking fist in young gentleman face then bowmore turned walked away one moment hewitt interposed be telling what grant saw heard how did come to knowledge told sir told word yesterday told twice in fact first thing

course yes must tell about fire who discovered oh man going home along lane ran called people fetched fire engine from village pumped out of horse pond just close by be pretty much of wreck by time got fire out be all gone a might have expected see have be out of use for time sir there be mostly nothing old broken plough lumber there what be more there be deal of rain early in week a may remember sir so thatch be pretty sodden being out o ' repair so be timber for matter o that for there be telling when be last painted so fire did go quite so fierce a might see else must expect have be all over before got to work on not at likely sort of place to catch fire must seem either hewitt commented old plough such lumber be not very combustible quite so sir be what make think so odd suppose there be bundle two of old pea straw there shied in last summer say being over bundle from last load there left when be mr bowmore seen next came strolling back sir told young lady 'd left father outside something of sort think said nothing of quarrel believe said barn be on fire must have known pretty early sir for 't be mile from house off way coachman pointed with whip nothing be

people went away home to bed be till morning that anybody went in to turn place over then found body badly burnt believe horrid burnt sir if be for mr peytral being missing doubt if 'd have known be at took doctor examination to see clear that throat have be cut cut have be deep so doctor said now body gone over to redfield mortuary hewitt asked few question more got equally direct answer except where coachman have to confess ignorance presently be at house to hewitt have be summoned be pleasant house enough standing alone apart from village little way back from loop of road skirted patch of open green a came in at front gate caught instant glimpse of pale face at upper window before must reach drawing room door miss claire peytral have met be young lady of singular beauty plain sign of violent grief anxiety very little obscured complexion of very delicate ivory tinge be scarcely marred by trace of sleeplessness tear be nevertheless clear to see eye be large black jetty hair have slight waviness be only distinct sign about her of remote blend of blood from inferior race oh mr hewitt cried be so glad have come at last have be waiting waiting so long poor mother be beginning to suspect have not told then will kill when know be sure kill on spot have only said that father be ill at at redfield oh what will do poor girl seemed on point of breakdown hewitt spoke sharply distinctly what must do be said must attend to tell want to know a accurately a tersely a can in case will do can if give way will cripple depends on remember be intimate friend mr brett who be good enough to offer to help now first think know head of case from newspaper more especially from coachman when sent for doubt have definite idea intention in mind what be oh be innocent mr hewitt be really only friend have in world only friend have steady steady hewitt said pressing kindly firmly into seat must keep steady know if be to do anything expected must be belief now tell why be so sure mr hewitt if knew must ask must never injure poor father went out after purely out of kindness because be uneasy must never hurt mr hewitt never never ca say strongly enough never must oh poor father now steady again cried hewitt more sharply still must see that feared hysterical breakdown might come at moment after lengthened suspense miss peytral have suffered listen now must frighten too much if mr bowmore be innocent say be so certain of then have doubt of finding way to prove if only will make best effort to help keep wit about a far a can see at present there be nothing against that need be afraid of if tackle properly of course police make arrest of sort by way of precaution in case like on merest hint come now say be uneasy when father went out after dinner on thursday night why know quite mr hewitt be mother be uneasy really about something never explained to father have taken to going out in evening after dinner just in way did on thursday night know why think have something to do with mother anxiety did dress for dinner not lately used to dress always have dropped of late hewitt paused for moment thoughtfully then said mr peytral be invalid know doubt none better for anxiety if must be managed must like to ask few question what do think miss peytral be altogether against mother be suffering from spinal complaint appeared with very serious nervous complication there be answering for result of smallest excitement never saw stranger if must possibly be avoided must be avoided now very well miss peytral will first go look at thing must see will do without mother help a long a possibly can now must answer few more question please question produced little more substantial information seemed to than have already received mr peytral have taken house in be sitting be called lodge simply two year ago before that family have lived in surrey have not moved direct from there there be journey to america between on business of mr peytral be on return voyage that have met mr percy bowmore mr bowmore have friend nearer than canada be reading for bar in very desultory way a gathered miss peytral childhood have be passed in west indie at town of san domingo in fact where father have be merchant mother have be helpless invalid ever since miss peytral must remember a to engagement with bowmore must seem to have have full approval of parent along rather curious change have come over father thought few month ago what be that have caused must not say grew nervous moody often absent minded sometimes even short tempered snappish thing have never known before also read daily paper with much care eagerness be plain that miss peytral have idea of cause might have led to quarrel between bowmore father hewitt most cunning question failed to elicit smallest suggestion of reason for occurrence ten day so ago mr peytral have returned from short walk after dinner very much agitated from day have made practice of going out immediately after dinner evening regularly walking off across paddock so away in direction of penn meadow first visit of percy bowmore after practice have begun be on thursday presence of visitor made difference a miss peytral have expected must her father rose abruptly after dinner went off a before time mr peytral who have be brought down to dinner displayed singular uneasiness about have experienced same feeling curiously enough on other occasion miss peytral remarked when husband have be unwell in difficulty even at considerable distance time feeling be so strong that begged bowmore to hurry after mr peytral accompany in walk young man have done returned alone after while saying simply that have lost sight of mr peytral whom have supposed might have come home by other way mentioning also that have be told that penn meadow barn be on fire when grew late mr peytral failed to return bowmore went out again made inquiry in direction grew necessary to concoct story to appease mr peytral who have be taken back to bedroom bowmore spent whole night in fruitless search inquiry then with morning came terrible news of discovery in burnt barn late in afternoon bowmore be arrested poor girl have great struggle to restrain feeling during conversation at close hewitt have to use tact to keep going physical exhaustion a well a mental trouble be against stimulus be needed so hewitt said now must try best if will keep up a well a have done little longer perhaps may have good news for soon must go at once examine thing first must like to have brought to single pair of boot shoe belonging to father send then go look after mother remember be helping time iii hewitt examined boot shoe with great rapidity with singularly quick eye for peculiarity liked light shoe said preferred to wear shoe rather than boot there be few boot not much worn although be living in country trod square on right foot inward on left wore left heel more than right be plain hated nail for be hand sewn with scarcely a much a peg visible in lot be laced boot shoe alike come be best worn pair be also pair of same sort maid tell must have be wearing since be missing low shoe laced will take with left house sought friend coachman pointed out quite clearly path by master have gone on last walk showed gate still fastened over have climbed to gain adjoining meadow put in way of finding small wood barn within without gate there be small patch bare of grass worn by foot here martin hewitt picked up trail at once ground have hardened since thursday night said so much better keep mark for do see what be here there be footmark certainly so beaten confused must make nothing of hewitt practised eye however read a might have read rather illegibly written letter here be right foot plain enough said carefully fitting shoe have brought in mark alighted on a came over gate half over be footmark bowmore expect for can see sign of others in direction going coming will know better presently rose followed irregular track across meadow like most such field track direction be plainly indicated by thin beaten grass with bare spot here there hewitt troubled to take more than glance at of spot a passed be needed meadow be bounded by hedge with stile at farther side of stile friend knelt again with sign of attention little piece of luck reported left shoe have picked up tiny piece of broken thorn twig just here see mark shoe be little soddened in sole by time thorn stuck hope stuck altogether if did may help wonderfully when get to barn for trouble there will be trampling round of people at fire so went on till reached edge of little wood field path skirted here hewitt dropped on knee set to work with great minuteness keep away from track brett warned may make worse police have be here see quite recently coming from direction of redfield here be two pair of unmistakable police boot heavy pair with doubt brought gamekeeper along with to have thing fully explained from corner of wood to point forty yard along path back to corner again then into wood hewitt went carefully examining inch of ground a did so then at last rejoined think gamekeeper have told truth said be pretty plain thanks to soft ground hereabout notwithstanding policeman boot here came together thorn twig stick to shoe still see here stopped mark face about bowmore step be retraced to corner of wood peytral turn again go on bowmore turn into edge of wood come along among tree see in grassy part quite a well a do expect there be will keep after peytral print bowmore come back in same track see next stile led to penn meadow meadow large one stretched over rather steep hump of land at other side of barn stood from stile two path must be discerned one rising straight over meadow in direction of barn other skirting to left parallel with hedge here footprint part hewitt observed musingly what doe mean manoeuvring what thought moment then went on will leave track for present see barn be straight ahead take when reached top of rise barn came in view blackened sinister wreck greater part of main structure be still standing even part of thatched roof still held place scorched broken off to right from where stood village roof be visible giving indication of position of road to redfield single human figure be in sight that of policeman on guard before barn now must get rid of excellent fellow said hewitt will be offering objection to examination want to make wonder if know name walked down to barn hewitt assuming largest possible air addressed policeman constable said be here officially here be card of course will know name if have have wide experience london experience especially be looking into case on behalf of miss peytral co operating with police of course where be inspector be rather stupid countryman policeman be visibly impressed even flurried by hewitt elaborate bumptiousness saluted tried to look unnaturally sagacious confessed that must exactly say where inspector be thing being put about so just now might be in throckham village more likely be at redfield ah hewitt replied with condescension now if be in village will oblige constable by telling that be here if be not there will return at once will be responsible here till come back be very long now man be taken by surprise possibly trifle doubtful hewitt be so extremely lofty so very peremptory official that inferior intelligence capitulated feebly presently after uneasy salute village policeman have vanished in direction of road moment have disappeared hewitt turned to ruined barn door be gone scorched charred lumber littered place have look of absolute ghostliness perhaps chiefly effect of imagination in knowledge of ghastly tragedy that place have witnessed well in from doorway be great scatter of light ash plainly pea straw that coachman have spoken of by ash partly among marked in odd manner on floor be horrible black shape shuddered to see a hewitt pointed out with moving forefinger made to trace figure of prostrate human form did never see that before in burnt house hewitt asked in hushed voice have more than once that sort of thing always leaf strange stain under like shadow business claimed martin hewitt stepped carefully within scarcely have done so when stood suddenly still with low whistle pointing toward something lying among dirt ash by foot of terrible shape see said disturb anything look crept in with care must command stooped place be filled with vast confusion of lumber cinder ash at first failed to see at what have so startled hewitt attention even when understood direction saw be about dozen little wire loop quarter of inch long le lying among little grey ash that clung about end of of loop in clot even a looked thing caught hewitt eye among straw ash there lay cinder of paper card near cinder smaller plainly of other substance hewitt took walking stick turned cinder over broke apart a did so from within two three little charred stick escaped hewitt snatched one up scrutinised closely do see tin ferrule said have be brush be box of colour pointed to cinder at foot that being so went on paper card be probably sketch book brett come outside bit there be something amazing here went outside hewitt faced with curious expression for life of must not understand suppose said that mr victor peytral be not dead after not dead gasped be know seems to hewitt pursued with eye still fixed on mine that know very little indeed of affair a yet body be unrecognisable very near remember what coachman said 'if be for mr peytral being missing ' said ' doubt if 'd have known be at think be exact word more must remember that body have not be seen by of peytral relative then protested if be body whose be ah indeed hewitt responded whose be see possibility of thing there be colour box sketch book burned who carried colour box sketch book not peytral must have heard of from daughter made particular point of father evening stroll being quite aimless so far a knowledge conjecture went knew nothing of sketching thing see what thing mean pointed toward place of little wire loop not at man see have be boot button when boot shrivelled thread be burnt button dropped off boot button be made of sort of composition burn to grey ash once fire really get hold of a may try time please can see ash still clinging to of shank there shank be lying in two group six six a fell now peytral came out in laced shoe if peytral be dead where be precisely rejoined hewitt with curious expression still in eye a say where be a said before who be dead man who be dead man where be peytral why have gone see possibility of case now light broke upon suddenly saw what hewitt meant here be possible explanation of whole thing peytral recent change of temper evening prowlings driving away of bowmore lastly of disappearance flight a now seemed probable be case have taken strange turn looked at one with meaning eye might be that hewitt begged by unhappy girl have just left to prove innocence of lover must by very act bring father to gallows poor girl hewitt murmured a stood staring at one better continued to believe dead a doe brett there be many good man must be disposed to fling proof away for girl sake mother seeing how little there can be to hurt bowmore justice must be done though blow fall a commonly doe on innocent guilty together see now have idea stay on guard while try hurried out toward farther side of broad band of trampled ground surrounded burnt barn began questing to fro way that receding farther from a went nearing horse pond road at last vanished altogether left alone with burnt barn thought dim shape on barn floor be broad day felt none too happy must not have be at anxious to keep police watch at night perhaps hewitt have be gone quarter of hour perhaps little more when saw again hurrying back beckoning to went to meet be right enough cried have come on trail again there be thorn mark by roadside at stile going to redfield probably to station come will follow up where be that fool of policeman oh muddle can make when really try need wait for asked yes better now with proof lying there must tell not to be bounced off again a bounced off there come heavy figure of local policeman be visible in distance shouted beckoned to hurry agility be part of policeman nature however beyond sudden agitation of head shoulder guessed to be caused by dignified spasm of leisurely haste saw apparent acceleration of pace a stood waited be aware of sound of wheel from direction of redfield a policeman neared from right so sound of wheel approached from left presently fly hove in sight sort of dusty vehicle that ply at rural railway station in country a caught sight of in road driver began waving whip in very singular excited manner a drew nearer still shouted though at first must not distinguish word by time policeman trotting ponderously be within few yard passenger in fly thin dark elderly man leaned over side to look ahead at with policeman pulled up with great gasp staggered into ditch ' e be cried fly driver regardless of angry remonstrance of fare ' e be e right ai 'im 'ere be shut mouth fool cried angry fare will stop making show of not cried eccentric cabman want fare sir be drivin ' 'ome for glory honour glory will make ' e be hewitt took in case in flash flabbergasted policeman excited cabman angry passenger sprang into road cried to cabman who pulled up suddenly before mr victor peytral believe said martin hewitt yes sir answered dark gentleman snappishly know there have be deal of trouble here mr peytral over absence from home a doubt have become aware be telegraphed for by daughter name be hewitt martin hewitt peytral face changed instantly know name well mr hewitt said there be matter who be friend mr brett who be good enough to help to day if may detain moment must like word with aside certainly mr peytral alighted two walked little apart saw hewitt talking pointing toward burnt barn well guessed what be saying be giving peytral warning of what have discovered in barn explaining that must give information to police asking if in circumstance peytral wished to go home to make other arrangement often hewitt duty to client duty a law upholding citizen between put in such delicate position there be hesitation in mr victor peytral plainly feared nothing be going home very well then heard hewitt say a turned towards perhaps have better go on slowly let friend cut across field first to break news brett knew must be useful sooner later so hurried off with happy though delicate mission to restore father lover to miss claire peytral iv miss peytral have to be put to bed under care of nurse for revulsion be very great so be physical prostration bowmore now set free in very pleasant young fellow came with hurried inquiry congratulation then rushed off to london to cable to friend in canada for fear of effect of newspaper telegram when at last hewitt sat with mr peytral in study mr hewitt said peytral be not sure how far explanation may go between there be more in death in barn than police will ever guess peytral be haggard drawn for a have let slip already have scarce slept hour since leaving home on thursday be tired said worn out be not novelty with be not sure may be of use to other did daughter tell why sent mr bowmore after on thursday night hewitt explained thing a briefly a possible just a have heard from miss peytral ah said peytral thoughtfully so thought manner became moody few month back did doubt for have memory more have apprehension mr hewitt think read in paper that be in way engaged in extraordinary case of murder of mr jacob mason be quite correct be there be case little while before possibly may not have heard of man be found strangled near york column by pall mall with just mark on forehead a be found on mr mason know that case too a well a other do know name of murderer think do speak in confidence of course a client professional man of course what be name have heard two everard myatt catherton hunt be real name doubt if anybody know twenty year ago more knew a mayes be jamaican mr hewitt that man foul life have be justly forfeit thousand time if belongs to anybody belongs to be terrible to see sudden fiery change in old man lassitude be gone in flash eye blazed nostril dilated for little while sat so mouth awork with passion then sank back in chair with sigh be getting old said more quietly perhaps be not strong enough to lose temper well a said mayes be jamaican renegade white do remember that in black rebellion of there be traitorous white man among negro eyre hanged few rebel rightly worst creature on island escaped probably escaped by aid of very white skin must have ensured greater punishment than rest escaped to hayti now have probably heard something of hayti of common state of affair there have heard indeed matter have be particularly brought to hewitt notice by case have told elsewhere a affair of tortoise a for have read sir spenser st john book on black republic have be greatly impressed by graphic picture give of horrible blood stained travesty of regular government there prevailing nothing in worst of south american republic be to be remotely compared to in worst period there be not crime imaginable must not be be not committed openly with impunity by anybody on right side of so called government government be nothing organised crime in well peytral pursued then need not expatiate on will understand sort of place that mayes fled to how suited be

be comparatively young man merchant at port au prince be bad place of course business be risky enough for very reason profit be large be attraction to sanguine young man like did very well have thought of getting out of with what have made be fatal thing to be supposed wealthy in port au prince unless be villain in power partner with one be be judged suitable victim by mayes not alone even only fortune gentleman gentleman poor wife who now lie peytral utterance failed rose a if choking hewitt rose to quiet never mind said sit quiet now understand rest moment old man sank back in chair for little while buried face in hand then went on need go into detail said huskily be enough to say that devilish engine of force cunning be put in operation against so came that at last on hint from hanger on of police office who have enough humanity in to remember kindness have experienced at hand that took flight in middle of night poor wife three child with nothing in world bare life clothes

mayes left island be told made for part of world year afterward heard of being in china though what truth there may have be in rumour can not say friend in san cristobel be cousin in fact put on leg again after while helped to begin business at san domingo under present name peytral in fact be mother maiden name there came sudden push in trade with united state about time went into affair with more energy to distract thought in fifteen year to cut long story short have made small competency have brought to england with with idea of peaceful end to life wife though doubt if be to have now doubt will tell why mr hewitt when went away without warning on thursday night be dogging mayes hewitt nodded with sign of surprise man killed in barn be one more of thousand crime without doubt though differs do know what drew attention to murder of men denson mason so set thinking in case murder be by strangulation medical evidence at inquest showed that be effected by mean of tourniquet in fact in second case tourniquet be left behind yes hewitt replied loosened unfortunately be too late well now peytral went on in hayti in time enemy have habit of dying suddenly in night by strangulation tourniquet be always instrument just a murder be quite popular procedure in accursed place so strangulation by tourniquet became for while most common form of crime be rapid effective silent see so that murder by tourniquet quite unknown thing in country took attention at once when followed so soon felt something like certainty triangle be suggestive too be mayes victim marked in way in hayti there be mark here mr peytral feature assumed curious expression there be thing be not believed in country be laughed at in fact called superstition know something of hayti therefore must have heard of voodoo witchcraft devil worship of west indie well mayes be a deep in a be in other specie of wickedness sound foolish perhaps here in civilised england may laugh tell that mayes must make men do a wished with consent against used thing be generally known that used thing marked with triangle red triangle by use of must bend men to will hewitt be listening intently with sign of laughter at notwithstanding client apprehension remembered case of mr jacob mason how victim have so fervently expressed wish to excellent clergyman mr potswood that have never dabbled in strange devilry of myatt mayes a be now learning to call at rate peytral resumed will understand that conjunction of tourniquet with red triangle in two case know of caused excitement daughter a have said noticed change in habit from time wife did more knew reason mr hewitt be older man there be hotter blood in vein than in yours father be english though might scarcely suppose mother to whose name have reverted be french creole so perhaps natural instinct come nearer to of savage ancestry than do yours whether not will understand know can tell that even now in cold blood for paroxysm have exhausted seems to that must be duty not to say sacred duty to tear man to piece with hand whenever wherever must put on old passion may have slept find be alive still found waking when realised that mayes be alive in england word 'insane be elastic in application doubt if must have called strictly sane of late evolved mad scheme for destruction of wretch be ready to devote everything possessed to purpose more than once contemplated coming to seeing that have met man in one of villainy with idea of enlisting aid reflected that must probably make party to plan of private revenge hesitated then then little more than week ago saw man changed without doubt not half a much changed a be nevertheless sure a be of now hesitated then for be here in meadow that know near barn thing seemed so likely to be illusion that almost suspected sens be dusk be walking talking with man good deal younger presently while be still confounded with surprise a passed behind clump of tree mayes be gone saw companion alone be young man artist must seem with sketch book colour started hewitt glanced at other peytral saw paused never mind said hewitt please go on after came out night in hope of seeing enemy again on several evening saw young artist waiting by barn expectantly nobody joined found that young man be lodging at cottage in village resolved not to lose sight of at last on thursday night saw mayes again mr bowmore be here when left house troubled much by coming after be obliged to tell wished to be alone be in nervously explosive state when did seemed reluctant to go anger blazed out violently ordered off from what have told seems that followed still lost sight of near penn meadow well be that a may saw mayes young artist again watched from rather awkward spot dusk be falling so that must not see passed presently be aware that mayes be making off by road alone followed from moment think really be mad though madness did not drive to attack at once have feeling of curiosity to see where must go curious cruel idea of letting run for little first a cat feel suppose with mouse may judge be not in normal state of mind from fact that through yesterday part of to day never a much a thought of telegraphing home to say that have gone to london for be to london followed took ticket at station got on platform by stealth entered train unobserved for one boy be only passenger feared attracting attention be easy enough in such station a redfield paid fare at london after lost lost in how like fool saw enter house waited followed again waited at might have flung into river from embankment refrained then whether began at dark corner in group of people can not tell suddenly discovered be following stranger stranger of about mayes form stature be what must have expected provided for in london street at night if have be mad be then be worst suppose by time must have be too late to get back home never thought of ran street whole night like fool hunting for mayes kept on day yesterday waited watched hour at two house have visited be not till early morning that flung on bed in private hotel in euston road slept little paroxysm be over perhaps be more fortunate than be disposed to think since be a yet in danger of trial for murder passionate wayward stricken man be plainly object of fascinated interest to hewitt friend waited moment then said house called at must like to know where lost sight of peytral sat back gazed thoughtfully for fully minute in hewitt face do know said at length think will answer question now 'd like to leave for day two yesterday must have told even on rack not word must have said 'take own chance get if can a for consider prey what scent have picked up will use ' mad fancy will think perhaps for question be be sanest then now will take day two to think v in le than day two identity of victim of burnt barn be established for hewitt have idea communicated with plummer of scotland yard man with buttoned boot sketch book be artist who have be staying at cottage in village who singularly enough have never be seen to draw have left drawing behind have warned people of cottage that might be away for night two have stayed away for two night before so that disappearance did not disturb when heard that mr peytral body have be found in barn accepted news a fact recognised at once photograph produced by plummer a of late lodger photograph have be procured from messrs kingsley bell dalton intended victim in bond case be one of henning vanished correspondence clerk that death must be convenient to mayes greater scoundrel be plain enough bond robbery have be brought to naught thanks to martin hewitt henning be now useless worse might be caught give up be thus perpetual danger probably wanted money being so be singular fact at inquest surgeon who have examined wound gave a most positive opinion that have be self inflicted be inflicted with razor henning own a be very clearly proved after inquiry for razor be found in barn by police entangled with blackened frame of old lantern here be still puzzle one to final revelation of mystery of red triangle gave answer a will be seen in due place case of admiralty code quick on heel of case of burnt barn followed next of red triangle affair indeed interval be barely two day mr victor peytral will be remembered have declined to reveal to hewitt address of two house in london have seen mayes visit desiring to think matter over for few day first before more must be heard from news of sort be brought by inspector plummer may give clue to period whereabout whole mystery of red triangle began to be cleared up if say at time of plummer visit country be on very verge of war with great european state be state with present relation of england be of friendliest description since dreaded collision be happily averted there be need to particularise in matter now especially a name of country with be at variance matter nothing a regard course of event be to relate though most reader will recognise at once when say that war have come to must have be naval war of great magnitude that during time of tension swift quiet preparation be going forward at naval depot movement disposition of fleet be arranged extended to remotest part of ocean be at height of excitement a have said two day after return of hewitt from throckham when case of burnt barn have be disposed of detective inspector plummer called be in hewitt office at time having in fact called in on way to learn if have heard more from mr victor peytral for a may be imagined be a eager to penetrate mystery of triangle a hewitt perhaps more so since hewitt be man inured to mystery have hardly have time to learn that peytral have not yet made up mind so far a to write when plummer pushed hurriedly into room excuse rushing in like said lad told that be mr brett who be with matter need hurry have heard more of fellow myatt hunt mayes name be last since barn murder of course have peytral given tip half promised hewitt shook head again brett have moment come to ask same question said have heard nothing must have said plummer emphatically do think will tell hewitt shook head again scarcely likely said be odd fellow mr peytral foreigner with revenge in blood have done daughter little service told private history seemed even then disposed to keep mayes to let nobody interfere with own vengeance will wire if like what be will tell said plummer pushing door close behind will tell in confidence of course because have seen more of mysterious rascal than have equally in confidence of course mr brett may hear too since be be in several of case already well of course know well enough that want creature mayes may a well call suppose now for three murder at least to say nothing of other thing be very well might have got with time now want for something else be such thing that must have at once else plummer pursed lip snapped finger significantly ca wait over mr hewitt have got to have man to day if can be done there be more than ordinary depending on be country time admiralty telegraphic code have be stolen by mayes plummer shrugged shoulder be to be proved said be seen leaving office at about time loss occurred be enough to set after there be not clue of sort mr hewitt wish be in official service hewitt smiled flatter said a have done before why in case particularly be case altogether out of ordinary one of string of such of have at finger end mind confessing that man mayes be little too big handful for one for at rate wish must work with over in fact in special circumstance have good mind to ask to have retained a exceptional measure thing urgent there be red tape hewitt have taken glance at desk tablet now flung down will do for love said if necessary appointment list be uncommonly slack just now even if be 'd make considerable sacrifice rather than be out of fellow mayes be dangerous man feel point of honour that will not continue to escape moreover have begun to form certain theory a to red triangle there be at back of theory must rather keep to myself till see little more since a stand may only strike a fantastic if be wrong may lead of off track be theory wish to test to end so be with plummer if will allow can make official application for special retainer not just a please plummer be plainly delighted most certainly will said will give head of case will come to admiralty see for think said hewitt first will send telegram to peytral then can give head of case a go along will look at place for be in case heart soul pay pay expect friend brett must like to be in too be there objection well plummer answered little doubtfully be glad of outside help of course be not sure officially of course be always glad of outside help hewitt interrupted in case may possibly find brett more useful than think consider now have seen good deal of case quite a much a in fact be only one of three of whom mayes doe not know by sight remember mayes saw in affair of mr jacob mason saw again in case of lever key escaped in fact because instantly recognised will answer for brett discretion be sure will be glad to help even if for official reason may not find possible to admit wholly into counsel of course willingly assented condition understood plummer offered further objection hewitt despatched telegram in very few minute be in cab on way to admiralty be way of plummer said will remember that when lost mayes at end of lever key case be waiting for in city office with assistant that only saw for instant in lift well that assistant be very intelligent man of mine named corder fellow with wonderful memory for face now corder be on case just now 'd put on dressed like loafer to hang about whitehall neighbourhood watching for one want well morning there came urgent message to yard from admiralty to ask for responsible official at once be sent a came along saw corder lounging about of course took notice must not do for people from yard to recognise other too readily in street corder came up made pretence to ask for match to light pipe under cover of that told that have seen mayes not hour before coming out of admiralty at of course pricked up ear did know what wanted for if there be mischief that fellow have be there be likely at least that might have be in corder be quite positive that be man although have only seen for moment in lift have seen go into admiralty office be passing a came out noted time exactly so that might report to at first opportunity time be mayes jumped into hansom drove off walked right out into middle of road to stop hansom know how wide road be there so that corder must hear direction to cabman took number a cab went off corder ought to have collared then there think be in difficult position must have endangered case be on be very important besides did realise how much wanted for having only be brought in a assistant at tail of bond case still le did guess more than be going to hear at admiralty office at rate interrupted hewitt have got number of cab here be plummer answered have already set man to get hold of cabman 'd better note number hewitt duly noted number advised to do same in case must chance to meet cab during afternoon a neared destination plummer gave rest of case in outline in office said found in great state copy of code cypher in confidential order other message be sent to fleet over world in report message be sent back have disappeared during morning be in charge of mr robert telfer clerk of responsibility undoubted integrity kept in small iron safe be let into wall of private room be safe when arrived in morning immediately used in order to code telegram locked in safe again at two hour later at went to safe for again in order to de code message just received be gone lock of safe be one must take hour to pick must judge there be shade of clue so far a can see except circumstance of mayes being seen leaving by corder just between telfer two visit to safe perceive of course there may be nothing in except for character of man be there be to go on a far a can see need tell how important thing be at time like how much must be paid for secret code by certain foreign government have made hurried arrangement to have certain place watched a soon a have taken to office must rush off make few more arrangement still here be mr robert telfer room be at side of long gloomy corridor on upper floor door be distinguished merely by number word private painted thereon found telfer sitting alone plainly in state of great nervous tension be man of forty thereabout thin alert using single eye glass plummer introduced by name rapidly explained business told name of party be after mr telfer plummer said went straight to mr martin hewitt a being most likely to have information of mr hewitt whose name know already of course be kind enough seeing be in bad pinch pushed for time to come in give help can both friend mr brett know good deal of doings of person be after assistance be likely to be of very greatest value do mind giving mr hewitt information may ask must rush over to yard to put other inquiry on foot to set observation two will be back presently certainly mr telfer answered be only too anxious to give information so long a be nothing departmentally forbidden will help to put horrible matter right please ask anything be patient if answer be not very clear have be much overworked lately a may imagine have have very little sleep now terrible misfortune have upset completely for of course be held responsible for copy of code if be recovered quickly be ruined to say nothing of course of far more serious consequence in other direction be safe in be kept presume hewitt said indicating small one let into wall may examine certainly mr telfer turned produced key from pocket code be here lying on shelf when needed morning at ten took out used returned to same place exactly locked safe door then took draft of telegram together with copy in cypher into controller room gave into safe hand returned here hewitt narrowly examined lock of safe with pocket lens there be sign of lock having be picked said even if be possible a matter of fact be lock must take day to pick even with heavy bag of tool think be way of have doubt about locking safe door at suppose before went to controller room possible doubt see left whole bunch of key hanging in lock while coded telegram be short one be soon done then returned code to place locked safe then used key on bunch to lock drawer in desk have occasion to go to safe again till about when controller secretary came here with telegram to be de coded safe be still locked then when be opened code be gone have have occasion to go to safe in meantime none at locked at unlocked two hour later be be not in room whole of time of course oh have told that at went to controller room after went out two three time on one occasion time locked door of room oh did be important took key with presume yes key on bunch took in pocket of course room door key also took there be one two rather important paper on desk see anybody from corridor might come in if door be left unlocked lock of door must be good deal easier to pick than of safe hewitt observed after examining must be of great use with safe locked shortly then fact be locked code safely away at left room two three time time door a well a safe be locked key in pocket then at two hour exactly after code have be put safely away opened safe again in presence of controller secretary code have vanished be whole matter in brief take precisely mr telfer be pallid bewildered seems total impossibility said total absolute physical impossibility there be a such thing a physical impossibility ever happens hewitt replied calmly must look further now be there other way into room than by door into corridor see door here what be that door have be locked for age room on other side be one like with door in corridor be used chiefly to store old document of great importance believe that whole stack of in bundle be piled against other side of same door will send for key see if like key be sent for door from corridor opened a telfer have led to expect place be full of old paper in bundle parcel thick with ancient dust thing be piled high against door next room plainly have not be disturbed for month even year there remains skylight said hewitt for perceive mr telfer that room be lighted from above have window while grate be register there seems to be opening in skylight revolving ventilator be right quite so there be getting in by skylight without breaking a see have not be broken certainly there be men on roof repairing lead be plain enough that nobody have come that way thing be wholly inexplicable at present yes hewitt said musingly stood for few moment in deep thought plummer be longer away than expected said presently by way be external appearance of missing code be nothing sort of thin manuscript book made of few sheet of foolscap size sewn in cover of thickish grey paper left in safe doubled lengthwise tied with tape in middle loss be very serious thing of course oh terribly terribly serious mr hewitt telfer replied despairingly be responsible will put end to career of course consequence to country be more important may be disastrous enormously so great sum must be paid for code on continent need hardly say now that know be taken surely code can be changed be not so easy a seems mr hewitt telfer answered shaking head mean time need tell that with affair in present state ca afford one moment of time expedient be being attempted of course will understand that new code must have to be arranged with scattered item of fleet in part of world probably with present code in hand of enemy moreover message already sent will be accessible with very little trouble contain strategical coaling storing disposition for great war mr hewitt ca ca be altered at moment notice oh be terrible here be inspector plummer news suppose mr plummer well plummer answered deliberately ca say have news for mr telfer just yet want to talk about few thing to mr hewitt have better go see if telegram be answered mr hewitt unless have heard have hewitt replied will go on at once good day for present mr telfer hope to bring good news when next see hope so too mr hewitt most fervently telfer answered look confirmed word walked in silence through corridor down stair out by gate into street then plummer turned on heel faced hewitt that man be wrong 'un said abruptly jerking thumb in direction of office have just left will tell about in cab a soon a cab be started on way back to hewitt office plummer explained be be watched said have mr telfer when did know will be watched again for rest of to day a have arranged what be more wo be allowed to leave office evening till have seen again sent message need to frighten too soon might suit be in alone in company how do know will tell seems lead roof be being repaired at admiralty plumber be walking about where like now need tell have have man two fishing about among doorkeeper so on at admiralty one of found plumber knew slightly working on roof that plumber happens to be fool bit smarter than detective constable seems to in fact anyhow seems to have got more out of man than man got out of soon after reached yard turned up asking to see said 'd heard that valuable paper be missing did know what from room with skylight in top floor where gentleman with single eye glass be where safe be let in wall wanted to know what must be reward for anybody giving information about of course must make promise gave to understand that must have to leave amount of reward to authority if information be worth anything also that be getting to work fast that if wished to be first to give information 'd better be quick about promised to make special report of name what have to say if be useful will be be vastly mistaken for just see here friend mr telfer say put that code safely away at in safe that never went to safe again till when controller secretary be with never went to for anything observe well plumber happened to be near skylight at half past eleven be prepared to swear that saw mr telfer gent with eye glass a call go to safe unlock take out grey paper folded lengthwise with red tape round re lock safe carry that paper out into corridor plumber be kneeling by brazier seems be close by skylight be so certain of time because be regulating watch by westminster hall clock compared when half hour struck be just while telfer be absent in corridor with paper be only gone second two will remember that corder saw mayes leaving premise within two minute of time yes well telfer be back in second two without paper went on with affair a before be pretty striking eh yes hewitt answered thoughtfully be be sort of shot in dark on part of plumber for knew nothing else nothing about telfer legitimately having key of safe of particular have be told merely knew that paper be missing having seen paper taken out of safe got into head that have possibly witnessed theft kept knowledge to till must see somebody in authority mighty keen too about reward now be having telfer supervised be not that be likely to get code from be passed out sure enough in mayes hand else pocket to confident expression of opinion hewitt offered reply presently alighted at office eager to learn if peytral have given information hewitt so much desired sure enough telegram be there ran thus on night know of mayes went first to raven street blackfriar then to norbury row barbican message follows now be at work hewitt said briskly for while part will make few change of dress go to take look at raven street blackfriar will two go on to norbury row will have to be careful plummer not show be where brett will be useful since be known if anybody be to be seen let be will be very careful though will have little disguise fancy will not be so likely to be seen a be to do asked well of course if see mayes in open grab instantly need tell plummer think plummer must naturally seize on spot rush off to nearest station go back with enough men to clear out norbury row if see will keep observation according to plummer discretion unless exceptional chance occurs hope wo go rushing in till communicate with other must work together may have news instinct seems to tell that yours be right end of stick at barbican must neglect nothing be why want to hold on there while make necessary examination at other end do know norbury row plummer think know street alley in city plummer answered there be very good publican at corner of norbury row who be be useful to police score of time keep eye open will be surprised if ca give information about anyhow moon name house be 'the compass will go there first if have message to send send through will tell on stair plummer encountered of assistant have got cab sir reported waiting outside now took up fare in whitehall opposite admiralty drove to charterhouse street got down just by meat market be man seems to know plummer questioned cabman found that a matter of fact be did know so telling to wait to take little journey returned reported information to hewitt just a expected said quietly stopped cab bit short of destination of course just a will doubt there be not great deal in evidence confirms idea ii followed be example by stopping cab in charterhouse street walking short remaining distance to barbican norbury row be obscure street behind at corner of stood compass public house plummer have mentioned did not venture to show in norbury row hastened into nearest door of compass chanced to be that of private bar stout red faced slow moving man with one eye black patch stood behind bar plummer lifted finger pointed quickly toward bar parlour at signal one eyed man turned with great deliberation pulled catch released door of apartment close at elbow stepped quickly within presently one eyed man came rolling in by other door well good art'noon mr plummer sir said with long intonation wheeze good art'noon sir have bin stranger lately good afternoon mr moon plummer answered briskly have come for little information friend be sure will give if can all year have be knowed to police answered mr moon slower wheezier a went on have allus give information must ' be fact ai mr plummer yes of course forget what want now allus tell what ever know rumbled mr moon turning to allus ' glad to do too 'cause why ai police very well then tell allus tell plummer waited patiently while mr moon stared solemnly at after speech then when patch slowly turned in direction eye in resumed want to know if know anything about norbury row number eight mr moon mused gazing abstractedly out of window num ber eight ground floor stevens packing case maker first floor hutt agent in fancy good second floor dunno name o ' richardson bookbinder on door be bin there five six year now ai same tenant richardson dead one bind book a can see even remember seein ' very often tallish darkish sort o gent be seem to have many visitor well then there be top floor s'pose be same tenant richardson used to have for workshop be have got window can watch from mr moon turned ponderously round without word led way to first floor puffing enormously on stair can see from club room said at length 'ere little place be better pushed open door entered small sitting room be place said pointing there be new packing case standing outside now norbury row presented appearance common enough in part of city little way removed from centre street of house once have sheltered well to do resident have gradually sunk in world to condition of tenement house now be on upward grade again being let in floor to smaller sort of manufacturer to such agent small commercial men a required cheap office be much like rest packing case maker have ground floor a moon have said token of trade in shape of new packing case stood on pavement rest of building showed nothing distinctive there y'be gent said mr moon if want to watch be welcome bein ' p'lice allus doe best for allus will have to excuse now 'cos o ' bar mr moon stumped off downstairs leaving plummer watching at window friend publican seems very proud of helping police remarked plummer laughed yes said at rate be anxious sha forget see be in way matter of mutual accommodation make thing a easy a possible for on licensing day a have pretty extensive acquaintance among sort of people often want to get hold of have be able to show gratitude very handsomely once twice house on eye be fixed be little too far up street for to see perfectly through window of second floor though must see enough to indicate that be furnished a office agreed that unknown second floor tenant be more likely to be customer connected with than of others still much desired nearer view presently since coast seemed clear plummer announced intention of taking one left at post of observation presently saw lounging along on other side of way keeping close to house so a to escape observation from upper window took good look at name on door post of presently stepped within waited five six minute then saw returning a have come be top floor want said when rejoined in mr moon sitting room packing case maker be genuine enough very busy so be fancy good agent went in seeing door wide open found agent little shop walkery sort of chap hard at work with clerk among pile of cardboard box must go further in case be spotted do think 'd be cool enough to do without arousing suspicion mayes doe know see what do think want to precipitate matter till hear from hewitt on other hand want to sit still a long a anything can be ascertained might ask question about book binding of course said if will let will go at once glad of chance to get peep will bespeak quotation for binding lettering thousand octavo in paste grain on behalf of convenient firm of publisher must be technical enough think took hat walked out a plummer have done though of course approached door of with le caution packing case maker men be hammering away merrily a mounted stair saw little fancy good agent among cardboard box just a plummer have said upper part of house be silent contrast to busy lower floor a arrived at next landing be surprised to see door ajar pushed boldly in found alone in good sized room plainly fitted a office there be two window looking on street one at back more than half concealed behind ground glass partition screen stepped across looked out of window looked on narrow space well of plain brick wall containing nothing ladder standing in one corner only other window giving on narrow square space be in opposite wall much lower on ground level saw thing in single glance then turned to find face to face with tallish thin active man with pale shaven ascetic face dark hair astonishingly quick glittering black eye stood just within office door to must have come without sound looking at with mechanical smile of inquiry while eye searched with portentous keenness oh said with best assumption of carelessness must command be looking for mr richardson do care to give quotation for binding at per thousand crown octavo volume in paste grain plain with lettering on back answered man with eye be afraid carelessness have led into mistake be not richardson bookbinder be predecessor in office have neglected to paint out name on door post hastened to apologise be sorry to have intruded said found door ajar so came in see publishing season be beginning regular binder be full of work so that have to look elsewhere good day good day keen man responded turning to allow to pas through door be sorry can not be of service to on occasion from first to last eye have never ceased to search now a descended stair must feel that be fixed on still took turn about house in order not to be observed going direct to compass entered that house by way of private bar a before be mayes other said plummer when have made report described man with eye have seen twice once with beard once without question now be whether have best sail in straight away collar there be window at back ladder think said can reach think might easily perhaps there be roof since be got top floor too not good enough without men to surround house must go gingerly over one thing to find out be what be building behind ah how wish mr hewitt be here now if hear from soon must send message must lose sight of for moment there be thump at sitting room door mr moon came puffing in shouldered confidentially against plummer bloke downstairs want to see said in hoarse grunt be meant for low whisper twigged outside think ' say be got somethink partickler to tell yer believe ' e 'nark see with one o ' chap other day will go plummer said to hurriedly plainly somebody spotted in street may a well hear knew very well of course what moon meant by 'nark 'nark ' be informer spy among criminal who sell police information can scrape up must be possible that man have anything to tell about mayes be scarcely likely made up mind that plummer be merely being detained by tale of petty local crime in few minute returned with news of import fellow be most valuable said know lot about mayes whom of course call by name identity certain saw looking in at say guessed must be after seems to have wondered at mayes mysterious movement for long time so kept eye on made inquiry seems that mayes sometimes us back way through window saw on opposite side of little area by way of ladder mentioned be quite plain fellow know something from particular about ladder want sovereign to show way through stable passage behind point out where man can be trapped to certainty will be cheap ten shillingsworth must waste time if hewitt come tell not to move till come back send message can easily do by chap be going with be sure to keep eye on front door of while be gone thing have begun to grow exciting fascination of pursuit took full possession of imagination saw plummer pas across end of street in company with shuffling out at elbow looking man with dirty brown whisker set to watch door of staircase by packing case maker with redoubled attention hoping fervently that mayes might emerge so give opportunity of capping extraordinary series of occurrence connected with red triangle by seizing handing over to police so waited watched for something near quarter of hour then there came thump at door once more beheld mr moon man askin ' for in bar sir said asking for asked little astonished by name mr brett ' e said sir be same chap know be got message from inspector plummer ' e say may come up here asked mindful of maintaining watch certainly sir if like will bring presently shuffling man with dirty whisker presented be shifty villainous looking fellow of middle height looking nark over pulled off cap delivered message in rum scented whisper inspector plummer say front way matter now said ' e can cop 'im other way if will go round to at once if mr martin hewitt here ' e 'd rather 'ave 'im on ' one to come now naturally thought plummer must prefer hewitt in case must for once be ahead of friend have pleasure of relating circumstance of capture to instead of listening a usual to own quiet explanation of manner in case have be brought to successful issue so took hat went best let go in front whispered nark bein ' toff might be noticed be reasonable precaution followed accordingly went little way down barbican presently taking very narrow turning plunged into cluster of alley through however must plainly perceive that way lay in direction of back of house in norbury row at length guide stopped at what seemed stable yard pushed open wicket gate went in keeping gate open for to follow be indeed stable yard littered with much straw nark carefully picked to walk on a noiselessly a possible motioning to do same be small enough yard dark when guide very carefully opened door of stable saw that be darker still pushed door wide so a to let little light fall on door now perceived in brick wall formed side of stable after listening intently for moment at door guide stepped back favoured with puff of rum whisper there be light in there passage said ' 'd better not strike one will catch hold of hand pulled stable door to took by hand heard inner door open quietly stepped cautiously forward have gone five six yard in darkness when felt something cold wrist of hand by be being led there be loud click hand be dropped felt wrist held fast while must hear late guide shuffling away in darkness must not guess whether to cry out remain quiet called after man in loud whisper got answer used other hand to feel at right wrist found that be clipped in one of pair of handcuff other being locked in staple in wall tugged hardest to loosen staple held firm thing have be so sudden stealthy that scarce have time to realise be in serious danger that doubtless plummer have preceded when light appeared at angle ahead turned corner perceived coming toward carrying lamp pale man of eye whom have encountered not hour before in word mayes eye searched still approached with curiously polite smile mr brett said name be not richardson be not bookbinder not that be particular about thing a name for have heard of under more than one already be quite at liberty to call richardson if like be sorry to have to talk to in uncomfortable place circumstance be exceptional at least must give chair stepped back little way pressed bell button presently fellow who have decoyed there appeared mayes ordered to bring chair at once did with stolid obedience sat in so that wrist rested at somewhere near level of shoulder mr brett mayes pursued when man be gone be not so implacable person a perhaps believe in fact can assure that disposition be most friendly then unfasten handcuff said be sorry that be little precaution find necessary to take till understand other better be glad to see mr brett though be sure will not think rude if say must have preferred mr martin hewitt in place perhaps turn will come later have proposition to make mr brett must like to join to join exactly nodded pleasantly need shrink sha ask to do

contempt be mere vulgar tool will have reward if be faithful of course if not well remember denson in samuel diamond business be not faithful there be end of may tell that denson be made example for one be needed assigned certain operation having brought to success endeavoured to embezzle did embezzle proceeds be made conspicuous example in most conspicuous public place to impress others did know knew well enough what red triangle meant ah excellent recruit for so count already there be more in little sign than can imagine be more than sign be implement of very potent power will learn whole secret in little form of initiation spoke of see now present example telfer admiralty clerk gave up that document at mere spoken word will deny to dying day will be ruined for act gave paper at mere order if be one of own if have passed through initiation offer must have protected a be must take punishment though be only who will benefit will still deny fact have mr brett do begin to perceive boast when tell of power beyond understanding truly be amazed though must not half understand circumstance of loss of admiralty code have be so inexplicable now incredible suggestion of prime actor in

little till can trust will be very soon if not well mr brett wish to be a friendly a please having be at trouble of catching having got here safely who know so much now who must be so dangerous if ever got away eh well know method have seen exemplified will understand there be anger in voice a uttered threat even thought in eye what there be be worse be sure will not make thing unpleasant concluded will go through little form have arranged if only for curiosity just think over for moment while go to close little office took lamp turned away a reached angle of passage there came sound that checked step must hear noise of foot hurried voice then suddenly arose shout in voice seemed to be plummer here cried help way hewitt brett shouted back at top of voice wondering where plummer be what might mean with mayes turned saw that be about to make for door have entered by resolved must not pas if must prevent sprang up seized chair in left hand shouting aloud for help a did so mayes came with bound flung lighted lamp full at head struck chair smashed to thousand piece in instant of time mayes be on plainly have weapon must have used be at disadvantage enough with right wrist chained to wall clung with might endeavoured to swing enemy round against wall in order might clasp hand about shouted loudest a did chair broken glass hampered mayes be desperate agony in right wrist be unbearable just a be conscious of rush of approaching foot heavy blow took full in face felt mayes rush over while fell hung from wrist have stunned sense of light voice general confusion then remembered nothing iii came to myself on floor of lighted room with hewitt face over mine wrist seemed broken though be free there be oil blood on clothes in left hand still gripped piece of mayes coat stop cried be gone by stable have got good brett hewitt answered soberly did best be gone peytral after peytral yes brought own message to town see if can stand up be well enough able to do indeed have only fainted from pain of strain on wrist several policeman be in room beside hewitt plummer mayes stronghold be in hand of enemy then suddenly remembered admiralty code cried be in office desk have got hewitt answered come plummer up ladder little time be lost in forcing mayes desk there document be found grey cover red tape intact police be left to make vigorous search for possible copy original be handed to plummer a chief representative of law present have be trapped precisely a have be except that have be led further shut in cellar a well a fastened by wrist mayes seemed have wasted very little time in attempting to pervert have doubt that fate might have be reserved for plummer must never have left place alive have not be for timely irruption of hewitt with peytral police in hour peytral returned have dashed out in chase of fugitive failed even to see lost wholly in court in fact for little while persevered found useless dirty whiskered man made attempt to escape though there be talk of man having got away in confusion by way of stable roof police be left in charge of place deferred complete exploration till next day hewitt tale be simple enough have endued in somewhat seedy clothes have visited raven street blackfriar found to be merely tenement house took time to make inquiry there with necessary caution because of number of lodger then inquiry led to nothing be experience common enough in practice none le annoying delay when returned to office found mr peytral already awaiting peytral described following of mayes at much greater length detail than before hewitt have come on to norbury row at once asked news of mr moon mr moon description of successive disappearance of plummer of continued absence so aroused hewitt suspicion that instantly procured help from nearest station approached door of mayes office knock being unanswered door be instantly broken in room be found to be unoccupied ladder be still standing at open window by mayes have descended to back premise down ladder hewitt went with police after rest have seen what said what be mystery why did telfer give up code what be power that mayes talk of be power replied hewitt have suspected for time now be quite sure of secret dangerous terrible power have encountered before though never before have known possibility carried so far be hypnotism hypnotism exclaimed can person be hypnotised against will in sense in most case can not be explanation of mayes proposal to to go through 'form of initiation if have consented 'form must have be process of hypnotism once twice repeated must have be wholly under control so that if willed forbade must tell nothing of what wished kept secret must have committed crime might suggest consider poor jacob mason remember how struggled to tell what knew oppressed by horror of how ended remember henning clerk mayes tool in case of bond robbery what have happened to committed suicide a know immediately after mayes have left at barn brett power of hypnotism power for healing in hand of good man may become terrible power for evil in hand of villain telfer to day seems to have known nothing of mayes be not one of regular creature mayes told so about know expect will find that have be willingly hypnotised at time perhaps more than once by same scoundrel mayes possibly in one of mayes appearance in respectable society at evening party like in case of sort hypnotist may impress certain formula word name number on subject mind by repetition of at future time same subject may be instantly hypnotised so that once having become hypnotised on innocent occasion subject be in power of hypnotist more le ever after hypnotist say repeat such such sentence number to in future will be hypnotised hypnotised subject duly be instantly supposing such case in matter of mr telfer must only be necessary for mayes to meet in corridor repeat formula command victim to bring out paper specified done must similarly order to forget whole transaction victim must do infallibly be only necessary to say here parenthetically that later inquiry proved truth of hewitt supposition twice three time mr telfer have be hypnotised in friend chamber by plausible tall man whose acquaintance host have made at public scientific gathering in end became possible to identify man with mayes mr moon of compass be of great comfort to that evening cut bruise be washed in house inner man revived with food drink allus glad to oblige p'lice said mr moon allus why ai p'lice very well then adventure of channel marsh mayes stronghold be taken mayes have escaped once again cage be in hand bird have flown martin hewitt however have plan a be soon to show recovery of admiralty code be good stroke be satisfactory ending to important case even capture of curious premise behind barbican made halting place in pursuit of mayes a soon a be in degree recovered from struggle captured place have be hastily searched chase be resumed without moment delay that adventure be entered upon saw end of red triangle unholy doings came terribly near to seeing end of hewitt in fact have not described den near barbican with great particularity have said that office accessible from open street be only connected with hidden premise behind premise a be afterwards discovered held under separate tenancy by easily shifted ladder be in hidden premise approached by maze of court stable yard that main evidence of mayes way of life be observable passage where wrist have be locked to wall room cellar in plummer have be confined be only part of lower premise fitted for detention of prisoner with exception of one very low wholly unlighted cellar entered by trapdoor very steep flight of brick step place smelt horribly faint stagnant produced on mind then when examined later effect of horror repulsion more than must be accounted for by smell alone of history nothing be discovered perhaps feeling though others experienced a well a myself be effect of mere fancy have never got rid of conviction that black cellar rather pit for be very narrow have be instrument of crime never to be told there be one two room sparely furnished one a bedroom larger room with long table sofa several chair in one of smaller room be found stove ladle crucible for melting down of metal gold silver be in same room also that table stood in drawer of be found paper letter formula thing giving more than hint of use to mayes have put friendship with mr jacob mason for of possible manner detail in science more particularly science of chemistry must aid in commission of crime there be note in same drawer most of thing be observed in detail later thing set once more on trail of mayes very night very hour be found in isolated office facing street be cheque book quite full of unused cheque cheque book said hewitt to inspector plummer be in drawer below in discovered admiralty code eastern consolidated be bank a see upper holloway branch now must follow at once before waiting to search further there may be something more important a clue there may not at rate while be looking for be losing time may bring to at once mean that may have address in holloway suggested plummer may get from bank there be possibility hewitt answered have have to bolt without warning preparation with nothing clothes ran in probably very little money money will want at once must rather not wait till morning to get if can get at once will mean thirteen fourteen hour start at least more will know very well that place will be searched that cheque book will be discovered soon enough consequently bank will be watched be what will do what be doing now very likely will knock up resident manager of bank try to get cheque cashed to night think that can be done in case will probably try to make arrangement to have money sent way must be at upper holloway branch of eastern consolidated bank a soon a hansom can get there thus be settled hewitt plummer went off at once leaving plummer men with city police in charge of raided premise leaving of also to make inquiry in neighbourhood mr victor peytral have shown anxious to accompany hewitt plummer have be dissuaded by hewitt guessed that hewitt feared that hasty indiscretion on part of terribly wronged man might endanger plan peytral however seemed tractable enough left immediately after have business said expected must occupy for day two when be completed must see again a for only remained long enough to ascertain that police must find trace of direction of mayes flight in immediate neighbourhood have little to aid have gone without hat dress be in degree disordered by struggle with latter defect might easily have remedied in court a ran must gather tidings of hatless man so took way to office wrist growing stiffer more painful a went so be not sorry to arrange for member of staff to take duty for night to get to bed few hour earlier than usual after day fatigue excitement ii going to bed uncommonly soon woke correspondingly early in morning be earlier than hewitt who be at door in fact ere breakfast be well begun well asked eagerly almost before friend have entered have got at last not yet hewitt answered did exactly a have expected plummer knocked up bank manager who life over premise at upper holloway branch be very decent fellow rather young for post be naturally bit surprised possibly irritated at being bothered by one after office hour showed cheque book asked if belonged to customer of 'why yes said examining number remember because be first of new series issued day before yesterday to new customer where did get ' 'we be very anxious to see that customer ' said 'have be here evening ' manager seemed trifle surprised answered readily enough 'yes said 'he be here not hour ago ' 'wanting to draw money ' asked that manager must tell of course so that be necessary for plummer to step in reveal fact that be police matter that be detective inspector made difference manager told that man have opened account at bank only two day before 'd like to guess what name have opened under not myatt said after chase not myatt catherton hunt catherton hunt have opened in name of mayes what actual name actual original name according to peytral account be transferred must seem from bank have idea may find that have be shifting money about from one bank to a safety suggested using real name with remember must find trace of banking account when police raided ransacked calton lodge after mason be killed quite probably have have small current account in other name at various time to aid in scheme main account have always stood in real name by see get confirmation of peytral story well a say account be opened in name of mayes cheque book be issued discovered last night upper holloway branch saw more of customer till yesterday evening long after hour when drove up in hansom oh said in hansom be men left behind must get news of yes ascertained that last night called back of course last thing expect got first cab visible drove off to hatter fair distance away then on to bank at rate knocked up manager told that have sudden need for money very night must have manager told must be impossible even if have be willing to do against regulation must still be impossible for strong room cash receptacle in be locked with two separate lock with different key though have one of key be useless without other be in possession of second in command who lived distance out of london course be usual precaution adopted in branch bank of sort opening closing morning evening have to be done by chief assistant together tell brett believe that be only being informed of fact that prevented mayes from trying of hypnotic trick on bank manager in case there must have be big bank robbery perhaps something worse in addition murder murder with tourniquet perhaps perhaps with other weapon at rate probably with red triangle know of course indeed told think that in most case not be necessary to get subject consent to first exercise of hypnotism on told also be possible for practised hypnotist while subject be under influence of first experiment to suggest to certain word formula even silent sign will bring under influence at other time whenever hypnotist chooses to repeat just a must have be done with mr telfer in case of admiralty code first suggestion must not be difficult thing might seem must only require little time persuasion nothing must be said about hypnotism of course perhaps something about little physical experiment like then in moment two subject must be in creature power for ever remember little 'ceremony of initiation that scoundrel attempted to persuade to submit to meant hypnotism perhaps death be mere speculation mayes found that key on premise be not enough to release money even if strict rule of bank have permitted cashing of cheque out of hour manager suggested that perhaps neighbouring tradesman must exchange cash for cheque with view of obliging new customer went with a far a shop of mr isaac trenaman grocer cheesemonger with rather large shop at corner of road mr trenaman introduced assured by manager be willing to give a much cash a must find in till against mr mayes cheque did so to extent of twenty seven pound cheque for sum be duly drawn on one of tradesman own cheque form left with done bank new customer took off with thanks apology carrying with however two blank cheque form from mr trenaman book penny for punctiliously paid over counter having cheque form with explained might find useful if must come across friend who must provide cash wished to use night having completed business so far charming new customer of bank made off into night be that know of movement yes a yet seems to have made very definite excuse to manager for wanting money in such hurry just said something have occurred made cash necessary be very polite apologetic generally manager formed notion that must be for gambling purpose fancied that mayes said something distantly alluding to be sure did ask about address given to bank of course there gained nothing manager must remember exactly book of course be locked up know already for what manager must remember be that be office address somewhere near barbican so that be back at barbican den again where be going now with plummer to give day to minute investigation of whole place meanwhile watch be being set at bank in holloway do expect back there then hardly see know that by time must have found cheque book will be on watch there be just chance very remote one that may send message perhaps send somebody to cash cheque though expect for be fool be indeed sort of genius must be mistake think still be bold be where money be may make dash at so couple of plummer men be to be waiting there morning in manager office if anybody come from mayes will be detained perhaps must like to be with ca be of much use with job will be dull there may have chance of excitement will be useful to come report if anything doe happen why may even bag mayes of course will go anywhere please told last night suppose that peytral have business have gone off yes be not sorry be too dangerous man to have about with hot blood terrible injury keep in memory a likely a not if get mayes must next have to collar peytral for shooting something so be not sorry be out of for bit can start now plummer be in office two men be in cab outside bank open at nine be in upper holloway seized hat made ready must keep eye open hewitt hinted before get to bank when leave a well a while be there do remember how poor mason be watched well there be probably watching going on now last night on way to bank back believe plummer be watched pretty closely iii plummer two plain clothes men reached neighbourhood of bank with quarter of hour to spare rather more dismissed cab at little distance from spot approached singly so that be not difficult for to slip in separately among dozen fifteen clerk a arrived passed directly into manager room door of opened into space left for public before counter from room whole of outer office be visible through glass of partition manager mr blockley quick intelligent man of thirty six so gave chair pointed out how best must watch counter without being observed if letter be sent said will be brought here to of course will bring messenger in if cheque be presented from mayes have told cashier to slide big ledger off desk accidentally with elbow will be signal then can do think proper think can do more than that took position waited felt pretty sure that if mayes sent at must be early for obvious reason be right for very first customer be man stepped in briskly scarcely minute after manager have ceased speaking remembered having seen waiting at street corner a came along be well dressed smart enough looking man in frock coat tall hat took letter case from pocket picked out cheque from rest of paper in passed under wire grille of counter cashier took turned over shifted mechanically to post amount in book on desk a did so elbow touched heavy ledger manager have pointed out to fell with crash cashier calmly put pen behind ear stooped to pick up book even a did two scotland yard men be out before counter have sidled up to stranger one on side may see that cheque if please asked one cashier turned face toward ah just so hundred pound mayes must just trouble to come with if please there be explanation wanted about cheque have followed two men from manager room now saw that while one have laid hand on stranger shoulder other have taken by opposite arm why said former looking into face be broady sims right man growled resignedly be cop will go quiet a spoke saw free hand steal out behind pitch away crumpled fragment of paper one of policeman saw too followed with eye saw snatch up be right sir said take care of will have cab in case anything else drop accidentally be just turning over broady be what be spread out piece of paper be astonished to find inscribed on just such series of figure in group of eight a be found in cypher message in case of lever key here be great find secret message a clear to a to mayes a likely a not scrap of paper must hang took one of plain clothes men aside while other kept hold of broady sims be very important said be cypher message mr hewitt can read in fact with little time must take with if so will make copy now well sir be responsible see man said so think must take so perhaps 'd better make copy a suggest very well said be done in few second can take man off will go direct to mr hewitt inspector plummer with copy with made copy read thus struck to ask manager if cheque just presented be one of procured from mr trenaman night before found that be then left policeman with prisoner made for nearest cab rank cypher message doubt conveying be instruction to man just captured be probably of utmost importance hewitt must see at once a cab ambled along towards barbican busied in deciphering figure according to plan of knight move in chess a hewitt have explained to must only see two nought among number so plainly be longer message than one then deciphered one of sixty two letter in fact turned figure into letter corresponding in alphabet for b for so on a hewitt have done arranged letter in square of roughly drawn chessboard so that stood thus w s o n b t h t n n t h n e l d g e n c h r w n h v f r c e s n o u t l r l u f w t l r o e r m l t letter thus set out to read off message be simple task enough in view of key hewitt have given began a in case of lever key message at right hand top corner taking knight move from b to e in last square one of third line thence to at end of fifth line so to t in seventh line from to r fifth square in bottom line u in seventh line so on in order shown by lever key message copy of kept a curiosity in pocket book so read message through set down thus be at ruin channel marsh to night twelve wait in hall for instruc word final general meaning of seemed clear enough man whom policeman have recognised a broady sims be to be at spot ruined building must seem in place called channel marsh at midnight there to wait in hall for instruction doubt for instruction where to take hundred pound be to have got from bank word final be not so clear though judged think rightly that meant that word final be to be used a password by two messenger must know other be almost at destination be cogitating message meaning when cab checked at traffic in barbican just by compass public house mr victor peytral hailed climbed on step of cab be just going to see if mr hewitt be at place said if so to ask for news be rather in hurry perhaps can tell be on track think answered have just come across be taking to hewitt with showed translation of cypher gave history in dozen sentence good peytral answered know channel marsh do probably mr hewitt doe wo keep longer see be hurrying hope to see again before long dropped off step disappeared cab went on round corner by compass found hewitt plummer in office where on pretence of bookbindery have first seen mayes face to face day before be near completion of examination of office content soon must begin a systematically on premise behind gave hewitt copy of cypher message translation with exact account of how have come into possession martin hewitt studied message for minute two then relapsed into grave thought so sat for little time while plummer left room by window descended ladder to speak with men on guard below presently hewitt looked up said brett message be most important probably a important a suppose to be at same time believe have made great mistake about have misread have be there other way no have misread have read word a be intended to be read be very different thing from what suppose to be what be then martin hewitt put paper on table looked keenly in face be trap said be trap to catch unless flatter unduly must not understand trap repeated how why must mayes need to send confederate instruction by written note know nature of hold over subordinate know that mean personal communication also cheque be in mayes own hand last night more mayes know very well that have read that cypher have known for time otherwise how must have discovered bond in case of lever key also mayes know that have cheque book know bank did assure be watched last night believe know have done in such circumstance might risk jackal liberty by sending on desperate chance of cashing cheque knowing risk must never have let come with information on least of must have let come carrying vital secret written in very cypher know read many week ago then see how message instead of being concealed be positively brought to notice that man broady sims be cunning rascal police know of old a skilful swindler bill forger man like doe get rid of compromising scrap of paper by trundling out under nose just at moment be arrested when attention of everybody be directed to must wait opportunity then must probably slip into mouth swallow a be must seem to have succeeded in dropping paper full in sight with elaborate pretence of secrecy now be have be done brett man have be sent to cash cheque with very little hope of success none because first move mayes must anticipate on part must be watching for cheque at bank in upper holloway if by chance cheque have be cashed well good harm must have be done then mayes must have gone on to arrange for drawing rest of balance must probably have quite safely come to draw if on other hand a fully anticipated sims be arrested what then nothing be lost penny cheque form even sims though mayes must care nothing about must only be searched then released for cheque be perfectly genuine there be charge against since must certainly be searched that cypher note be given with instruction to make conspicuous show of attempting to get rid of now that note be written in cypher mayes knew be a plain a print to whom to be on trail note be deliberately flung in way open a day with appearance of secrecy be dangerous enemy know a told in fact yesterday if can clear away can take breath make safe purpose of note be to induce to go alone to place on channel marsh to night at twelve in hope of learning where to find mayes there be to be got rid of murdered in way for preparation will be made mayes judge character pretty well know that in such circumstance a represents sims being kept away from appointment must certainly go take place use password to learn what must brett be precisely what will do what will go exclaimed must danger 'd better go together hewitt smiled why not forty of said here be chance of bagging man for however be to be arranged for whether by shot steel tourniquet make doubt be mayes who be to do will come however plummer at least will not go in bunch will follow watch ready to help when needful channel marsh be empty dark space between two channel of lea be among hackney marsh lying between stratford homerton fancy there be deserted house there though ca remember ever having seen do know not in least well must reconnoitre to day that with lot of care think told be convinced of being watched be thing ca prevent in place like london if be skilfully done now brett have done very well morning if want to be on scene of action to night at twelve must get leave from editor must how wrist be still extremely stiff told hewitt that doubted ability to hold pen for two three day very well then get off convey excuse a soon a please will have talk with plummer then will take few hour to myself by in somebody else clothes be in room evening for may expect message iv be at little past nine in evening that next saw hewitt came into room in incongruous get up wore corduroy trouser very dirty striped jersey particularly greasy old jacket twisted over be excellent overcoat on head tall hat of high polish brought to by kerrett said in explanation of hat overcoat be be waiting with for long time in court by milford lane good hat overcoat will cover anything preferred to enter building in own character have be wearing that afternoon pulled out of pocket old peaked cap with ear piece tied over top must bring best clothes went on will spoil scrambling about boat groping in ditch have done ditch groping for day be going to change have best be putting on older thing while get into newer what sort of place be channel marsh asked well must think there must be great many better place to spend night in must be dreariest wettest flat within many mile of london must like to see portrait of man who have idea of building house there for house there be rather ruin of deserted for year half carried away by rat people who wanted slate firewood water pipe be that place where intend waiting to night be have examined nearly so closely a must like for fear of raising scare channel marsh be almost island with narrow neck of entrance at end foot track run whole length person in ruined house can easily see anybody entering marsh from end for reason reconnoitred from boat boat will go in to night think be very dirtiest old tub ever saw so that suited rig out discovered at wharf little way down river paid shilling for hire of channel marsh be banked bit on one side crept up under cover of bank learned very little beyond general lie of land because be so mighty cautious judged better to be content with examination rather than drive away game even a be have idea have be seen lay up among reed till dark after be sure there be somebody on marsh skulking too like so after waiting scouting for little gave up paddled quietly back look here hewitt said seems bit mad why go risk a talk of doing believe mayes will be there at ruin will come there at twelve very well then why ca police send enough men to surround place capture for certain hewitt smiled shook head dear brett said have seen place have will be hard enough job for plummer to get near spot unobserved guided by man who know inch trampling crowd of policeman must have a much chance a herd of elephant on such light night a be having now must be seen mile off who know what scout may have out a say will be great piece of luck if get through unobserved a be even now be not perfectly certain must do best alone however arrangement be made now be coming three of then what be arrangement asked just be to leave here first make best of way to mile end gate where old inn stand in middle of road go to corner of turning opposite at south side of road at eleven o'clock four wheeler will drive up with plummer one of men in man be one who know geography of channel marsh also know exactly where to find boat used to day will drive to little way beyond bow bridge then plummer man will lead to boat have better scull leave others to look out will know what to do will pull along to place where can watch till see coming on to marsh by path a soon a see will slip quietly along to place policeman will show close to ruin watch again be know whether not think worth while to take pistol certainly will then be most likely to want plummer will have one thought well worth while took regulation webley relic of old volunteer captaincy then by way of underground railway gained neighbourhood of mile end interested about back street till time approached to look for plummer cab plummer be more than punctual indeed be two three minute before time cab drew near kerb scarcely stopped so quickly did scramble in good said plummer be well ahead of time mr hewitt quite right yes said left so hour half ago at office sat silent while cab rattled rumbled over stony road to bow bridge shopkeeper on way put up shutter extinguished light bow bridge be reached passed presently stopped cab alighted here style plummer man took lead little way farther along road turned into dark muddy lane on left floundered through for hundred fifty yard so then suddenly drew in at opening on right here stood for few moment while guide groped way down toward muddy water must smell rather than see little way before there be few broken step broad black thing be boat got into a silently a must manage cast off be clumsy broad beamed leaky old conveyance that be a dirty a hewitt have described must feel a groped for scull got out night be light dark by turn changing with cloud shipped rudder style steered must probably have run ashore more than once for bank be not always distinct channel be narrow dark passed black form of several factory with tall chimney then drew out among marsh flat grey with wisp of mist lying here there so went in silence for while till at last drew in against bank on left laid hold by post at landing place be channel marsh whispered style a climbed cautiously ashore ca see house very well from here there be where mr hewitt will come through looking over top of low bank must discern path traversed length of marsh entering by broken gate at neck of land must have passed on way here crouched waited have heard half hour struck on distant clock soon after entering boat now waited anxiously for three quarter so long did time seem to excited perception have quite decided that clock must have stopped at rate did not chime quarter when at last stroke came distant plaintive over misty flat quarter of hour plummer remarked wo be minute late minute too early from what know of how long will take from gate to ruin eight nine minute good style answered then will see in seven minute six minute a case may be plummer rejoined in same low tone slowly minute dragged with not sound about save sucking lapping of muddy river occasional flop of water rat dark cloud be now fewer moon be high only partially obscured by thinner cloud that traversed face more than once fancied sound from direction of ruin then doubted fancy when at last there be sound indeed from opposite direction in moment saw hewitt muffled close about neck walking briskly up path regained boat with possible speed silence pulled best regardless of stiff wrist during watch have have time to perceive wisdom of arrangement have be made have be watching from place fairly out of sight from ruin yet sufficiently near to be able to reach neighbourhood before hewitt certainly be better to approach actual spot at same time a hewitt for then if be being watched for attention of watcher must be diverted from presently reached reed bed that hewitt have spoken of must see sort of little creek inlet here ceased to pull style cautiously punted into creek with one of scull boat grounded noiselessly in mud crept ashore one at time through mud sedge creek be edged with bank of rough broken ground grown with coarse grass bramble a peeped over bank ruined house stood before so near a to startle by proximity must have be large house originally if indeed be ever completed now stood roofless dismantled windowless in many place whole rod of brickwork have fallen now littered ground about black gap of front door stood plain to see with short flight of broken step before by side of thick timber shore supported front wall struck then that ruin be perhaps largely due to failure of marshy foundation place seemed silent empty hewitt footstep be now plain to hear presently appeared walking briskly a before must not see did not look for made directly for broken step mounted paused on topmost struck match seemed rather large hall caught momentary glimpse of bare rafter plasterless wall then match went out hewitt stepped within almost on instant there came loud jar noise of falling brick then in same instant of time heard terrific crash saw hewitt leap out at front door leap out a seemed from cloud of dust splinter sprang to foot plummer pulled down again steady said lie low be hurt wait see before show ourselves seemed that floor above have fallen on spot where hewitt have be standing have alighted from leap on hand knee now stood facing house revolver in hand watching there be moment pause sound of movement from upper part of ruin quiet moment then bang flash from high on wall to right hewitt sprang to shelter behind heavy shore shot followed scoring white line across thick timber plummer be up style be after there be cried plummer up on coping pulled out own pistol shoot cried hewitt will take alive far to right on topmost coping of front wall must see crouching figure saw rise to knee once more raise arm to take aim at hewitt then with sudden cry human figure appeared from behind coping sprang upon first there be moment of struggle then rotten coping crumbled down down came brick men together sickened can only explain feeling by saying never before have seen anything seemed so long in falling a two men then with horrid crash struck broken ground pistol fired again with shock reached in dozen stride turned over limp oozing lifeless then saw that one

that pull on opposite end of long lever must force away brick on beam rested let whole weight fall be jar of beam fall of first few loose brick have so far warned hewitt a to enable to leap from under floor almost a fell peytral sudden appearance when have time to reflect on gave suspicion a to at least of espionage to hewitt have be subjected suspicion confirmed later by peytral after recovery from shock of fall for fresh news of enemy have re awakened passion since alone must not find be willing enough to let hewitt do tracking down if only might clutch mayes throat in end explained business have called away after barbican stronghold have be captured finding hewitt plummer somewhat uncommunicative somewhat out of have drawn off have followed hewitt movement confident that must be led to old enemy at last what have told of cypher message have led to hunt out channel marsh in afternoon to return at midnight of course regarded message a did at time a perfectly genuine instruction from mayes to sims came to rendezvous wholly in ignorance a to what hewitt be doing with better hope than that might hear something must lead in direction of mayes have entered marsh after dark from

made great promise have spoken of great idea must put into execution together have lent money then at last have initiated a called have put to lie back in chair have directed gaze on red triangle held in air before then triangle have descended gently felt sleepy till at cold touch of thing on forehead sens have gone be done more than once in end victim found that mayes have only to raise triangle before to send to sleep instantly then found that must do certain thing whether wanted not ended in complete subservience so mayes must set to perpetrate robbery then appropriate proceeds for for by post hypnotic suggestion must force to bring hand over penny more poor wretch be held in constant terror for knew that very life depended on lift of master hand must be sent into lethargy by gesture killed in state very thing be done in fact a have seen in two case sims be one of gang of such criminal brought to heel made victim mind soul such a be have passed into miscreant keeping terror

innocent person who allows to be made subject of hypnotic experiment at hand of person with whom with whose object be not thoroughly acquainted must be remembered at time there be person advertising to teach practice of hypnotism to anybody who will pay to anybody who may use terrible power a plea more danger be so great that have led two eminent men of science to issue public protest warning with urgent plea that practice of hypnotism be restricted by law at least a closely a of vivisection a to what must have happened if plummer have yielded to mayes threat so far a to undergo initiation proposed at time be helpless in hand of have little doubt can not suppose that must have wasted much time over once have fallen lethargic when hewitt burst in must have found lying dead with red
