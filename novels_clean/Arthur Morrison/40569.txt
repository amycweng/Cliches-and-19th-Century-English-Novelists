towner who find nothing else in sunday paper so refreshing a paragraph headed windfall for cabman fortune for pauper who cut out to pin over mantelpiece handsome coloring of such paragraph be responsible for many bold flight of fancy in regard to ted munsey fortune cubitt town left to being sterile soil for imagination said that munseys have come in for chest packed with bank note on decease of one of mr munsey relation of whom be wont to hint others put at street full of house a being higher ideal of wealth few more romantically given imagined vaguely of ancestral land hall mr munsey forbear have be done out of for many year by lawyer mr munsey in hour of triumph be at little pain to discount although in simple fact fortune be more than legacy of hundred pound from ted uncle who have kept public house in deptford of hundred pound mr munsey took immediate custody there be guessing what must have become of in ted hand probably must have be in chief part irrecoverably lent certainly must have gone left ted moulder at moffat a before with mr munsey there be hesitation difficulty obvious use of hundred pound be to put possessor into business meant shop to elevate socially at single bound beyond many grade lying between moulder small tradesman wherefore munseys straightway went into business being equally ignorant of sort of shopkeeping be free to choose sort pleased thus be that mr munsey decided upon drapery haberdashery ted contribution to discussion being limited to mild hint of greengrocery coal instantly suppressed a low nothing must be more genteel

disappointingly few several old neighbor came in from curiosity to talk buy nothing one woman who looked at many thing without buying be discovered after departure to have stolen pair of stocking hedward be duly abused for not keeping sharp look out while wife back be turned finally shutter went up on day taking of three sevenpence farthing including most dubious threepenny bit then a mr munsey said when be in business must expect trade to vary of course there must be more customer when shop got known although hedward certainly might have taken trouble to find one in busier thoroughfare hedward whose opinion in matter a in others have never be asked retired to back yard to smoke pipe thing have be pining for day be quickly recalled pipe being clay upon mr munsey discovery that act must be observed from neighbor window be continually bringing family into disgrace mr munsey despaired aloud over far into night day came went trade varied a fact very little indeed between three sevenpence farthing nothing scope for fluctuation be small for time first day record be never exceeded on fifth day customer bought nearly seven shilling worth at once husband have day returned from sea with money after month of stint indulged in orgie of haberdashery at nearest shop mr munsey be reassured trade be increasing perhaps assistant must be needed soon in addition to two girl only younger of girl by bye have a yet taken active interest in business emma elder spending much of time in bedroom making unpresentable by inordinate blubbering be because of mr munsey prohibition of more company keeping with jack page jack be plumber just out of time rather catch for moulder daughter impossible of course for daughter of people in business a emma must have have proper feeling to see for emma have not wallowed in luxury of woe exacerbated on occasion to poignancy by scolding sometimes by thumping of mar neglected even select weekly quadrille class membership whereof be part of novel splendor there be never again seven shilling customer state of trade perplexed mr munsey beyond telling being in business one must by circumstance have genteel competence be elementary axiom in cubitt town where be money what be difference between other shop be screw loose anywhere in case certainly must not be fault wherefore nagged hedward one day polite young man called in large pony trap explained whole mystery nobody must reasonably expect to succeed in business of sort who did not keep good stock of fancy apron lace bow made by firm be charged to represent of course knew what business be that cash be not always free need never hinder transaction with three month credit be regular thing with respectable well established business concern in three month one must certainly sell fancy apron lace bow of especial kind price that one have room for need scarcely remind lady of mr munsey business experience fancy apron lace bow of right sort be by far most profitable good known to trade everybody knew must say gross of just to go on with well then gross price be cut so near that really did not pay to split gross time to secure good customer must stretch point mr munsey be enlightened plainly secret of success in business be to buy advantageously in way polite young man suggested sell at good price live on profit merely paying over remainder at end of three month nothing must be simpler so began system forthwith other polite young men called further certain profit be arranged for on similar term weak spot in plan be absence of binding arrangement with general public be not long in discovering nobody came to buy fancy apron lace bow tempting a might seem moreover after have hung week more alice reported that large shop in commercial road be

glad to find outsider to instruct to impress with full sense of sombre mystic dare devilry therefore came to red cow with snorkey to spread a said light be not received with enthusiasm perhaps because of certain unlaundered aspect of person remarkable even to of red cow group grease be chief exterior characteristic thick hair turning up over collar seemed to have lain for long unharried of brush

operated man must be watchful of rest there must be half measure timorousness comrade wavering temporizing behaving in way suspiciously must be straightway suppressed there must be mistake about that be desperate glorious work there must be desperate rapid method of striking guarding thing made clear in best conspirator manner with nod scowl shaken forefinger a of one accustomed to oversetting empire men of red cow group looked at other spat thoughtfully then comrade asked what have better be blown up first sotcher opinion be that there be most glory in blowing up people in crowd at theatre building be safer a there be more chance of getting away of building public office be probably to be preferred something in whitehall say bank nobody seemed to have tried bank offered suggestion now of course there be not many public building in east end possibly group must like to act in own neighborhood must be novelty must attract notice question be one for own decision independent freedom of judgment being right thing in matter there be church of course factory of bloated capitalist particularly might suggest gas work close by there be large gasometer abutting on street probably explosion there must prove tremendously effective putting light out everywhere attracting great attention in paper be glory jerry shand hazarded remark about life of men in gas work sotcher explained that be trivial matter revolution be never accomplished without bloodshed few casual life be not to be weighed in balance against glorious consummation of social upheaval repeated contention when weaker
