complexion unusually fair for italian in whom professed to recognise likeness to tasso poet man became guide in excursion about neighbourhood of naples though be not one of regular corp of guide indeed seemed to have regular occupation of definite sort tasso a father always called seemed civil fellow enough be fairly intelligent mother disliked extremely from first without being able to offer

miraculous for dead ruffian marino have be member of dreaded camorra camorristi be eager to avenge death to anybody acquainted with internal history of italy more particularly history of old kingdom of naples name of camorra will be familiar enough be one of worst most powerful of many powerful evil secret society of italy have none of excuse for existence have be from time to time put forward on

regularity than be of tax due to lawful government of country carrying of smuggled good be monopoly of camorra perfect organisation existing for purpose throughout kingdom whole population be

considerable trouble have heard that in year after matter be describing two hundred camorristi be banished from italy a soon a legal form be complied with father received broadest possible official hint that sooner more secretly left country better must be for family british consul too impressed upon that law must be entirely unable to protect against machination of camorra indeed needed little persuasion to induce to leave for poor mother be in state of constant terror lest be murdered together in hotel so that lost time in returning to england bringing european trip to close in london stayed at well known private hotel near bond street have be three day here when father came in one evening with firm conviction that have be followed for something like two hour followed very skilfully too more than once have doubled suddenly with view to confront pursuer who felt be at heel have met nobody of suspicious appearance next afternoon heard mother telling governess who be travelling with of unpleasant looking man who have be hanging about hotel door who felt sure have afterwards be following father a be walking mother grew nervous communicated fear to father however pooh poohed thing took little thought of meaning nevertheless dogging continued father who be never able to fix upon person who caused annoyance indeed rather felt presence by instinct a one doe in such case than otherwise grew extremely angry have idea of consulting police then one morning mother discovered little paper label stuck on outside of door of bedroom occupied by herself father be small thing circular about size of sixpenny piece even smaller mother be quite certain that have not be there when last entered door night before be much terrified for label carried tiny device drawn awkwardly in ink pair of knife of curious shape crossed sign of camorra nobody knew anything of label how came where have be found mother urged father to place under protection of police at once delayed indeed fancy have suspicion that label might be production of practical joker staying at hotel who have heard of neapolitan adventure be reported in many newspaper designed to give fright very evening poor father be found dead stabbed in dozen place in short quiet street not forty yard from hotel have merely gone out to buy few cigar of particular brand fancied at shop two street away in le than hour of departure police be at hotel door with news of death having got address from letter in pocket be part of present design to enlarge on mother grief to describe in detail incident followed father death for be going back to early period of life merely to make more clear bearing of what have recently happened to myself will be sufficient therefore to say that at inquest jury returned verdict of wilful murder against person person unknown that be several time reported that police have obtained most important clue that being so very naturally there be never arrest returned to sydney there grew up must perhaps have mentioned ere that profession must rather say hobby be that of artist fortunately unfortunately a may please to consider have need to follow profession a mean of

dorrington to one magnificent evening a leaned on rail smoked rigby be very common name in australia be seem to remember case twenty year ago more of australian gentleman of name being very badly treated in london indeed now think of be not sure that be murdered ever hear anything of yes said great deal unfortunately be father be murdered father there be awfully sorry perhaps must have mentioned of course did know oh replied be right be so far back now that mind speaking about be very extraordinary thing altogether then feeling that owed dorrington story of sort after listening to many have be telling described to whole circumstance of father death ah said dorrington when have finished have heard of camorra before know thing two about indeed a matter of fact still exists not quite widespread open thing once be of course much smaller pretty active in quiet way pretty mischievous be mighty bad lot camorristi personally be rather surprised that heard more of be sort of people who must rather day murder three people than one usual idea of revenge went good way beyond mere murder of offending party have way of including wife family a many relative a possible at rate seem to have got off right though be inclined to call rather piece of luck than otherwise then a be invariable habit launched into anecdote told of crime of maffia italian secret society larger even more powerful than camorra almost a criminal tale of implacable revenge visited on father son grandson in succession till race be extirpated then talked of method of large fund at disposal of camorra maffia of cunning patience with scheme be carried into execution of victim who have discovered too late that most trusted servant be sworn to destruction of who have fled to remote part of earth hoped to be lost forgotten who have be shadowed slain with barbarous ferocity in most trusted hiding place italian be there be apt to be branch of one of society one must never tell where might might not turn up two italian forecastle hand on board at moment might be member might might not have business in hand not included in signed article asked if have ever come into personal contact with of society doings with camorra though know thing about must probably surprise of not little have have professional dealing with maffia that without coming off second best too be not so serious case a

place one learns discretion in such trade a mine a to adventure with maffia now be there secrecy about dorrington shrugged shoulder said none in particular case be not particularly interesting be in florence document be property of wealthy american of maffia rascal managed to steal doe matter what document be be private matter owner must have parted with great deal to get back maffia held for

while got net effectually round gentleman who be president of particular branch of maffia when be ready have friendly interview with just showed hand of card served a other argument must have done in end concluded quite amicable arrangement on easy term for party client got property back including expense at about fifth of price expected to have to pay be learnt deal about maffia while business lasted at other time learnt good deal about camorra too dorrington grew more intimate day of voyage till knew detail of uneventful little history knew many of own most curious experience in truth be

received telegram calling instantly to london be shocking nuisance said here holiday knocked on head altogether cut in two fear be first rather than second be just way in such uncertain profession a mine there be possible help for however must go a 'd understand at once if knew case what chiefly annoys be leaving alone reassured on point pointed out that have for long time be used to good deal of own company though indeed with dorrington away life at shooting lodge threatened to be le pleasant than have be will be bored to death here dorrington said thought jumping with own on other hand wo be much good going up to town yet everybody be out of town mowbray among there be little business of ours be waiting for at moment partner mentioned in letter yesterday why not put in time with little tour round might work up to london by irregular stage look about a artist 'd like to see few of old town probably edinburgh chester warwick so on be great programme perhaps hardly know what else to suggest a for must be off a be by first train can get begged not to trouble about to attend to business a matter of fact be disposed to get to london take chamber at rate for little while chester be place much wanted to see real old town with wall round be not indisposed to take day at warwick so in end resolved to pack up make for chester following day from there to take train for warwick in hour dorrington be gone chester be delight to recollection of trip to europe in childhood be vivid enough a to misfortune followed father of ancient building visited remembered little now in chester found medival town have so often read of wandered for hour together in quaint old row walked on city wall evening after arrival be fine moonlight be tempted from hotel took stroll about town finished by walk along wall from watergate toward cathedral moon flecked over now again by scrap of cloud at time obscured for minute together lighted up roodee in interval touched with river beyond a walked presently grew aware of quiet shuffling footstep little way behind took little heed of at first though must see nobody near from whom sound might come soon perceived that when stopped a did from time to time to gaze over parapet mysterious footstep stopped also when resumed walk quiet shuffling tread began again at first thought might be echo moment reflection dispelled that idea mine be even distinct walk followed be soft quick shuffling step mere scuffle moreover when by way of test took few silent step on tip toe shuffle still persisted be being followed now know whether not may sound like childish fancy confess thought of father when last have be in england a child father violent death have be preceded by just such following now after year on return on very first night walked abroad alone there be strange footstep in track walk be narrow nobody must possibly pas unseen turned suddenly therefore hastened back at once saw dark figure rise from shadow of parapet run ran too must not gain on figure receded farther more indistinctly before one reason be that felt doubtful of footing on unfamiliar track ceased chase continued stroll might easily have be vagrant thief thought who have notion to rush at convenient opportunity snatch watch here be far past spot where have turned there be shuffling footstep behind again for little while feigned not to notice then swinging round a swiftly a must made quick rush useless again for there in distance scuttled that same indistinct figure more rapidly than must run what did mean liked affair so little that left wall walked toward hotel street be quiet have traversed two be about emerging into one of two main street where row be when from farther part of dark street behind there came once more sound of now unmistakable footstep stopped footstep stopped also turned walked back few step a did sound went scuffling away at far end of street illustration made quick rush must not be fancy must not be chance for single incident perhaps such explanation might serve not for persistent recurrence hurried away to hotel resolved since must not come at pursuer to turn back more before reached hotel there be shuffling footstep again not far behind must not be true to say be alarmed at stage of adventure be troubled to know what might mean altogether puzzled to account for thought great deal went to bed rose in morning wiser than ever whether not be mere fancy induced by last night experience can not say went about day with haunting feeling be watched to impression be very real indeed listened often in bustle of day even in quiet old chester individual character of different footstep be not easily recognisable once however a descended flight of step from row fancied quick shuffle in curious old gallery have just quitted turned up step again looked there be shabby sort of man looking in one of window leaning so far a to hide head behind heavy oaken pilaster supported building above might have be footstep might have be fancy at rate must have look at mounted top stair a turned in direction man ran off with face averted head ducked vanished down stair made speed after when reached street be nowhere to be seen what must mean man be rather above middle height wore one of soft felt hat familiar on head of london organ grinder also hair be black bushy protruded over back of coat collar surely be delusion surely be not imagining italian aspect for man simply because of recollection of father fate perhaps be foolish took more pleasure in chester embarrassment be novel one for must not forget went back to hotel paid bill sent bag to railway station took train for warwick by way of crewe be dark when arrived night be near a fine a last night have be at chester took very little late dinner at hotel fell into doubt what to do with one rather fat very sleepy commercial traveller be only other customer visible billiard room be empty there seemed to be nothing to do to light cigar take walk must just see enough of old town to give good hope of to morrow sight seeing there be nothing visible of quite such interesting character a one might meet in chester there be good few fine old sixteenth century house there be two gate with chapel above of course castle be great show place must visit on morrow if there be difficulty a to permission there be very fine picture there if remembered aright what have read be walking down incline from one of gate trying to remember who painter of picture be besides van dyck holbein when shuffling step be behind again admit that cost effort time to turn on pursuer there be something uncanny in persistent elusive footstep indeed there be something alarming in circumstance dogged thus from place to place unable to shake off enemy to understand movement motive turn did however straightway shuffling step went off at hastened pace in shadow of gate time made more than dozen step back turned again pushed way to hotel a went shuffling step came after thing be serious there must be object in unceasing watching object must bode good to plainly unseen eye have be on whole of day have noted going coming journey from chester again irresistibly watching preceded father death came to mind must not forget must have doubt now have be closely watched from moment have set foot at plymouth who must have be waiting to watch at plymouth when indeed have only decided to land at last moment then thought of two italian forecastle hand on steamer very men whom dorrington have used to illustrate in what unexpected quarter member of terrible italian secret society might be found camorra be not satisfied with single revenge destroyed son after father waited for many year with infinite patience cunning dogged by step reached hotel went to bed slept fitfully at first though better rest came a night wore on in early morning woke with sudden shock with indefinite sense of being disturbed by somebody about window be directly opposite foot of bed there a looked be face of man dark evil grinning with bush of black hair about uncovered head small ring in ear be flash face vanished be struck by terror one so often feel on sudden violent awakening from sleep be second ere must leave bed get to window room be on first floor window looked down on stable yard have momentary glimpse of human figure leaving gate of yard be figure have fled before in row at chester ladder belonging to yard stood under window be rose dressed must stand sort of thing no longer if be only something tangible if there be only somebody must take hold of fight with if necessary must not have be so bad be surrounded by mysterious machination persistent unexplainable that be altogether impossible to tackle to face to complain to police must have be absurd must take for lunatic be indeed just such complaint that lunatic so often make to police complaint of being followed by indefinite enemy of being besieged by face that look in at window even if did not set down lunatic must police of provincial town do for in case like must go consult dorrington have breakfast then decided must at rate try castle before leaving try did accordingly be allowed to go over through whole morning be oppressed by horrible sense of being watched by malignant eye clearly there be comfort for while lasted so after lunch caught train brought to euston soon after half past six took cab straight to dorrington room be out be not expected home till late so drove to large hotel near charing cross avoid mentioning name for reason will presently be understood sent in bag dined have not smallest doubt be still under observation of man men who have so far pursued have indeed hope of eluding except by contrivance of dorrington expert brain so a have desire to hear that shuffling footstep again indeed have seemed at warwick to have physically painful effect on nerve stayed within got to bed early have fear of waking face to face with grinning italian here window be four floor up out of reach of anything fire escape in fact woke comfortably naturally saw nothing from window bright sky building opposite traffic below a turned to close door behind a emerged into corridor there on muntin of frame just below bedroom number be little round paper label perhaps trifle smaller than sixpence on label drawn awkwardly in ink be device of two crossed knife of curious crooked shape sign of camorra will not attempt to describe effect of sign upon may best be imagined in view of what have said of incident preceding murder of father be sign of inexorable fate creeping nearer step by step implacable inevitable mysterious in little more than twelve hour after seeing that sign father have be mangled corpse one of hotel servant passed a stood by door made shift to ask if knew anything of label looked at paper then more curiously at must offer explanation spent little time over breakfast then went by cab to conduit street paid bill took bag with dorrington have gone to office have left message that if called be to follow office be in bedford street covent garden turned cab in direction forthwith why said dorrington a shook hand believe look bit out of sort doe england agree with well answered have proved rather trying so far then described in exact detail adventure a have set down here dorrington looked grave be really extraordinary said most extraordinary be often that call thing extraordinary neither with experience be plain something must be done something to gain time at rate be in dark at present of course expect will have to fish about little before get at anything to go on in meantime think must disappear a artfully a can manage sat silent for little while thoughtfully tapping forehead with finger tip wonder said presently whether not italian fellow on steamer be in not suppose have made known anywhere have nowhere a know have be with time till left moor since then have be with nobody called on nobody now there be doubt be camorra dorrington said be pretty plain think told on steamer that be rather wonderful that have heard nothing of after father death what have caused delay there be telling know best be be lucky for anyway so far what 'd like to find out now be how have identified got on track so promptly there be guessing where fellow get information be just wonderful if can find out then perhaps can stop supply turn on something will lead into pit if have called anywhere on business declared a might have done for instance at mowbray might be inclined to suspect that got tip in crooked way from there have of course if italian chap on steamer be in be probably identified pretty certainly if be not may only have made guess two landed together kept together till day two ago a far a outsider must know might be rigby might be dorrington come will work on line think smell plan be staying anywhere paid bill at hotel came along here with bag very well now there be house at highgate kept by very trustworthy man whom know very well where man might be pretty comfortable for few day even for week if doe mind staying indoors keeping out of sight expect friend of camorra be watching in street outside at moment think will be fairly easy to get away to highgate without letting into secret if mind secluding for bit in circumstance take wo object at object must think not very well that be settled can call dorrington not a please though perhaps will be safest not to shout 'rigby too loud a for myself for day two at least be going to be mr james rigby have card case handy yes here be then a to taking name wo run serious risk dorrington winked merrily have run risk two before now said in course of business if mind risk need grumble for warn will charge for risk when send

place retreat have got other identifying paper have yes have produced letter from sydney lawyer to mowbray deed of south australian property from bag ah said dorrington will just give formal receipt

town for there be way in might give little help fancy never mind leave to there be receipt keep snug away somewhere where inquisitive people ca read handed receipt then took to partner room introduced mr hick be small wrinkled man older than dorrington must think by fifteen twenty year with aspect manner of quiet old professional man dorrington left room presently returned with hat in hand yes said there be charming dark gentleman with head like mop ring in ear skulking about at next corner if be who looked in at window wonder be startled dress suggests organ grinding interest look a though

drive into power get paper from armed with with consummate address knowledge of affair must go to mr mowbray in character of mr james rigby sell land in south australia have whole of property transferred to from sydney rest of baggage be at room if further proof be required might be found there have taken good care must not meet mr mowbray who by way afterwards found have not left office have never fired gun in life at first wondered that dorrington have not made murderous attempt on at shooting place in scotland little thought convinced that must have be bad policy for disposal of body must be difficult must have to account somehow for sudden disappearance whereas by use of italian assistant murder apparatus at highgate be made to efface own trail must be got rid of in end with little trouble for body stripped of everything might identify must be simply that of drowned man unknown whom nobody must identify whole plot be contrived upon information have afforded dorrington during voyage home sprang from remembering report of father death when paper in office came to be examined there step in operation be plainly revealed there be code telegram from suez directing hick to hire grouse moor there be telegram letter from scotland giving direction a to later movement indeed thing be displayed completely business of dorrington hick have really be that of private inquiry agent have done much bon fide business many of operation have be of more than questionable sort among paper be found complete set neatly arranged in docket containing in skeleton complete history of case many of case be of most interesting character have be enabled to piece together out of material thus supplied narrative will follow a to own case only remains to say that a yet dorrington hick croftings have be caught played in end for high stake might have made six figure of if have killed first figure must not have be one lost by mere accident have often wondered how many of body coroner jury of london have returned to be found drowned be drowned not where be picked up in horrible tank at highgate what drug be that gave mr crofting coffee value in dorrington eye know plainly have not be sufficient in case to keep unconscious against shock of cold water till must be drowned altogether month have passed since adventure even now sweat at sight of iron tank case of janissary ii case of janissary in case indeed in most of others note other document found in docket must by give faint outline of fact indeed might easily be unintelligible to many people especially a for much of information have be indebted to outside inquiry therefore offer excuse for presenting whole thing digested into plain narrative form with little reference to authority though knew none of actor in with exception of astute dorrington case be especially interesting to a will be gathered from narrative only paper in bundle will particularly allude to be newspaper cutting of date anterior by nine ten month to event be to write of have evidently be cut at time appeared saved in case might be useful in box in form of book containing many hundred of others from receptacle have be taken attached to bundle during progress of case may say at once that fact recorded have direct concern with case of horse janissary have be useful in affording suggestion to dorrington in connection therewith matter be short report of ordinary sort of inquest here transcribe dr mcculloch held inquest yesterday on body of mr henry lawrence whose body be found on tuesday morning last in river near vauxhall bridge deceased be well known in certain sporting circle sophia lawrence widow said that deceased have left home on monday afternoon at about five in usual health saying that be to dine at friend saw nothing more of till called upon to identify body have reason for suicide so far a witness knew be free from pecuniary embarrassment have indeed be very successful in betting recently habitually carried large pocket book with paper in mr robert naylor commission agent said that deceased dined with that evening at house in gold street chelsea left for home at about half past eleven have at time sum of nearly four hundred pound upon chiefly in note have be paid by witness in settlement of bet be fine night deceased walked in direction of chelsea embankment be last witness saw of might not have be perfectly sober be not drunk be capable of taking care of evidence of thames police went to show that money be on body when found except few copper pocket book dr william hodgetts said that death be due to drowning there be bruise on arm head might have be caused before death body be very healthy one coroner said that there seemed to be very strong suspicion of foul play unless pocket book of deceased have got out of pocket in water evidence be very meagre although police appeared to have made possible inquiry jury returned verdict of 'found drowned though how deceased came into water there be evidence to show ' know more of unfortunate man lawrence than have only printed cutting here because probably induced dorrington to take certain step in case be dealing with with case fate of man lawrence have nothing to do pass out of story entirely ii mr warren telfer be gentleman of mean owner of few very few racehorse have great knack of buying hidden prize in yearling what stable lacked in quantity often more than made up for in quality thus have once bought st leger winner for a little a hundred fifty pound many will remember bitter disappointment of ten dozen year back when horse matfelon starting odds on favourite for two thousand never even got among crowd ambled in street behind everything be freely rumoured doubt with cause that matfelon have be got at in way nobbled there be hint of certain bucket of water administered just before race bucket of water observed in hand said of one said of person connected with ritter training establishment there be suspicion of pulling for plainly jockey be doing best with animal way along never have tight rein so nobbling must have be said knowing one mr warren telfer said so too with much bitterness more immediately removed horse from ritter stable started small training place of own for own horse merely putting old steeplechase jockey in charge who have come out of bad accident permanently lame have fallen on evil day owner be impulsive violent tempered man who once notion be in head held to through everything in spite of everything misfortune with matfelon made most insanely distrustful man alive in everything fancied saw trick to man seemed scoundrel must scarce bear to let very stable boy touch horse although for year went a well a must be expected in stable suspicious distrust lost nothing of virulence be perpetually fussing about stable making surprise visit laying futile trap convicted nobody sole tangible result of behaviour be violent quarrel between mr warren telfer nephew richard who have be making lengthened stay with uncle young telfer to tell truth be so discreet so exemplary in behaviour a might have be temper be that characteristic of family when conceived that uncle have idea that be communicating stable secret to friend outside there be animated row nephew betook luggage somewhere else young telfer always insisted however that uncle be not bad fellow on whole though have habit of thought conduct made altogether intolerable at time uncle have good word for graceless nephew indeed richard telfer betted more than must afford be not so particular in choice of sporting acquaintance a gentleman must have be mr warren telfer house blackhall stable be little more than two mile from redbury in hampshire after quarrel mr richard telfer be not seen near place for many month not indeed till excitement be high over forthcoming race for redbury stake for there be entry from stable janissary for long ranked second favourite then owner nephew did not enter premise in fact made visit a secret a possible have said that janissary be long ranked second favourite for redbury stake little more than week before race became first favourite owing to training mishap to horse fancied first made chance so poor that might have be scratched at moment so far be janissary above class of field though be two year old race there might be surprise that at once went to far shorter odds than previous favourite indeed have run fit well must have found janissary easy colt to beat mr telfer nephew be seen near stable two three day before race day owner despatched telegram to firm of dorrington hick in response to telegram dorrington caught first available train for redbury be with mr warren telfer in library by five in afternoon be about horse janissary want to consult mr dorrington said mr telfer be right enough now at least be right at exercise morning feel certain that there be diabolical plot on hand somewhere to interfere with horse before redbury stake day be sorry to have to say that suspect own nephew to be mixed up in in way in first place may tell that there be doubt that colt if let alone bar accident can win in canter must have won even if herald late favourite have kept well for can tell that janissary be far greater horse than anybody be aware of outside establishment at rate than anybody ought to be aware of if stable secret be properly kept pedigree be nothing very great never showed quality till quite lately in private trial of course have leaked out somehow that colt be exceptionally good believe can trust soul in place how must price have gone up to five to four unless somebody have be telling what be paid not to tell be all a have said have conviction that something on foot somebody want to interfere with horse of course get tout about now again down be pretty big generally manage to dodge if want to on last three four morning however wherever janissary might be taking gallop there be big hulking fellow with red beard spectacle not so much watching horse a trying to get hold of lad be always up out at five for have found to cost remember about matfelon that if man doe want to be ramped must never take eye off thing well have scarcely seen lad ease colt once on last three four morning without red bearded fellow bobbing up from knoll clump of bush something close by especially if janissary be bit away from other horse not under nose head lad for moment rode at fellow of course when saw what be after be artful a cartload of monkey vanished somehow before must get near head lad belief have seen about just after dark too be keeping stable lad in when be not riding suppose find have chance of getting at except when be out with horse morning not only did see fellow about a usual be ashamed to say observed own nephew acting part of common tout certainly have decency to avoid clear out be not all a will see morning happening to approach stable from back suddenly came upon red bearded man giving money to groom of mine ran off at once a may guess discharged groom where stood must not allow into stable again offered explanation excuse took off hour afterward almost sent away head boy too for when told of dismissal admitted that have seen that same groom taking money of nephew at back of stable hour before have not informed said that thought that a be 'only mr richard did matter fool anyway groom have gone so far a can tell a yet colt be right examined at once of course also turned over box week groom used to keep brush odd thing in there found paper full of powder yet know what be be certainly nothing have business with in stable will take now mr telfer went on be in uneasy state want advice assistance quite apart from suspicious more than suspicious circumstance have informed of be certain know without being able to give precise reason be certain that attempt be being made at disabling janissary before thursday race feel in bone so to speak have same suspicion just before two thousand when matfelon be got at thing be in air a be now perhaps be sort of instinct rather think be result of unconscious absorption of number of little indication about be a may be resolved to leave opening to enemy if can help want to see if can suggest further precaution beyond be taking come look at stable dorrington must see opening for piece of rascality by might make more of case than by serving client loyally so resolved to do latter followed mr telfer through training stable where eight nine thoroughbred stood must suggest improvement upon exceptional precaution already existed said dorrington think can do better than at least on inner line of defence be best to make outer line secure first by way be janissary be saw farther up row did oh be very different sort of colt though doe look like doe people who have be up down stable once twice often confuse be bay much of build about same height have bit of stocking on same leg though janissary be bigger animal have white star never saw two creature look so like run so differently be dead loss not worth feed if can manage to wind up to something like gallop will try to work off in selling plate somewhere a far a can see be good enough even for that be disappointment stock far better than janissary too cost half a much again yearling be lottery still have drawn prize two among at one time ah yes so have heard now a to outer defence be speaking of let find out who be trying to interfere with horse do mind letting into secret of stable commission oh be talking in confidence of course have backed colt pretty heavily round not too much anywhere there be good slice with barker know barker of course mullins have thousand down for be at five to one before herald went amiss then there be ford lascelles good men naylor be smallest man of there be only hundred two with though be be laying horse pretty freely everywhere at least until herald went wrong there be pedder there must have be deal of money laid to outside backer there be telling who may contemplate ramp just so now a to nephew what of suspicion in direction perhaps be little hasty a to mr telfer answered little ashamed of what have previously said be worried mystified a see hardly know what to think nephew richard be little erratic have foolish habit of betting more than can afford quarrelled time back while be staying here because have idea that have be talking too freely outside have in fact regarded a breach of confidence so there be quarrel went away very well wonder if can get bed at 'crown at redbury be afraid will be crowded will try why trouble why not stay with be near stable because then must be of more use to than one of lad people who come out here morning be probably staying at redbury must go there after iii crown at redbury be full in anticipation of race dorrington managed to get room ordinarily occupied by one of landlord family who undertook to sleep at friend for night two settled strolled into yard soon fell into animated talk with hostler on subject of forthcoming race town be backing janissary for stake hostler said advised dorrington to do same during conversation two men stopped in street just outside yard gate talking one be big heavy vulgar looking fellow in box cloth coat with shaven face hoarse voice other be slighter slimmer younger more gentlemanlike man though there be certain patchy colour about face seemed to hint of anything teetotalism there said hostler indicating younger of two men be young mr telfer a whose uncle owner o ' janissary be young plunger be be on janissary too give tip straight mornin ' put little bit on uncle colt ' said be right ai such pal with old man a be have got tip that money down on so neglect opportunity thomas ' say have be stoppin ' in house be young mr richard who be that be talking to bookmaker yes sir be naylor bob naylor be got mr richard bet p'raps be puttin ' on bit more now men at gate separated bookmaker walked off down street in fast gathering dusk richard telfer however entered house dorrington followed telfer mounted stair went into room dorrington lingered moment on stair then went knocked at telfer door hullo cried telfer coming to door peering out into gloomy corridor beg pardon dorrington replied courteously thought be naylor room no be by end believe be just gone down street dorrington expressed thanks went to own room took one two small instrument from bag hurried stealthily to door of be quiet door opened at once to dorrington picklock for there be nothing common tumbler rim lock to secure dorrington being altogether unscrupulous scoundrel must have thought nothing of entering man room thus for purpose of mere robbery much le scruple have in doing so in present circumstance lit candle in little pocket lantern having secured door looked quickly about room there be nothing unusual to attract attention turned to two bag lying near dressing table one be usual bookmaker satchel other be leather travelling bag be locked dorrington unbuckled strap of large bag produced slender picklock of steel wire with sliding joint with little skilful humouring turned lock in course of minute two one glance inside be enough there on top lay large false beard of strong red upon shirt below be pair of spectacle dorrington went farther felt carefully below linen till hand met small flat mahogany box withdrew opened within on velvet lining lay small silver instrument resembling syringe shut replaced box having rearranged content of bag shut locked strapped blew out light have found what came to look for in minute mr bob naylor door be locked behind dorrington took picklocks to own room be noisy evening in commercial room at crown chaff laughter flew thick richard telfer threatened naylor with terrible settling day more be drunk than thirst strictly justified everybody grew friendly with everybody else dorrington sober keenly alert affected reverse exhibited especial extreme affection for mr bob naylor advance be unsuccessful at first dorrington manner crown whisky overcame bookmaker reserve at about eleven o'clock two left house arm in arm for cooling stroll in high street dorrington blabbed chattered with great success soon began about janissary so have pretty well done want with janissary eh book full ah nothing like keeping book even round be safest way bepecially with colt a janissary about eh boy nudged naylor genially ah doubt be good colt old telfer have rum notion about preparation have dunno replied naylor how do mean why what doe have horse led up down behind stable for hour afternoon did know did ah doe came across only afternoon be coming over down just a got round behind telfer stable there saw fine bay colt with white stocking on off hind leg well covered up in suit of clothes being led up down by lad like sentry up down up down about twenty yard way nobody else about 'hullo say to lad what horse be ' 'janissary say boy pretty free for stable lad 'ah say 'and what be walking like for ' 'dunno say boy 'but be guv'nor order afternoon at two to minute have to bring out here walk like for hour exactly neither more le then go in have handful of malt dunno why 'well ' say never heard of being done before be fine colt put hand under cloth felt hard a nail smooth a silk boy let touch yes struck a bit easy for stable boy be odd trick be that of half hour walk handful of malt never hear of anybody else doing did never did talked strolled for quarter of hour then finished up with one more drink iv next be day before race in morning dorrington making circuit came to mr warren telfer from farther side a soon a be assured of privacy have seen man with red beard morning asked dorrington looked out pretty sharply too be right if like to fall in with suggestion however will see at about two o'clock take handsome rise out of very well mr telfer replied what be suggestion will tell in first place what be value of other horse look so like janissary hamid be name be worth well what will fetch will sell for fifty be glad of chance very good then will doubt be glad to risk health temporarily to make sure of redbury stake to get longer price for anything may like to put on between now to morrow afternoon come to stable will tell first be there place where may command view of ground behind stable without being seen yes there be ventilation grating at back of stall good then will watch from hamid stall will be empty select most wooden faced most careful boy send out behind stable with hamid at two o'clock to moment put horse in full suit of clothes be necessary to cover up white star tell lad must lead up down slowly for twenty yard so rather expect red bearded man will be coming along between two o'clock half past two will understand hamid be to be janissary for occasion must drill boy to appear bit of fool to overcome stable education sufficiently to chatter freely so long a be proper chatter man may ask horse name may not way boy must forget be janissary be leading have odd fad must know boy must know too in matter of training ridiculous fad be to have colt walked up down for hour exactly at two o'clock afternoon then given handful of malt a come in boy can talk a freely about a plea also about colt chance anything else like be to let stranger come up talk to horse pat in short to do a plea be that plain perfectly have found out something about red bearded chap then oh yes be bookmaker a matter of fact with false beard what naylor yes see idea of course once naylor think have nobbled favourite will lay to extent odds will get longer then can make pay for little game well yes of course though must put too much with naylor in case be not big man might break lose lot can get out of others just so 'd better see about schooling boy now think will tell more presently minute two before two o'clock dorrington telfer mounted on pair of step be gazing through ventilation grating of hamid stall while colt clothed completely be led round then dorrington described operation of previous evening matter what may think of tale said naylor will be pretty sure to come have tried to bribe stableman have be baffled attempt to get hold of boy in charge of janissary have failed will be glad to clutch at shadow of chance to save money now once be here favourite apparently at mercy thing be done by way expect nephew little present to man sacked be fairly innocent one doubt merely asked man whether janissary be keeping well be thought good enough to win for find be backing pretty heavily naylor came afterwards with much le innocent intention fortunately be down on in time several consideration induced to go to room in first place have heard rather shady tale of doings on one two occasion did not seem sufficiently big man to stand to lose great deal over horse then when saw observed that figure bore considerable resemblance to of man have described except a regard red beard spectacle article easily enough assumed indeed often enough used by scum of ring whose trade be welshing apart from consideration here at rate be one man who have interest in keeping colt from winning here be room waiting for to explore so explored card turned up trump a be speaking stable boy stolid looking youngster be leading hamid back forth on turf before eye there be somebody said dorrington suddenly over in clump of tree yes man sure enough felt pretty sure of after have told that have thought worth while to turn up morning here come naylor with red beard sticking out over collar of big coat came slouching along with awkwardly assumed air of carelessness absence of mind hullo said suddenly a came abreast of horse turning a though now aware of presence be valuable sort of horse ai lad yes said boy be be goin ' to win redbury stake to morrow be janissary oh janey sairey be naylor answered with quaint affectation of gaping ignorance janey sairey eh well do look fine what can see of what suit o clo'es ' so be one o ' 'orses run in race be well never pretty much like other 'orses too to look at ai only bit thin in leg boy stood carelessly by colt side man approached hand came quickly from inner pocket then passed under hamid cloth near shoulder ah do feel lovely skin to be sure said ' so there be goin ' to be race at redbury to morrow be there dunno anythin ' about race ' oo naylor sprang back a horse flinging back ear started suddenly swung round reared lor said what vicious brute jist because stroked will be careful about touching racehorse again hand passed stealthily to pocket again hurried on way while stable boy steadied soothed hamid illustration horse started suddenly swung round reared telfer dorrington sniggered quietly in concealment be taken deal of trouble have dorrington remarked be sad case of biter bit for mr naylor be afraid be prick colt felt hypodermic injection with syringe saw in bag doubt boy wo be such fool a to come in again at once will if naylor taking look back from anywhere may make suspicious fear have told to keep out for half hour will do dear dear what innocent person mr bob naylor be 'well never pretty much like other horse did know there be to be race at redbury 'janey sairey ' too be really very funny ere half hour be quite over hamid came stumbling dragging into stable yard plainly amiss collapsed on litter a soon a gained stall there lay shivering drowsy expect will get over in day two dorrington remarked suppose vet must do much for just now except perhaps give drench let take rest certainly effect will last over to morrow be what be calculated for v redbury stake be run at three in afternoon after two three minor event have be disposed of betting have undergone considerable fluctuation during morning in general ruled heavily against janissary story have got about too that mr warren telfer colt must not start so that when number went up be seen that janissary be starting after there be much astonishment good deal of uneasiness in ring be pity ca see friend naylor face just now be dorrington remarked to client a looked on from mr telfer drag yes must be interesting telfer replied be quite confident last night say quite tested by offer of small bet on colt asking point over odds took at once indeed believe have be going about gathering up wager must about janissary market have felt nephew have risked more with believe altogether look a though town must spoil 'bookies badly a horse came from weighing enclosure janissary be seen conspicuous among bright clean firm good many face lengthened at sight start be not so good a might have be favourite starting price have gone to even be not left got away well in crowd of ten starter there lay till rounding bend when telfer blue chocolate be seen among foremost near rail mr telfer almost trembled a watched through glass hang that willett said almost to be too clever against rail before getting clear right though all right be coming illustration came in three length winner janissary indeed be showing in front a horse came along straight be plain that mr telfer colt be holding field comfortably there be change in crowd dropped away came out attempted to challenge for lead favourite striding easily be never seriously threatened in end being little let out came in three length winner never once having be made to show best congratulate mr telfer said dorrington may congratulate certainly certainly said mr telfer hastily hurrying off to lead in winner be bad race for ring in open part of course many humble fielder grabbed satchel ere shouting be over made best pace for horizon more than one pair of false whisker a red a naylor came off suddenly while owner betook to fresh stand unless good many outsider sailed home before end of week there must be bad monday for layer sporting redbury be jubilant have be on local favourite for local race have won vi mr bob naylor got bit back in own phrase on other race by end of week same saw black settling day ahead have be done done for certainty have realised a soon a saw number go up for redbury stake janissary have not be drugged after meant that horse have be substituted for that whole thing be elaborate plant thought knew janissary pretty well by sight too rather prided on having eye for horse clearly be plant complete do telfer be in so of course be that gentlemanly stranger who have strolled along redbury high street with night telling that cock bull story about afternoon walk handful of malt there be nice schoolboy tale to take in man who thought broad a cheapside cursed high low to be done to know be galling thing must be worse tale must get about must boast of clever stroke like must injure with everybody with honest men because reputation a be must bear worsening with knave like because must laugh at leave out when little co operative swindle be in contemplation though chagrin of defeat be bitter bad enough loss be worse have taken everything offered on janissary after have nobbled wrong horse have given almost odds demanded do a might must see nothing balance against on monday though might pay out last cent must not cover by several hundred pound on day met customer at club a usual paid out freely young richard telfer however with whom be heavily in put off till evening have be bit disappointed morning over ready be to be paid over said have used last cheque form in book might come have bit of dinner with to night mr telfer take then telfer assented without difficulty all right then be settled know place gold street seven sharp missis will be pleased to see be sure mr telfer let see be fifteen hundred thirty altogether be yes that be will come young telfer left club at corner of street ran against dorrington telfer of course knew a late fellow guest at crown at redbury be first meeting in london after return from race ah said telfer going to draw bit of janissary money eh oh have much to draw dorrington answered expect pocket be pretty heavy if have just come from naylor yes have just come from naylor have touched merry sovs just yet replied telfer cheerfully there be be run on naylor be going to dine with respectable missis evening draw plunder then feel rather curious to see what sort of establishment man like naylor keep going place be in gold street chelsea yes believe so anyhow congratulate on haul wish merry evening two men parted dorrington have indeed few pound to draw a result of fishing bet with naylor now resolved to ask for money at own time invitation to telfer took attention reminded oddly of circumstance detailed in report of inquest on lawrence transcribed at beginning of paper have cut out report at time appeared because saw certain singularity about case have filed a have done hundred of other such cutting now certain thing led to fancy that might be much interested to observe proceeding at naylor house on evening after bad settling day resolved to gratify with strict professional watch in gold street evening on chance of something coming of for be important thing in dorrington rascally trade to get hold of a much of other people private business a possible to know exactly in what cupboard to find man skeleton for there be knowing might be turned into money sooner later so found number of naylor house from handiest directory at six o'clock little disguised by humbler style of dress than usual began watch naylor house be at corner of turning with flank wall blank of window except for one at top public house stood at opposite corner dorrington skilled in watching without attracting attention to now lounged in public house bar now stood at street corner now sauntered along street picture of vacancy of mind looking apparently at everything in turn except house at corner first thing noted be issuing forth from area step of healthy looking girl in much gaily be ribboned finery plainly servant taking evening out be odd thing that servant must be allowed out on evening when guest be expected to dinner house looked like one where be more likely that one servant must be kept than two dorrington hurried after girl changing manner of address to of civil labourer said beg pardon miss be mary walker still in service at 'ouse mary walker said girl why never 'eard name there ai nobody in service there beg pardon must be wrong 'ouse be cousin miss be dorrington left girl returned to public house a reached perceived second noticeable thing although be broad daylight there be now light behind solitary window at top of side wall of naylor house dorrington slipped through swing door of public house watched through glass be bare room behind high window might have be bathroom interior be made dimly visible from outside by light tall thin woman be setting up ordinary pair of house step in middle of room done turned to window pulled down blind a did so dorrington noted very extreme thinness of face body when blind be down light still remained within again there seemed significance in appeared that thin woman have waited until servant have gone before doing whatever have to do in room presently watcher came again into gold street from there caught passing glimpse of thin woman a moved busily about front room over breakfast parlour clearly then light above have be left for future use dorrington thought for minute then suddenly stopped with snap of finger saw now here be something altogether in way must take daring course withdrew once more to public house ordering drink took up position in compartment from must command view of gold street side turning time now saw by watch be ten minute to seven have to wait rather more than quarter of hour before seeing richard telfer come walking jauntily down gold street mount step knock at naylor door there be momentary glimpse of thin woman face at door then telfer entered now began to grow dusk in about twenty minute more dorrington took to street again room over breakfast parlour be clearly dining room be lighted brightly by intent listening watcher must distinguish now again sudden burst of laughter from telfer followed by deeper grunt of naylor voice once by sharp tone that seemed natural to suppose be thin woman dorrington waited no longer slipped pair of thick sock foot over shoe after quick look along two street to make sure nobody be near descended area step there be light in breakfast parlour with knife opened window catch raised sash quietly stepped over sill stood in dark room within be quiet except for talking in room above have done what many thief parlour jumper do day there be more ahead made way silently to basement passage passed into kitchen room be lighted cookery utensil be scattered about nobody be there waited till heard request in naylor gruff voice for slice of something noiselessly mounted stair noticed that dining room door be ajar passed quickly on to second flight rested on landing above mr naylor must probably have to go downstairs once twice again did not expect anybody in upper part of house just yet there be small flight of stair above landing whereon stood leading to servant bedroom bathroom took glance at bathroom with feeble lamp step open ceiling trap returned again to bedroom landing there stood waiting watchfully twice thin woman emerged from dining room went downstairs came up again time with food plate then went down once more be longer gone meantime naylor telfer be talking joking loudly at table when once again dorrington saw crown of thin woman head rising over bottom stair perceived that bore tray set with cup already filled with coffee carried into dining room whence presently came sound of striking match after conversation seemed to flag telfer part in grew le le till ceased altogether house be silent except for sound of heavy breathing soon became almost snore then there be sudden noisy tumble a of drunken man still snoring went on naylors be talking in whisper there be shuffling heaving sound chair be knocked over then at dining room door appeared naylor walking backward carrying inert form of telfer by shoulder while thin woman followed supporting foot dorrington retreated up small stair flight cocking pocket revolver a went up stair came naylor puffing grunting with exertion telfer still snoring soundly on till at last having mounted top flight came in at bathroom door where dorrington stood to receive smiling bowing pleasantly with hat in one hand revolver in other woman from position saw first dropped telfer leg with scream naylor turned head then also dropped end drugged man fell in heap snoring still naylor astounded choking made a if to rush at interloper dorrington thrust revolver into face exclaimed still smiling courteously mind mind be dangerous thing be revolver apt to go off if run against stood thus for second then stepped forward took woman who seemed like to swoon by arm pulled into room come mr naylor said be not one of fainting sort think 'd better keep two such clever people a under eye one of may get into mischief come now naylor will talk business naylor now white a ghost sat on edge of bath stared at dorrington a though in fascination of terror hand rested on bath at side odd sound of gurgling came from thick throat will talk business dorrington resumed come have met before now know at redbury ca have forgotten janissary walking exercise handful of malt be afraid be clumsy sort of rascal naylor though do best be rascal myself though often confess assure that conception be crude a yet still be bad notion in way that of drugging man drowning in cistern up there in roof when prefer not to pay winning have very considerable merit after body have be fished out of river may choose to fling into stupid coroner jury will never suspect that be drowned in other water just a happened in lawrence case for instance remember that eh so do very well be because remembered that paid visit to night do thing much too clumsily really when saw light up here in broad daylight knew at once must be left for purpose to be executed later in evening when saw step carefully placed at same time after servant have be sent out why thing be plain remembering a did curious coincidence that mr lawrence be drowned very evening have be here to take away winning step must be intended to give access to roof where there be probably tank to feed bath what more secret place to drown man than there what easier place so long a man be well drugged there be strong lid to tank a say naylor notion be meritorious execution be wretched perhaps because have notion be watching paused then went on come said collect scattered faculty of sha hand over to police for little invention of yours be too useful invention to give away to police sha hand over be to say a long a do a tell if get mutinous will hang of for lawrence business may a well tell that be bit of scoundrel by way of profession boast about be well to be frank in making arrangement of sort be going to take into service employ few agent tank may come in very handy from time to time must set up with few improvement in house house have quite such awkward window must execute little suppression so regularly on settling day look suspicious so a soon a can get faculty together will talk over thing man woman have exchanged glance during speech now naylor asked huskily jerking thumb toward man on floor ' what about 'im what about why get rid of a soon a like not way though pointed toward ceiling trap doe pay be master now besides what will people say when tell same tale at inquest that told at lawrence friend bookmaking murder assort together profitable a combination may seem settling day be too regular be not going to be accomplice mind be going to be mine do what please with telfer leave on somebody doorstep if like owe fifteen hundred ai got more than half of will be ruined very likely dorrington returned placidly be ruined a soon a possible then devote time to business be not to ornament ring longer remember be to assist private inquiry agent wife charming tank repudiate debt if like be mere gaming transaction there be legal claim leave in street tell be be robbed please a to little roguery may a well for be last will do on own account for future respectable talent

bottle have be druggist ordinary flat bottle graduated with dose mark altogether seven inch high thereabout have without doubt contained chloroform wherewith lon bouvier have be assaulted a dorrington have judged from smell of cork fact of bottle being corked showed that chloroform have not be bought at once since in case must have be put up in stoppered bottle more probably have be procured in very small quantity ostensibly for toothache something of kind at different druggist put together in larger bottle have originally be used for something else bottle have be distinguished by label usual white label affixed by druggist with direction a to taking medicine label have be scraped off except small piece at bottom edge by right hand side whereon might be just distinguished greater

thoroughfare end in n be mostly street lane court see there seems to be only one druggist in hatton garden capital fellow doubt one whose name address observe on bottle on mantelpiece dorrington stood with foot on chair tapped knee carelessly with stick hamer dropped into other chair regarded with frown though face be pale presently said in strained voice well yes there be something else mr hamer a appear to suggest see be wearing new pair of glass morning pity broke others last night have brought piece left behind gathered up broken bottle held up piece of concave lens think after be really best to use cord with pince nez be awkward catch in thing know save breakage be liable to get glass knocked off know in certain circumstance hamer sprang to foot with snarl slammed door locked turned

peddling detail well suppose have got suppose refuse to give what then what then why must talk of unpleasant thing wo refuse know do mean 'd get out of by help of pistol well said dorrington deliberately pistol be noisy make mess be useful thing might do with know in certain circumstance be thinking of there be much le troublesome way be slower man than took for mr hamer perhaps have quite appreciated yet if be to go to window call police what with little bit of evidence in pocket other little bit that druggist who sold chloroform must give other bit in reserve prefer not to talk about just now there must be rather awkwardly complete case of robbery with violence must there 'd have to lose diamond after to say nothing of little rest in gaol general ruination that sound very well what about client come now call man of world be one how will client account for possession of diamond worth eighty thousand pound so doe seem millionaire police must want to know about a well a about if be fool a to bring in where did steal eh dorrington smiled bowed at question be very good card to play mr hamer said capital card really to superficial observer might look like winning trick think can trump bent farther forward tapped table with pistol barrel suppose care one solitary dump what becomes of client suppose care whether go to gaol stay out of in short suppose prefer own

at first sight want rare lot of capital then prospectus well have seen more satisfactory one know say be all right of course still sha go out of way to recommend friend of mine to plunge on wo wo

with pacing machinery will come dorrington expressed delighted suggested that stedman must dine with before going to track stedman for part charmed with new acquaintance a everybody be at first meeting with dorrington assented gladly at moment door of stedman room be pushed open well dressed middle aged man with shaven flabby face appeared beg pardon said thought be alone have just ripped finger against handle of brougham door a came in screw stick out have piece of sticking plaster extended bleeding finger a spoke stedman looked doubtfully at desk here be court plaster dorrington exclaimed producing pocket book always carry be handier than ordinary sticking plaster how much do want thanks inch so be mr dorrington of messrs dorrington hick mr mallow stedman said managing director mr paul mallow mr dorrington dorrington be delighted to make mr mallow acquaintance busied with careful strapping of damaged finger mr mallow have large frame of man of strong build who have have much hard bodily work there hung about heavier softer flesh that told of later period of ease sloth ah mr mallow stedman said bicycle safest thing after dangerous thing brougham ah younger men mr mallow replied with slow rounded enunciation younger men can afford to be active elder can afford brougham dorrington added before managing director began next word just so bicycle doe wonderful thing bicycle dorrington have not misjudged man oblique reference to wealth flattered mr mallow dorrington went once more through report a to spoke patent then mr mallow bade good bye good day mr dorrington good day said be extremely obliged by careful personal attention to matter of patent may leave with mr stedman now think good day hope soon to have pleasure of meeting again with clumsy stateliness mr mallow vanished ii so think 'avalanche good business a investment dorrington said once more a stedman after excellent dinner be cabbing to track stedman answered touch there be better thing than coming along presently perhaps will be able to put in for something know bit later be in hurry a to 'avalanche even if everything else be satisfactory there be too much 'booming ' being done just now to please sort of rumour know of having something 'up sleeve so on mysterious hint in paper that a to something revolutionary being in hand with 'avalanche people perhaps there be why fetch out in view of public subscription for share be more than can understand unless want too much of rush a to well look like modestly shrinking from anything of sort up to present be at track soon after seven o'clock gillett be not yet riding dorrington remarked that gillett appeared to begin late well stedman explained be one of fellow afternoon training doe seem to suit unless be bit of walking exercise just doe few mile in morning spurt two then come on just before sunset for fast ten fifteen mile be when be getting fit for such race a saturday to night will be last spin of length before saturday because to morrow will be day before race to morrow will only go spurt two rest most of day strolled about inside track two highly banked end whereof seemed to nearsighted person in centre to be solid erect wall along face of training rider skimmed fly fashion only three four person beside be in enclosure when first came in ten minute time mr paul mallow came across track why said stedman to dorrington here be governor be often come down here expect be anxious to see how gillett going in view of saturday good evening mr mallow said dorrington hope finger right want more plaster good evening good evening responded mr mallow heavily thank finger not troubling bit held up still decorated by black plaster plaster remains see be little careful not to fray too much in washing be mr mallow sat down on light iron garden chair of several stood here there in enclosure began to watch riding track be clear dusk be approaching when at last great gillett made appearance on track answered friendly question two put to by mallow stedman then giving coat to trainer swung off along track on bicycle led in front by tandem closely attended by triplet in fifty yard pace quickened settled down into swift even pace regular a clockwork sometimes tandem sometimes triplet went to front gillett checked heeded a nursed by pacer who be directed by trainer from centre swept along mile after mile mile in few second over two minute look at action exclaimed stedman with enthusiasm just watch not ounce of power wasted there did ever see more regular ankle work did anybody ever sit machine quite so well a show movement anywhere above hip ah said mr mallow gillett have wonderful style wonderful style really men in enclosure wandered about here there on grass watching gillett riding a one watch performance of great piece of art indeed be what gillett riding be there be besides mallow stedman dorrington trainer two official of cyclist union amateur racing man named spark track superintendent man sky grew darker gloom fell about track machine became invisible little must be seen of rider across ground row of rhythmically working leg white cap gillett wore trainer have just told stedman that there must be three fast lap then man must come off track well mr stedman said mr mallow think will be right for saturday rather answered stedman confidently gillett be going great gun steady a watch pace now suddenly increased tandem shot once more to front triplet hung on rider flank group of swishing wheel flew round track at one fifty gait spectator turned about following rider round track with eye then swinging into straight from top bend tandem checked suddenly gave little jump gillett crashed into from behind triplet failing to clear wavered swung crashed over along track too three machine six men be involved in one complicated smash everybody rushed across grass trainer first then cause of disaster be seen lying on side on track with men bicycle piled over against be one of green painted light iron garden chair have be standing in enclosure triplet men be struggling to foot though much cut shaken seemed least hurt of lot one of men of tandem be insensible gillett who from position have got worst of lay senseless too badly cut bruised left arm be broken trainer be cursing tearing hair if knew who 'd done stedman cried 'd pulp with chair oh that betting that betting wailed mr mallow hopping about distractedly see what lead people into doing ca have be accident can accident skittle man doe put chair on track in dark leave there by accident be anybody getting away there from outside of track there be nobody must wait till be clear off minute ago more here fielder shut outer gate will see who be about there seemed to be suspicious character indeed except for ground man boy gillett trainer racing man who have just finished dressing in pavilion there seemed to be nobody about beyond whom everybody have seen standing in enclosure there have be ample time for anybody standing unnoticed at outer rail to get across track in dark just after rider have passed place obstruction escape before completion of lap damaged men be helped carried into pavilion damaged machine be dragged after will give fifty pound gladly more hundred said mr mallow excitedly to anybody who will find out who put chair on track might have ended in murder wretched bookmaker suppose who have taken too many bet on gillett a have said thousand time betting be curse of sport nowadays governor excites great deal about betting bookmaker stedman said to dorrington a walked toward pavilion between believe of 'avalanche people be in betting bee be always in mallow bonnet a matter of fact there be very little betting at on cycle race what there be be little more than matter of half crown at most half sovereign on day of race bookmaker ever make heavy book first still there may be something in time of course look at 'avalanche people with gillett away man can certainly win on saturday if only weather keep fair can almost a certainly beat record just at present fifty mile be fairly easy be bound to go soon indeed intention be that gillett must pull down on saturday be safe winner bar accident be good odds on altering record if weather be good at with gillett out of lant be just about a certain winner a man must be if be well there must be boom for 'avalanche company on very eve of share subscription lant must know be very second rate till season have improved wonderfully in last month two since have be with 'avalanche people let win can point to machine a responsible for 'here ' will say in effect 'be man who must rarely get in front even in second class company till rode 'avalanche now beat world record for fifty mile on make ring round topmost professional why will be worth thousand of capital to of course subscription of capital wo hurt loss of record may to have gillett knocked out like in middle of season be serious yes suppose with be more than matter of one race of course so will be with 'avalanche company see with gillett probably useless for rest of season lant will have own way at anything over ten mile will help to boom up share there will be big profit made on trading in oh tell thing seems pretty suspicious to look here said dorrington can borrow light for let run over with to spot where smash took place people have cleared into pavilion must go alone certainly will have try for governor hundred well perhaps anyway there be harm in doing good turn if can while be here day perhaps will do one right be will ask fielder ground man lantern be brought dorrington betook to spot where iron chair still lay while stedman joined rest of crowd in pavilion dorrington minutely examined grass within two yard of place where chair lay then crossing track getting over rail did same with damp gravel paved outer ring track be of cement unimpressionable by footmark nevertheless scrutinised that with equal care a well a rail then turned attention to chair be a have said light chair made of flat iron strip bent to shape riveted have seen good service present coat of green paint be evidently far from being original one also be rusty in place part have be repaired strengthened with cross piece secured by bolt square nut rusty loose be from one of square nut holding cross piece stayed back at top that dorrington secured object might have be hair carefully transferred to pocket book done with one more glance round betook to pavilion surgeon have arrived reported well of chief patient be simple fracture healthy subject when dorrington entered preparation be beginning for setting limb there be sofa in pavilion surgeon saw reason for removing patient till be made secure found anything asked stedman in low tone of dorrington dorrington shook head not much answered at whisper will think over later dorrington asked one of cyclist union official for loan of pencil having made note with immediately in part of room asked spark amateur to lend stedman have told mr mallow of dorrington late employment with lantern managing director now said quietly remember what said about rewarding anybody who discovered perpetrator of outrage mr dorrington well be excited at time quite hold to be shameful thing have be looking about ground hear hope have come across something will enable to find something out nothing will please more than to have to pay be sure well dorrington confessed be afraid have seen anything very big in way of clue mr mallow will think bit worst of be never know who betting men be do once get away there be so many may be anybody not only that may bribe anybody yes of course there be end to wickedness be afraid stedman suggests that trade rivalry may have have something to do with that seems uncharitable view think of course stand very high there be jealousy be thing be sure firm must think of stooping to for moment no be betting be at bottom of fear hope mr dorrington that will make attempt to find guilty party presently stedman spoke to dorrington again here be something may help said to begin with must have be done by one from outside of track why well at least probability way everybody inside be directly interested in gillett success excepting union official spark who be gentleman quite above suspicion a much so indeed a union official of course there be ground man be right be sure trainer oh be altogether improbable altogether be going to say there be that other man who be standing about have heard who be right be know where be now man have gone look here will make quiet inquiry about man stedman pursued forgot about in excitement of moment be going to say that although whoever did must easily have got away by gate before smash came might not have liked to go way in case of observation in passing pavilion in case must have got away indeed must have got into ground to begin with by way of one of garden wall bound ground just by where smash occurred if be so must either live in one of house must know somebody doe perhaps might put man to smell about along road be only short one chisnall road name yes yes dorrington responded patiently there might be something in by time gillett arm be in starched bandage secured by splint cab be ready to take home mr mallow took stedman away with expressing desire to talk business dorrington went home by did not turn down road walked jauntily along toward nearest cab stand once twice chuckled for saw way to delightfully lucrative financial operation in cycle company without risk of capital cab gained called at lodging of two of men assistant gave instant instruction then packed small bag at room in conduit street at midnight be in late fast train for birmingham iii prospectus of avalanche bicycle tyre company stated that work be at exeter birmingham exeter be delightful old town can scarcely be regarded a centre of cycle trade be in especially easy short communication with birmingham be sort of thing that critic anxious to pick hole in prospectus might wonder at so one of dorrington assistant have gone by night mail to inspect work be from man dorrington in birmingham about noon on day after gillett disaster received telegram work here old disused cloth mill just out of town closed empty with big new signboard notice work now running be at birmingham agent say only deposit paid tenancy agreement not signed farrish telegram increased dorrington satisfaction for have just taken look at birmingham work be not empty though nearly so be large man there have told that chief premise where most of work be done be at exeter hollower business better prize saw in store for have already early in morning indulged in telegram on own account though have not signed be how ran mallow upper sandown place london w fear not safe here run down by train without fail thus happened that at little later than half past eight dorrington other assistant watching door of upper sandown place saw telegram delivered immediately afterward mr paul mallow in much haste dashed away in cab be called from end of street assistant followed in mr mallow dismissed cab at theatrical wig maker in bow street entered when emerged in little more than forty minute time none practised watcher who have guessed reason of visit must have recognised have not assumed clumsy disguise of false beard be made up deftly colour be heightened face seemed thinner there be heavy accession of false hair slight crpe hair whisker at side made better le pronounced disguise seemed younger healthier man watcher saw safely off to birmingham by ten minute past ten train then gave dorrington note by telegraph of guise in mr mallow be travelling now train be timed to arrive at birmingham at one be reason that dorrington have named in anonymous telegram entrance to avalanche work be by large gate be closed be provided with small door to pas man within be yard at little before one o'clock dorrington pushed open small door peeped entered nobody be about in yard what little noise must be heard came from particular part of building on right pile of solid export crate stood to left dorrington have noted at previous call morning a making suitable hiding place for temporary use now slipped behind awaited stroke of one prompt at hour door on opposite side of yard swung open two men boy emerged climbed one after through little door in big gate then presently man not workman apparently sort of overseer came from opposite door carelessly let fall to behind also disappeared through little door then locked dorrington be now alone in sole active work of avalanche bicycle tyre company limited tried door opposite found be free to open within saw in dark corner candle have be left burning opposite large iron enamelling oven like immense safe round about on bench be strewn heap of glaring red gold transfer dorrington have observed day before on machine exhibited in holborn viaduct window of frame have label newly applied others be still plain must seem that chief business of avalanche bicycle tyre company limited be attaching of label to previously nondescript machine there be little time to examine further indeed dorrington presently heard noise of key in outer gate so stood waited by enamelling oven to welcome mr mallow a door be pushed open dorrington advanced bowed politely mallow started guiltily remembering disguise steadied asked gruffly well sir who be answered dorrington with perfect composure be mr paul mallow may have heard of in connection with 'indestructible bicycle company mallow be altogether taken aback then struck that perhaps detective anxious to win reward have offered in matter of gillett outrage be here making inquiry in assumed character of man who stood impenetrably disguised before so after pause asked again little le gruffly what may be business well said dorrington did think of taking share in company suppose there must be objection to managing director of company taking share in answered mallow wondering what be to lead to of course not be sure think so eh dorrington a spoke looked in other face with sly leer mallow began to feel altogether uncomfortable there be one other thing dorrington pursued taking out pocket book though still maintaining leer in mallow face one other thing by way will have piece of court plaster now have got out say no be pleasure to oblige really dorrington leer growing positively fiendish tapped side of nose with case of court plaster illustration tapped side of nose with case mallow paled under paint gasped felt for support dorrington laughed pleasantly come come said be frightened admire cleverness mr mallow will arrange everything pleasantly a will see a to court plaster if 'd rather not have need have piece on now see why did get to paint over at clarkson really did face very well though there again be quite right man a yourself be likely to be recognised in such place a birmingham must have be unfortunate for of of assure man alive look a though be going to cut throat be not assure be smart man of business happen to have spotted little operation of yours be will arrange easy term for pull together talk business before men come back here sit on bench mallow staring amazedly in dorrington face suffered to be led to bench sat on now said dorrington first thing be little matter of hundred pound be reward promised if must discover who broke gillett arm last night well have do happen to have note with if not make cheque how mean who who tut tut waste time mr mallow who why of course knew about before left last night though be quite convenient to claim reward then for reason will understand presently come that little hundred what what proof have be not to be bounced like know mr mallow be gathering faculty again proof why man alive be reasonable suppose have none none at what difference doe that make be to walk out tell fellow director where have met here be to have hundred more be to publish abroad that mr paul mallow be moving spirit in rotten bicycle company well mallow answered reluctantly if put like only put like to make see thing reasonably a matter of fact connection with new company be enough to bring little performance with iron chair pretty near proof got at from other side see here be much too clumsy with finger mr mallow first go tear tip of middle finger opening brougham door have to get court plaster from then let that court plaster get frayed at edge still keep on after that execute very successful chair operation when eye of others be following bicycle take chair in hand with plaster on catching hold of at place where rough loose square nut protrudes pitch on to track so clumsily nervously that nut carry away frayed thread of court plaster with here be see still in pocket book where put last night by light of lantern just sticky black silk thread be have only brought to show be playing fair game with of course might easily have got witness before took thread off nut if have thought be likely to fight matter knew be not ca fight know with bogus company business known to so be only showing thread a act of grace to prove have stumped with perfect fairness now hundred here be fountain pen if want one well said mallow glumly suppose must then took pen wrote cheque dorrington blotted on pad of pocket book folded away so much for that said that be just little preliminary understand have done little thing just a guarantee of good faith not necessarily for publication though must remember that a yet there be nothing to prevent have done turn by finding out who upset bicycle a so ardently wished to do last night have loyally fulfilled part of contract by paying promised reward though must say that have paid with delight pleasure spoke of at time will forgive that now that little hors d'oeuvre be disposed of will proceed to serious business mallow looked uncomfortably glum must look so ashamed of know dorrington said purposely misinterpreting glumness be business be disposed for little side flutter so to speak little speculation outside regular business well must be ashamed of mallow observed assuming something of ordinarily ponderous manner of course not be little speculative deal everybody doe there be deal of money going precisely since everybody doe there be so much money going be only making share of course mr mallow be almost pompous by now of course dorrington coughed slightly well now do know be exactly same sort of man a if mind comparison be disposed for little side flutter so to speak little speculation outside regular business also be not ashamed of since everybody doe there be so much money going why be thinking of making share so be evidently pair naturally intended for other mr paul mallow here looked little doubtful see here now dorrington proceeded have lately taken into head to operate little on cycle share market be why came round about little spoke affair instead of sending assistant wanted to know somebody who understood cycle trade from whom might get tip see be perfectly frank with well have succeeded uncommonly well want to understand have gone step of way by fair work took nothing for granted played game fairly when asked a have anxious reason to ask if have found anything told there be nothing very big see what little thing thread be before came away from pavilion made sure that be really only man there with black court plaster on finger have noticed hand of man two made excuse of borrowing something to see saw thin pretence of suspecting betting men played up to have have telegraphic report on exeter work morning deserted cloth mill with nothing on of yours signboard only deposit of rent paid there referred to work here here referred to work there be very clever really also have have telegraphic report of make up adventure morning clarkson doe marvellously doe by way that telegram bringing down to birmingham be not from confederate here a perhaps fancied be from thanks for coming so promptly managed to get quiet look round here just before arrived on whole conclusion come to a to 'avalanche bicycle tyre company limited ' be clever man whom give great pleasure to know with bow to mallow conceives notion of offering public very rottenest cycle company ever planned without appearing in find what little capital be required two three confederate help to make up board of director with one two titled guinea pig who know nothing of company care nothing rest professional racing man be employed to win race make record on machine have be specially made by firm perhaps be 'indestructible who know to private order afterwards decorated with name style of bogus company on transfer for ordinary sale bicycle of 'trade description be bought so much hundred from factor put own name on come cheap sell at good price profit pay expense perhaps bit over by time break down company will be successfully floated money capital will be divided moving spirit confederate will have disappeared guinea pig will be left to stand racket if there be racket moving spirit will remain unsuspected man of account in trade time admirable work to be done at 'works be sticking on of label bit of enamelling excellent round be that about size of operation well yes mallow answered little reluctantly with something of modest pride in manner be notion since speak so plainly will be notion everything will be a have planned with one exception be moving spirit will divide plunder with why gave hundred just now dear dear why will harp so much on vulgar little hundred that settled done with be little personal bargain in matter of lamentable accident with chair be now talking of bigger business not hundred thousand not one of lot come now mind like yours must be wide enough to admit of broad large view of thing if refrain from exposing charming scheme of yours will be promoting piece of scandalous robbery very well then want promotion money in regular way can shut eye allow piece of iniquity like to go on unchecked without getting anything by way of damage for perish thought when expense be paid confederate be sent off with a little a will take will divide fairly mr mallow respectable brother in rascality mind might say 'd divide to begin with leave to pay expense be always fair to partner in anything of sort will just want little guarantee know be safest in such matter a say bill at six month for ten thousand pound be very low when satisfactory division be made will have bill back come have bill stamp ready being so much convinced of reasonableness a to buy morning though cost five pound be nonsense be trying to impose will give anything reasonable half be out of question what after trouble worry risk that have have must suffice for more than to put in gaol if held up finger hang be reasonable be mighty clever man have got on hip a admit say ten per cent be wasting time presently men will be back choice be between making half making none going to gaol into bargain choose just consider choose mallow looked despairingly about really said want money more than think for last time choose mallow despairing gaze stopped at enamelling oven well well said if must must suppose warn may regret dear be not so pessimistic come wrote cheque now will write bill month after date pay to order sum of ten thousand pound for value received excellent value too think there be when bill be written signed mallow scribbled acceptance with more readiness than might have be expected then rose said with something of brisk cheerfulness in tone well be done least said soonest mended have won wo grumble more think have done thing pretty neatly eh come see 'works other part of place be empty of machinery there be good many finished frame wheel bought separately now in course of being fitted together for sale there be many more complete bicycle of cheap showy make to nothing needed to be done to fix red gold transfer of avalanche company then mallow opened tall iron door of enamelling oven see said be enamelling oven get in look round frame other different part hang on rack after enamel be laid on gas jet be lighted to harden by heat do see that deeper part there by back go closer dorrington felt push at back door be swung to with bang latch dropped be in dark trapped in great iron chamber warned shouted mallow from without warned might regret instantly dorrington nostril be filled with smell of escaping gas realised peril on instant mallow have given bill with idea of silencing by murder recovering have pushed into oven have turned on gas be dark to light match must mean death instantly without match must be death by suffocation poison of gas in very few minute to appeal to mallow be useless dorrington knew too much must seem at last horribly fitting retribution have overtaken dorrington in death by mode parallel to creature have prepared for others dorrington victim have drowned in water at least crofton have for never ascertained definitely whether anybody have met death by tank after croftons have taken service with dorrington now dorrington be to drown in gas oven be of sheet iron fastened by latch in centre dorrington flung desperately against door gave outwardly at extreme bottom snatched loose angle iron with hand came in contact dashed against door once more thrust iron through where strained open then with tremendous plunge drove door little more outward raised angle iron in crack then once more raised again be near to losing sens when with one more plunge catch of latch not designed for such treatment suddenly gave way door flew open dorrington blue in face staring stumbling gasping came staggering out into fresher air followed by gush of gas illustration hauled struggling wretch across room mallow have retreated to room behind thither dorrington followed gaining vigour fury at step at sight of wretched mallow sank in corner sighing shivering with terror dorrington reached clutched by collar there must be more honour between two thief now must drag mallow forth proclaim aloud must keep bill hauled struggling wretch across room tearing off crpe whisker a came while mallow supplicated whined fearing that might be other design to imprison in enamelling oven at door of room against containing oven progress came to end for escaped gas have reached lighted candle with one loud report partition wall fell in half burying mallow where lay knocking dorrington over window fell out of building men broke through front gate climbed into ruined room stopped still escaping gas when two men boy returned with conspirator who have be in charge of work found crowd from hardware cycle factory thereabout surveying with great interest spectacle of extrication of mr paul mallow managing director of indestructible bicycle company from broken brick mortar bicycle transfer of avalanche bicycle tyre company limited preparation for carrying to surgeon where broken leg might be set a for dorrington crushed hat torn coat be hurt beyond few scratch in couple of hour be over birmingham spreading to other place that business of avalanche bicycle tyre company consisted of sticking brilliant label on factor bicycle bought in batch for whole thing be thrown open to general gaze by explosion so that when next day lant won fifty mile race in london be greeted with ironical shout of gum on yer transfer hi mind yer label where did steal that bicycle sold yer share so forth somehow avalanche bicycle tyre company limited never went to allotment be said that few people in remote benighted spot where news never came till be in history book have applied for share banker returned money doubtless to extreme disappointment be found politic also that mr paul mallow must retire from directorate of indestructible bicycle company concern be still believe flourishing exceedingly a for dorrington have hundred pound reward bill for never presented why altogether know unless found that mr mallow financial position a have hinted be not altogether so good a be supposed at rate be found among note telegram in case in dorrington deed box case of mr loftus deacon v case of mr loftus deacon be case helped to give dorrington much of reputation unfortunately too often enabled to profit far beyond extent to client intended occurred few year back there be such stir at time over mysterious death of mr loftus deacon that well paid dorrington to use utmost diligence in honest effort to uncover mystery gave one of best advertisement though indeed occasioned le trouble in unravelling than many le interesting case there be scarcely memoranda of affair among dorrington paper beyond entry of fee paid have almost entirely relied upon account given by mr stone manager in employ of firm owning premise in mr deacon died premise consisted of large building let out in expensive flat one of first place built

be why have not merely because be gold silver to shut up in strong room must be next thing to destroying altogether why not lock whole of collection in safe never look at be valuable if be not to be seen must rather have money cost so gold silver stood in case to blinking wonderment of messenger porter whose errand took into mr loftus deacon sitting room content of case be only occasion however

left quarter there have originally be other door into corridor from of room mr deacon have have blocked up so making flat entirely self contained just by glazed swing door have spoken of in full view of old gentleman door hall porter box stood be glazed on side porter sat so that mr deacon door be always before eye so long a be there be very unlikely that anybody anything must leave enter by door unobserved by be important to remember in view of what happened on occasion be writing of there be one other exterior door to mr deacon flat one only gave upon back spiral staircase be usually kept locked staircase have outlet to corridor merely extended from housekeeper room at top of building to basement be little used then only by servant for gave access only to room on own side there be way from staircase to outer street except through private room of tenant through of housekeeper that wednesday morning thing have happened precisely in ordinary way mr deacon have risen breakfasted a usual be alone with newspaper morning letter when breakfast be taken in when be removed have remained in room till between twelve one o'clock good have arrived for be almost daily occurrence one two ordinary visitor have called gone away again be mr deacon habit to lunch at club at about quarter to one thereabout have come out locked door leaving usual message that must be at club for hour two in case anybody called have left building at about one however have returned hurriedly having forgotten letter did give letter for post did beard before went out asked porter porter replied that have not mr deacon thereupon crossed corridor entered door shut behind have be gone few second when there arose outcry from within room shout followed in breath by loud cry of pain then silence beard porter ran to door knocked there be reply did call sir shouted knocked again still without response door be shut have latch lock with exterior handle beard who have have uncle die of apoplexy be now thoroughly alarmed shouted up speaking tube for housekeeper key in course of few minute be brought beard housekeeper entered lobby be a usual sitting room be in perfect order in room beyond mr loftus deacon lay in pool of blood with two large fearful gash in head not soul be in of room though two men first shutting outer door searched diligently window door be shut room be tenantless undisturbed except on floor lay mr deacon in blood at foot of pedestal whereupon there squatted with serenely fierce grin god hachiman gilt painted carrying in one of four hand snake in mace in third small human figure in fourth heavy straight guardless sword around furniture cabinet porcelain lacquer everything else lay undisturbed at first sight of tragedy porter have sent lift man for police soon arrived surgeon with for surgeon there be very little to do mr deacon be dead of two frightful gash in head must have be fatal have obviously be delivered with same instrument something heavy exceedingly sharp police now set to close investigation porter be certain that nobody have entered room that morning who have not afterwards left be sure that nobody have entered unobserved be sure that mr deacon have re entered chamber unaccompanied working therefore on assumption that murderer must not have entered by front door police turned attention to back door window door to back staircase be locked key be in lock inside therefore considered window there be three of looked upon street two in one room one in be shut fastened within other room be lighted by window looking upon lighting well being supplied with reflector window be found to be quite undisturbed fastened within except one window be in bedroom though be shut catch be not fastened porter declared that be mr deacon practice invariably to fasten shut window thing be always very careful about window now found unfastened shut be always left open foot so day to air bedroom more housemaid be brought who have that morning made bed dusted room window be opened said when have entered room have left so a always did therefore shut a be not fastened seemed plain that window must have given exit to murderer since other way appeared possible also to shut window behind must be fugitive natural policy lower pane be of ground glass at least pursuit must be delayed window looked upon lighting well concreted floor of basement be fifteen twenty foot below careful inquiry disclosed fact that man have be at work painting joinery about well bottom be man of very indifferent character have in fact done time be employed for odd job by way of charity being sort of connection of member of firm owning building have indeed received good education fitted to place in very different position from in now found be black sheep drank gambled finally stole relative helped again again effort be useless now be indebted to one of for present occupation at pound week police of course knew something of postponed questioning directly until have investigated little further might be that mr deacon death be work of conspiracy wherein more than one have participated ii next morning thursday mr henry colson be early caller at dorrington office mr colson be thin grizzled man of sixty thereabout who have be close friend only intimate friend indeed of mr loftus deacon be widower lived in room scarce two hundred yard distant from bedford mansion where friend have died business mr dorrington said be in connection with terrible death of old friend mr loftus deacon of doubt have heard read in morning paper yes dorrington assented in morning paper evening paper of yesterday very good may tell that be sole executor under mr deacon will will indeed be in possession be retired solicitor there happens to be sum set apart in will out of be to defray expense may arise in connection with death really seems to must be quite justified in using part of sum in paying for inquiry to be conducted by such experienced man a into cause of poor friend death at rate wish to make such inquiry even if have to pay fee be convinced that there be something very extraordinary something very deep in tragedy police be pottering about of course keeping very mysterious a to matter expect be simply because know nothing have made arrest perhaps minute of delay be making thing more difficult a executor of course have access to room can come look at now oh yes dorrington answered reaching for hat suppose there be doubt of case being one of murder suicide be not likely take oh certainly not be scarcely sort of man to commit suicide must say be a cheerful a must be afternoon before when last saw besides surgeon say be nothing of kind man committing suicide doe gash twice over head even once in case first blow must have made incapable of have heard nothing about weapon dorrington remarked a entered cab have be found that be difficulty mr colson answered must seem not of course there be number of weapon about place japanese sword what not one of might have caused such injury there be bloodstain on of be article of value missing believe not everything seemed to be in place so far a noticed yesterday then be not there long be too much agitated to notice very particularly at rate old gold silver plate have not be disturbed kept that in large case in sitting room must certainly be plate that murderer must have made for first if robbery have be object mr colson gave dorrington other detail of case already set forth in account presently cab stopped before bedford mansion body of course have be removed otherwise room have not be disturbed porter let into chamber by aid of housekeeper key seem to have found key mr colson explained will be troublesome for expect presently usually carried with be not on body when found may be important dorrington said let look at room walked through large apartment one after other dorrington glanced casually about a went presently mr colson stopped struck with idea ah said more to than to dorrington will just see turned quickly back into room have just quitted made for broad shelf ran length of wall at about height of ordinary table yes cried be be gone what be gone sword masamun whole surface of shelf covered with silk cloth be occupied by japanese sword dirk with rich mounting most lay on side in row two three be placed in lacquered rack mr colson stood pointed at rack be standing alone swordless be where be said saw be talking about in fact afternoon before be nowhere about be not like of others let see mr colson much excited hurried from room to room wherever sword be kept searching for missing specimen said at last looking strangely startled be gone think be near soul of mystery spoke in hushed uneasy tone eye gave token of strange apprehension what be dorrington asked what about sword come into sitting room mr colson led dorrington away from scene of mr deacon end away from empty sword rack from under shadow of grinning god with four arm snake threatening sword think be very superstitious mr colson proceeded really feel that can talk more freely about matter in here sat at table over against case of plate mr colson went on sword speak of said be much prized by poor friend who brought with from japan nearly twenty year back not many year after civil war there in fact be very ancient specimen of fourteenth century think work of famous swordsmith masamun masamun work be very rarely met with seems mr deacon felt especially fortunate in securing example be only piece of masamun work in collection may tell that sword by one of great old master be one of rarest of rarity come from japan possessor of best keep rather than sell at price such sword be handed down from father to son for many generation japanese of old school must have be disgraced have parted with father blade even under most pressing necessity mount might possibly sell if be in very bad circumstance blade never of course such thing have occurred occurred in very case a will hear a almost invariable rule japanese samurai must part with life by starvation rather than with father sword by sale such sword must never be stolen for there be firm belief that faithful spirit resided in must bring terrible disaster on wrongful possessor sword have own name just a legendary sword of king arthur have man social standing be judged not by house by dress by two sword in girdle ancient sword smith wore court dress made votive offering when forged best blade god be supposed to assist to watch over career of weapon thus will understand that article be apt to become object almost of worship among samurai warrior class in old japan now to come to sword in question be long sword katana sword a know be worn in pair smaller be called wakizashi be mounted very handsomely with fitting by great metal worker of goto family signature of great masamun be engraved in usual place on iron tang within hilt mr deacon bought weapon of possessor man of distinction before overthrow of shogun in who be reduced to deep poverty by change in affair mr deacon came across in direst strait when child be near to starvation man sold sword for sum be little fortune to though only represented four five pound of money mr deacon be always very proud of treasure indeed be said to be only blade by masamun in europe two japanese thing that have always most longed for have heard say be masamun sword piece of violet lacquer precious lacquer secret of making died long ago masamun acquired a have be telling violet lacquer never once encountered six month so back deacon received visit from japanese taller than usual for japanese have seen with refined type of face characteristic of of higher class of country name be keigo kanamaro card said introduced a son of keigo kiyotaki man who have sold deacon sword have come to england have found friend after much inquiry said expressly to take back father katana father be dead desired to place sword in tomb that soul of old man might rest in peace undisturbed by disgrace have fallen upon by sale of sword have be ancestor for hundred of year back father have vowed when have received sword in turn from kanamaro grandfather never to part with have broken vow under pressure of want son have earned money a merchant immeasurable descent for samurai with feeling of old school be prepared to buy back masamun blade with goto mounting for much higher price than father have received for suppose deacon must sell dorrington asked mr colson replied must have sold at price be sure well kanamaro pressed very urgently called again again be very gentlemanly very dignified be very earnest apologised for making commercial offer assured deacon that be quite aware that be mere buyer seller pleaded urgency of case 'it be not here a in japan said 'among samurai of old day have belief have ours be religion must place katana in father grave father disgraced sold sword in order might not starve when be little child must rather that have let die since be alive know that have sword must take lay by bone will make offer instead of giving money will give sword sword worth a much money a father perhaps more have have sent from japan since first saw be blade made by great yukiyasu have scabbard mounting by older greater master than goto who made for father sword ' happened that deacon already have two sword by yukiyasu while of masamun have only one so tried to reason japanese out of fancy be useless kanamaro called again again got to be quite nuisance left off for month two about fortnight ago appeared again grew angry forgot oriental politeness english have english way said have ours yes though many of foolish countryman be in haste to be same a english be have belief have knowledge tell that there be thing must call superstition be very real old god be not dead yet tell in old time man must wear keep man sword why because great sword have soul just a man have know god know man kept sword who did not fall into terrible misfortune death sooner later give father katana save father weeps in ear at night must bring katana ' be talking to poor deacon a told only on tuesday afternoon told that kanamaro have be there again day before in frantic state so bad indeed that deacon thought of applying to japanese legation to have taken care of for seemed quite mad beind foolish man said bey god still live be strong father wanders on dark path can not go to god without sword in girdle father asks of vow between here japan there be great sea father may walk even here looking for katana be angry go away for little god know father know then took off now mr colson nodded towards next room dropped voice now poor deacon be dead sword be gone illustration give father katana save have not be seen about place suppose since visit speak of on monday dorrington asked particularly asked a to yesterday morning hall porter swears that japanese came to place a to letter now say that when mr deacon came back after having left apparently to get lunch said came for forgotten letter be such letter afterwards found yes there be three lying on very table stamped ready for postage where be now have at chamber opened in presence of police in charge of case there be nothing very important about appointment so forth merely so police left in charge a executor nevertheless must like to see not just now presently think must see man presently man who be painting in basement below window be supposed to have be shut by murderer in escape be if police have frightened very well will see after a soon a like there be just one other thing rather curious coincidence though of course there ca be anything in such superstitious fancy think told that deacon body be found lying at foot of four handed god in other room yes just so mr colson seemed to think little more of superstitious fancy than confessed just so said again at foot of god immediately under hand carrying sword be not wooden actual steel sword in fact noticed that yes now be figure of hachiman japanese god of war recent addition to collection very ancient specimen deacon bought at copleston only few day ago indeed arrived here on wednesday morning deacon be telling about on tuesday afternoon bought because of extraordinary design showing such sign of indian influence hachiman be usually represented with more than usual number of man arm with weapon sword be only image of hachiman that deacon ever saw heard of with four arm after have bought ascertained that be said to be one of idol carry with ill luck from moment leave temple one of copleston men confided to deacon that lascar seaman stoker on board ship brought over swore that everything went wrong from moment that hachiman came on board indeed vessel be nearly lost off finisterre copleston man said be glad to be quit of thing have disappeared in most extraordinary unaccountable manner other thing have be found smashed notably large porcelain vase without human agency after standing near figure well mr colson concluded after remembering what kanamaro said about god of country who watch over ancient sword doe seem odd doe that a soon a poor deacon get thing must be found stricken dead at foot dorrington be thinking yes said presently be certainly strange affair altogether let see odd job man now man who be in basement below window rather find out where be leave to find mr colson stepped out spoke with hall porter presently returned with news be gone said bolted what man who be in basement yes seems police questioned pretty closely yesterday seized first opportunity to cut run do know what asked examined generally suppose a to what have observed at time only thing seems to have said be that heard window shut at about one o'clock questioned further got into confusion equivocation more especially when mentioned ladder be kept in passage close by where be painting seems have examined before speaking to found have be just recently removed put back be thick with dust except just where have be taken hold of to shift there hand mark be quite clean nobody be in basement dowden be man name nobody else must have shifted that ladder without hearing knowing of moreover ladder be just length to reach deacon window asked if have seen anybody move ladder most anxiously vehemently declared that have not little while after be missing have reappeared let go dorrington exclaimed what fool may know something about of course colson said dubiously with sword missing knowing what do of kanamaro anxiety to get at cost glanced toward other room where idol stood one thing seems to must look in direction will look in direction dorrington replied kanamaro may have enlisted dowden help do know where to find kanamaro yes deacon have have letter from have seen lived in lodging near british museum very well now do happen to know whether night porter be kept at place there be none outer door be shut at twelve anybody coming home after must ring up housekeeper by electric bell tenant have key for outer door none key for own room good now mr colson want to think thing over little must care to go at once ascertain whether not kanamaro be still at address speak of certainly will perhaps must have told that though know slightly have never spoken of father sword to doe not know that know anything about seems indeed to have spoken about to nobody deacon be very proud reticent in matter now that deacon be dead probably think nobody alive know of matter of sword if be at home what will do in case keep in sight communicate with with police will stay here for little while then will get hall porter if will instruct before go to show ladder vicinity of dowden operation also think will look at back staircase be found locked with key inside well well there be way of managing that a must know if knew a much about housebreaking a do will see iii mr colson took cab for kanamaro lodging kanamaro be not in found have given notice to leave room servant at door thought that be going abroad since box be being packed apparently for purpose servant did not know at what time must be back mr colson thought for moment of reporting fact at once to dorrington on second thought determined to hurry to city make inquiry at of shipping office a to vessel soon to leave for japan on way however bethought to buy shipping paper gather information from that found what wanted from paper kept cab on way for happened to know man in authority at anglo malay company office might be good thing to take look at passenger list next ship for yokohama be to sail in few day found unnecessary to see passenger list a entered one of row of swing door gave access to large general inquiry office of steamship company perceived keigo kanamaro leaving by kanamaro have not seen mr colson hesitated for moment then turned followed now mr colson became suddenly seized with burning fancy to play subtle detective on own account plainly kanamaro feared nothing walking about thus openly taking passage for japan at chief office of first line of steamship that anybody must think of who contemplated voyage to japan instead of leaving country a might have done by indirect route shipping for japan from foreign port doubtless still supposed that nobody knew of errand in search of father sword mr colson quickened pace came up beside japanese kanamaro be well made man of five foot eight nine remarkably tall for native of dai nippon cheek bone have not prominence noticeable in japanese of lower class pale oval face aquiline nose gave token of high sikozu family hair only be of coarse black be seen on head of japanese perceived mr colson stopped at once with grave bow good morning mr colson said saw leaving steamship office wondered whether not be going to leave yes go home to japan by next departing ship kanamaro answered spoke with excellent pronunciation with intonation suppression of short syllable peculiar to countryman who speak english beesness be finished mr colson suspicion be more than strengthened almost confirmed commanded feature however replied a walked by keigo side ah visit have be successful then have be successful kanamaro answered at very great cost at very great cost yes did not expect to have to do what have done must once not have believed possible must do kanamaro checked hastily resumed grave reserve be private beesness not for to disturb with mr colson have tact to leave line of fishing alone for little walked few yard in silence then asked with eye furtively fixed on face of japanese do know of god hachiman be hachiman warrior of eight flag kanamaro replied yes know of course spoke a though must banish subject mr colson went on did preside over forging of ancient sword blade in japan asked know of preside be new word great worker of steel who made katana in time of yoshitsun taiko sama hung curtain made offering to hachiman when forged blade yes great muramasa great masamun sannori forged blade at foot of hachiman be believed that god inari came unseen with hammer forged steel too though hachiman be buddhist inari be shinto be not thing to talk about there be one religion be yours there be religion be mine be not good that talk together of there be thing that people call superstition when be of religion though may be very true walked little farther then mr colson determined to penetrate kanamaro mask of indifference observed be very sad thing about mr deacon what be asked kanamaro stolidly why be in newspaper newspaper read at mr deacon have be killed murdered in room be found lying dead at foot of hachiman god indeed kanamaro answered politely with something rather like stolid indifference be very sad be sorry did not know have hachiman say mr colson pursued that something have be taken ah yes kanamaro answered just a coolly there be many thing of much value in room after little while added see be little late will excuse for must go to lunch at lodging good day bowed shook hand hailed cab mr colson heard direct cabman to lodging then in cab mr colson made for dorrington office kanamaro stolidity lack of anything like surprise at news of mr deacon death admission that have finished business in england successfully thing placed matter beyond doubt in mr colson mind plainly felt so confident that none knew of errand in england that took thing with perfect coolness even ventured so far a to speak of murder in very near term to say that did not expect to have to do what have done must not have believed possible that must do though to be sure checked at once before going farther certainly dorrington must be told at once must be better than going to police perhaps for possibly police might not consider evidence sufficient to justify arrest dorrington may have ascertained something in meantime dorrington have not be heard of at office since leaving there early in morning so mr colson saw hick arranged that man must be put on to watch kanamaro must be sent instantly before must leave lodging again then mr colson hurried to bedford mansion there saw housekeeper from learned that dorrington have left time since promising to be back to telegraph during afternoon also learned that beard hall porter be in great state of indignation anxiety a consequence of discovery that be being watched by police have got couple of day leave of absence to go see mother who be ill found intention destination matter of pressing inquiry mr colson assured housekeeper that might promise beard speedy respite from attention of police went to lunch iv after lunch mr colson called called again at bedford mansion dorrington telegram have be heard of at something near five o'clock however when have made up mind to wait restless a be dorrington appeared fresh complacent hope have be waiting long asked fact be got opportunity for lunch till after four so have then think 'd fairly earned case be finished finished there be kanamaro to be arrested have found think anybody will be arrested at will read about in evening paper in hour expect come into room have thing to show assure mr colson said a entered door of deacon room assure got a good a confession from kanamaro let slip in ignorance of what knew why do say that nobody be to be arrested because there be nobody alive who be responsible for mr deacon death come let show whole thing be very simple led way to room where body have be found paused before four armed idol here be old friend hachiman said whom half fancied might have have something to do with tragedy well be right hachiman have good deal to do with with various disaster at copleston too will show how figure be larger than life size have be set up temporarily on large packing case hidden by red cloth covering hachiman be represented in familiar japanese kneeling sitting position carving of whole thing be of intricate close description god be represented a clad in ancient armour with large loose cloak depending from shoulder falling behind in wilderness of marvellously deeply carved fold see here dorrington said placing finger under projecting part of base of figure motioning to mr colson to do same lift pretty heavy eh idol be indeed enormously heavy must have required exertion of several strong men to place where be seems pretty solid doe dorrington continued look here stepped to back of image taking prominent fold of cloak in one hand with quick pull simultaneous rap of other fist two foot above great piece of carved drapery lifted on hinge near shoulder displaying hollow interior in dark corner within small bottle fragment of rag be just visible see there said dorrington there must be enough room in there for small man japanese priest of old time say must squat pretty comfortably see pointed to small metal bolt at bottom of swing drapery must bolt safely in when got there whether priest went there to play oracle to blow fire out of hachiman mouth nose know though doubt might be interesting subject for inquiry perhaps did observe chamber be lined with metal doe something towards giving thing weight there be cunning little opening among armour joint in front must transmit air sound even permit of peep out now mr deacon might might not have found out back door after figure have be while in possession be certain knew nothing of when bought copleston knew nothing of though thing have stood in place for month see be not thing one must notice at once never must have done so if have be looking for shut part joint of irregular outline fell into depth of fold vanished a if by magic now dorrington went on a told copleston knew nothing of one of men found out do happen to have heard of one samuel castro nicknamed belackjaw hunchback whom copleston employed on odd job have seen here called sometimes with message sometimes with parcel must probably have forgotten about be not that be rather extraordinary creature even among copleston men who be remarkable did illustration slackjaw murdered mr deacon think dorrington replied a fancy can explain to wo hang for for be drowned afternoon before eye in attempt to escape from police be extraordinary creature a have said be english half caste of sort think though command of language of riverside dock description be very free got nickname of slackjaw among longshoreman be desperately excitable have most of vice though think premeditated murder in case nothing robbery be immensely strong although little fellow sharp in wit might have have regular work at copleston if have liked be game be too lazy must work long enough to earn shilling so then must go off to drink money so be sort of odd on off man at copleston just to run message carry something what not when regular men be busy well seems to have be smart enough perhaps be no more than accident to find out about hachiman back used knowledge for own purpose copleston must account for missing thing in night because never guessed that castro by shutting up in hachiman about closing time have run of place when everybody have gone must pick up trifle that looked suitable for pawnshop in morning must sleep comfortably on sack among straw thus save rent of lodging must accept hachiman shelter again just before copleston turned up to start next day business getting out too after place be opened be quite easy for nobody came to large store room till something be wanted in large place with many door gate like copleston unperceived going coming be easy to one who knew rope so slackjaw must creep quietly out in again by front door to ask for job copleston noticed how regular have be morning for past few month thought be getting steadier a to thing got smashed expect slackjaw knocked over getting out in dark one china vase in particular have be shifted at last moment probably after be in hiding place stood behind image be smashed of course thing coming after bad voyage of ship in came over very naturally gave poor hachiman unlucky reputation probably slackjaw be sorry at first when heard that hachiman be bought then idea struck have be to mr deacon room on errand must have seen fine old plate in sitting room have picked up unconsidered trifle at copleston by aid of hachiman why not acquire something handsome at deacon in same way figure be to be carried to bedford mansion a soon a work began on wednesday morning very well all have to do be to manage customary sojourn at copleston over tuesday night keep to hiding place in morning did perhaps men swore bit at weight of hachiman a idol weighed several hundredweight by have not be shifted since first arrived most likely perceived difference hachiman with slackjaw comfortably bolted inside though even must have found quarter narrow jolted away in waggon in course of time be deposited where now stand of course have told be about to tell be more than conjecture think will say have reason from within idol slackjaw must hear mr deacon movement doubt when heard take hat stick shut outer door behind hachiman tenant be glad to get out have never have so long trying sojourn in idol before though have provided time with something to keep spirit up in little flat bottle left behind probably however waited little time before emerging for safety sake judge because found sign of having started work except single small knife mark on plate case must have more than begun when mr deacon came back for letter first however went shut bedroom window lest movement might be heard in adjacent room man who be painting said heard that remember well hearing mr deacon key in lock of course made rush for hiding place there be time to get in close up before mr deacon must hear noise mr deacon a entered footstep in next room went to see result know castro perhaps crouched behind idol hearing mr deacon approaching knowing discovery inevitable in mad fear excitement snatched nearest weapon struck wildly at pursuer see here be dozen heavy short japanese sword at hand one of might have be used thing done castro have to think of escape door be impossible hall porter be already knocking there man have key must be heard moving about calling for one there be yet little time wiped blade of weapon put back in place took key from dead man pocket regained concealment in idol whether not took key with idea of again attempting theft when room be left empty know most likely thought must aid in escape anyway did attempt theft lay in concealment pretty bad time must have have of till night probably nerve be not good enough for anything more than simple flight when be quiet left room shut door behind then lurked about corridor basement till morning when door be opened slipped out unobserved be be pretty obvious once know about hachiman interior how did find out when left here considered thing put aside suspicion of motive japanese sword rest of addressed to bare fact somebody have be in room when mr deacon came back that somebody have murdered first thing be to find how person came where came from at first of course one thought of bedroom window a police have done reflection proved unlikely mr deacon have entered front door be inside few second then be murdered close by figure of hachiman now if anybody have entered by window for purpose of robbery impulse on hearing key in outer door thing must be heard over room a tested for impulse say must be to retreat by way have come that be by window if then mr deacon have overtaken before must escape murder might have taken place just a have done must have be in bedroom not in room in opposite direction thief attention must naturally be directed at first to gold plate indeed detected fresh knife mark in door of case will show presently now a see by arrangement of room retreat from plate case to bedroom window must be short one whereas murderer must in fact have taken longer journey in opposite direction why because have arrived from direction natural impulse be to retreat by way have come might have be by door to back stair careful examination of door lock key convinced that have not be opened key be dirty to have turned from opposite side must have necessitated forcible use of pair of thin hollow plier familiar tool to burglar must have left mark on dirty key so turned back to idol be spot intruder have made for in retreat figure have be brought into place very morning of murder also thing have disappeared from vicinity at copleston more be large thing what if be hollow one have heard of such thing having be invented by priest anxious for certain effect must not thief smuggle in way suggestion be little startling for if be right one man might be hiding there at moment gave thing hour examination in end found what have shown be not sort of thing one must have found out without looking for look at even now although have seen open must point to joint dorrington opened again once open went on thing be pretty plain here be rag perhaps be castro pocket handkerchief used to wipe weapon be stained over cut a will observe by sharp edge also may see crumb two slackjaw have brought food with in case of long imprisonment chiefly observe bottle be flat high shouldered 'quartern bottle such a publican sell lend to customer in poor district a usual bear publican name j mill be most extraordinary thing seems fate of almost murderer matter how cunning to leave such damning piece of evidence about foolish a may seem afterward have known in dozen case probably castro in dark in excitement forgot when quitted hiding place at rate helped made course plain clearly man whoever be have come from copleston moreover be small man for space have occupied must be too little even for man of middle height also bought drink of j mill publican if j mill carried on business near copleston so much easier task must seem before left however went to basement inspected ladder removal of have caused police so much exercise then be plain why dowden have cleared out prevarication uneasiness be explained at once a police might have seen if have looked behind ladder a well a at for have be lying lengthwise against wooden partition formed back of compartment put up to serve tenant a wine cellar dowden have taken three plank out of partition so arranged that must be slipped in place out again without attracting attention what have be taking through hole thus made wo undertake to say will make small bet that of tenant find wine short presently so dowden never industrious person never at one job long thought best to go away when found police asking why ladder have be moved yes yes be very surprising doubt be right still what about kanamaro that sword tell exactly what said to to day mr colson detailed conversation at length dorrington smiled see here said have found out something else in room what kanamaro said meant in sense to what supposed wondered little about sword made little search among drawer in consequence look here do see box standing out here on nest of drawer be quite unlike mr deacon orderly way box contains piece of lacquer have be shifted from drawer to make room for more precious piece see here dorrington pulled out drawer just below where box stood took from white wood box opened box removed quantity of wadding rich brocade fukusa be then revealed loosening cord of dorrington displayed japanese writing case suzuribako aged little worn at corner of lacquer of beautiful violet hue what exclaimed mr colson violet lacquer be what be dorrington answered when saw judged at once that deacon have at last consented to part with masamun blade in exchange for even greater rarity fine piece of real old violet lacquer must imagine that kanamaro brought on tuesday evening will remember that saw mr deacon for last time alive in afternoon of day beard seems not to have noticed in evening hall porter be apt to be at supper know perhaps even taking nap now then then be how kanamaro 'finished business ' mr colson observed havery great cost ' be probably what have to pay for suppose so must not have believed possible that must get piece of violet lacquer in circumstance mr colson objected still understand indifference lack of surprise when told of poor deacon death think be very natural in such man a keigo kanamaro profess to know very great deal about

never got farther than next street hung about reasonable time perhaps in ship anchor if fund permitted then returned to say that nephew must not come just yet old cater have quarrelled with nephew a have with everybody else time before greer be resolved if must to prevent meeting now for must mean that nephew must take possession of place must lose chance of convenient larceny when end came so be that nephew knew of old jerry cater shaky condition illustration saw few doubled paper before long finding that old miser must not leave bed indeed must scarcely turn in greer took courage in sinclair

greer ventured to take down dusty old pickle jar from top shelf in cupboard of master bedroom cater be dozing at moment greer tilting jar toward light saw within few doubled paper very dusty snatched

before have banged street door behind lest cater listening above must wonder what detained in convenient courtyard hundred yard away drew out paper inspected eagerly first there be policy of insurance of house premise then there be bundle of receipt for yearly insurance premium then there be old jerry cater will there be two foolscap sheet written in jerry cater own straggling handwriting greer hastily scanned sheet dirty face grew longer squint intensified a turned over second sheet found nothing behind stuffed paper back in pocket for be plain that not penny of old jerry cater money be for

impotent fit of prostration be longer than have preceded presently greer thought might be well to call doctor call did accordingly surgery be hard by doctor came jerry cater revived little sufficiently to recognise doctor be last effort lived hour half greer kept change have beef tea a well doctor gave opinion that old man have risen in delirium have expended last strength in moving about room opening window ii samuel greer found somewhere near two pound in silver in small canvas bag under dead man pillow more money however rewarded hasty search about bedroom when sinclair returned greer set off to carry news to paul cater dead man nephew respectable greer have considered well matter of will saw way fancied at least to few pound by way of compensation for loss of employment ungrateful forgetfulness of late employer two sheet comprised in fact not simple will merely will codicil on one of sheet codicil being year two more recent than will nobody apparently knew anything of paper struck greer that be now in power to prevent anybody learning unless interested party be disposed to pay for disclosure be why now took way toward establishment of paul cater for will made paul cater not only sole executor practically sole legatee wherefore greer carefully separated will from codicil intending will alone for sale to paul cater because indeed codicil very considerably modified might form subject of independent commerce paul cater made le miserly show than have be wont of uncle house be in street in ground floor front room of be made into office with wire blind carrying name in gilt letter perhaps be that paul cater carried covetousness to greater refinement than uncle have done seeing that decent appearance be commercial advantage by bringing greater profit than miserly habit must save man of general dealing be balancing book when greer arrived at announcement of uncle death dropped everything be not noticeably stricken with grief unless sudden seizure of hat roaring aloud for cab might be considered a indication of affliction for in truth paul cater knew well that be case in much might depend on being first at bermondsey worthy greer have scarce got news out before found standing in street while cater be giving direction to cabman here come in too said cater greer be bustled into cab be plainly situation in half crown must not be too reluctantly parted with so paul cater produced one presented cater be strong faced man of fifty odd with tight drawn mouth proclaimed everywhere tight fist so that unaccustomed passing over of tip be noticeably awkward unspontaneous performance greer pocketed money with little more acknowledgment than growl do know where put will asked paul cater with keen glance will answered greer looking blankly in face gaze of one eye passing over cater shoulder that of other seeming to seek boot will p'raps e never made one did that 'ud mean lawfully a property must come to ' mr flint 'arves bein personal property so 'd think greer composite gaze blankly persisted how do know whether made will not 'ow do know ah well p'raps dunno be only fancy like jist put to that be 'ud be divided atween two of then after long pause added lor 'ud be pretty fine thing for if did leave will willed to must mighty fine thing 'ud be mighty fine thing for mr flint if there be will leaving to must pretty fine thing cater said nothing watched greer face sharply greer face with greasy feature irresponsible squint be a expressive a brick travelled distance in silence then greer said musingly ah will like 'ud be mighty fine thing what 'ud be disposed to give for now give for do mean if there be will there be end to why must give anything for jist so jist so replied greer with complacent wave of hand why must reason at unless must find without givin ' something see here now said cater sharply let understand do mean that there be will know that be hidden where be greer squint remained impenetrable hidden lor must know if be hidden be puttin ' of case to because cater went on disregarding reply if be case sooner out with information better will be for because there be way of making people give up information of sort for nothing yes o ' course replied imperturbable greer o ' course there be ' quite right too ah be fine thing be lawr mighty fine thing cab rattled over stone of bermondsey wall two alighted at door through old jerry cater be soon to come foot first sinclair be back much disturbed anxious at sight of paul cater poor fellow weak broken spirited left house a quietly a might for year of grinding habit have inured to belief that in reality old cater have treated rather well now feared probable action of heir who be that asked paul cater of greer be clerk owed uncle money greer nodded then be not to come here again do hear will take charge of book thing a to debt well will see about after now look here paul cater stood before greer spoke with decision about will now bring greer be not to be bluffed where from asked innocently will stand there tell know where be maybe 'd best stand here tell what pay best pay how much more do want bring will will have in gaol for stealing lor answered greer composedly conscious of holding trump a well a will why if there be anybody a knowed where will be talked to a violent a 'ere why 'd frighten so much 'd a likely a not go out get price from cousin mr flint be in will might pay to get hold of at moment there came furious knocking at front door why greer continued bet be ca be nobody else bet doctor told summat be on first floor landing greer peeped from broken shuttered window that looked on street yes said that be mr flint sure enough now mr paul cater business do want to see will before let flint in yes exclaimed cater furiously catching at arm quick where be want twenty pound twenty pound be mad what for right if be mad will go ' let flint in knocking be repeated louder longer cried cater getting in

with protested cater waving fist give will come to office for money to morrow tick for sort of job answered greer decisively sorry ca oblige be goin down to front door made a though to go well look here said cater desperately pulling out pocket book have got note two think 'ow much asked greer calmly laying hold of pocket book two at least two fiver well will let go at give hold took note pulled out will from pocket flint outside battered door once more why exclaimed cater a glanced over sheet be sole executor get lot who be witness oh be right longshore hand just hereabout will get 'em day at behip anchor ' cater put will in breast pocket 'd best get out o ' man said have have for ten pound further get from safer will be what said greer with chuckle not even grateful shockin ' took way downstairs cater followed at door flint counterpart of cater except dress be more slovenly stood ragefully ah cousin said cater standing on threshold preventing entrance be very sad loss sad loss flint replied with disgust lot think of loss a much a do reckon want to come in then sha' cater replied with prompt change of manner sha be sole executor have got will in pocket pulled out sufficiently far to show end of paper then returned a executor be in charge of property responsible be vested in till will put into effect be law be bad thing for anybody to interfere with executor be law too flint be angry cautious well said be uncommon high with will executor law bead loss ' must say what be game for answer cater began to shut door just look out cried flint have heard last of may be executor may be lie may have will may not anyway know better than to run risk of putting in wrong now will watch will watch house will be about when will come to be proved if ai done quick will apply for administration see thing through iii samuel greer sheered off a cousinly interview ended well satisfied with ten pound be fortune to meant having good deal more did nothing further till following morning when presented at shop of jarvis flint good mornin mr flint said samuel greer grinning squinting affably must help noticin a have few word yesterday with mr cater after sad loss well 'appens a have seen will a mr cater be talkin ' of thought p'raps 'ud save makin ' mistake if told of what about jarvis flint be not disposed to accept greer altogether on trust well do seem scandalous thing certainly what mr cater said be right do take personal property subjick to debt ' do take freehold primbees ' be 'xecutor be will witnessed yes two waterside chap well know 'd there abouts be made by lawyer in lamented corpse 'andwritin umph flint maintained hard stare in greer face anything else well mr flint sir p'raps not wonder if there might be sich thing a codicil be there oh be wonderin be might make deal o ' difference in will might p'raps mr cater might know anythink about codicil what do mean be there codicil well reely mr flint answered greer with deprecatory grin reely ai business to give information for nothink be business not if know anything will find will have to tell be not going to let cater have own way if be executor lawyer will be on job before be day older man wo find pay to keep thing too quiet ca pay worse than to give information for nothink persisted greer come now mr flint s'pose say there be mind only say s'pose s'pose there be codicil s'pose codicil meant matter of few thousand pound in pocket s'pose person must tell where to put hand on codicil what might be disposed to pay person bring codicil answered flint if be all right will give well say five shilling greer grinned again shook head reely mr flint said ca do business on term like fifty pound down in hand now be done fifty be dirt cheap longer be considerin well know mr cater might get hold of then why s'pose got burnt never 'eard of agen flint glared with round eye get out said go on fifty pound indeed fifty pound without knowing whether be telling lie not out go know what to do now man greer grinned once more slouched out have not expected to bring flint to term at once of course man must drive away at first having got scent of existence of codicil supposing to be somewhere concealed about old house at bermondsey wall must set lawyer to warn cousin that thing be known that a executor must be held responsible for trump card codicil be carefully stowed in lining of greer hat cater knew nothing about presently flint finding cater obdurate must approach wily greer again then must be squeezed meanwhile hat lining be a safe place a in to keep paper perhaps flint might take fancy to have waylaid at night searched in case pocket must be unsafe repository flint on part be in good spirit plainly there be codicil favourable to certainly meant to pay greer for discovering at rate such sum a fifty pound to abate jot of right flint have running contract with shady solicitor named lugg in accordance with lugg received yearly payment transacted legal business consisting chiefly of writing threatening letter to unfortunate debtor also a think have mentioned dorrington be working for at time working at very cheap rate flint resolved to begin with to set dorrington lugg to work first dorrington who a matter of fact be in flint back office during interview with greer thus be that in hour two dorrington found in active pursuit of samuel greer with instruction to watch closely to make drunk if possible to get at knowledge of codicil by mean conceivable iv on morning of day after talk with flint samuel greer ruminated doubtfully on advisability of calling on ship store dealer again waiting in dignified silence till flint must approach a ruminated rubbed chin so rubbing found very stubbly resolved on luxury of penny shave a walked street kept eye open for shop where operation be performed at price mr flint at rate must wait till chin be smooth presently in turning by abbey street bermondsey came on just barber shop a wanted within two men be being shaved already waiting greer felt especially fortunate in three more followed at heel be ahead of turn anyhow so waited patiently illustration walk be unsteady man whose turn be immediately before own did not appear to be altogether sober hiccough shook from time to time grinned with dull glance at comic paper held upside down in hand when went to take turn at chair walk be unsteady barber have to use skill to avoid cutting opened mouth to make remark at awkward time then greer turn came at other chair when shave be half completed saw unsteady customer rise pay penny go out beginnin ' early in mornin observed one customer barber laughed yes said want to get proper bust on before go to bed s'pose samuel greer chin being smooth at last rose turned to where have hung hat jaw dropped eye almost sprang out to meet other a saw bare peg unsteady customer have walked off with wrong hat hat paper concealed inside lor cried dismayed greer be took hat shopful of men set up guffaw at take then said one be blame sight better one than yourn greer without hat rushed into street barber without penny rushed after stop 'im shouted greer distractedly stop thief thus be that dorrington at time of far le well groomed appearance than be later wont watching outside barber observed mad bursting forth of greer followed by barber after barber came customer one grinning furiously beneath coating of lather stop 'im cried greer ' e got 'at stop 'im pay money said barber catching arm never mind 'at can 'ave 'be just pay first leave go be responsible for lettin ' 'im take tell be special valuable leave go dorrington stayed to hear more three minute before have observed slightly elevated navvy emerge from shop walk solemnly across street under hat manifestly size two too small for now dorrington darted down turning man have taken hat be wretched thing there must be special reason for greer wild anxiety to recover especially a navvy must have left probably better behind already dorrington have conjectured that greer be carrying codicil about with for have place else to hide must scarcely have offered so confidently to negotiate over if have be in bermondsey wall house well in reach of paul cater so followed elevated navvy with haste might never have seen again be not that unconscious bearer of fortune of flint indeed dorrington hesitated for little while whether not to enter door of public house near st saviour dock in end decided to go on be just a have started that dorrington sighted again navvy walked slowly gravely on now again with swerve to wall curb generally with careful laboured directness presently arrived at dock bridge with low iron rail incoming barge attracted eye stopped solemnly inspected leaned on low rail for purpose a did so hat too small fell off have be standing two yard nearer centre of bridge must have dropped into water a be fell on quay few foot from edge dockman coming toward step by bridge side picked up brought with here y'be mate said dockman offering hat navvy took in lofty silence inspected narrowly then said 'ere wot ai 'at glared suspiciously at dockman ai answered dockman carelessly aw right then keep for bloke b'longs to want returned navvy with rising indignation want mine though done with eh ai rotten old 'un like 'ere none o ' yer lark jist 'and over come on 'and wot over asked dockman growing indignant in turn drop yer 'at over bridge like kid a ca take care of brings up for ye betead o ' sayin ' thank ye 'like man y ' asks for 'at go ' bile yer face turned on heel ye bawled navvy dropping battered hat making complicated rush at other retreating form not much gim 'at grabbed dockman anywhere with hand illustration mingled bunch of dockman navvy be floundering about street dockman be a big a navvy more patient immediately punched assailant nose in three second mingled bunch of dockman navvy be floundering about street dorrington saw more have despised hat in hand general attention being directed to action in progress hurried quietly up nearest court v samuel greer having got clear of barber by paying penny be in much perplexity notwithstanding acquisition of navvy hat very decent bowler covered head generously rested on ear what must be move now hat be clean gone codicil with to find again must be hopeless task unless by chance navvy must discover mistake return to barber to make rectification of hat so samuel greer returned once more to barber for rest of day called again again fruitlessly at first barber be vastly amused told story to customer who laughed then barber got angry at continual worrying at close of day barbering earned night repose by pitching samuel greer neck crop into gutter samuel greer gathered up disconsolately surrounded head with navvy hat shuffled off to ship anchor at ship anchor found one barker decayed sodden lawyer clerk out of work greer temporary affluence enabling to stand drink be presently able by putting artfully hypothetical case to extract certain legal information from barker chiefly learned that if will codicil be missing might nevertheless be possible to obtain probate of by satisfying court with evidence of content genuineness here at rate be certain hope alone apparently of person knew content of codicil name of witness since be impossible to sell codicil now that be gone might at least sell evidence resolved to offer evidence for sale to flint at once take what must get there must be delay for possibly navvy might find paper in hat carry to flint seeing that name be beneficially mentioned in address given plainly hat must not go back to barber now if drunken navvy have found out mistake probably have not least notion where have be where hat have come from else must have returned during day recovered own superior property so samuel greer went at once late a be knocked up mr flint flint congratulated feeling sure that greer have thought better of business have come to give information for anything must get greer on part be careful to conceal fact that codicil have be in possession have be lost said be that have seen codicil that date be nine month later than of will that benefited jarvis flint to extent of ten thousand pound leaving flint to suppose if pleased that cater executor have codicil must probably suppress indeed be conclusion that flint immediately jumped at result of interview be flint with much grudging reluctance handed over a preliminary fee sum of one pound most must be screwed up to then be settled that greer must come on morrow consult with flint solicitor lugg object of consultation being construction of consistent tale satisfactory soi disant copy of codicil greer be to swear to if necessary armed with paul cater might be confronted brought to term may be wondered why ere flint have not received genuine codicil recovered by dorrington from greer hat fact be dorrington a be wont be playing little game of own having possessed of codicil be now in position to make most from side in far more efficient manner than clumsy greer people of jarvis flint sordid character be apt with sordid keenness to be wonderfully short sighted in regard to what might seem fairly obvious to man of honest judgment thus never occurred to flint that man like dorrington willing for miserable wage to apply exceptional subtlety to furtherance of employer rascally design must be at least a ready to swindle master on own account when opportunity offered must be in fact more ready in proportion to stinginess wherewith master have treated having found codicil dorrington procedure be not to hand over forthwith to flint be first made careful exact copy of codicil then procured two men of acquaintance men of good credit to read over copy word for word certify a being exact copy of original by way of signed declaration written on back of copy then be armed at point packed copy carefully away in pocket book with original in coat pocket called at house in bermondsey wall where paul cater have taken up quarter to keep guard over everything till will must be proved so happened that while samuel greer jarvis flint lugg lawyer be building scheme dorrington be talking to paul cater at cater wharf on assurance that have business of extreme importance cater took dorrington into room in old man have died cater be using room a office in to examine balance uncle book corpse have be carried to room below to await funeral dorrington clothes at time a have hinted be not distinguished by excellence of cut condition be afterwards noticeable in point of fact be seedy assurance presence of mind be fully developed be very transaction be to put elegant appearance within reach mr cater said believe be sole executor of will of uncle mr jeremiah cater who lived in house cater assented will be one extremely favourable to yourself in fact by become not only sole executor practically sole legatee well be here a man of business a man of world to give certain information there be codicil to will cater started then shrugged shoulder shook head a though knew better there be codicil dorrington went on imperturbably executed in strict form in handwriting of testator dated nine month later than will codicil benefit cousin mr jarvis flint to extent of ten thousand pound to put in way deprives of ten thousand pound cater felt uneasy did best to maintain contemptuous appearance be rushing ahead pretty fast said talking about term of codicil a call what want to know be where be that replied dorrington smilingly be question very easily answered codicil be in pocket tapped coat a spoke paul cater started again now be plainly discomposed very well said with bravado if have got can show to suppose nothing easier dorrington responded affably stepped to fireplace took poker wo mind holding poker while inspect paper will asked politely fact be codicil be of such nature fear man of sharp business instinct might be tempted to destroy there being other witness present unless have assurance now give that if a much a touch will stun with poker there be codicil may read with hand behind spread paper out on table cater bent eagerly read growing paler a eye travelled down sheet before raising eye however collected a stood up said with affected contempt care brass farthing for thing be forgery on face of dear answered dorrington placidly recovering paper folding up be very disappointing to hear must take round to mr flint see if be opinion must exclaimed cater desperately say be genuine document very well be still executor be bound to give to precisely dorrington replied sweetly in strict interest of justice think mr flint a person interested ought to have look at first in case accident must happen to in hand cater knew be in corner face betrayed come said dorrington in more business like tone here be case in nutshell be business just a be yours to get a much a can for nothing in pursuance of business quietly got hold of codicil nobody know have a to how got need ask for sha' tell here be document be worth ten thousand pound to of two people mr flint worthy cousin be prepared to sell at very great sacrifice to sell dirt cheap in fact give privilege of first refusal for ought to be grateful one thousand pound be price that give profit of nine thousand pound when have destroyed codicil noble profit of nine hundred per cent at stroke come be bargain what ejaculated cater astounded thousand pound one thousand pound exactly replied dorrington complacently penny for receipt stamp if want receipt oh said cater be mad thousand pound why be absurd think so remarked dorrington reaching for hat then must see if mr flint agrees with be be man of business never heard of refusing certain nine hundred per cent profit yet good day stop yelled desperate cater go be unreasonable now say five hundred will write cheque wo do answered dorrington shaking head thousand be price not penny le not by cheque mind understand move of sort note gold wonder at smart man like expecting to be so green have money here very likely not where be bank will go there get cater between avarice fear be at wit end be so hard on mr dorrington whined be not rich man assure will ruin ruin what do mean give ten thousand pound for one thousand say ruin really seems too ridiculously cheap if settle quickly mr cater will raise term warn so came about dorrington cater took cab together for branch bank in pimlico whence dorrington emerged with one thousand pound in note gold stowed carefully about person cater with codicil to uncle will hour later have safely burnt vi so much for first half of dorrington operation for second half made immediate hurry if have be aware of samuel greer movement lugg little plot might have hurried a be busied in setting up on more respectable scale by help of newly acquired money did not long delay have attested copy of codicil must be a good a original if properly backed with evidence in court of law astute cater wise in own conceit just a be equally astute cousin flint have clean overlooked possibility of such trick a now dorrington have to do be to sell copy for one more thousand pound to jarvis flint be on morning of old jerry cater funeral that made way to deptford to do chuckled a reflected on probable surprise of flint who doubtless wondered what have become of sweated inquiry agent when confronted with offer when arrived at ship store shop found that flint be out so resolved to call again in evening at moment jarvis flint samuel greer lugg lawyer be at house in bermondsey wall attacking paul cater greer foreseeing probable defiance by cater from window have led party in by wharf door so have taken cater by surprise cater be in suit of decent black a befitted occasion received news of existence of copy of codicil have destroyed with equal fury apprehension what do mean demanded what do mean be not to be bluffed like talk about codicil where be where be eh dear sir said lugg peaceably be small snuffy man be not here to make disturbance quarrel breach of peace be here on strictly business errand assure will be for best interest if listen quietly to what have to say ahem seems that mr samuel greer here have frequently seen codicil greer rascal thief scoundrel cried irate cater shaking fist in thick of greer squint swindled out of ten pound really mr cater lugg interposed do good by such outburst prevent putting case before a be saying mr greer have frequently seen codicil saw indeed on very day of late mr cater decease may not have come across indeed there may be temporary difficulty in finding original fortunately mr greer took note of content of witness name from note have be able to draw up statement mr greer be prepared to subscribe to by affidavit declaration if by chance may be unable to produce original codicil cater seeing thousand pound to dorrington going for nothing now confronted with fear of losing ten thousand pound more must scarce speak for rage greer liar tell spluttered out liar thief scoundrel word affidavit oath anything of be worth straw dear sir lugg proceeded equably be thing may remain for probate court possibly jury to decide upon in meantime permit to suggest that will be better for party cheaper in fact if matter be settled out of court think if will give matter little calm unbiassed thought will admit that balance of strength be altogether with case must like to look at statement effect will see be roughly speaking to give client legacy of say about ten thousand
