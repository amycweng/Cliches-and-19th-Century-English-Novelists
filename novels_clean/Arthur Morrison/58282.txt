letter carrying though picture making favoured a little a did old man there be situation of cottage hindrance must see way to overcome being so left for time betook to smaller difficulty putting letter carrying aside for moment forgetting distance a obstacle what trade be there to choose from truly good many that none must be missed johnny grandfather took paper pencil walked to woodford where begged use of london directory read through trade from absorbent cotton wool manufacturer to zincographic printer making laborious list a went omitting with reluctance such item a banker broker

keeper found that one at least of cottager thereabouts be poacher then greeting be a friendly a seemed a to johnny trade have few idea beyond one butcher did very well in sister having married one what shive turner ammeter might be knew more than stick knew well enough what poacher be a also perhaps did stick if contact must teach counselled that boy be kept away from certain lot a blandy lot honeywell lot hayes lot who must do no good old butterfly hunter knew lot very well on own account perpetual gropings about bank undergrowth made friend among must scarce believe even after long experience that grub alone accounted for activity truly man with government pension who affected scientific taste who lived clean life who be called mr may by keeper who moreover have such uncommon opportunity of witnessing what passed in wood might well be object of suspicion in simple truth village loafer have small conception of old man knowledge of behaviour among rabbit burrow knew wood a

toward glen lifting stick in recognition of johnny who bore bundle of dead stick homeward johnny mother peeled cut rhubarb revolving impossible expedient for bridging space between london space looked so small on map be so great obstacle to purpose so wide division between two mode of life knew johnny grandfather pinned strapped deftly deep in thought presently looking up beat said fearful of ignoring good thing in trade to guess what shive turner be iii so life went at cottage for little while looked for visit from uncle isaac since a sent postal order be felt that must defer return of half crown merely because contemplated early payment in person week passed nothing be heard of seen meantime problem of johnny trade met solution have left school nearly three month now thing seeming

hour allowed for breakfast must scarce suffice for mere hurrying home hurrying back again full hour at midday must give bare time for dinner with mother bessy be infected with excitement stumped downstairs to honour johnny setting out left shop door hour too soon with boot flung after darkness of street seemed more solid at hour than ever at midnight almost smothered faint gas light now again touch of sleet came down wind little dirty half melted snow of yesterday made way sloppy nobody be about to view manly glory of johnny white duck be not sorry now that overcoat largely hid for wind be cold reflected with satisfaction that warming of coffee on furnace must smoke inglorious newness off tin can ere carried home in open day one two policeman met regarded curiously for workman be not

anywhere asked tremulously ill johnny have seen no lady ill well when said young girl with weak thank hastened on way be very odd thought johnny a stared into dark where vanished who must lose lady ill in blackwall street at time of pitch dark morning a thought there rose in mind picture of gran'dad straying bloody sick to death night seemed so far away though be month two since maybe lady have wandered from bed in such plight a johnny be sorry for girl trouble must have liked to turn aside join in search be hour of great business of own went way about policeman be knocking at door now rousing workman who answered with shout from within old night watchman too scurrying hardest for have farther to go than policeman banged impatiently at knocker of more conservative old fashioned a johnny neared maidment hurst street grew busy with earliest workman who lived farthest from labour maidment hurst gate be shut fast be far too soon tried little door be cut in great gate be locked wondered if ought to knock did venture on faint tap of knuckle might a well have tapped brick wall moreover passing apprentice observed act guffawed aloud try down airey mate be advice so johnny stood waited keeping new tin can where gaslight over gate must not betray unsmoked brightness trying to look a much like old hand a possible passing men grinned at other jerking head toward johnny felt that

stepped in after mr cottam told to come morning sir said before timekeeper have quite disappeared into box name may timekeeper turned growled again that being usual manner of conversation awright continued wait there till ' e come in then be many month ere johnny next heard say so much at once timekeeper began hanging round metal ticket on great board studded with hook ticket to hook in numbered order presently man came in at door selected ticket from board dropped through slot into what seemed to be big money box then three came together did same then there came stream of men boy board grew barer of ticket barer in midst came mr cottam suddenly appearing within impossibly small wicket a by conjuring trick tramped heavily straight ahead apparently unconscious of johnny a came by dropped hand on boy shoulder gazing steadily ahead well lad roared much a though addressing somebody at window of factory across yard good morning sir johnny answered walking at foreman side by compulsion for hand however friendly be heaviest strongest have ever felt mr cottam went several yard in silence still gripping johnny shoulder then spoke again mother all right asked fiercely still

circumstance did not notice till after breakfast when gas be turned off daylight penetrated from above confusion of heavy raftering stretched below roof carrying belted shafting everywhere man bent over machine bench for cottam be sharp gaffer johnny watched leading hand scribing curve on metal along line already set out by punctured dot lining off said leading hand seeing boy interest then leaning over to speak because of workshop din centre dab added pointing to dot at least johnny resolved not to forget lining off centre dab for reason perhaps usual reason perhaps three four of men be losing quarter monday morning of be men with whom young apprentice have be working consequently cottam in addition to general supervision have to keep particular watch on mentorless lad johnny learned

end bob white understood perfectly thought have last seen round square in possession of george walker whereas george walker be perfectly certain that have gone downstairs to bill cook in big shop doubting nothing from uncommonly solemn face of sam joe bob george johnny set off down stone stair where met ascending gaffer on way back from pattern maker shop 'ullo boy said where goin ' downstairs

round by shoulder sending in front there be furtive grin in shop one lad asked got in voice cautiously subdued just then bell rang for breakfast most of men several of boy made best pace for gate lived near got breakfast at coffee shop half hour began ended in haste few others more leisurely stayed to gather can handkerchief to wipe hand on cotton waste curious tangled stuff by alone johnny remembered father a for waited to do what rest did for saw that friend long man have gone out with patron of coffee shop boy took can clattered down to smith shop johnny well in rear for be desirous of judging from safe distance what form little game might take that long man have warned of in case came soon wayward fate preserved from booby trap that morning in first place have come in cap so forfended one ordeal for be etiquette of shop among apprentice that bowler hat brought in on head of new lad must be pinned to wall with tang of many file since bowler hat ere lad have four year at least of service be pretension vainglory outrage next lagging saved new duck first lad down have prepared customary trap consisted of seat of honour in best place near fire seat doctored with pool of oil situated exactly beneath rafter on stood can of water taken from lathe string depending from can with lower end fastened behind seat so that victim accepting accommodation must receive large oily embellishment on new white duck by impact of back against string induce copious christening of entire outfit chanced that elderly journeyman from big shop old ben cutts appeared on scene early wiping spectacle on jacket lining a came knew nothing of fresh 'prentice saw nothing convenient warm seat hastened to seize lad be taken by surprise no not there shouted one few yard away fust come fust served lad chuckled old ben cutts a dropped on fatal spot 'ere be ' with that can fell johnny at door be astonished to observe grey headed workman with pair of spectacle in hand vast oily patch on white overall dripping dancing swearing smacking wildly at head of boy about without hitting there be more trick that breakfast time for when at length old ben subsided to meal put little pile of

decorum possible in smith shop johnny new can be satisfactorily blackened breakfast be well disposed of such youth a tried with verbal chaff answered a well a might though have a yet little of cockney boy readiness at last bell rang again breakfasters went back to work mr cottam casting glance about shop in search of simplest possible job for johnny to begin on with steady man at hand to watch stopped a gaze reached long hick sent johnny to help with bolt so johnny found tall man surmise verified tall man received with grin little le shy set to running down bolt nut showing how to fix bolt in vice work nut on with spanner johnny fell to task enthusiastically so morning went xiii when nan may opened shop saw that men be pulling down a much of ship yard wall opposite a stood between two chalk line thought more of thing at time not guessing how nearly concerned for be to be new workman gate to ship yard passing workman might change fortune of shop for day however there be sign demand of bricklayer labourer for penn'orth of cheese be a bad day a saturday in matter of trade indeed there be drunken man to buy lard woman heart grew heavier a empty hour went bessy stood at back parlour door pale anxious striving to lift brave face before one o'clock there be dinner to be prepared not that bessy mother must eat for johnny at quarter past one met at door a cheerfully a must indeed be eager to hear of fortune wondered to see coming with long man who lived next door long man for part be awkward nervous when saw at first hung back a though to let johnny go on alone changed mind came striding ahead hastily looking to right to left plunged in at door johnny be hungry in high spirit long hick seemed have be bedding down junk ring for piston johnny easing bolt nut long hick doing other work said nothing of round square talked greatly of slide valve crank till bessy judged full engineer already between mouthful illustrated proper handling of hammer file reprehended sinful waste of spoiling surface of new file on outer skin of fresh iron casting cheered nan may to see boy taking so heartily to work through secret dread that might lack mean to keep at johnny glanced anxiously at clock from time to time at last declared that must knock for long hick who be plainly forgetting how late be in end rushed away to disturb tall man ten minute too soon hurried off to maidment be there to take own new metal ticket from great board drop duly into box afternoon went busily at factory busy day followed johnny acquired first tool steel foot rule carried in public place with full quarter of length visible at top of appointed pocket be way of young apprentice to do rule must say thus being carried convenient for hand be exact science among observant to judge lad experience inversely by scale of inch exposed going at rate of inch year lad through two year of time must show more of rule than two inch by end of four year one of inch must have vanished a twenty first birthday approached last inch shrank to mere hint of bright metal nobody ever saw foot rule of full journeyman except be using johnny christening postponed by accident of old ben cutts came when be first put to small lathe to try hand at turning bolt for when returning from breakfast belted lathe did not perceive that water can have be tied to belt realising however next instant when flew over shafting discharged water on head then be free of shop suffering more than rest from workshop prank habitual among younger lad joining in gammoning newer lad than with demand for round square oppressing with urgent message to testy gaffer that cockroach have got in foo foo valve that donkey man wanted order for new nosebag like grew able moreover in workshop policy making good interest with storekeeper who might sometimes oblige with loan of hammer for lost hammer meant fine of three sixpence when yours be stolen everybody stole everybody else hammer borrowed one must tide over till must steal making friend too with tool smith at slight expense in drink though able to punish also if necessary by secret bedevilment of fire with iron boring learned to manufacture apparent water crack by way of excuse for broken file water crack made with touch of grease well squeezed between broken end in short became initiated 'prentice engineer in trade moreover be not slow mr cottam have once mentioned though johnny did not know a none so bad boy one a can work own 'ead until first enthusiasm have worn off never ceased from questioning long hick in hour of leisure on matter concerning steam engine so that retiring hick grew almost out of touch with accordion have be solace of solitude tall man have never met quite so inquisitive apprentice engineering be in blood supposed have guessed boy mother engineer wife when first johnny came to bench because of extra button nan may have be careful to sew on jacket cuff button used to tighten sleeve that might not catch driver on lathe be early in johnny experience indeed have be scarce fortnight at engine shop when man coming in from outdoor job just before dinner told foreman that old friend be awaiting at gate looking for job ' 'oo ol friend asked cottam severely distrustful mr butson esquire man answered with grin butson gaffer ejaculated eye grew rounder butson agen 'd damme 'd a soon 'ave brass monkey mr cottam

unknown among when johnny told mother at dinner thought men rude ignorant be especially surprised at mr cottam for little while johnny wondered at girl who be hunting for sick lady in street on dark monday morning looked out for on way to from work resolved if met to ask how search have fared how lady be saw nothing of thing began to drop from mind till saturday afternoon when went to see new ram launched for way to ship yard saw pretty girl surely be same in tear trouble now indeed most disconcertingly composed dignified yet surely same johnny hesitated stopped then most precipitately resumed walk for truly be very awful young person icily unconscious of casual glance flung serenely through head over perhaps be same after if not well be lucky have said nothing nevertheless inner feeling be that have made mistake more that girl remembered be proud must not own did matter said to afternoon went little flat launch be le interesting than one might have expected there be great iron hull tricked out with flag when men knocked away dog shore with sledge hammer ship slid away cradle into water there be much in of course if knocked away dog shore ship be bound to slide plainly enough be very interesting johnny felt vaguely resentful of proceeding still wondered afresh at lost lady who be ill out of door so early in morning xiv launch be when johnny 'prentice teeth be cut when running down of bolt pin be beneath notice must be trusted with work at small nibbling machine when have turned stop valve spindle more than once felt secretly confident of ability to cut screw meantime history be making at shop very slowly at first be true holly have be made most of seemed to attract not at penn'orth have'porths be most of sale even be few nan may grew haggard desperate uncle isaac have called once soon after opening saturday since have be stranger have said that be about to change lodging be widower nan knew nothing of new address in truth such be uncle isaac tenderness of heart that disliked sight complaint of distress in manner of many other people of similar tenderness betook a far a possible from scene thereof kept there be within few day of christmas when thing seemed hopeless johnny indeed have never ceased to hope till now have talked of certainty of struggling on somehow till wage be enough for indeed even six shilling week seemed something considerable now though knew that rent alone came to ten even johnny cheerfulness fell in face of intenser dejection more open tear of mother sister a day wore on long hick found quieter le inquisitive boy duller help than at first dinner at home be sad make believe knew that other two be contrasting coming christmas with last then gran'dad be with hale merry to look out of window be to look through world of frosty twig to woody deep where deer waited timid shadowy for crust flung out afar for from garden now there be just at desperate time that change came a by magic men who pulled down wall at opposite side of street gave place to others who built mighty brick pier at side of opening pier designed to carry half of new gate work be near complete men boy from yard found convenient place to slip out in at on breakfast time dinner time errand now chanced at time that one of men be in domestic difficulty difficulty that large part of eight nine hundred men of ship yard encountered in turn at more le regular interval wife inhabited bedroom in company with monthly nurse while roosted sleeplessly at night on slippery horsehair couch in parlour wallowed in jumble of spare blanket old coat on floor spending home hour by day in desolate muddling in kitchen lost incapable abject before tyranny of nurse on dark morning made forlorn attempt at raking together breakfast to carry with to work a have taken no thought to put anything into cupboard over night found easy matter to extract breakfast from in morning so came to pas on second day of affliction bedevilled husband hunger merely aggravated by stale lump of bread have thought to make shift on issued forth at new gate in quest of breakfast there be little time most of shop be distance off just opposite be flaming little chandler shop

have be ill fed for two three day new baby made event wherewith extra expense be natural boy came for two other quarter pound so that be plain that first customer have told others loaf be cut up to go with bacon mr may announced new branch of trade to johnny when came to dinner though a yet return be small enough there be new chance mother be hopeful of so went back to lathe with lighter heart night riveter worked overtime bacon be in better demand still more at night two three men took home snack in paper for supper from day thing grew better daily hock be finished by afternoon of next day establishment be out of pickle for men boy who brought own cold meat with came now for pickle trade be better a day went on christmas though found poor enough be none so sad festival after in month when gate have be formally opened for time men streamed by in hundred three large hock must rarely last two day there be average profit of three shilling hock more bread came in daily in batch at trade price cheese pickle went merrily what went best what increased in sale even beyond point be bacon customer called ham pleased nan may for indeed cooking hit popular taste began to feel pride in men who went home to dinner must buy bacon to take home for tea a many of lived in harbour lane thereabout custom soon came from wife in soap candle treacle pepper blacking nan may trade instinct grew with exercise found particular sort of bacon that best suited purpose customer taste have regular boiling throughout week quickly found trick of judging quality of bought bought to best use of money here must be said that nan may in new prosperity behaved toward one benefactor with undutiful forgetfulness be near ingratitude for bought almost nothing of mr dunkin be reasonably grieved true have begun by getting first stock of even then critical examination of what be sent showed unworthily suspicious attitude of mind even sent back many thing demanded better wilfully blind to fact that mr dunkin must turn out of shop at week notice if pleased though indeed in own mind be not vindictive for new tenant must be hard to find even submitted to outrage ending in actual loss humiliation for large tin of mustard be mr may first supply be tin from among kept for sale to small shopkeeper not on account to be sold from retail across mr dunkin own counter something in feel taste of mustard did not please nan may though indeed be not asked to eat went back now chanced that mr dunkin have taken on new shopman that week bungling incapable straightway began selling mustard from returned tin have served three customer before blunder be perceived then matter came to light purely because third customer chanced to be food drug inspector functionary gravely announced a soon a have good hold of parcel handsomely offered return of third part of mustard in sealed packet upshot be fine of five pound cost for mr dunkin on opinionative evidence of analyst who talked of starch turmeric ginger very excellent substance a anybody know truly be vexatious blow for mr dunkin unjust for certainly fault be not to sell such article retail be wholly against principle never complained such be forbearance never spoke of hardship to soul in fact except when sacked new assistant be even said that have offered reporter money to keep out of paper though did get into paper at good length too yet effort be kindly meant for truly must give mr may pain to learn that have be cause of mr dunkin misfortune if be woman of feeling at a time went began to doubt if be for custom dropped away to nothing rate at bacon be handed in from cart of firm somewhere in borough be scandalous to behold before very eye too when called for rent employed collector presently took to coming for rent that by presence manner might shame so thankless tenant into sense of decency order for bacon mustard coughed gently stared very hard at incoming good nan may be in wise abashed gave carman direction with shameless composure with sympathetic stop full out mr dunkin asked how trade be nan may answered in proper shopkeeper term that must grumble with hum purr led back through casual question answer to stock have at first supplied asked how have done with how have gone off answer be so artlessly direct so inconsiderately truthful that good mr dunkin be clean baffled reduced at last to desperate hint that if anything be wanted must take order back with got order so purred hummed way into harbour lane so away after time collector came in stead mr dunkin resolved to wait have doubt of permanence of new prosperity in shop place have never brought anybody living yet must not feel convinced till have seen steady trade there for time nan may activity must always be kept from flagging by judicious increase of rent if thing grew well established by exertion be certain to continue paying concern why here must be new branch of mr dunkin business ready made needed week notice given unexpectedly at properly chosen time when neighbouring shop be to let good stroke of business be happily completed mr may must vanish man must go in to manage at pound twenty five shilling week quarter there must be interruption to trade for outgoing tenant must naturally keep at work till last minute to get what little must mr dunkin must have new branch paying very excellently with trouble to mr dunkin have established other branch in same way found very simple cheap arrangement there be risk of own capital trouble in working up trade cost of goodwill rent be coming regularly while tenant laboured with zeal of man who imago be working for own benefit child important thing be to give nothing weekly tenancy else tenant might find time to get going somewhere near at hand so perhaps deprive mr dunkin of just reward of sagacity foresight patience there be little difficulty in matter beginner be timid glad of weekly tenancy fearing responsibility of anything longer at first afterwards well thing be in groove mr dunkin be so very kind sympathetic that be worth while to bother about change by method mr dunkin judiciously selecting purchase in shop property have acquired two three of half dozen branch flourished exceedingly kindly soul rejoiced to see in beginning have thought of plan for harbour lane shop being mainly concerned to get tenant matter in what trade indeed in eye place be a little suited for chandlery a for anything even now must wait for doubted lasting quality of new prosperity better few year of forbearance than too hurried seizure of weakening concern to find little more than same tenantless shop on hand after if seemed that trade owed anything to personal quality connexion of mr may well must be simple thing to keep on to manage instead of man must be act of benevolence moreover to unfortunate widow come cheaper be matter for future meanwhile nan may active confident filled shop by purchase from whatsoever factor sold best cheapest traveller called for

to something very near last place distinguished society of bar be profoundly astonished indeed distressed at ill luck gave more excellent information for future event information however that brought even worse luck with wife showed sympathy for trouble of course there be vexation disappointment such a of spring handicap be inseparable from fashionable life rather aggravated with hole corner

differently disposed came to dabble there be gymnasium too cricket club plenty of boxing girl came to learn cookery dressmaking there be sometimes superior visitor from other part oozing with inexpensive patronage who spoke of johnny companion a degraded class who be to be raised from depth so in institute johnny drew learned proper drawing office manner of projection learned also muscle grinder long arm balance on horizontal bar more particularly learned to pop in straight left to duck counter to give take furious pounding for three minute on end without losing wind good humour so that attention be diverted from home for long saw nothing of misery mother suffered in secret nothing of meek endurance of bessy for more reason because studied to keep ignorant to show cheerful face there came evening when eye be opened in degree at least perhaps something especially perverse have happened in spring handicap spring handicap be just beginning perhaps be other of vexation beset gentlemanly career certainly mr henry butson came into harbour lane in amiable mood at corner where public house shed light across street ran into stout bare armed girl in faded ultramarine hat made to push roughly aside girl stood ground planted untender elbow near spot where watch chain hung resplendent garn cried bought street yer then a sought to pas on d ' y'ear ye got yer collar yer chain where yer muzzle nowise mollified by outrage mr butson came scowling in at shop door taking notice of nan who stood at counter entered back parlour slammed door behind be barely nine o'clock so early return be uncommon bessy sat by fireside sewing mr butson be angry with world sorely needing someone to bully bessy be providentially convenient put cigar into mouth strode across to shelf in corner shoving girl chair crutch out of way in heap shelf carried bessy tattered delight of old book dragging random handful of leaf from among while confused bunch fell on floor twisted up one leaf thrust into gas flame bessy seized arm o pleaded please not out of book there be lot made on mantelpiece o indeed glass vase stood full of pipe light jerked elbow into face knocking backward swore savagely lit pipe with precious leaf then because bessy wept took handful from shelf pitched on fire at pleading harder limped forward to snatch off mr butson with timely fling of foot checked sound leg brought headlong on fender yus roared furious at contumacy take auf when put on go on see what will do to ye damn lazy skewshanked took by shoulder a made to rise pushed forward go ' earn yer livin '

idle slut get out o ' for second johnny stared then reached butson at spring knocked backward with swing of right fist crutch lay behind man heel tripped so that sat backward on floor mightily astonished johnny snatched poker waved close about butson head move cried white with passion try to get up will beat head in mr butson raised arm to save skull caught blow across bone sent numb to side johnny cried nan snatching at arm o henry pray get away mother said johnny will have to hit head blackguard coward be meaner hound even than took for will touch sister lame girl will at thought struck again nan caught at only mr butson shoulder suffered johnny mother entreated think o ' neighbour can hear next door so must for sake of trade propriety of harbour lane must be respected to have row in house be scandal unpardonable in lane in height of anger johnny remembered instinctively dropped voice very well said then call p'liceman will lock up johnny anger kept reason half astray yet must have remembered that to have member of household taken off by policeman must be more disgraceful than twenty row mr butson consternation though momentary be plain johnny johnny pleaded poor nan think of disgrace do let make up for sake johnny bessy be cry in corner nan be choking sobbing johnny wavered poker stopped in mid air butson took heart of grace moved to get up though kept eye on poker better take away growled to nan if ye want to smash 'im poker waved again mr butson changed mind a to getting up smash johnny asked smash eh keep civil tongue will have now see thrust point against mr butson nose leaving black smear think care for if be anywhere else 'd have ' broken head in twenty place now sit there ' listen to mr butson what be know came here starving with about suit o ' boiler clothes in world mother fed out o charity worse luck fed put clothes on lazy carcase cadged begged a mongrel dog must stop where be will have with flourish of poker smear on nose mr butson sat up again figure of ignominy talked mother over married have lived on ever since like gentleman like what think be gentleman not worth boy pay on mud barge now see here be not boy now at anyrate be not little one be within head a tall a be not so strong a now perhaps know be not a big day will be stronger because be rotting with idleness booze then will give bigger hiding than can carry for what saw just now look forward to until then if put hand within foot of sister again will brain with poker will stick something into will go for with can lay hold of now remember that johnny voice be loud again once more nan appealed right mother answered more quietly will make understand will keep little more at home in evening now fine fellow will take table to draw on whether like not unless sister mother want to use have got more right here than if go out will ask about behaviour when come in have kept quiet knuckled under to for sake of peace so a not to worry mother there be be enough o that if want row will have will make a frightened of a be of p'lice ah know what mean johnny have idea of what meant have be sharp enough to observe effect of earlier allusion to police followed up know what mean 'd look deal more at home in gaol than here in white shirt eating other people victual mr butson decided that bluster must not do just at present wondered if johnny really did know anything how much surely not must go good deal farther anyway best be cautious so mr butson growled oh right damn lot o ' fuss to make over ' want word bessy still cry took hold of brother arm said say more johnny please p'raps ought to have ' done what did what did johnny answered not so cheaply appeased do what like be will see interfere say want word sha have 'em will have something harder if touch let go arm minute go on can get up now to butson with black nose 'd better go ' wash none o ' trick if try to lay hold o ' from behind anything like will get with anything can catch hold of so now know mr henry butson growling indistinctly went out to wash face closely watched by johnny poker in hand next door on one side head be thrust out at back door to listen to unwonted noise of quarrelling at chandler on other side other head be thrust out at front door because law of irregularity in building of harbour lane decreed back garden to one house front garden to other xxiv home in harbour lane grew le sufferable than ever to mr butson taste contempt remained for sordid surroundings vulgar trade simple wife for everything about place in fact with reasonable exception of money extracted from food ate there now there be new affliction of unsubmissive stepson stepson moreover who watched who kept alert ear for expedient assertion of authority whereat might raise mutiny most objectionable stepson in way far too big growing bigger day who must not forget bygone who have nasty suggestive way of handling poker large poker unnecessarily heavy poker for sitting room seemed to suspect thing too talked unpleasantly of police thing turned one hot cold together so mr butson went more up west sought longer solace in society of bar a for johnny finding butson ceasing so far a must see from active offence gave thought to other thing though watching still drawing be among other matter claimed care chief of be different thing altogether for at institute have found girl first saw on dark morning when set out to be engineer have seen since once a be on way to ship launch twice little later then not at for eighteen month at least till began to forget now that saw again found woman grown a much woman a be grown man wondered that must ever have forgotten for moment more when have seen twice thrice knew turn of head nearing of step be desperately persuaded that nothing in world time tide must make forget again so that resolved to learn to dance little society that danced at institute saw nothing of radiant unforgettable came twice week to dressmaking class wherein acted a monitor assistant to teacher being a johnny later discovered by vast exertion dressmaker herself in daily work made friendship walked sedately apart be in sort mystery being for reason regarded a stuck up by girl of class so made target for many small needle thrust of spite johnny have secret notion that remembered because must pas with so extreme unconsciousness in manner so very blank unacquaintance in eye neat grey in dress have ever placid gravity of air almost odd by contrast with unceasing smirk giggle of rest of girl of institute name happy discovery attained at great expense of artless diplomacy be nora sansom now for awhile practice of orthographic projection suffered from neglect abstraction of mind long hick ignorant of cause be mightily concerned expostulated with face of perplexed surprise much poking of finger through hair jerking at lock thus separated be great matter tugged so secretly at johnny mind daily harder at heart string till blushed in solitude to find so weak creature nora sansom did not come to dancing knew nobody that knew be unapproachable a a chinese empress how to approach nora sansom at thought gulped tingled be more than little terrified be not brought to stand by contemplation of distinct interposing labyrinth of conventional observance such a who can see can pick way through in strict form by difficulty palpable to instinct rather than figured in mind intangible barrier that vexed johnny to madness so that hammered institute punching ball with blind fury again because world be now grown so many heaven wider must sit dream of thing beyond farthest margin yet between plan section crank shaft piston must wake to find designing monogram of letter n s j m altogether becoming sad young fool such a none of ever be in like circumstance angel two angel to be exact of rather stout came one night to johnny aid came unwitting in cab being man wife simple design be to see for upraising of hopeless residuum have be told though scarce believed at institute far east much farther east than whitechapel therefore without doubt deeper sunk in dirt iniquity young men woman danced together under regular ball room convention bawling chorus pounding one with quart pot be even said that partner be introduced in proper form before dancing thing so ludicrous in incongruity a to give choice laughter so two doubter from west end be only bayswater really took cab to see thing for having taken pain to inform of order of thing at institute arrived on evening when there be dancing be very annoying said so with acerbity be indeed so very indignant at disconformity of arrangement to caprice so extremely so obviously important lady waggled gilt handled lorgnon with such offended majesty that be discussed among in direction whether not something might be done to appease in end after few hasty inquiry class be broken up for evening off hand dance be declared to music extracted from institute piano fiddle of blushing young amateur girl came in gay chattering from dressmaking class lad rushed to exchange gymnasium flannel for clothes have come in unconscious that be to be made show of who kept dancing shoe on premise triumphed in foresight johnny be among a for have seen nora sansom coming in with others alone little shy resolved to seize occasion with hand did so very gallantly with le trepidation than at calmer moment must have judged possible first quadrille be called johnny courage rose for a yet have great confidence in dancing in general did know figure of quadrille having learned by rote a most boy learn euclid laid hand on mild young shopman who have unexpectedly found appointed master of ceremony in two minute be standing in set with nora sansom at side sheer pride of disorganised memory so that be lucky be side couple there must have be rout in first figure johnny partner knew very little nothing of dancing be quick to learn johnny rank beginner have proud advantage in knowledge of figure unstable a be so that thing went very joyfully girl eye grew brighter face gayer moment to end for life have be starved of merriment here be merriment in plenty of sort girl love four five dance be there be for place shut at ten to dance with nora sansom be impossible scandalous for everybody be very particular at institute johnny went a far a two sit out extracted half promise that must come dance other time more walked two street of way home with way be paved with cloud of glory why might go farther must not guess there be dismissed quite unmistakably though pleasantly enough fair very fair be poor little street in moonlight a johnny walked home very sweet air be good world kind world world a one may see who have emptied bottle of good champagne johnny must have shaken hand with anybody on way probably even with butson if have met nobody made offer even baked chestnut man be still there by high wall growled merely when johnny gave good night so johnny went to dream of gentle grey eye in dimpled face with brown hair about for few of song book beauty be nora sansom hair be golden black simple brown like hair of most other people eye be mere grey yet johnny dreamed a for two angel from bayswater who caused thing to come to pas looked at dancing from gallery said that be really very creditable considering quite surprising indeed for people of class hoped did lead to immorality went home virtuously conscious of having done duty toward submerged lady left gilt handled lorgnon in cab whereof gentleman have thought to take number lady said great many time before went to bed after that be just like man xxv week went time neared when dancing at institute must end for season must end with bang dazzle in long night when dancing must be kept up shamelessly till something one o'clock than twelve johnny counted first week then day last hour not because of dancing although be amusing because be to take nora sansom with double ticket for may have counted day hour may not true be that sat up late on several night with nun veiling ribbon making dress for occasion first fine frock have be hers night hid carefully dressmaking class night of late have be johnny privilege to guard home going to end of second street never farther twice have come to dancing by small practice be already johnny superior at exercise for big shouldered novice of eleven stone two be slower pupil than girl of eighteen in world be very welcome one to other acquaintance bettered day by day once johnny ventured question about adventure of morning now more than three year ago learned little from miss sansom answer lady who be ill be relation said found then talked of something else so till evening before long night be rule at institute to honour long night with glove white tie by way of compromise with evening dress johnny bought glove with discretion selected tie with care then went to institute took turn two at bar climbed up rope gave member lesson with glove thus refreshed dressed in walking clothes making sure that tie glove be safe in pocket set out for home there be dressmaking class night so that need not wait outside plainly waiting for be nora sansom johnny thought have be cry a in fact have oh mr may said be very sorry thought might be here be afraid sha be able to come to morrow not come why be sorry be very sorry mr may ca tell really there be quiver of lip voice be little uneven a though there be danger of more tear johnny be not disappointed merely be also angry be hard to conceal fact so said nothing turned walked few

bereavement better then end quickly have done with pang herein misjudged strength doubt perplexity assailed johnny also though for time grew to nothing sharper must have gone home straightway proud joyful if little sheepish to tell mother tale of evening nora have implored to say nothing yet wanted time to think thing over said left at familiar corner two street beyond institute begging to come

be in such trouble such trouble johnny wept again tell trouble must not at anyrate not then in end left johnny much mystified near a miserable a herself because of blind helplessness in unrevealed affliction inexpert in mystery be incomprehension what be trouble that must not be told of did not even know where nora lived why must tell why did never let see a far a home much knew that have mother have lost father by death have just learned from under stress of tear be not to see mother at least not yet nora be in sore trouble refused to say what trouble be that night moped brooded at maidment hurst next morning be saturday mr cottam gaffer swore made remark about expedience of being thoroughly awake before dinner time more at one o'clock johnny passed pay box without taking money turned back for when reminded amid chaff of shopmates many offer of portership suggestion to scramble slighted cash not far from yard gate saw small crowd of people about public house a neared perceived born drunk in midst of publican have refused to serve indeed have turned out now swayed about door proclaimed at large behultin lady screamed hoarsely ca go in plashe 'thout bein ' behulted behulted by low common public 'oush wo 'ave stand ducky sang out boy give what for for moment seemed inclined to turn wrath on natural enemy boy eye fell on black bottle with broken neck lying in gutter gi ' what for hiccupped stooping for bottle yesh will gi ' what for with flung bottle at largest window in sight there be crash black hole in midst of plate glass vast spider of crack to farthest corner mother born drunk stood stared perhaps little sobered then barman ran out tucking in apron took by arm there be yell scream struggle cheer from blackguard boy mother born drunk be hauled off screaming sliding stumbling between policeman publican johnny told mother when reached home that old acquaintance emma pacey be like to endure spell of gaol what occupied mind be trouble forgot mother born drunk for three four day then came next evening of dressmaking class at institute went never doubting to meet nora a came away at door housekeeper who be also hall porter beckoned gave letter left earlier in day be addressed to by name in weak straggling female hand for moment stared at not little surprised when tore open envelope found blotchy tear stained rag of letter read dearest johnny be over now do hope will forgive for not telling before be to say good bye god bless pray forget about be wrong of to let go so far did love so johnny must not help then did know what to do can never come to class again with disgrace everything printed in newspaper must get work somewhere where know must rather die must look after a well a can johnny because be mother burn at once forget about day will meet nice girl belonging to respectable family nothing to be ashamed of try to find will only make miserable good bye please forgive yours affectionately nora sansom what be what did mean stood in gymnasium dressing room to read when looked up gaslight danced locker spun about one clear thing be that nora said good bye be gone presently faculty assorted read letter again then once more be over asked to forgive for not telling before telling what told nothing now must never come to institute again did know address must try to find then there be everything printed in newspaper of course must look at newspaper why so long realising that went to reading room applied to pile of paper magazine littered table one paper after searched searched again saw nothing that must connect with nora by stretch of imagination till found stray sheet of day before with ring of coffee stain on police intelligence lay uppermost in midst of column name emma sansom in italic letter caught eye be forty one be charged with drunkenness wilful damage sentence more everything stood displayed a by flash of lightning for have witnessed offence on saturday emma sansom be married name of emma pacey whom boy called mother born drunk woman be mother now be plain all from very beginning when child wandered in night seeking strayed drunken mother inquired for with shamed excuse that be ill be why be not to call to see mother be for nora hindered from seeing home there be shameful report at publican tale be simple plain enough have declined to serve prisoner because be drunk a refused to leave have turned out though said made particular resistance shortly afterward heard crash found broken bottle great deal of broken glass in bar have gone outside saw prisoner being held by barman plate glass window be smashed be worth ten pound there be little more evidence police told worship that prisoner have be fined small sum for drunkenness before be usually inoffensive except for collecting crowd of boy be first charge against involving damage be widow of ship officer lost at sea have small annuity be chiefly supported of late by daughter dressmaker very respectable young woman daughter be present reporter called prepossessing young female in great distress wished to be allowed to pay damage in small instalment in end mother be sent to prison for month in default of payment of fine damage for indeed daughter be minor undertaking be worthless one thing johnny looked for eagerly did not find prisoner address whether consideration for daughter have prompted reporter to suppression whether be due to accident johnny must not guess in other report in same column address be given not straightway johnny went to beg housekeeper that might rummage store of old paper for of day before for to desert nora now in trouble be thing wholly inconceivable so far from burning letter put envelope in safest pocket felt there more than once to be assured of safety address be in none of paper in fact report be in more than three in one of be five line long what must do must not even write one line of comfort have be going on with work placidly monday while nora have be standing up in police court weeping imploring mercy for wretched mother if have known must scarce have done anything to aid helplessness be consolation rather cruellest of aggravation well there stood matter raving must not help must beating table even head with fist must somehow devise way to reach nora xxviii resolved first to try institute nora name address must be on class register what business have with girl class register a diplomatist failure be lamentable must invent reasonable excuse ignoble defeat be fate at hand of rigid lady who managed girl department of institute then took to prowling about street lay beyond second corner have marked end of evening walk watching for searching also desperately for impossible sign about house might suggest that lived in thus spent daylight of two evening watching little muslin hung window because muslin be tied with ribbon of sort remembered to have worn because chose to fancy neatness daintiness about tying might well be hers on second evening a dusk fell window opened hairy red bearded man in blue shirt sleeve put out head leaned on sill to smoke pipe watch red sky johnny swung away savagely called fool for pain indeed must ill afford to waste time for maidment hurst claimed till five day few hour in evening be remained more nora must change lodging perhaps have done so already after screwed courage so high a to go to police station where charge against nora mother must have be taken to ask for address cast iron faced inspector in charge took name address instead a beginning then must tell nothing at last maddened reckless went to publican demanded information of now if johnny have have little more worldly experience little more cunning great deal more coolness must have done at first beginning by ordering drink must have opened casual conversation led to matter of window in end must have gained point quietly easily a be did none of thing ordered drink made blunt request taking little thought of manner none of publican point of view perhaps forgetting that man be in way responsible for rebuff already endured publican for part be already in bad temper because of clumsy tapping of barrel ensuing cheek of potman so answered johnny demand by asking if have come to pay for window receiving negative reply have expected urgently recommended intruder departure outside in such term a gave choice compliance so now in extremity johnny resolved on last expedient one have be vaguely in mind for day two though have yet scarce have courage to consider seriously be to tell mother whole thing to induce if might to ask address at institute perhaps on pretext of dressmaking business be not hopeful for well knew that hint of traffic with family of one such a nora mother must be horror to must see nothing else to sit still be intolerable moreover guessed that mother must suspect something from preoccupation neglect of drawing though indeed poor nan be most at pain just then to conceal trouble of own mr butson in fact began to chafe under restraint of narrow circumstance not that be poorer than have be habit indeed be much better off that need have expanded with prosperity with success in society be just now that wife began to attempt retrenchment probably be encouraged by outrageous revolt of son revolt have made advisable certain degree of caution on part of head of household spoke of rumour that ship yard opposite might close a so many other thames ship yard have closed of late year that said must mean ruin for shop must try to save what little might meantime absurdity of course in mr butson view felt interest in rumour of old woman about ship yard petty measurement of sordid chance of trade irritated if wife found one source of profit running dry must look out tap be so long a got what wanted troubled little about manner of getting now ran near having le than wanted wife be growing even le accommodating went so far a to hint of withholding paltry sum lad earned must have thought to buy clothes to save toward end of apprenticeship more than mr butson much suspected that johnny have actually have own money for while past that mr butson have descended to mean subterfuge of representing a earnings sum in reality extracted week from till act of pure embezzlement then there be cottage in epping forest must sell now though wanted to sell when first left what good be there in keeping true there be three sixpence week of rent be nothing must go in round of drink in round in distinguished bar there be deduction even from three sixpence sold cottage might produce respectable sum perhaps hundred pound at anyrate eighty figure stirred blood what magnificent dash man might cut with eighty pound fortune might be made out of too if be used wisely not buried away in wretched three sixpenny cottage properly invested on judicious flat race certainty must double about twice week so made very plain to nan that sale of cottage for what must fetch handing over of proceeds be plan insisted on stupid woman must see be plain that be beginning to over estimate importance in establishment by reason that of late have not be sufficiently sworn at shoved thumped twisted pinched on arm be worst of kindness to woman took advantage so that be obliged to begin to thump again there be need to do so that johnny might know so cause low disturbance in fact johnny took little notice of thing at home just now no longer made inquiry lifted poker with so impudent stare be scarce indoors at wherefore mr butson punched ruffianed being careful to leave disreputable mark in visible spot such a black eye sometimes kicked demanded more money more while insisted on sale of cottage monstrous law of conveyance made impossible for to lay hand on deed sell place must have done of course made advisable too for bessy to avoid have better effect than direct attack on nan till at last woman be so far reduced that be near very dangerous rebellion indeed nearer than mr butson suspected for began to think of attempting separation by magistrate order shameful a must be in neighbourhood though feared greatly so be when johnny turned toward home on evening little before nine o'clock sick of blind searching ready to tell mother story of nora sansom first to last at harbour lane corner saw butson walking off wondered to see about blackwall so early in evening nobody be in shop johnny went through so quietly that surprised mother bessy in shop parlour cry bitterly nan sat on chair bessy bent over concealment be possible johnny be seized by dire surmise mother what be said what be be doing nan bent lower answered nothing johnny looked toward bessy almost sternly be beaten mother again bessy blurted between sob beaten mother again johnny face be white nostril stood wide round beaten mother again be always doing now bessy sobbed wanting more money 'd good mind to tell before beaten room swam before johnny eye why nan rose to close door johnny said meekly be bit upset let upset what be matter with leg be limping kicked saw kick at ankle bessy burst out pouring tale unrestrained tried to stop then hit asked johnny not so white in cheek now whiter than ever about mouth yes be most bessy wept afresh perhaps evening of disappointment have chastened johnny impatience knew that man be out of reach now forced fury down in ten minute knew whole thing between bessy outpouring nan tearful admission when be coming back did not know probably must be late a usual go doing anything hasty johnny nan implored be so afraid of doing something rash be not much really be bit upset will have to think about johnny said with such calmness nan felt somewhat reassured though bessy be inwardly afraid be going out for hour strode away to institute walking by instinct seeing nothing till be under lettered lamp went to dressing room hurried into flannel in gymnasium instructor brawny sergeant of grenadier be watching lad on horizontal bar johnny approached with hesitating request for free spar free spar lad said sergeant what be up gettin ' cheeky want to give hidin ' sergeant johnny answered not such fool a never have free spar with man much heavier than just want to try be there be comprehending twinkle about sergeant eye right said be givin near two stone be if be bit over eleven fetch glove at time johnny must never have conceived impudence of asking sergeant once champion of army for free spar even light spar with sergeant be something of undertaking wherein one be apt to have hand full bit over lad have reason now dashed at professor with straight lead soon blow be going like hail on window pane sergeant stood like rock johnny rush be beaten back a by hammer blow on head came again fresh eager buzzed master merrily about head getting in very respectable number of straight drive such a must knock ordinary man down though sergeant never winked bringing off one on mark did knock out grunt much a punch in region will knock one out of squeaking doll steady sergeant called after two long round have be sparred will get stiff if keep on at rate lad be not what want reckon last with grin have be boxin

after johnny asked be to morrow what sergeant oh ai sergeant be stranger there be sergeant go to moral establishment p'raps with nod at institute behaves strictly proper be just chap out in street must like to see fight be when be quite know that johnny answered oh like be hum sergeant be thoughtful for moment perhaps incredulous then said well ca be helped suppose anyway keep left goin strong lead quite so reckless with head up ' guard be good enough ' bigger be more to hit xxix mr butson be perhaps shade relieved when returned home that night found quiet johnny in bed have half expected that inopportune return might have caused trouble night after a came from railway station little earlier than usual johnny stopped in street want to speak to said just come round by dock wall manner be quiet businesslike mr butson wondered why asked ca tell here ca there be too many people about be money in pocket if come mr butson went what meant must not imagine johnny usually told truth said must be money in pocket desirable disposition of article dock wall be just round corner tall raking wall at one side of sparsely lit road be empty at night lower wall at other road reached by flight of step rising from street gateway in low wall well what be now mr butson asked suspiciously a johnny stopped under gas lamp looked right left along deserted road only just johnny replied with simple distinctness wanted mother to give money week though in fact be be letting keep well here last week money shook in hand will give if will stand up here fight what fight mr butson laughed felt secret uneasiness yes 'd rather fight woman doubt lame girl be going to give change make fight here johnny flung jacket on ground hat on be such young fool mr butson loftily put on jacket come home yes

come on mr butson sat gasped fingered nose gently found very tender bleeding seemed to have met thunderbolt in dark turned slowly over on knee so got on foot hit come hit called johnny sparring at fancy be only mother cur come be hitting see so seized man by ear twisted rapped about face treatment must have roused sheep butson sprang at johnny grappled with for moment bore back johnny asked nothing better broke ground checked rush with half arm hit stopped with quick double left flush in face be mere slaughter johnny be too hard too scientific too full of cool hatred wretched butson bigger heavier a might be be flaccid from soft living science have none fought like rat in corner recking nothing of rule kicking biting striking wrestling madly though to small purpose for enemy deadly calm deadly quick saw movement ere be made battered with savage precision whenever have have enough said johnny a butson staggered leaned against wall can stop know by calling p'lice like
