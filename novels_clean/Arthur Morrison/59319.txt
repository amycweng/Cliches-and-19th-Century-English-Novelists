lane tabernacle case of flitterbat lancer in none of case of investigation by martin hewitt have a yet recorded have direct substantial personal interest in case be about to set forth however have such interest though legally fear amounted to more than cost of smashed pane of glass case in way be one of most curious came under notice completely justified hewitts oft repeated dictum that there be nothing however romantic apparently improbable have not happened at time in london be late on summer evening two three year back that drowsed in armchair over particularly solid ponderous volume of essay on social economy be doing good deal of reviewing at time remember that particular volume have property of such exceeding toughness have already made three successive attack on on a many successive evening attack having be defeated in end by sleep weather be hot chair be very comfortable day be tiring book have somewhere about string of polysyllable essence a of laudanum still something have be done on evening now on fourth strenuously endeavoured to finish book late a be lamp have be lighted hour so for there have be light enough to read by near window till well past nine oclock be just beginning to feel that word before be sliding about losing meaning be about to fall asleep after when sudden crash jingle of broken glass behind woke with start threw book down pane of glass in window be smashed hurried across threw up sash to see if must whence damage have come illustration pane of glass in window be smashed think have somewhere said believe be in describing circumstance of extraordinary death of mr foggatt that building in chamber hewitts office be situated be accessible rather visible for there be entrance from rear there be in fact small courtyard reached by passage from street behind into courtyard sitting room window looked hullo there shouted there came reply must distinguish anybody in courtyard be at best shadowy place at night with artificial light after news agent who have permanent booth there have shut up gone home gone be now to yard seemed deserted men have be at work during day on drain pipe near booth reflected that probably litter have provided stone wherewith window have be smashed a looked however two men came hurrying from passage into court going straight into deep shadow of one corner presently appeared again in le obscure part hauling forth third man who must have already be there in hiding man who appeared so far a must see to be smaller than of assailant struggled fiercely without avail be dragged across toward passage leading to street beyond most remarkable feature of whole thing be silence of three men cry exclamation expostulation escaped one of in perfect silence two hauled third across courtyard in perfect silence swung struggled to resist escape matter astonished not little men be entering passage before found voice to shout at took notice disappeared soon after heard cab wheel in street beyond have doubt that two men have carried off prisoner illustration man struggled fiercely turned back into room little perplexed seemed probable that man who have be borne off have broken window why looked about on floor presently found missile be a have expected piece of broken concrete be wrapped up in worn piece of paper have partly opened out again a lay on carpet thus indicating that have only just be hastily crumpled round stone again why might be considered trifle more polite to hand gentleman clinker decently wrapped up than to give in raw state came to much same thing after if be passed through shut window why clinker at disengaged paper spread out then saw to be rather hastily written piece of manuscript music whereof append reduced facsimile gave help turned paper way must make nothing of there be not mark on must discover except music scrawled title flitterbat lancer at top paper be old dirty cracked what did mean one might conceive of person in certain circumstance sending message possibly appeal for help through friend window wrapped round stone seemed to be nothing of sort be not message hastily written piece of music with bar time marked just a might have be put down by somebody anxious to make exact note of air time of must remember moreover be year old not thing just written in recent emergency what lunatic must have chosen violent way of presenting with air from forgotten flitterbat lancer indeed be idea what more likely than that man taken away be lunatic others keeper man under curious delusion led not only to fling old music note through window to keep perfectly quiet while struggling for freedom looked out of window again then seemed plain to that clinker paper must not have be intended for personally have be flung at window a being only one showed light within reasonable distance of yard most of window about mine be of office have be deserted early in evening once more picked up paper with idea to hear what flitterbat lancer sounded like turned to little pianette strummed over note making own time changing a seemed likely make nothing of must by mean extract from note anything resembling air considered thing little more half thought of trying martin hewitts office door in case might still be there must offer guess at meaning of smashed window scrap of paper be most probable however that have gone home be about resuming social economy when hewitt came in have stayed late to examine bundle of paper in connection with case just placed in hand now having finished came to find if be disposed for evening stroll before turning in thing be in habit of handed paper piece of concrete observing there little job for hewitt instead of stroll what do thing mean told complete history of smashed window hewitt listened attentively examined paper fragment of paving say people made absolutely sound whatever asked none that of scuffling even that seemed to do quietly must see whether not two men gagged other placed hand over mouth certainly didnt do that be dark of course not so dark a to prevent seeing generally what be doing when first looked out of window after smash called out got answer although man suppose to have thrown thing must have be there at time alone be so hewitt stood for minute in thought then said there something in what cant guess at moment something deep fancy be sure wont come out now on mind be made up dreadful volume have vanquished altogether three time already if let go again must haunt like nightmare there be indeed very little left to read determined to master draft review before slept so told hewitt be sure must stick to work very well said then perhaps will lend article holding up paper stone a spoke delighted to lend em im sure said if get more melody out of clinker than did out of paper wont have musical evening good night hewitt went away with puzzle in hand turned once more to social economy thanks to gentleman who smashed window conquered be sure must have dropped fast asleep have not be for ii at time only regular daily work be on evening paper so left home at quarter to eight on morning following adventure of broken window in order a usual to be at

floor below will probably be in at about time come down with went down found hewitt in outer office gentleman told with solemn intonation have come to ask for piece of manuscript music flitterbat lancer be particularly proud of because nobody who try to play can make sort of tune out of be entirely because two dear friend of be anxious to drag out of pocket practice over on quiet that flung through window pane last night wrapped round piece of concrete stranger glanced sharply at must see that manner tone rather disconcerted hewitt came forward at once oh yes said just so quite natural sort of thing a matter of fact quite expected umbrella wet do mind putting in stand thank come into private office entered inner room hewitt turning to stranger went on yes be very extraordinary piece of music that flitterbat lancer have be having little practice with though im really nothing of musician dont wonder be anxious to keep to yourself sit down stranger with distrustful look at hewitt complied at moment hewitts clerk kerrett entered from outer office with slip of paper hewitt glanced at crumpled in hand be engaged just now be remark kerrett vanished now hewitt said a sat down suddenly turned to stranger with intent gaze now mr hoker well talk of music stranger started frowned youve advantage of sir said seem to know name dont know yours hewitt smiled pleasantly name said be hewitt martin hewitt be business to know great many thing for instance know that be mr reuben b hoker of robertsville ohio illustration mr hoker visitor pushed chair back stared well that git said youre pretty smart chap anyway ive heard name before of course so youve be studyin of flitterbat lancer have with keen glance in hewitts face well well spose have whats opinion why answered hewitt still keeping steadfast gaze on hokers eye think pretty late in century to be fishing about for wedlake jewel thats word astonished almost a much a did mr hoker great wedlake jewel robbery be a many will remember traditional story of sixty remembered more of at time than probably most men do who have at time read up cause clbres of century sir francis wedlakes country house have be robbed whole of lady wedlakes magnificent collection of jewel stolen man named shiels strolling musician have be arrested have be sentenced to long term of penal servitude man named legg one of comparatively wealthy scoundrel who finance promising theft swindle pocket greater part of proceeds have also be punished only very few of trinket quite unimportant item have be recovered great bulk of booty be never brought to light so much remembered hewitts sudden mention of wedlake jewel in connection with broken window mr reuben b hoker flitterbat lancer astonished not little a for hoker did best to hide perturbation with little success wedlake jewel eh said whats to do with anyway to do with responded hewitt with air of carelessness well well have idea nothing more if wedlake jewel have nothing to do with well say more about thats here paper mr hoker only little crumpled here also be piece of cement if wedlake jewel have nothing to do with affair may possibly want that too cant tell rose placed article in mr hokers hand with manner of terminating interview hoker rose with bewildered look on face turned toward door then stopped looked at floor scratched cheek finally after thoughtful look first at then at hewitt sat down again emphatically in chair have just quitted put hat on ground come said well play square game paper have something to do with wedlake jewel win lose ill tell know about youre smart man youve found out more than know already tell guess do harm aint done good yet anyway say what please of course hewitt answered think first might tell something youd be sorry for afterward mind dont invite confidence confidence be durned say will listen to what say tell if think ive be swindled not there aint creature in country whose advice can ask dollar be gone now guess wont go skirmishing after more if think good will do so much a said before hewitt replied tell what please if can help will remember dont ask for secret thats right guess mr hewitt well now be like mr reuben b hoker plunged into detailed account of adventure since arrival in london relieved of repetition put a directly a possible be a follows mr hoker be wagon builder have made good business from very humble beginning intended to go on make still better meantime have come over to europe for short holiday thing have promised for year be wandering about london street on second night after arrival in city when managed to get into conversation with two men at bar be not very prepossessing men altogether though flashily dressed very soon suggested game of card reuben b hoker be not to be have in way after while parted two be amusing fellow enough in way when hoker saw again next night in same bar made difficulty in talking with freely after time after succession of drink told that have speculation on hand speculation meant thousand if succeeded to carry out be only waiting for paltry sum of there be house said in be certain be hidden great number of jewel of immense value have be deposited there by man who be now dead exactly in what part of house jewel be to be found did not know there be paper said be supposed to contain information a yet hadnt quite be able to make out must really matter very little if once must get possession of house then must simply set to work search from topmost chimney to lowermost brick if necessary anyhow jewel must be found sooner later only present difficulty be that house be occupied that landlord wanted large deposit of rent down before must consent to turn out present tenant give possession at higher rental deposit other expense must come to at least hadnt money however if friend of theirs who meant business must put necessary sum at disposal keep mouth shut must make equal partner in proceeds with a value of whole haul must probably be something not very far off speculation must bring tremendous return to man who be smart enough to see advantage of putting down hoker very distrustful skeptically demanded more detailed particular of scheme two men luker birks be name found in course of talking inflexibly refused to communicate be likely said luker that must give ole thing away to anybody who might easily go with clear out bloomin show not much weve told what game be if youd like to take flutter with right youll do a well a anybody well treat square if dont well dont thats well get oof from somewhere there bloke a ud jump at chance can tell only theyre inconvenient bloke to deal with a ill explain if come in with anyway aint going to give show away before youve done somethin to prove youre on job straight put money in will know a much a do then there be more drink more discussion hoker be still reluctant though tempted by prospect growing more venturesome with drink dont see said birks that if be tryin to ave must out with tale a long a yer arm complete with address of ouse then spose youd lug out piece on nail without askin bloomin question more fool thats a be thing so perfectly genuine that wed rather lose chance wait for other bloke to find money than run chance of givin thing away aint wotll be doin favour mind if anybody not that want to talk of favour at if come to matter o business simple plain thats be if youre willin to come in with money that cant do without very well if aint very well too only aint goin to give thing away to outsider question of trustin with chance of collarin trustin with paltry dont lay out igh moral sentiment only say weight o money be on one side take leave thats ave scotch talk went on drink went on ended at chucking out time in reuben b hoker handing over five ten pound note with smiling though slightly incoherent assurance of eternal friendship for luker birks in morning awoke to realization of bad head bad tongue bad opinion of proceeding of previous night in sober sens seemed plain that have be swindled have heard of confidence trick to many american have unaccountably fallen victim for to trick have always seemed very thin have sworn that something better than confidence trick must be required to get over now there seemed doubt that be more than confidence trick over again in new more impudent form day cursed fuddled foolishness at night made for bar have be scene if transaction with little hope of seeing luker birks who have agreed to be there to meet there be however rather to surprise made demand for more money asked if understood music showed worn old piece of paper containing manuscript flitterbat lancer exact spot said where jewel be hidden be supposed to be indicated somehow somewhere on piece of paper hoker did not understand music must find nothing on paper looked in least like direction to hiding place for jewel anything else luker birks then went into full particular of project first a to history first a to history jewel be famous wedlake jewel have be taken from sir francis wedlakes house in never heard of again certain jerry shiels have be arrested in connection with robbery have be given long sentence of penal servitude have died in gaol jerry shiels be extraordinarily clever criminal travelled about country a street musician although expert burglar very rarely perpetrated robbery acted a sort of travelling fence receiving stolen property transmitting to london out of country also acted a agent of man named legg who have money who financed likely looking project of criminal nature shiels might arrange recommend luker birks explained that there be many men of class that be to that have referred on previous evening when said that there be bloke must jump at chance of financing present venture jerry shiels travelled with pardner man who played harp acted a assistant messenger in affair wherein jerry be reluctant to appear personally when shiels be arrested have in possession quantity of printed manuscript music after first remand pardner jimmy snape applied for music to be given up to in order a explained that might earn living objection be raised to shiels be quite willing that snape must have so be handed over now among music be small slip headed flitterbat lancer shiels have shown to snape before arrest in case of shiels being taken snape be to take particular slip to legg a fast a must slip indeed carried about in unexplained way legg understood indication of place in shiels have concealed bulk of wedlake jewel whole proceeding be ingenious trick invented by shiels used before be supposed to communicate with legg while under arrest snape got music a chance must have on very day legg be arrested soon after be sentenced also to term of year snape hung about in london for little while then emigrated before leaving however gave slip of music to lukers father rag shop keeper who be friend of to whom owed money explained history hoped that luker senior must be able to recoup for debt good deal over then went luker senior have made sort of fruitless effort to get at information concealed in paper have held to fire to bring up concealed writing have washed have held to light till eye ached have gone over with magnifying glass in vain have got musician to strum out note on sort of instrument backwards forward alternately in other way must think of if at time fancied resemblance in resulting sound to familiar song tune got that song studied word with loving care upside down right side up way took word flitterbat lancer transposed letter in direction did everything else must think of in end gave up died now lately luker junior have be impelled with desire to see into matter have repeated parental experiment more with chemical with same lack of success have taken pal birks into confidence together have tried other experiment still usually very clumsy one indeed till at last began to believe that message have probably be written in sort of invisible ink subsequent washing experiment have erased altogether have done one other thing have found house shiels rented at time of arrest in good quantity of stolen property not connected with wedlake case be discovered here argued if anywhere jerry shiels have hidden jewel there be other place where must be found to have lived over have sufficient control to warrant hiding valuable therein perhaps once house must be properly examined something about might give clue a to what message of flitterbat lancer meant at rate message none anybody in possession of house with certain amount of patience secrecy thoroughness must in time make master of possible hiding place must completely excavate back yard trouble be that house be occupied that money be wanted to get possession be with view of providing that have decided to broach subject to hoker hoker of course be anxious to know where house in question stood luker birks must on account inform youve done part said now leave to do ours there bit of job about tenant out wont go itll take bit of time before landlord can make so just hold jaw wait when be safe in ouse there chance of anybody else pokin into business then can come help find stuff if like aint goin to ave chance of puttin in first for journey bet hoker went home that night sober in much perplexity thing might be genuine after indeed there be many little thing made think be then if be what guarantee have that must get share supposing search turned out successful none at then struck for first time that jewel though may have lain untouched so long be stolen property after moral aspect of affair began to trouble little legal aspect troubled more that consideration however decided to leave over for present at rate have more than word of luker birks that jewel if existed be of lady wedlake luker birks only professed to know from hearsay at rate be gone where felt pretty sure must have difficulty in getting back from determined to wait event at least made up mind to have little guarantee for money in accordance with resolve suggested when met two men next day that must take charge of slip of music make independent study of proposal however met with instant veto whole thing be now in hand luker birks laid down didnt intend letting of out if hoker wanted to study flitterbat lancer must do in presence if be dissatisfied must go to next shop altogether became clear to unhappy hoker now have parted with money be altogether at mercy of fellow if wished to get share of plunder even to see money back again if made complaint if matter became at known affair must be blown upon a expressed money must be gone mostly though resented bullying talk determined to get even in matter of music resolved to make up piece of paper folded a like slip a possible substitute one for other at next meeting then must put flitterbat lancer in safe place face fellow conspirator with hand of card equal to own carried out plan next evening with perfect success thanks to trick of passing card have learned in youth thanks also to contemptuous indifference with luker birks have begun to regard got slip in pocket left bar have not gone far however before luker discovered trick soon became conscious of being followed looked for cab be in dark street cab be near luker birks turned corner began to run saw must catch felt doubt that did must lose slip of paper everything be big active fellow must probably do a liked with especially since must not call for help without risking exposure of joint enterprise everything depended now on putting flitterbat lancer out of reach where must recover then must form sort of security for share of venture ran till saw narrow passage way on right into darted led into yard where stone be lying about in large building before saw window of lighted room couple of floor up be desperate expedient there be time for consideration wrapped stone in paper flung with force through lighted window even a did heard foot of luker birks a hurried down street rest of adventure in court saw luker birks kept hoker in lodging night searched unsuccessfully for paper bullied swore cajoled entreated begged to play game square with pal hoker merely replied that have put flitterbat lancer where couldnt easily find that intended playing game square so long a did same in end released apparently with more respect for cuteness than have before entertained advising at rate to get paper into possession a soon a must with view repaired again to scene of window smashing exploit having ascertained exact position of window in building began morning attack on outer door now said mr hoker in conclusion of narrative perhaps youll give bit of christian advice youre up to a many move a most people over here be playin fool game running after tough aint wouldnt have told what have of course if wasnt clear that youd got hold of hang of scheme somehow say now be swindle hewitt shrugged shoulder depends said on friend luker birks a may easily see for may want to swindle of money of proceeds of speculation a call may not im afraid theyd like to at rate perhaps youve got little security in piece of paper one thing be plain certainly believe in deposit of jewel else wouldnt have taken so much trouble to get paper back on chance of seeing way of using after have got into house speak of then guess ill go on with thing if thats that depends of course on whether care to take trouble to get possession of what after be somebody el lawful property hoker looked little uneasy well said there that of course didnt know nothin about at first when did id parted with money felt entitled to get something back for anyway stuff aint found yet when be why then know might make deal with owner say how did find out name about here affair being jined up with wedlake jewel hewitt smiled a to name address just think over little when youve gone away if dont see how did youre not so cute a think be in regard to jewel well just read message of flitterbat lancer thats read whew that beat what doe say where how did fix hoker turned paper over eagerly in hand a spoke see now said hewitt wont tell all ill tell something may help to test real knowledge of luker birks part of message be in word have better write down over coal fifth dancer slide say jerry shiels horney what hoker exclaimed fifth dancer slide over coal thats mighty odd dance figure anyway lancer not whats about about wedlake jewel a said now can go make bargain with luker birks only other part of message be address that already know if have be telling truth about house intend taking can offer to tell have told of message after have told where house be proved to that be taking step talk of if wont agree to think have best treat a common rogue be charge with obtaining money under false pretence in case dont be disappointed if see very little of wedlake jewel nothing more must hewitt say than despite hokers many question when at last hoker have gone almost a troubled perplexed a ever friend turned to said now brett if havent lunched must like to see end of business hurry up end of said be to end so soon how simply by police raid on jerry shielss old house with search warrant communicated with police morning before came here poor hoker said oh have told police before saw hoker heard of of course just conveyed message on music slip be enough ill tell about when there more time must be off now with information have given hoker friend may make extra push get into house soon couldnt resist temptation to give unfortunate hoker sort of sporting chance though poor one fear get lunch a quickly a can go at once to colt row bankside southwark way know probably will be there before if not wait hewitt have assumed hat glove a spoke now hurried away took such lunch a must in twenty minute hurried in cab towards blackfriar bridge cabman knew nothing of colt row have notion of where to find bankside once in region left then colt row be not difficult to find be one of place decay with access of respectability like drury lane clare market once when jacob island be still island little farther down river colt row have evidently be unsafe place for person with valuable about then probably prospered in own way now be quite respectable very dilapidated dirty looked a unprosperous a street well can be too near river to be frequented thoroughfare too far from to be valuable for wharfage purpose be stagnant backwater in london tide close though stood to full rush of stream perhaps be sixty yard long perhaps little more be certainly very few yard wide house at side have patient forlorn look of waiting for metropolitan improvement to come along carry away to rest many seemed untenanted most threatened soon to be untenable must see sign a yet of hewitt of police so walked up down narrow pavement for little while a did so became conscious of face at window of least ruinous house in row face fancied expressed particular interest in movement house be old gabled structure faced with plaster what have apparently once be shop window at rate wide one on ground floor be now shuttered up face watched old woman looked from window next above have noted particular with curiosity when arriving again at street corner observed hewitt approaching in company with police inspector followed by two unmistakable plain clothes men well hewitt said youre first here after have seen more of friend hoker nothing very well probably hell be here before long though party turned into colt row inspector walking up to door of house with shuttered bottom window knocked sharply there be response so knocked again equally in vain out said inspector said saw woman watching from window above not three minute ago ho ho inspector replied thats so eh one of johnson step round to back will know court behind one of plain clothes men started off after waiting minute two inspector began thundering cannonade of knock brought available head out of window of inhabited room in row woman face appeared stealthily at upper window again inspector saw shouted to to open door save necessity of damaging at woman opened window began abusing inspector with shrillness fluency added street corner audience to already congregated at window go away blaggards lady said among other thing ought to be orse wipped one of ye comin ere tryin to turn decent people out o ouse ome wait till usband come ome ell show yer ye mutton cadgin scoundrel payin rent reglar good tenant a be always be a may ask mr green next door blessed minute im respectable married woman thats what be ye dirty great cow ards last word with low tragic emphasis hewitt remembered what hoker have said about present tenant refusing to quit house on landlord notice think weve come from landlord to turn out said to inspector be not here from landlord old fool inspector said in a low voice a must be trusted to reach woman ear dont want to turn out be police with search warrant to look for something left here before came youd better let in can tell youll get into trouble ark at woman screamed pointing at inspector ark at im think be born yesterday that feller go ome ye dirty pie stealer go ome oo sneaked cook watch eh go ome audience showed sign of becoming small crowd inspector patience gave out here bradley said addressing remaining plain clothes man give hand with shutter two powerful men seized iron bar held shutter began to pull garrison be undaunted seizing broom woman began to belabour invader about shoulder head from above just at moment woman emitting terrific shriek be suddenly lifted from behind vanished then head of plain clothes man who have gone round house appeared with calm announcement there winder open behind sir ill open front door if like illustration woman began to belabour invader about shoulder head from above then there be heavy thump head be withdrawn broom be probably responsible inspector shouted impatiently for front door to be opened in minute two bolt be shot swung back placid johnson stood in passage a passed in said ive locked er in back room upstairs a matter of fact might have guessed volley of screech punctuated by bang from contact of broom door left doubt bottom staircase of course inspector said tramped down into basement little way from stairfoot hewitt opened cupboard door enclosed receptacle for coal still keep coal here see said striking match passing to fro near sloping roof of cupboard be of plaster covered under side of stair now for fifth dancer said throwing match away making for staircase again one two three four five tapped fifth stair from bottom here be stair be uncarpeted hewitt inspector began careful examination of one have indicated tapped in different place hewitt passed hand over surface of tread riser presently with hand at outer edge of riser hewitt spoke here be said be riser slide took out pocket knife scraped away grease paint from edge of old stair then joint be plainly visible for long time plank grimed set with age refused to shift at last by dint of patience firm finger moved in few second be drawn clean out from end like lid of domino box lying on side within nothing be visible grime fluff small rubbish inspector passed hand along bottom angle here hook something at rate said be gold hook of old fashioned earring broken off short hewitt slapped thigh somebody be here before said good time back too judging from dust hook plain indication that jewellery be here once probably broken up for convenience of carriage stowage there plainly nothing more except except piece of paper hewitts eye have detected black with loose grime a be small piece of paper lying at bottom of recess drew out shook off dust why whats exclaimed more music why look here went to window there saw in hewitts hand piece of written musical notation thus hewitt pulled out from pocket few piece of paper here be copy made morning of flitterbat lancer note two of own a well said took pencil constantly referring to own paper marked letter under note on last found slip of music when have done letter read be clever cove whoever be there be cleverer say jim snape horney mate see hewitt said handing inspector paper snape unconsidered messenger finding legg in prison set to work got jewel for either have more gumption than other people through whose hand flitterbat lancer have passed else have got clue to cipher during association with shiels thing be cryptogram of course of very simple sort though uncommon in design snape be humorous soul too to leave message here in same cipher on chance of somebody else reading flitterbat lancer asked why did give that slip of music to lukers father well owed money got out of way also avoided appearance of flushness that paying debt might have given got quietly out of country with spoil also may have paid off grudge on old luker anyhow thing plagued enough shriek upstairs have grown hoarser broom continued vigorously let that woman out said inspector well go report not much good looking for snape now fancy there satisfaction in clearing up that old quarter century mystery left place pursued by execration of broom wielder who bolted door behind from window defied to come back vowed must have searched before magistrate for what have probably stolen in very next street hove in sight of reuben b hoker in company of two swell mob looking fellow who sheered off down side turning at sight of group hoker too looked rather shy at sight of inspector a passed hewitt stopped for moment said im afraid youve lost jewel mr hoker come to office to morrow ill tell about iii meaning of thing be so very plain hewitt said to afterwards that duffer who have flitterbat lancer in hand for so long never saw at if shiels have made ordinary clumsy cryptogram letter figure must have seen what be at once at least must have tried to read because be put in form of music tried everything else right way be clever dodge of shielss without doubt very few people police officer not turning over heap of old music must notice feel suspicious of little slip among rest once one see be cryptogram absence of bar line of note beyond stave must suggest that reading be a easy a possible for part tried a cryptogram at once know plan have be described hundred time see here look at copy of flitterbat lancer only difficulty be small one be that word be not divided since there be on stave position for le than dozen note there be twenty six letter to be indicated follows that crotchet quaver semiquaver on same line space must mean different letter first step be obvious count note to ascertain sign occurs most frequently find that crotchet in top space be sign required occurs le than eleven time now letter most frequently occurring in ordinary sentence of english be e let then suppose that represents e at once coincidence strike in ordinary musical notation in treble clef note occupying top space must be e let remember presently now most common word in english language be know sign for e last letter of word so let see if in more than one place sign be preceded by two others identical in case if so probability be that other two sign will represent t h whole word will be now happens in le than four place sign e be preceded by same two other sign once in first line twice in second once in fourth word of three letter ending in e must be in least likely to occur four time in short sentence except then will call note sign preceding e be quaver under bottom line for t crotchet on first space for h travel along stave wherever sign occur mark with t h a case may be now remember that e crotchet in top space be in right place a musical note while crotchet in bottom space mean h be musical note at considering for minute remember that among note be expressed in ordinary music on treble stave without use of ledger line d e f be repeated at lower at upper part of stave therefore anybody making cryptogram of musical note must probably use one set of duplicate position to indicate other letter a h be in lower part of stave be where variation come in let experiment by assuming that crotchet above f in ordinary musical notation have usual value let set letter over respective note now thing begin to shape look toward end of second line there be word letter f f t h with note between two f now that word can only possibly be fifth so that now have sign for be crotchet on bottom line let go through mark be now observe first sign of lot be there be one other sign before word only word possible here beginning with of two letter be if be in now have sign for t f so know that isnt if be must be unlikely here because there be tendency a see to regularity in sign t next letter alphabetically to s be at bottom of stave let try n at once get word dance at beginning of line three now have got enough to see system of thing make stave put g b c higher d e f in proper musical place then fill in blank place with next letter of alphabet downward h j find that h fall in place have already discovered for a crotchet now take quaver go on with k l m n o so on a before beginning on space when have filled quaver do same with semiquaver there be only six alphabetical letter left for u v w x y z now will find that exactly agrees with have ascertained already if will use other

have taken rapid glance about room be now examining stove register with close attention shut trap above pushed to room door then very carefully by aid of feather end of quill pen lay on table shifted charred remains of piece two of paper from top of cold cinder into fire shovel carried to sideboard nearer light from window examined minutely making few note in pocket book then removing glass shade from ornament on mantel piece placed over there something may be of use to police remarked may not a case may be at rate there be safe from draught if want there nothing distinguishable on one piece

eight hour must say bed not slept in see couldnt have done thats certain knife hewitt added be gone hidden here be inspector inspector be stranger to hewitt looked at inquiringly till surgeon introduced mentioned profession then said with air of one unwillingly relaxing rule of conduct right doctor if he friend of yours little practice for eh mr hewitt yes hewitt answered modestly havent have advantage of experience in police force perhaps may learn perhaps also may help did not seem to strike inspector a very luminous probability stepped to landing ordered up constable to make full report have brought man with who took charge of door by time thinly populated a be neighbourhood boy have begun to collect outside policeman story be simple a passed on beat have be called by three woman who have light ladder planted against window sill of room feared something be wrong with occupant of room said a must not make hear door be locked therefore have brought ladder to look in at window now feared to go look must policeman do so mounted ladder looked in at window saw what be still visible have then at woman urgent request entered house broken in door found body to be dead cold

earlier than usual without breakfast be that mr beckle knew only other person in house be servant miss walker school teacher knew nothing miss walker be very anxious to be allowed to go to school of course have not allowed till inspector must arrive illustration mounted ladder looked in at window thats right inspector said youre sure door be locked yes sir fast key in lock sir havent seen key window shut just a be now yes sir nothing be touched inspector walked to window opened be wooden framed casement window fastened by usual turning catch at side with heavy bow handle just glanced out then swung window carelessly to on hinge catch however worked so freely that handle dropped catch banged against window frame a turned away hewitt saw closed casement properly after glance at sill inspector made rapid examination of clothing on body then said singular thing about key door be locked fast there key to be seen inside room seems must have be locked from outside perhaps hewitt suggested other key on landing fit lock commonly case in sort of house thats so inspector admitted with air of encouraging pupil well see walked across landing to nearest door have small round brass scutcheon apparently recently placed there yale lock said inspector thats good went to third door stood ajar seems to be mr foster room inspector remarked here key inside took across landing tried fitted captain pullins lock exactly easily hullo said inspector look at hewitt nodded thoughtfully just then became aware of somebody behind who have arrived noiselessly turned saw mincing little woman with pursed mouth lofty expression who took notice of addressed inspector will be glad to know if please said when may leave house attend to duty school have already be open for three quarter of hour can not conceive why be detained in manner very sorry maam inspector replied matter of duty of course perhaps will be able to let go presently meanwhile perhaps can help youre not obliged to say anything of course if do will make note of didnt hear uncommon noise in night did nothing at retired at ten be asleep soon after know nothing of whole horrible affair will leave house entirely a soon a can arrange did have opportunity of observing mr pullins manner habit hewitt asked indeed saw nothing of must hear very often language be not of sort must tolerate seemed to dominate whole house with boorish behaviour be frequently intoxicated have already told mr beckle that if stay be to continue mine must cease avoided indeed altogether know nothing of do know how came here did know mr beckle anybody else in house before also cant say mr beckle believe knew about in fact have sometimes thought there be mysterious connection between though what can not say certainly can not understand landlady keeping so troublesome lodger have seen little more of mr foster of course well yes have be here so much longer be more endurable than be captain pullin certainly though be not always sober two did not love one believe there inspector pricked ear didnt love one say maam why be that oh dont really know fancy mr foster wanted to borrow money something used to say captain pullin have plenty of money have once sunk ship purposely dont know whether not be serious of course hewitt looked at keenly have ever heard called captain pullin of egret asked never heard name of vessel there just one thing miss walker inspector said that im afraid must insist on before go only matter of form of course must ask to let look round room shant disturb miss walker tossed head very well then said turning toward door with yale lock producing key there be flung door open inspector stepped within took perfunctory glance round will do thank said be sorry to have kept think may go now miss walker wont be leaving here to day altogether suppose im afraid cant good morning a disappeared by foot of stair inspector remarked in jocular undertone neednt bother about isnt strong enough to cut hen throat just then miss walker appeared again attempted to take umbrella from stand heavy tall oaken one rib however have become jammed between stand wall so miss walker with one hand calmly lifted stand disengaged umbrella with other eye observed inspector shes bit stronger than look surgeon came upon landing will send to mortuary now said ive seen want to see here have seen landlady think shes downstairs went downstairs found mr beckle in back room much agitated though be not sort of woman one must expect to find greatly upset by anything be thin hard rigid with rigidity sharpness that woman acquire who have long lonely struggle with poverty have at first very little to say captain pullin have lodged with before last night have be in evening have gone to bed about past eleven quarter of hour later everybody else have done so house be fastened up for night front door be fully bolted barred be found so in morning stranger have be in house for day only person who have left before discovery be mr foster went away when only servant be up be unusual a usually took breakfast in house what have frightened girl so much thought be fact that after door have be burst open peeped into room out of curiosity be so horrified at sight that ran out of house have always be hard working girl though of sullen habit inspector made more particular inquiry a to mr foster after little reluctance mr beckle gave opinion that be very short of money indeed have lost ship sometime back through neglect of duty be not of altogether sober habit have consequently be unable to get berth a yet be fact admitted that owed considerable sum for rent have enough clothes nautical implement in box to cover more hewitt have be watching mr beckles face very closely now suddenly asked with pointed emphasis how long have known mr pullin mr beckle faltered returned hewitts steadfast gaze with quick glance of suspicion oh said have known on off for long time connection by marriage of course hewitts hard gaze be still upon mr beckle looked from to inspector back again corner of mouth twitched then sat down rested head on hand well suppose must say though ive kept to myself till now said resignedly he brother in law of course a have be told be not obliged to say anything now more information can give better chance there may be of detecting brother in law murderer well dont mind im sure be bad day when married sister killed not at once so that might have be hung for by course of regular brutality starvation hated man said with quick access of passion however suppressed at once yet let stay in house oh dont know be afraid of used to come just when pleased practically take possession of house couldnt keep away drove away other lodger suddenly fired up again wasnt enough to make anybody desperate can wonder at anything quieted again by quick effort hewitt inspector exchanged glance let see be captain of sailing ship egret wasnt hewitt asked lost in pacific year more ago yes if remember story of loss aright one native hand kanaka boy be only survivor yes be only two be only one came back to england just so there be rumour believe that after wasnt altogether loser by wreck mind only say there be rumour there may have be nothing in yes mr beckle replied know about said ship have be cast away purposely for sake of insurance there be truth in else why did underwriter pay besides from what know privately couldnt have be abel pullin be reckless scoundrel enough know must have taken good care to be paid well for villainy of sort yes of course be suggested that be nothing of sort came here a usual a soon a got home until got ship hadnt penny have to keep so know be sober almost time from want of money do mean to say if common talk be true that must have remained like without getting money of owner accomplice at least making give ship not know too well yes doubt be just now back from next voyage after take yes in iolanthe brig smaller ship than have be used to belonging to different owner have much money time no have bought gold watch chain abroad have ring few pound in money instrument be think in addition to clothes well theyve be stolen now inspector said have missed anything other lodger so far a know neither of very well mr beckle well have word two with servant now then ill get to come over house with sarah taffs be servant name seemed to have got over agitation be now sullen uncommunicative must say nothing said neednt say nothin if didnt want to wont be must say repeated again again once however in reply to question a to foster flashed out angrily if mr foster youre after wont find im e gentleman e be aint goin to tell nothin be then mr beckle showed inspector surgeon hewitt over house everything be in perfect order on ground floor on stair stair appeared have be swept before discovery be made nevertheless hewitt inspector scrutinised narrowly top floor consisted of two small room only used a bedroom by mr beckle sarah taffs respectively nothing be missing everything be in order there one floor between contained dead man room miss walker foster miss walker room have already seen now turned into foster place seemed to betray careless habit on part of tenant be everywhere in slovenly confusion bedclothes be flung anyhow on floor chair be overturned hewitt looked round room remarked that there seemed to be clothes hanging about a might have be expected mr beckle replied have taken to keeping in box lately how many box have asked inspector only two be inspector stooped tried lid locked said think well take liberty of peep into box produced bunch of key tried none fitted then hewitt felt about inside lock very carefully with match then taking button hook from pocket after little careful humouring work turned lock one after lifted lid mr beckle uttered exclamation of dismay inspector looked at rather quizzically box contained nothing brick illustration box contained nothing brick ah said inspector ive seen that sort of suit o clothes before people have em who dont pay hotel bill such like youre very good pick lock by way mr hewitt never saw anything quicker neater know have lot of clothes mr beckle protested ive seen very likely very likely indeed inspector answered theyre gone now mr foster gone with em girl didnt say have bundle with when went out didnt didnt say hadnt did wont say anything about say wont plump even supposing hadnt got with morning that signifies nothing clothes be gone anybody intending job of sort inspector jerked thumb significantly towards skipper room must get thing away quietly first so a to have difficulty about getting away afterwards thing pretty plain now think im afraid mr foster pretty bad lot anyway shouldnt like to be in shoe hewitt assented evidence of sort isnt easy to get over come mr beckle inspector said do mind coming into front room with body covered over with rug landlady disliked going be plain to see presently pulled together followed men peeped once distrustfully round door to where body lay then resolutely turned back on watch chain be gone else have in pocket inspector said think said have ring yes one thick gold one then thats gone too everythings turned upside down probably other thing be stolen too do miss yes mr beckle replied looking round avoiding with eye rug covered heap near fireplace there be sextant on mantel piece be kept one two other instrument in drawer pointing to one have be turned out seem to be gone now there be small ship carved in ivory worth money believe thats gone dont know about clothes of may be stolen may not stepped to bed turned back coverlet oh added sheet be gone from bed too usual thing inspector remarked wrap up swag in sheet know make convenient bundle nothing else missing landlady took one more look round said doubtfully dont think so oh yes suddenly added uncle hook oh remarked inspector with dismal jocularity he took uncle hook a well a own have what be uncle hook like wasnt of much value mr beckle explained kept a memorial great uncle who died many year ago be sea captain too have lost left hand by accident wore hook in place hook made for on board vessel be iron hook screwed into wooden stock have taken off in last illness gave to to mind against recovery never got well so ive kept over since used to hang on nail at side of chimney breast wound about body might have be made with hook like doctor be there inspector asked wound at one well well inspector said moving toward door weve got to find foster now thats plain ill see about youve sent to mortuary say doctor right youve particular reason for sending girl out of door to day suppose mr beckle can keep in of course landlady answered will be inconvenient though ah then keep in will mustnt lose sight of ill leave couple of men here of course ill tell mustnt be allowed out hewitt surgeon went downstairs parted at door will be over again to morrow morning hewitt said about other matter be speaking of will find in well doctor answered at rate will tell where be good morning good morning hewitt answered then stopped im obliged for being allowed to look about upstairs here said im not sure what inspector have in mind by way must think noticed must be pretty plain to though naturally must be cautious about talking of before others a be that being case might seem rather presumptuous in to make suggestion especially a seems fairly confident if have chance presently of giving quiet hint might draw special attention to two thing charred paper took from fireplace missing hook there be good deal in fancy will have hour two to myself expect afternoon ill make small inquiry two on own account in town if anything come of ill let know to morrow when see very well will expect goodbye hewitt did not go straight away from house to railway station took turn two about row of house looked up of path leading from across surrounding marshy field then took path for station about hundred yard along path reached deep muddy ditch with high hedge behind then lay by side of ditch for little distance before crossing hewitt stopped looked thoughtfully at ditch for few moment before proceeding then went briskly on way that evening paper be agog with mysterious murder of ship captain at west ham in next morning paper be announced that henry foster seafaring man lately mate of trading ship have be arrested in connection with crime ii that morning hewitt be at surgeon house early surgeon be in saw at once own immediate business being transacted hewitt learned particular of arrest of foster man actually came back of own accord in afternoon surgeon said certainly be drunk seems very reckless sort of thing even for drunken man one rather curious thing be that asked for pullin a soon a arrived insisted on going to to borrow sovereign of course be taken into custody at once charged seemed to sober very quickly seemed dazed for bit then when realised position be in refused to say word saw at station have certainly be drinking good deal curious thing be that hadnt cent of money on hed soon got rid of anyhow did say anything to inspector a to thing mentioned to yes didnt seem to think great deal of took look at charred paper saw that one piece have evidently be cheque on eastern consolidated bank other couldnt see sort of sign upon a to hook seemed to take that be used to fasten in knot of bundle to carry more easily well hewitt said think told yesterday must make inquiry two yes did ive made inquiry now think can give inspector help what be name by way truscott he very good sort of fellow really very well will find at station probably unless he off duty that dont know about must call at house first think if be be much nearer than station might possibly be there even if isnt there will be constable can tell where to find truscott hewitt accordingly made for house have good fortune to overtake truscott on way there good morning inspector called cheerily ive got information for think oh good morning what be in regard to business hewitt replied indicating by nod row of house hundred yard ahead will be clearer if go over whole thing together take what have found out in proper place youre not altogether satisfied with capture of foster be well mustnt say of course perhaps not weve traced doings yesterday after left house perhaps doesnt help much what do know ill tell first can get hold of such thing a boat hook long pole with hook on end will do dont know there one handy perhaps theyll have garden rake at house if thatll do excellently must think if fairly long will ask garden rake be forthcoming at once with hewitt inspector made way along path led towards railway station stopped where came by ditch ive brought here purely on matter of conjecture hewitt said there may be nothing in if there be will help be very muddy ditch with soft bottom many foot deep probably judging from wet nature of soil hereabout took rake plunged deep into ditch dragging slowly back up side brought up tangle of duckweed rush slimy mud with stick two among do think knife be thrown here asked inspector possibly possibly something else well see hewitt made dive went along thus very thoroughly laboriously dragging part of ditch a went being frequently necessary for to pull together to get rake through tangle of weed rubbish have worked through seven eight yard from angle of path where approached ditch when hewitt stopped with rake at bottom here be something feel little different said ill get a good hold a can then well drag up slowly steadily together gave rake slight twist then two pulled steadily presently sunken object came away suddenly a though mud suction have kept under rose easily to surface be muddy mass have to swill to fro few time in clearer upper water before be seen to be linen bundle drew ashore untied thick knot at top inside be indian shawl also knotted opened also there within wet dirty lay sextant chronometer in case gold watch chain handful of coin thick gold ring ship carved in ivory with much of delicate work broken sealskin waistcoat door key seaman knife iron hook screwed into wooden stock illustration have to swill before be seen to be linen bundle lord exclaimed inspector truscott whats queer place to hide swag of sort why watch instrument must be ruined yes im afraid so hewitt answered see thing be wrapped in sheet just a expected sheet mean something more there be two notice yes of course dont see what point to whole thing most odd foster certainly must have be fool to hide thing here he sailor know better than to put away chronometer sextant in wet ditch unless got frightened put thing there out of sight because murder be discovered say have traced movement after left if have come near here while police be about must have be seen from house youve got wrong prisoner person who put thing there didnt want again then do think robbery wasnt motive after yes be not robbery come well talk over in house let take thing with arrived at house hewitt immediately locked bolted barred front door then very carefully gently unfastened lock bolt bar in order pressing door with hand taking precaution to avoid noise nevertheless noise be considerable there be sad lack of oil everywhere bolt creaked lock in particular made deal of noise when key be half turned bolt shot back with loud thump anybody who have once heard that door fastened unfastened said hewitt must hesitate about opening in dead of night after committing murder must remember noise do mind taking thing up to room room upstairs will go ask mr beckle question truscott went upstairs presently hewitt followed have just asked mr beckle said whether not captain went to front door for purpose on evening before death say stood there for hour so smoking pipe before went to bed will see what mean presently think now will go into thing in light of what have found out illustration stood there for hour so smoking pipe before went to bed yes tell that very well think will make thing plainer if summarise separately conclusion from evidence a whole from beginning perhaps same idea struck im sure youll excuse going over now here be man undoubtedly murdered murderer be gone from room there be two way by must have gone door window if went by window then be somebody who did not live in place since nobody seemed to have be missing when girl came down though mind be necessary to avoid relying on said in view of manner almost acknowledged determination not to incriminate foster seemed at first sight probable that murderer have gone out by door because key be gone entirely if have left by window must probably have left key in lock to hinder anybody who attempted to get in with key to peep then blind be up be found so in morning must probably be pulled down at dark murderer must be unlikely to raise except to go out way then casement be shut fastened just so cant be a easily shut fastened from outside a from in catch be very loose swing by true prevents casement shutting when be just carelessly banged to see here rose went to window anybody from outside who cared to hold catch back with finger till casement be shut a far a frame must then shut window completely catch must simply swing into appointed groove illustration catch must simply swing into appointed groove now see something more looked at sill outside be smooth new house be almost new probably saw in one place sharply marked pit depression look seems to have be drilled with sharp steel point be absolutely new for there be powder of stone about mark wind have since blown powder away now if man have descended from sill by mean of rope with hook at end be just sort of mark must expect to leave behind so at rate balance of probability be that murderer have left by window there be thing confirms will remember that when mr beckle mentioned that sheet be gone from bed concluded that have be taken to carry swag yes so be a have seen here in bundle just so why sheet one must be ample since allude to bundle why sheet a well a indian shawl last by way be thing mr beckle seems not to have missed in confusion perhaps didnt know that pullin possessed why wrapping moreover why hook presumption be clear bundle be already made up in indian shawl required more wrapping two sheet be wanted to tie together to enable criminal to descend from window hook be very thing to hold rope with at top be not necessary to tie to anything must not prevent shutting of window behind moreover when descent have be made mere shake of rope of sheet must dislodge hook bring down thus leaving evidence of escape except mark on sill be very small then again there be noise struggle heard pullin a must see be powerful hard set man not likely to allow throat to be cut without lot of trouble therefore murderer must either have entered room unknown to unlikely thing for have not gone to bed else must have be there with permission must have taken by sudden surprise now come to heart of thing of two paper burnt in grate have kept under shade see one bore trace of writing have be on many ink paper after having be burnt other bore plain sign of having be cheque now just let look at main body of paper have burnt to deep gray ash nearly black printed part of cheque printed in coloured ink be be of much paler gray quite light ash colour be colour to most of pink ink used in printing cheque burn a may easily test for with old cheque of sort be printed from fine plate with water solution pink ink black ink on other hand such a number of cheque be printed in have charred black by sharp eye be quite distinguishable against general dark gray of paper cinder be unfortunately broken rather badly part containing signature be missing altogether one can plainly see in large script letter part of boldest line of print name of bank letter be e r n c o n s o must mean eastern consolidated bank of course saw that for yes of course did fortunately whole of cheque number be unbroken be bk of course took note of a well a of other particular distinguishable be payable to pullin clearly for here be latter half of christian name abel first few letter of pullin then on line where amount be written at length there be letter u s n d p plainly be large cheque for thousand at bottom where amount be placed in figure there be bad break first figure be cheque then be one for at least there be one more thing cinder be perfect unbroken nearly all along top edge there be sign of crossing so that here be open cheque thief might cash with little care be can see be enough think now must thief committing murder for sake of plunder burn cheque must pullin to whom money be to be paid burn think not then who in whole world must have interest in burning not soul with one single exception man who drew yes yes what do mean that man who drew that cheque must have murdered pullin in order to get back destroy be opinion now who must draw pullin cheque for anybody in house be at likely of course not again be pointed to stranger now remember pullins antecedent on last voyage one ship egret from valparaiso for wellington new zealand be cast away on paumotu island far out of proper course there be small crew a happened be lost except pullin one kanaka boy egret be heavily insured there be nasty rumour at lloyd captain pullin have made sure of whereabouts taken care of destroyed ship in collusion with owner that kanaka boy have only escaped because happened to be well acquainted with island there be nothing positive in way of proof underwriter paid with more than covert grumbling a remember mr heckle told yesterday pullin on return have money now suppose story of intentional wreck be true for reason pullins payment be put off till after next voyage must people who sent men to death in pacific hesitate at single murder to save think not after left yesterday made particular inquiry at lloyd through friend of mine underwriter find that sole owner of egret be one herbert roofe trading a herbert roofe co firm be very small one a shipping concern go have have reputation for long time of being very rocky financially indeed be common talk at lloyd that nothing wreck of egret saved roofe from bankruptcy court be supposed now to be hanging on by eyelash a friend express with very little margin to keep going in continual state of touch go between debit credit side a to rumour of wilful casting away of egret friend assured that thing be a certain a anything must be short of legal proof there be something tricky about cargo altogether be black sort of business to complete thing told that banker of herbert roofe co be eastern consolidated phew be getting pretty warm must say mr hewitt wait minute friend aided little further still told whole story in confidence of course agreed to help at suggestion went to manager of eastern consolidated bank whom knew personally represented that among heap of cheque one have got torn missing piece destroyed be true entirely except in regard to heap little fiction trust friend may be forgiven cheque said be on eastern consolidated number be bk must manager mind telling of customer have cheque book from have be taken trace of where cheque have come from have be quite lost must save lot of trouble if bank must let know certainly said manager ill inquire did presently clerk entered room with information cheque bk be from book in possession of messrs herbert roofe co inspector rose excitedly from chair come said must be followed up mustnt waste time there knowing where roofe may have got to by just little more patience hewitt said dont think there will be much difficulty in finding belief safe a soon a friend told what bank manager have said went round to roofes office to ascertain whereabouts prepared with excuse for interview in case must find in be small office rather over shop in leadenhall street when asked for mr roofe clerk informed that be at home confined to room by bad cold have not be at office since tuesday next day one before body be discovered appeared to be disappointed asked if must send message yes must clerk told letter be being sent to be sending business instruction daily to office from chadwell heath saw that address have slipped inadvertently from clerk mouth for be general rule know in city office to keep principal address from casual caller so said more contented with information have got took first opportunity of looking at suburban directory then found name of mr roofes house at chadwell heath be scarby lodge must be off then at once truscott said make careful inquiry a to movement cinder bless soul theyre a precious a diamond now how will keep from damage oh glass shade will do fancy wait moment let review thing thoroughly will run rapidly over what suggest have happened between roofe pullin will stop if see flaw in argument best to make impression clear definite now will suppose that egret have be lost pullin have come home to claim reward of infamy will suppose be go to roofe demand roofe say cant possibly pay just then be very hard up insurance money of egret have only just saved from bankruptcy pullin insists on having money say roofe be impossible because hasnt got cheque for amount must be dishonoured plunder of underwriter have be used to keep thing going roofe say plainly that pullin must wait for money pullin cant reveal conspiracy without implicating roofe know promise to pay in certain time give pullin acknowledgment of debt o u perhaps something of kind with pullin have to be contented having money have to go away on voyage time in ship belonging to somebody else because must look worse than ever if roofe gave berth at once make voyage return asks for money again roofe be a hard up a ever can not pay can not refuse to pay be ruin way know that pullin will stand more delay may do something desperate so roofe doe something desperate tell pullin that must not call at office must anybody see together anywhere for fear of suspicion suggests that roofe must call at pullins lodging late one night bring money pullin be to let in so that nobody may see pullin consent thus assist in concealment of own murder stand at front door smoking pipe remember that mr beckle told so waiting for roofe when roofe come pullin take very quietly up to room without attracting attention roofe on part have prepared thing by feigning bad cold going to bed early going out perhaps through window when household be quiet there be plenty of late train from chadwell heath must bring to stratford well when be safely in pullins room roofe hears front door shut bolted with squeak thump decides that wont be safe to go out way after have committed crime men sit talk pullin drink roofe doesnt will remember bottle on table with only one glass roofe produce writes cheque for pullin hand back o u roofe burn must be lower of two charred piece of paper have there with other cant read then crime take place perhaps pullin drink little too much perhaps doze will never know unless roofe confesses circumstantially at rate roofe get behind us sharp seaman knife have brought for purpose straightway skipper be dead at foot then roofe get back cheque burn after that ransacks whole room fear there may be documentary evidence unguarded letter something of sort being examined may throw light on egret affair there be none then set about escape have whole night before to make thing look like murder for ordinary plunder at same time account for upset room take away dead man valuable tied in shawl see hook just thing want of course sheet be obvious substitute for rope take away door key to make seem likely that somebody inside house have be criminal then simply go away through window a have already explained at there must be train to chadwell heath must land home early enough to enable to regain bedroom unobserved after that wisely maintains pretence of illness for day two guessed that thing carried off must be in ditch for very simple reason looked about house ditch seemed only available hiding place near more be on way to station direction roofe must naturally take must seize very first opportunity of getting rid of burden for possible reason be nuisance to carry must not account for if be asked further carried before getting rid of more distinct clue to direction have taken supposing ever be found a quite expected guess be right behaviour of of people in house might have be suspicious if hadnt have so strong clue in hand leading in direction foster poor fellow have probably pawned clothes one after put brick in box to conceal fact so mr beckle might not turn away owed so much that at last hadnt face to go eat breakfast when have money to pay for went out early met friend got stood drink came back drunk girl taffs very naturally ran from horrible sight in room probably foster have be kind to at time so that when found be suspected refused to give information yes inspector said certainly seems to fit together to smallest bit a put there future before mr hewitt ought to be in force now must go to chadwell heath be coming iii at chadwell heath be found that first class return ticket to stratford have be taken just before train left on last night abel pullin be seen alive that return half have be given up by passenger who arrived by first train soon after six in morning porter who took ticket remembered circumstance because first class ticket be rare at time in morning did not recognise passenger who be muffled up think there enough for arrest without warrant at rate truscott said will be able to walk round pick up little more evidence after be off to scarby lodge cant afford to waste more time be foolish to take first class ticket way that single man out might easily have be recognised be smart enough not to use season ticket though must have done clean scarby lodge be rather pretentious house standing in about three acre of ground path to front door be well shaded be arranged that truscott must wait aside till hewitt have sent in message asking to see mr roofe on matter of urgent business that then must follow servant to room be done a parlourmaid be knocking at bedroom door be astonished to find hewitt police inspector behind truscott at once pushed open door two walked in be large well lighted room at far end man sat in dressing gown near table on stood several medicine bottle be man apparently of about thirty eight well built with sharp feature frowned a truscott hewitt entered betrayed sign of emotion carelessly taking one of small bottle from table at side what do want here said sorry to be so unceremonious mr roofe truscott said advancing up long

instant action if by chance game went against inspector truscott be troubled be nice thing said to have prisoner commit suicide in front of eye itll be unpleasant job for im afraid can testify that hadnt time to get near cant indeed wasnt prisoner at time for hadnt arrested in fact case of mr geldards elopement many people have be surprised at information that in martin hewitts wide busy practice matrimonial case whereon have be engaged have be comparatively few that have have many important case of sort be true among innumerable case of different description make small percentage reason be that so many of person wishing to consult on such concern be actuated by mere unreasoning fanciful jealousy that hewitt must do more in case than urge reconciliation mutual trust common private inquiry office chiefly flourish on class of case proprietor present particular reluctance to taking up in event mean fee for consultation watching recent newspaper report have made plain that among of le scrupulous agent case may be manufactured from beginning to end according to order again hewitt have distaste for sort of work commonly involved in matrimonial trouble with immense amount of business brought to rendering necessary rejection of so many commission be easy for to avoid what went against inclination still a have said matrimonial case there be often of interesting nature taking rise in fanciful unreasoning jealousy when on change of proprietorship accepted appointment on paper now claim have week two holiday pending final turning over of property must not leave town for might have be wanted at moment made absorbing instructive use of leisure a amateur assistant to hewitt sat in office much of time saw more of daily routine of work than have ever done before be present at one two interview that initiated case afterwards developed striking feature one of indeed saw entirely through before resumed more legitimate work be case of mr mr geldard hewitt have stepped out for few minute be sitting alone in private room when became conscious of disturbance in outer office excited female voice be audible making impatient inquiry presently kerrett hewitts clerk came in with message that lady mr geldard be name on visitor slip that have filled up be anxious to see mr hewitt at once failing have decided to see whom kerrett have calmly taken upon to describe a hewitts confidential assistant apologised for explained that thought a lady seemed excited must be a well to let see to begin with if there be objection perhaps must begin to be coherent intelligible by hewitts arrival might occur at moment so lady be shown in be tall bony severe of face began a soon a saw ive come to get to get watch set on husband ive endured sort of thing in silence long enough wont have ill see if there protection to be have for woman treated a be with going out day on business when office be shut up tight time wanted to see mr hewitt suppose youll do for present at rate though ill have sifted to bottom get best advice to be have matter what cost though be only woman with nobody to confide in to speak word for im not going to be crushed like fly a ill soon let know here seized short opportunity to offer mr geldard chair to say that expected mr hewitt in few minute very well ill wait see have to do with watching business doubt youll understand what be want done im sure im justified mean to sift to bottom happens be to be kept in total ignorance of what husband doe day when be supposed to be at business be likely must submit to said didnt think likely at be fact mr geldard appeared to be about least submissive woman ever saw wont thats more nice going on somewhere doubt with office shut up day business going to ruin want to watch want to follow to morrow morning find out doe let know ive followed morning yesterday morning get away somehow from back of office cant watch on two staircase at once so want to come do ill here fortunately hewitts arrival checked mr geldards flow of speech rose introduced told shortly that lady desired watch to be set on husband at office report to be given of daily proceeding hewitt did not appear to accept commission with particular delight sat down to hear visitor story stay here brett said a saw hand stretched towards door weve engagement presently know engagement remembered be merely to lunch hewitt kept with notion of restricting time alarming woman might be disposed to occupy repeated to hewitt in same manner what have already said to then hewitt seizing first opportunity said will please tell mr geldard definitely concisely what evidence even indication have of unbecoming conduct on husband part substantially what case wish to take up case why ive be telling again mr geldard repeated vague catalogue of suffering assuring hewitt that be determined to have best advice assistance that therefore have come to in end hewitt answered put concisely mr geldard take that case be simply mr geldard be in business a think told general agent broker keep office in city have have various disagreement with not uncommon thing unfortunately between married people have entertained certain indefinite suspicion of behaviour yesterday went so far a to go to office soon after must have be there found absent office shut up waited time called again door be still locked caretaker of building assured that mr geldard usually kept office thus shut knocked repeatedly called through keyhole got answer morning even followed husband saw enter office when little later attempted to enter once more found locked apparently tenantless from conclude that must have left room by back way say be determined to find out where go what doe during day for purpose gather wish to watch report whole day proceeding to yes of course a said im afraid state of other engagement just at present will scarcely admit of indeed to speak quite frankly mere watching especially of husband wife be not sort of business care to undertake except a necessary part of definite tangible case apart from will allow to advise not professionally mean merely a man of world why come to third party with vague suspicion family division of sort with sort of covert mistrust suspicion be bad thing at best once carried a far a talk of carrying go beyond peaceable remedy why not deal frankly openly with husband why not ask plainly what have be doing during day be unable to get into office will probably find capable of very simple innocent explanation be to understand then mr geldard said bridling that refuse to help have not refused to help hewitt replied on contrary be trying to help now did husband ever follow other profession than one be now engaged in once be mechanical engineer got very few client didnt pay there now be suggestion must be very unlikely that husband trained mechanician a be may have reverted so far to old profession a to be conceiving new invention in case what more probable than that must lock securely in office to work out idea take notice of visitor knocking in order to admit nobody who might learn something of what be doing doe keep clerk office boy no never have since left mechanical engineering well mr geldard im sorry have more time now must earnestly repeat advice come to understanding with husband in straightforward way a soon a possibly can there be plenty of private inquiry office about where will watch anybody do almost anything without inquiry into client motif with single eye to fee charge fee advise to treat husband with frankness mr geldard did not seem particularly satisfied though hewitts rejection of consultation fee somewhat softened left protesting that hewitt didnt know sort of man have to deal with that one way must have explanation come well get to lunch said hewitt im afraid suggestion a to mr geldards probable occupation in office wasnt very brilliant be pleasantest must think of for moment main thing be to pacify lady one doe good by aggravating misunderstanding of sort can make conjecture said at what trouble really be hewitt raised eyebrow shook head there telling said angry jealous pragmatical woman apparently mr geldard impossible to judge at first sight how much really know how much imago dont suppose shell take advice seems to have worked into state of rancour must burst out violently somewhere lunch be present business come next day spent at friend house little way out of town so that be not till following morning about same time learned from hewitt that mr geldard have called again yes said seems to have taken advice in own way wasnt judicious one when suggested that must speak frankly to husband meant to do in reasonably amicable mood instead of appears to have flown at throat so to speak with bitterness at tongue disposal natural result be row man slanged back woman threatened divorce man threatened to leave country altogether so yesterday mr geldard be here again to get to follow watch have to decline once more got something rather like slanging for pain seemed to think be in league with husband in way in end promised more to get rid of than anything else to take case in hand if ever there be anything really tangible to go upon if husband really did desert know anything like if in fact there be anything more for to consider than spiteful suspicion suppose said have nothing more to tell than have before very little seems to have startled geldard however by chance shot seems that once employed maid whom subsequently dismissed because a tell young woman be great deal too good looking because observed fancied observed sign of secret understanding between maid husband moreover be husband who discovered maid introduced into house furthermore did must to induce mr geldard not to dismiss even hinted that dismissal might cause serious trouble mr geldard say be chiefly since maid have left house that movement have become so mysterious well seems that in heat of yesterday quarrel mr geldard quite at random asked tauntingly how many letter geldard have received from emma trennatt lately emma trennatt be girl name chance shot seemed to hit target geldard so wife tell at rate winced visibly paled little dodged question for rest of quarrel appeared much le at ease made more than one attempt to find out how much wife really knew of correspondence have spoken of a reference to be of course wildest possible fluke got little guidance while better half waxed savage in triumph parted on wild cat term came straight here evidently thought that after geldards reception of allusion to correspondence with emma trennatt seemed to regard a final conclusive confirmation of jealousy must take case in hand at once when found still disinclined gave trifling sample of rhetoric a doubt commonly supplied to mr geldard said in effect that have only come to because meant having best assistance possible that didnt think much of after one man be a bad a so on think be trifle angrier because remained calm civil went away time without least reference to consultation fee one way illustration sign of secret understanding laughed probably said went off to agent wholl watch a long a like to pay quite possibly be quite wrong hewitt took hat made for staircase a opened landing door there be hurried foot on stair below a shut behind mr geldards bonnet load of pink flower hove up before be in state of fierce alarm excitement have oddly enough something of triumph in a of woman who say told so hewitt gave tragic groan under breath here nice state of thing im in for now mr hewitt began abruptly through refusing to do anything for while there be time though be ready to pay well a told young man wouldnt listen to anything seemed to think knew business better than must tell now youve caused state of affair by delay perhaps youll take case in hand now havent told have happened hewitt began whereat lady instantly rejoined with shrill pretence of laugh happened why what do suppose have happened after what have told over over again precious husband gone clean away thats he deserted gone nobody know where thats whats happened said that if did anything of sort youd take case up so now ive come to see if youll keep promise not that likely to be of much use now turned back into hewitts private office mr geldard told story disentangled from irrelevance repetition opinion incidental observation be after quarrel geldard have gone to business a usual have not be seen heard of since after yesterday interview with hewitt mr geldard have called at husband office found shut a before went home again waited never returned home that evening night in morning have gone to office once more finding still shut have told caretaker that husband be missing insisted on bringing own key opening for inspection nobody be there mr geldard be astonished to find folded laid on cupboard shelf entire suit of clothes that husband have worn when left home on morning of previous day also found in waste paper basket fragment of two three envelope addressed to husband brought for hewitts inspection be in handwriting of girl trennatt with mr geldard have discovered small fragment of one of letter mere scrap sufficient to show part of signature emma two three of row of cross running beneath such a be employed to represent kiss thing have brought with hewitt examined slightly then asked can have photograph of husband mr geldard immediately produced not only photograph of husband also one of girl trennatt said belonged to cook hewitt complimented on foresight now said think well go take look at mr geldards office if may of course will follow up now hewitt made sign to interpreted a asking whether must care to accompany assented with nod for case seemed likely to be interesting omit most of mr geldards talk by way be almost ceaseless mostly compounded of useless repetition very tiresome office be on third floor in large building in finsbury pavement caretaker made difficulty in admitting there be two room very large one of at back very small indeed in be small locked door lead on to small staircase sir caretaker said in response to hewitts inquiry staircase lead down to basement aint used much cept by cleaner if went down back staircase hewitt pursued suppose must have difficulty in gaining street not bit sir youd have to go little way round to get into finsbury pavement there passage lead straight from bottom of stair out to moorfields behind yes remarked mr geldard bitterly when caretaker have left room thats way he be leaving office day in disguise too pointed to cupboard where husband clothes lay pretty plain proof that be ashamed of doings whatever be come come hewitt answered deprecatingly well hope there nothing to be ashamed of at rate till there proof of there proof a yet that husband have be disguising great many men who rent office believe keep dress clothes at do for convenience in case of unexpected invitation such other eventuality may find that returned here last night put on evening dress went somewhere dining illness fifty accident may have kept from home mr geldard be not to be softened by such suggestion must see hewitt have chiefly thrown out by way of pacifying lady allaying bitterness a far a must in view of possible reconciliation when thing be cleared up that isnt very likely said if kept dress suit here openly must know of if kept here unknown to what did want for if went out in dress clothes last night who did go with who do suppose after seeing envelope piece of letter well well will see hewitt replied may turn out pocket of clothes certainly there nothing in of importance mr geldard said looked before came to nevertheless hewitt turned out here be cheque book with number of cheque remaining counterfoil filled in be awkward banker london amalgamated will call there presently ivory pocket paper knife sovereign purse empty hewitt placed article on table a named gold pencil case ivory folding rule russia leather card case turned to mr geldard there be pocket book said pocket knife watch there be key did mr geldard usually carry of thing yes mr geldard replied carried four hewitts simple methodical calmness plain disregard of former volubility appeared by to have disciplined mr geldard into businesslike brevity directness of utterance a to watch now can describe oh be only cheap one have gold one stolen at rate told so since then have only carried very common sort of silver one without chain key only know there be bunch of key of fitted drawer bureau at home others suppose fitted lock in office what of pocket knife be very uncommon one be present a matter of fact from engineering friend who have have made specially be large with tortoise shell handle silver plate with initial there be only one ordinary knife blade in other implement be small tool thing of kind there be small pair of silver caliper for instance like hewitt suggested producing used for measuring drawer cabinet in search of secret receptacle yes like there be folding steel compass tiny flat spanner little spirit level number of other small instrument of sort be very well made indeed used to say that must not have be made for five pound indeed hewitt cast eye about two room see sign of book here mr geldard account book mean of course husband must have kept account book take yes naturally must have done never saw of course business man keep book then after pause mr geldard continued theyre gone too never thought of there might have known a much who can trust man safely if own wife cant wont shield he be doing with client money hell have to answer for thank heaven ive enough to live on of own without being dependent on creature like think of disgrace husband nothing better than common thief swindling client making away with book when cant go on longer will be punished oh yes ill see he punished if once find hewitt thought for moment then asked do know of husband client mr geldard answered rather snappishly dont ive told never let know anything of business never anything at very good reason have too thats certain then probably happen to know content of drawer hewitt pursued tapping writing table a spoke oh there nothing of importance in at rate in unlocked one looked at of morning when first came table be of ordinary pedestal pattern with four drawer at side ninth in middle at top of very ordinary quality only locked drawer be third from top on left hand side hewitt pulled out one drawer after in one be tin half full of tobacco in few cigar at bottom of box in third pile of notepaper headed with address of office rather dusty be empty still contained handful of string top middle drawer rather reminded of similar drawer of own at last newspaper office for contained several pipe own be mostly briar whereas be clay there nothing really so satisfactory hewitt said a lifted examined pipe by turn to seasoned smoker a well used clay most such men keep one more of for strictly private use there be nothing noticeable about pipe except that be uncommonly dirty hewitt scrutinised before returning to drawer then turned to mr geldard said a to bank now london amalgamated mr geldard be known there personally oh yes husband gave authority to pay cheque signed by up to certain amount often do for household expense when happens to be away then perhaps will be best for to go alone hewitt responded of course will never a general thing give person information a to account of customer perhaps a be known to hold husband authority to draw cheque may tell something what want to find out be of course whether husband drew from bank remaining balance yesterday large sum must go alone ask for manager tell that have seen nothing of mr geldard since left for business yesterday morning mind be not to appear angry suspicious anything of sort mustnt say be employing to bring back from elopement will shut up channel of information at once hostile inquiry theyll never answer even by smallest hint except after legal injunction can be a distressed a alarmed a please husband have disappeared since yesterday morning youve notion what have become of be tale perfectly true one must like to know whether not have withdrawn balance considerable sum since must indicate whether not absence be intentional premeditated mr geldard understood undertook to make inquiry with discretion bank be not far be arranged that must return to office with result a soon a have left hewitt turned to pedestal table probed keyhole of locked drawer with small stiletto attached to penknife seems to be common sort of lock said must probably open with bent nail whole table be cheap sort of thing perhaps there be easier way drew unlocked drawer above completely out passed hand into opening felt about yes said just a hoped a usually be in pedestal table not of best quality partition between drawer doesnt go more than two third of way back can drop hand into drawer below cant feel anything there seems empty withdrew hand tilted whole table backward so a to cause lay in drawer to slide to back dodge be successful hewitt reinserted hand withdrew with two orderly heap of paper held together by metal clip paper in clip on examination proved to be of identical character with exception of date be in fact rent receipt for office have be given quarterly be put back in place with scarcely glance others hewitt placed on table before ran apart from date in fashion received from mr j cookson s one month rent of stable at dragon yard benton street to here followed date also rent feed care of horse in own stable a agreed w gask receipt be ill written here there ill spelt hewitt put last of receipt in pocket returned others to drawer said mr cookson be client who get mr geldard to hire stable for may not be likely mr geldard call mr cookson when go driving possibly with miss trennatt will see pedestal table put in order again hewitt took poker raked in fireplace be summer behind bar be sort of screen of cartridge paper with frilled edge behind various odds end have be thrown spent match trade circular crumpled up torn paper there be also remains of several cigar only half smoked one almost whole torn paper hewitt examined piece by piece finally sorted out number of piece set to work to arrange on blotting pad formed complete note written in same hand a be envelope already found by mr geldard of girl emma trennatt corresponded also with solitary fragment of letter have accompanied by way of having number of cross below signature ran thus tuesday night dear sam to morrow to carry not late because people be coming for flower what did be good smoke leak worse than ever f think must light new pipe else stop smoking altogether for bit uncle be anxious emma then followed cross filling one line nearly next seventeen in hewitt gazed at fragment thoughtfully be find said most decidedly find look so much like nonsense that must mean something of importance date see be tuesday night must be received here on wednesday yesterday morning so that be immediately after receipt of note geldard left pretty plain cross dont mean kiss note isnt quite of sort usually carry such symbol moreover when lady fill end of sheet of notepaper with kiss doesnt stop le than half way across last line fill to end cross mean something very different must like too to know what smoke mean anyway letter must probably astonish mr geldard if saw well say nothing about for present swept fragment into envelope put away envelope in breast pocket there be nothing more to be found of least value in fireplace careful examination of office in other part revealed nothing have not noticed before so far a must see except geldards boot standing on floor of cupboard wherein clothes lay whole place be singularly bare of what one commonly find in office in way of paper hand book general business material mr geldard be not long away at bank found that manager be absent deputy have be very reluctant to say anything definite without sanction gave mr geldard to understand however that there be balance still remaining to husband credit also that mr geldard have drawn cheque previous morning wednesday for amount rather larger than usual be by way mr geldard hewitt observed with air of recollecting something there be mr cookson believe if remember who knew mr geldard dont happen to know do whether not mr geldard have client acquaintance of name know nobody of name ah doesnt matter suppose isnt necessary for husband to keep horse vehicle of description in business certainly not mr geldard looked surprised at question of course must have known that doe not drive to business suppose go by omnibus a to emma trennatt now

enough turned into large door of building have just left a be impossible that must know followed boldly up stair saw stop before door of geldards office knock passed a stood there handsome young woman enough well back on left cheek in place mr geldard have indicated there be plain to see very large mole pursued way to landing above there stopped in position commanded view of geldards door young woman knocked again waited doesnt look like elopement yesterday morning doe hewitt whispered unless geldards left one wife in lurch young woman below knocked once twice more walked irresolutely across corridor back in end after parting knock started slowly back downstairs brett hewitt exclaimed with suddenness will do favour woman understands geldards secret coming going a be plain from letter must appear to know nothing of where be now since seems to have come here to find perhaps last absence of have nothing to do with others in case will follow woman must be watched want to see to matter in

in care of inspector at crouch end police station know will call there in case may have sent if after five afternoon wire also to office if keep with to crouch end where life will probably meet parted at door of office be at first bound for followed girl southward new turn of affair increased puzzlement already laboured under here be girl trennatt who by evidence appeared to be well acquainted with geldards mysterious proceeding in consequence of whose letter might mean must seem to have absented apparently ignorant of whereabouts even unconscious that have left office have at first begun to speculate on geldards probable secret employment have heard of men keeping good establishment who unknown to even own wife procured wherewithal by begging crossing sweeping in london street have heard also knew in fact from hewitts experience of well to do suburban resident whose actual profession be burglary coining have speculated on possibility of geldards secret being one of kind mind have even reverted to case have related elsewhere in hewitt frustrated dynamite explosion by timely discovery of baker cart number of loaf wondered whether not geldard be member of secret brotherhood of anarchist fenians here must seem be two distinct mystery one of geldards generally unaccountable movement of disappearance mystery complicating other again what did extraordinary note mean with cross odd reference to smoking have dirty clay pipe anything to do with half smoked cigar perhaps whole thing be merely ridiculously trivial after must make nothing of however applied to pursuit of emma trennatt who mounted omnibus at bank on roof of secured seat ii here must leave own proceeding to put in proper place of martin hewitt a subsequently learnt benton street found by directory turned out of city road south of old street so be quite near be there in le than ten minute have discovered dragon yard dragon yard be a small stable yard a one must easily find only right hand side be occupied by stable there be only three of on left be high dead wall bounding great warehouse such building across first second of stable stretched long board with legend w gask corn hay straw dealer underneath shop address in old street third stable stood blank uninscribed three be shut fast nobody be in yard hewitt at once proceeded to examine end stable door be unusually well finished close fitting lock be good one of lever variety very difficult to pick hewitt examined front of building very carefully then after visit to entrance of yard to guard against early interruption returned scrambled by projection fastening to roof be roof in contrast to of other stable be of tile seemed old carried nothing in way of skylight evidently be habit of mr gask helper to do horse van business with gate wide open to admit light roof of third stable be newer better made carried good sized skylight of thick fluted glass hewitt took good look at such few window a happened to be in sight straightaway began with strongest blade of pocket knife to cut away putty from round one pane be rather long job for putty have hardened thoroughly in sun be accomplished at length hewitt with final glance at window in view prised up pane from end lifted out interior of stable be apparently empty stall rack be to be seen place be plainly used a coach van house simply hewitt took one more look about dropped quietly through hole in skylight floor be thickly laid with straw there be few odd piece of harness rope two lantern few sack lying here there at darkest end there be obscure heap covered with straw sacking heap hewitt proceeded to unmask having cleared away few sack left revealed about dozen roll of linoleum one of dragged to light where became evident that have remained thus rolled tied with cord in two place for long period there be crack in surface when cord be loosened linoleum showed disposition to open out to become unrolled others of roll on inspection exhibited same peculiarity moreover roll appeared to consist of more than couple of yard of material at most though be of same pattern roll in fact be of same length thickness shape a others containing somewhere near two yard of linoleum in roll of half dozen thickness leaving open diameter of four inch in centre hewitt looked at in turn then replaced heap a have found after to regain skylight be not difficult by aid of trestle pane be replaced a well a absence of fresh putty permitted five minute later hewitt be in hansom bound for crouch end illustration dozen roll of linoleum dismissed cab at police station within have difficulty in procuring direction to trennatt nurseryman short walk brought to place fairly high wall topped with broken glass bounded nursery garden next road in wall be two gate one wide double one for admission of vehicle other smaller one of open pale for ordinary visitor garden stood sheltered by higher ground behind whereon stood good sized house just visible among tree surrounded hewitt walked along by side of wall soon came to where ground of nursery garden appeared to be divided from of house by most extraordinarily high hedge extending couple of foot above top of wall stepping back better to note hedge hewitt became conscious of two large board directly facing other with scarcely four foot space between one erected on post in ground of house other similarly elevated from of nursery being inscribed in large letter trespasser will be prosecuted hewitt smiled passed on here plainly be neighbour quarrel of long standing for board be by mean new wall continued keeping by hewitt made entire circuit of large house ground arrived once more at part of wall enclosed nursery garden just here near wider gate upper part of cottage be visible standing within wall evidently residence of nurseryman carried conspicuous board with legend h m trennatt nurseryman large house nursery stood entirely apart from other house enclosure must seem that nursery ground have at time be cut off from ground attached to house hewitt stood for moment thoughtfully then walked back to outer gate of house on rise be high iron gate a hewitt perceived be bolted at bottom within garden showed neglected weed choked appearance such a one associate with garden of house have stood long empty little way off policeman walked hewitt accosted spoke of house be wondering if might happen to be to

funny believe sir why quite treat sometimes on dull beat like why whats blowed if dont think theyre beginning again now yes be well beat other way there be sound of angry voice in direction of nursery ground hewitt made toward just where hedge peeped over wall altercation be plain to hear youre old vagabond ill indict for nuisance youre old thief youd like to turn out of house home wouldnt indict away greedy old scoundrel similar endearment punctuated by growl snort came distinctly from over wall accompanied by certain scraping brushing sound a though neighbour be madly attempting to scale hedge personally bang other hewitt hastened round to front of nursery garden quietly tried first wide gate next small one be fastened securely in manner of milkman at gate of house above hewitt slipped hand between open slat of small gate slid night latch held within quarrel ran high a hewitt stepped quietly into garden trod on narrow grass border of bed for quietness sake till presently only line of shrub divided from clamorous nurseryman stooping looking through opening gave back view hewitt observed that brushing scraping noise proceeded not from angry scramblings from forcing through inadequate opening in hedge of piece of machinery nurseryman be most amicably passing to neighbour at same time a assailed with savage abuse received full return in kind appeared to consist of number of coil of metal pipe not unlike sometimes used in heating apparatus be a yet only very little way through something else of bright copper lay on garden bed at foot of hedge intervening plant concealed shape illustration forcing through hedge piece of machinery hewitt turned quickly away made towards greenhouse keeping tall shrub a much a possible between cottage looking sharply about here there about garden be stand pipe carrying tap at upper end placed conveniently for irrigation in particular hewitt scrutinised presently a neared large wooden outhouse close by large gate turned attention to one backed by thick shrub when thick undergrowth of shrub be pushed aside small stone slab black dirty be disclosed hewitt lifted uncovering square hole six eight inch across from

try hewitt however be satisfied saw case plain rose made way back toward small gate be scarce half way there when straining of hedge ceased before reached last insult have be hurled quarrel ceased trennatt approached hewitt immediately turned back to gate looking about inquiringly hemmed aloud a though to attract attention nurseryman promptly burst round corner cry who who that eh what dye want eh why answered hewitt in tone of mild surprise be so uncommon to have customer drop in id have sworn that gate be fastened old man said looking about suspiciously must have be rash have difficulty in opening come cant sell button hole old man led way to greenhouse a went growled again id have sworn shut gate perhaps forgot hewitt suggested have have little excitement with neighbour havent trennatt

deep in thought in end returned to gate of house above nursery with much circumspection opened gate entered ground instead of approaching house turned immediately to left behind tree shrub making for side nearest nursery soon reached long low wooden shed door be only secured by button turning gazed into dark interior now have not noticed that close after woman have entered gate that woman be mr

floor of what have just perceived to be merely tool house after door be shut buttoned behind illustration first apprisal of lady presence be sharp drive in back perhaps youll be more careful in future came mr geldards angry voice from without how go making mischief between husband wife poking nose into people affair such fellow a ought to be well punished hewitt laughed softly mr geldard have evidently changed mind door presented difficulty fairly vigorous push dislodged button entirely walked back to outer gate chuckling quietly in distance heard mr geldard in shrill altercation with deaf old woman good talking old woman be saying cant hear nobody aint allowed in here place so must get out out go now outside gate hewitt met iii own adventure have be simple have secured back seat on roof of omnibus whereon emma trennatt travelled south from bank from must easily observe where alighted when did so followed found to astonishment that destination be other than geldards private house at camberwell a remembered from address on visitor slip mr geldard have handed in at hewitts office couple of day before handed letter to maid who opened door soon after in response to message by same maid entered house presently maid reappeared bonneted hurried off to return in few minute in cab with following behind almost immediately mr geldard emerged in company with emma trennatt hurried girl into one of cab heard repeat loudly twice address of hewitts office once to girl once to cabman now seemed plain to that to follow emma trennatt farther must be waste of time for be off to hewitts office where kerrett must learn message knowing where message must find hewitt sooner than at office judged well to tell mr geldard of fact approached therefore a be entering other cab began to explain when cut short go tell master to attend to own business a soon a plea for not shilling doe get from ought to be ashamed of sowing dissension between man wife for sake of what can make out of so ought bowed with what grace might retired other cab have gone so set forth to find one for at nearest rank must think of nothing better to do than to make for crouch end police station endeavour to find hewitt soon after cab emerged north of city became conscious of cab whose driver fancied recognised kept ahead all along route in fact be mr geldards cab presently dawned upon that must be bound for same place when became quite clear that crouch end be destination of lady instructed driver to disregard police station follow cab in front thus arrived at mr fuller house just behind mr geldard thus waiting at gate met hewitt a emerged hullo brett said condole with mr geldard have changed mind considers pernicious creature anxious to make mischief between husband im very much afraid shant get fee answered told wouldnt compared note hewitt laughed heartily appearance of emma trennatt at geldards office morning be explained said went first with message from geldard to mr geldard at camberwell explaining absence imploring not to talk of make disturbance mr geldard have gone off to town emma trennatt be told that have gone to geldards office there went then first saw found nobody at office after minute two of irresolution returned to camberwell then succeeded in delivering message a saw mr geldard be apparently satisfied with husband explanation im afraid revenue officer wont approve of revenue officer yes case of illicit distilling big case fancy ive wired to somerset house doubt men be on way here now mr geldards up at house so wed better hurry up to police station have few sent from there come along whole thing very clever most uncommonly big thing if know about think do geldard partner have be turning out untaxed spirit by hundred gallon for long time past geldard be practical man engineer probably erected whole apparatus in house on hill spirit be brought down by pipe laid very little way under garden surface carried into one of irrigation stand pipe in nursery ground there quiet little hole behind pipe with couple of stop cock one to shut off water when necessary other to do same with spirit when stopcock be right just turn tap at top of pipe get water whisky a case may be fuller man up at house attends to still with such assistance a deaf old woman can give trennatt down below draw off liquor ready to be carried away two keep up ostentatious appearance of being at unending feud to blind suspicion a yet ungreeted friend geldard guiding spirit of whole thing come disguised a carter with apparent cart load of linoleum carry away manufactured stuff in pleasing language of geldard co smoke a alluded to in note saw mean whisky something have be wrong with apparatus lately have be leaking badly geldard have be at work on patching ineffectually what did be good said charming emma in note a will remember uncle be anxious justifiably so because not only doe leak of spirit mean waste mean smell sharp revenue man might sniff moreover if there be leak liquid run somewhere at random with sudden increase in volume attention might easily be attracted be so bad that f fuller thought geldard must light pipe start still give up smoking distilling for bit there be explanation of note to morrow to carry probably mean that be to call with cart cart in whose society geldard becomes cookson to remove quantity of spirit be not to come late because people be expected on floral business cross think will be found to indicate amount of liquid to be moved that will see anyhow geldard got there yesterday have busy day loading up then set to repairing damage be worse than supposed urgent thing result geldard work into early morning have sleep in place where may be called at moment start again early morning new part have to be ordered be delivered at trennatts to day passed through hedge meantime geldard sends message to wife explaining thing result youve seen at police station telegram have already be received from somerset house be enough for hewitt who have discharged duty a citizen now dropped case left police revenue officer to deal with matter travelled back to town yes said hewitt on way after have fully described day experience seemed pretty plain that geldard left office by back way in disguise there be thing hinted what that disguise be pipe be noticeable be quite unnecessarily dirty partly from dirty finger pipe smoked by man in office must never look like have be smoked out of door by man with dirty hand hand pipe must be in keeping with rest of man appearance be noticeable that have left not only clothes hat boot behind be quite plain though good boot must be quite in keeping with dress that of labourer such man in working clothes moreover partly smoked cigar be probably thrown aside because must appear inconsistent with geldards changed dress content of pocket in clothes left behind too told same tale cheap watch necessary key pocketbook pocket knife be taken article of luxury russia leather card case sovereign purse so on be left then came on receipt for stable rent suggestion perhaps disguise be that of carter then there be coach house plainly if geldard took trouble thus to disguise thus to hide occupation even from wife have very good reason for secrecy now good man must be likely to carry secretly in cart van a regular piece of business must probably be either stolen smuggled when examined piece of linoleum became convinced that be intended merely a receptacle for other sort of article altogether be old have evidently be thus rolled for very long period appeared to have be exposed to weather on outside only moreover be of one size shape forming long hollow cylinder with plenty of interior room now from be plainly unlikely that be intended to hold stolen good stolen good be not apt to be always of one size shape adaptable to cylindrical recess perhaps be smuggled now only good profitable to be smuggled nowadays be tobacco spirit plainly roll of linoleum must be excellent receptacle for tobacco must be packed inside roll end stopped artistically with narrow roll of linoleum spirit must be contained in metal cylinder exactly fitting cavity end filled in same way a for tobacco for tobacco smart man must probably make linoleum roll of different size for sake of more innocent appearance while for spirit must be convenience to have vessel of uniform measure to save trouble in quicker delivery calculation of quantity bearing thing in mind went in search of gentle nurseryman at crouch end general survey of nursery ground house behind inspired with notion that situation arrangement be most admirably adapted for working of large illicit still form of misdemeanour let tell be much more common nowadays than be generally supposed remembered geldards engineering experience heard something of odd manner of mr fuller theory of traffic in untaxed spirit became strengthened why nursery be mere accident of design there be commonly irrigation pipe about nursery extra one might easily be made to carry whisky with in mind visited nursery with result know of stand pipe tested be where expected handy to vehicle entrance must produce simple new river water raw whisky at command of one of two stop cock duty be plain a know be citizen first investigator after find advantage of in frequent intercourse with police other authority a soon a must get away telegraphed to somerset house then grew perplexed on point of conduct be commissioned by mr geldard scarcely seemed loyal thing to put client husband in gaol because of what have learnt in course of work on behalf decided to give nobody else sporting chance if must possibly get at in time at disposal by so that accomplice must get benefit of warning must give plain hint to run then must take chance returned to place began to work round ground examining place a went at very first outhouse put head into be surprised in rear by mr geldard coming in hot haste to stop rescue husband most unmistakably gave sack so now police may catch geldard not a luck may be did catch in next day paper report of great capture of illicit distiller occupied prominent place prisoner be james fuller henry matthew trennatt sarah blatten deaf woman samuel geldard wife rebecca geldard two woman be found on premise in violent altercation when officer arrived few minute after hewitt have left police station on way home be considered by far greatest haul for revenue authority since seizure of famous ship boiler on wagon in east end stuffed full of tobacco after same ship boiler have made about dozen voyage to continent back for repair geldard be found dressed a workman carrying out extensive alteration repair to still light van be found in shed belonging to nursery loaded with seventeen roll of linoleum enclosing cylinder containing two gallon of spirit packed at end with narrow linoleum roll will be remembered that seventeen be number of cross at foot of emma trennatts note illustration prisoner subsequent raid on number of obscure public house in different part of london in consequence of information gathered on occasion of geldard capture resulted in seizure of large quantity of secreted spirit for permit must be shown demonstrated also extent of geldards connection indicated plainly what be done with spirit when have carted away from crouch end of public house in question must have acquired notoriety among neighbour for frequent purchase of linoleum case of late mr rewse of case personally saw nothing beyond first advent in hewitts office of mr horace bowyer who put case in hand then merely saw mr bowyers back a passed downstairs from room noted case in full detail after hewitts return from ireland a seemed to one not entirely without interest if only a exemplar of fatal ease with man may unwittingly dig pit for own foot pit from there be climbing out few moment after have seen stranger disappear into hewitts office kerrett brought to hewitt in inner room visitor slip announcing arrival on urgent business of mr horace bowyer that visitor be in hurry be plain from hasty rattling of closed wicket in outer room where mr bowyer be evidently making impatient attempt to follow announcement in person hewitt showed at door invited mr bowyer to enter did a soon a kerrett have released wicket with much impetuosity be stout florid gentleman with loud voice large stare mr hewitt said must claim immediate attention to business of utmost gravity will please consider commissioned wholly regardless of expense to set aside may have in hand devote to case will put in hand certainly not hewitt replied with slight smile what have in hand be matter have engaged to attend to mere compensation for loss of fee must persuade to leave client in lurch else what must prevent other gentleman coming here to morrow with bigger fee than yours bribing away from be most serious thing mr hewitt matter of life death be indeed quite so hewitt replied there be thousand such matter at moment pending of know nothing there be also two three more of know nothing on be at work so that becomes question of practicability if will tell business can judge whether not may be able to accept commission concurrently with have in hand operation take month of constant attention can be conducted intermittently others still be mere matter of few day many of hour simply will tell then mr bowyer replied in first place will have kindness to read that be cutting from standard column of news from province of two day ago hewitt took cutting read a follows epidemic of small pox in county mayo ireland show few sign of abating spread of disease have be very remarkable considering widely scattered nature of population though there can be doubt that market town be centre of infection that be from that germ of contagion be carried into country by people from part who resort thither on market day in many case disease have assumed particularly malignant form death have be very rapid numerous comparatively few medical men available be sadly overworked owing largely to distance separating different patient among who have succumbed within last few day be mr algernon rewse young english gentleman who have be staying with friend at cottage few mile from cullanin on fishing excursion illustration algernon rewse hewitt placed cutting on table at side yes said inquiringly be to mr algernon rewses death wish to draw attention be mr bowyer answered reason come to be that very much suspect more than suspect indeed that mr algernon rewse have not died by small pox have be murdered murdered cold bloodedly for most sordid motif by friend who have be sharing holiday in what way do suppose to have be murdered that can not say that indeed want to find out among other thing chiefly perhaps murderer who have made off own status in matter queried hewitt be that of be trustee under will by mr rewse must have benefited considerably have lived month two longer that circumstance indeed lie rather near root of matter thing stood thus under will speak of of young rewses uncle very old friend of mine in lifetime money lay in trust till young fellow must attain twenty five year of age younger sister miss mary rewse be also benefited to much smaller extent be to come into property also on attaining age of twenty five on marriage whichever event happened first be further provided that in case of young people died before coming into inheritance share must go to survivor want particularly to remember will observe now in consequence of young algernon rewses death barely two month before twenty fifth birthday whole of very large property personalty free from tie restriction must otherwise have be will in regular course pas on twenty fifth birthday on marriage to miss mary rewse whose own legacy be comparatively trifling will understand importance of when tell that man whom suspect of causing algernon rewses death who have be companion on otherwise lonely holiday be engaged to be married to miss rewse mr bowyer paused at hewitt only raised eyebrow nodded have never particularly liked man mr bowyer went on never seemed to have much to say for like man who hold up head open mouth dont believe in sort of modesty that showed so much of isnt genuine man cant afford to be genuinely meek retiring who have way to make in world be clever enough to know that be poor then hewitt asked oh yes poor enough name by bye be main stanley main be medical man hasnt be practising except a assistant since became qualified reason being understand that couldnt afford to buy good practice be person who will profit by young rewses death at rate who intended to will see about that a for mary poor girl have lost brother for fifty fortune a to circumstance of death now yes yes be coming to young algernon rewse must know have rather run down in health main persuaded that wanted change dont know what be altogether rewse seemed to have be having own little love trouble sort of thing know hed be engaged think very nearly so young lady died so on well a said have run down got into low health spirit doubt change of sort must have done good stanley main always seemed to have great influence over poor boy be about four five year older than rewse somehow persuaded to go away two together to outlandish wilderness of place in west of ireland for salmon fishing seemed to at time rather ridiculous sort of place to go to main have way went there be cottage rather good sort of cottage believe for district friend of main once landowner in district have put up a convenient box for salmon fishing rented not long after got there epidemic of small pox got about in district though believe have have little to do with poor young rewses death appeared to go well until day over week ago when mr rewse received letter from main mr bowyer handed martin hewitt letter written in irregular broken hand a though of person writing under stress of extreme agitation ran thus dear mr rewse will probably have heard through newspaper indeed think algernon have told in letter that very bad epidemic of small pox be abroad in district be deeply grieved to have to tell that algernon have taken disease in rather bad form showed first symptom to day tuesday be now in bed in cottage be fortunate that a medical man happen to be on spot a nearest local doctor be five mile off at cullanin be working travelling night day a be have little medicine chest with can get else be necessary from cullanin so that everything be being done for algernon be possible hope to bring up to scratch in good health soon though of course disease be dangerous one pray dont unnecessarily alarm dont think about coming over here anything of sort can do good will only run risk will take care to let know how thing go on so please dont attempt to come journey be long must be very trying to must have place to stay at nearer than cullanin be quite centre of infection will write again to morrow most sincerely stanley main not only did handwriting of letter show sign of agitation here there word have be repeated sometimes letter have be omitted hewitt placed letter on table by newspaper cutting mr bowyer proceeded letter followed on next day said handing to hewitt a spoke short one a see not written with quite such sign of agitation merely say that rewse be very bad repeat former entreaty that mother will not think of going to hewitt glanced at letter placed with other while mr bowyer continued notwithstanding main persistent anxiety that must stay at home mr rewse who be of course terribly worried about only son have almost made up mind in spite of very delicate health to start for ireland when received third letter announcing algernons death here be be certainly sort of letter one might expect to be written in such circumstance yet there seems to at least certain air of disingenuousness about wording there be a see usual condolence so forth disease be of malignant type say be terribly rapid in action often carrying off patient even before eruption have time to form then be thing wish especially to note there be once more repetition of desire that young man sister will come to ireland funeral must take place immediately say under arrangement made by local authority before must reach spot now doesnt obtrusive anxiety of that connection of young rewses must be near during illness even at funeral strike a rather singular well possibly be though may easily be nothing zeal for health of mr rewse daughter a matter of fact what main say be very plausible must do sort of good in circumstance might easily run into danger to say nothing of fatigue of journey general nervous upset mr rewse be in weak health think said yes shes almost invalid in fact be subject to heart disease tell now a entirely impartial observer doesnt seem to that there be very forced unreal sort of tone in letter perhaps one may notice something of sort fifty thing may cause that case from beginning may have be worse than made out what ensued on receipt of letter mr rewse be prostrated of course daughter communicated with a friend of family be how heard of whole thing for first time saw letter seemed to looking at circumstance of case that somebody at least ought to go over make certain that everything be a must be here be poor young man staying in lonely cottage with only man in world who have reason to desire death profit to gain by have very great inducement indeed moreover be medical man carrying medicine chest with remember a say in letter in situation rewse suddenly dy with nobody about so far a there be anything to show main a medical attendant must be main who must certify register death matter what foul play might have taken place must be safe a long a nobody be on spot to make searching inquiry might easily escape even then in fact when one man be likely to profit much by death of doctor medicine chest be likely to supply too easy mean to end did say anything of suspicion to lady well well hinted perhaps more than hinted know wouldnt hear of got indignant took on a people call worse than ever so have to smooth over since seemed somebody duty to see into matter little more closely there seemed to be nobody to do started off very evening by night mail be in dublin early next morning spent that day getting across ireland nearest station be ten mile from cullanin that a remember be five mile from cottage so that drove over on morning of following day must say main appeared very much taken aback at seeing manner be nervous apprehensive made more suspicious than ever body have be buried of course couple of day more asked few rather searching question about illness so forth answer became positively confused have burned clothes that rewse be wearing at time disease first showed said a well a bedclothes since there be really efficient mean of disinfection at hand story in main be that have gone off to cullanin one morning on foot to see about top joint of fishing rod be to be repaired when returned early in afternoon found algernon rewse sickening of small pox at once put to bed there nursed till died wanted to know of course why other medical man have be called in said that there be only one available be doubtful if must have be got at even day notice so overworked be moreover said man with hurry over strain must never have given patient such efficient attention a who have nothing else to do after while put to plainly that must at rate have be more prudent to have have body at least inspected by independent doctor considering fact that be likely to profit so largely by young rewses death suggested that with exhumation order might not be too late now a matter of justice to effect of convinced man gasped turned blue with terror be full minute must think before must collect sufficiently to attempt to dissuade from doing what have hinted at did so a soon a must by argument must think of entreated in fact almost desperately that decided said that after what have said particularly in view of whole manner bearing must insist by mean in power on having body properly examined went off at once to cullanin to set telegraph going see local authority might be proper when returned in afternoon stanley main have packed bag vanished have not heard seen anything of since stayed in neighbourhood day next left for london in evening by help of solicitor proper representation be made at home office especially in view of main flight prompt order be made for exhumation medical examination preliminary to inquest be expecting to hear that disinterment have be effected to day what want to do of course be chiefly to find main irish constabulary in district be fine big men doubt most excellent in quelling faction fight shutting up shebeen doubt efficiency in anything requiring much more finesse perhaps also may be able to find out something of mean by murder be plain be one be committed be quite possible that main may have adopted mean to give body appearance even to medical man of death from small pox hewitt said be scarcely likely else indeed why did not take care that doctor must see body before burial must have secured be not thing one can deceive doctor over of course in circumstance exhumation be desirable if case be one of small pox dont envy medical man who be to examine at rate business be must imagine not likely to be very long one can take in hand at once will leave to night for ireland by train from euston very good will go over of course if anything come to knowledge in meanwhile of course ill let know hour two after cab stopped at door young lady dressed in black sent in name minute later be shown into hewitts room be miss mary rewse wore heavy veil said uttered in evidently deep distress of mind hewitt did what must to calm waited patiently at length said felt must come to mr hewitt yet now that be here dont know what to say be fact that mr bowyer have commissioned to investigate circumstance of poor brother death to discover whereabouts of mr main yes miss rewse be fact can tell anything will help mr hewitt fear not be such dreadful thing mr bowyer be im afraid be so much prejudiced against mr main that felt ought to do something to say something at least to prevent entering on case with mind made up that have be guilty of such awful thing be really quite incapable of assure pray miss rewse hewitt replied dont allow apprehension to disturb if mr main be a say incapable of such act a perhaps be suspected of may rest assured harm will come to so far a be concerned at rate enter case with perfectly open mind man in profession who accepted prejudice at beginning of case must have very poor result to show indeed a yet have opinion theory prejudice nothing indeed bare outline of fact will derive opinion theory from anything consideration of actual circumstance evidence on spot quite understand relation in mr main stand in regard to family have heard from lately not since letter informing of brother death before then miss rewse hesitated yes said corresponded there be really nothing letter be of personal private sort be yes yes of course hewitt answered with eye fixed keenly on veil miss rewse still kept down of course understand then there be nothing else can tell fear not can only implore to remember that matter what may see hear matter what evidence may be be sure sure sure poor stanley must never do thing miss rewse buried face in hand hewitt kept eye on lady though smiled slightly asked how long have known mr main illustration how long have known mr main for five six year now poor brother knew at school though of course be in different form mr main being elder be always on good term be always like brother little more be said hewitt condoled with miss rewse a well a might presently took departure even a descended stair messenger came with short note from mr bowyer enclosing telegram just received from cullanin telegram ran thus body exhumed death from shot wound trace of small pox nothing yet heard of main have communicated with coroner oreilly ii hewitt mr bowyer travelled towards mayo together mr bowyer restless loquacious on subject of business in hand hewitt rather bored thereby resolutely declined to offer opinion on single detail of case till have examined available evidence occasional remark on matter of general interest scenery so forth struck companion unused to business of sort have occasioned journey a strangely cold blooded indifferent telegram have be sent ordering that disarrangement of content of cottage be to be allowed pending arrival hewitt well knew that nothing more be practicable till site be reached at ballymaine where train be left at last stayed for night left early next morning for cullanin where meeting with dr oreilly at mortuary have be appointed there body lay stripped of shroud calm gray beginning to grow ugly with scarcely noticeable breach in flesh of left breast wound have be thoroughly cleansed closed stopped with carbolic plug before interment dr oreilly said be middle aged grizzled man with face whereon many recent sleepless night have left trace have not thought necessary to do anything in way of dissection bullet be not present have passed clean through body between rib back front piercing heart on way death must have be instantaneous hewitt quickly examined two wound back front a doctor turned body over then asked perhaps dr oreilly have have experience of gunshot wound before doctor smiled grimly think so answered with just enough of brogue in word to hint nationality more be army surgeon for good many year before came to cullanin saw service in ashanti in india come then hewitt said youre expert must have be possible for shot to have be fired from behind oh see bullet entering make wound of quite different character from of bullet leaving have idea of weapon used large revolver must think perhaps of regulation size be must judge bullet to have be conical one of about size fitted to such weapon smaller than from rifle can form idea of from what distance shot be fired dr oreilly shook head clothes have be burned said wound have be washed otherwise one might have looked for powder blackening did know either dead man dr main personally only very slightly may say saw just pistol a might cause that sort of wound in main hand day before gave out that rewse have be attacked by small pox drove past cottage a stood in doorway with in hand have breach opened seemed to be either loading unloading be couldnt say very good doctor may be important now be there single circumstance incident conjecture that can tell of in regard to case that have not already mentioned doctor oreilly thought for moment replied in negative heard of course said of reported new case of small pox main have taken case in hand be indeed relieved to hear for have already more on hand than one man can safely be expected to attend to cottage be fairly isolated there must have be nothing gained by removal to asylum indeed there be practically accommodation so far a can make out nobody seems to have seen young rewse alive dead after main have announced that have small pox seems to have done everything laying out body may be pretty sure that none of stranger about be particularly anxious to have anything to do with undertaker there be only one here be down with small pox now be a much overworked a be be glad enough to send off coffin by market cart leave laying out screwing down to main since have got order main made out death certificate since be trebly qualified everything seemed in order certificate merely attributed death to small pox take with qualifying remark small pox simply hewitt mr bowyer bade dr oreilly good morning car be turned in direction of cottage where algernon rewse have met death at town hall in market place however hewitt stopped car set watch by public clock be more than hour before london time said mustnt be at odds with native about time a spoke dr oreilly came running up breathlessly ive just heard something said three men heard shot in cottage a be passing last tuesday week where be men dont know at moment can be found will set about if possibly can hewitt said will help enormously can send message to be at cottage a soon a can get there to day tell will have sovereign apiece right will good day tuesday week said mr bowyer a drove off be date of main first letter day on by account rewse be taken ill then if be shot killed rewse must have be lying dead in place while main be writing letter reporting sickness to mother cold blooded scoundrel yes hewitt replied think probable in case that tuesday be day that rewse be shot have be safe for main to write mother lying letter about small pox before rewse might have written home in meantime something might have occurred to postpone main plan then there must be impossible explanation required over very bad road jolted on in end arrived where road now become mere path passed tumble down old farmhouse be where woman life who cooked cleaned house for rewse main mr bowyer said there be cottage scarce hundred yard off little to right of track well replied hewitt suppose stop here ask few question like to get evidence of witness a soon a possible simplifies subsequent work

looked at clock at ballyshiel do remember anything about coming home again did not looked furtively at one presently broke into grin ah see how be hewitt said good humouredly thats now think come ten

book on ut a to toime oh thank hewitt laughed take word for mr shanahan mr shanahan pulled forelock again vanished there nothing confusion to be got from mr bowyer remarked testily mere waste of time not waste of time hewitt replied waste of money one thing be made pretty plain be that shot be fired on tuesday mr hurley never noticed report three men be close by there be doubt that heard only single thing agree about at contradict one over everything else agree completely in of course wish must have got exact time cant be helped a be be rather fortunate that disagreed so entirely two of be certainly wrong perhaps three in case have be safe to trust to mere computation of time by three men just beginning to get drunk who have particular reason for remembering if by chance have agreed on time might have be led into wrong track altogether by taking thing a fact gunshot be not such doubtful thing when three independent witness hear gunshot together there can be little doubt that shot have be fired now think youd better sit down perhaps can find something to read im about to make very minute examination of place will probably bore if youve nothing else to do mr bowyer must think of nothing business in hand dont understand window said shaking finger towards a spoke not at why must main want to get in out by window wasnt stranger hewitt began most careful inspection of whole surface of floor ceiling wall furniture of sitting room at fireplace stooped lifted with great care few sheet of charred paper from grate put on window ledge will just bring over little screen asked to keep draught from burnt paper thank look like letter paper thick letter paper since ash be very little broken weather have be fine there have be fire in grate for long time paper have be carefully burned with match candle ah perhaps letter poor young rewse be writing in morning what can tell perhaps nothing perhaps great deal hewitt be examining cinder keenly holding surface sideways to light come said see if can guess rewses address in london mountjoy garden hampstead be that be there can read show mr bowyer hurried across room eager excited can sometimes read word on charred paper hewitt replied a may have noticed have curled crinkled rather too much in burning be plainly notepaper with embossed heading stand out rather clearly have evidently brought notepaper with from home in trunk look can just see ink line crossing out address there little else at beginning of letter there be d then gap then last stroke of m rest of word mother dear mother dearest mother evidently something follows too in same line be unreadable dear mother sister perhaps after there be nothing recognisable first letter look rather like w even be indistinct seems to be longish letter several sheet be stuck together in charring perhaps more than one letter thing be plain mr bowyer said poor lad be writing home perhaps to other place main after crime burned letter because must have stultified own with lying tale about small pox hewitt said nothing resumed general search passed hand rapidly over inch of surface of everything in room then entered bedroom began inspection of same sort there there be two bed one at end of room inch of piece of bed linen passed rapidly under sharp eye after bedroom betook to little bath room then to scullery finally went outside examined board of close fence stood few foot from sitting room window brick paved path lying between when be over returned to mr bowyer here be strange thing said shot passed clean through rewses body striking bone meeting solid resistance be good sized bullet a dr oreilly testifies therefore must have have large charge of powder behind in cartridge after emerging from rewses back must have struck something else in confined place yet on nowhere ceiling floor wall furniture can find mark of bullet bullet bullet main might easily have got rid of yes not mark indeed bullet must scarcely be easy to get at if have struck anything have seen about here must have buried just look round now where must bullet strike in place without leaving mark mr bowyer looked round well no said nowhere unless window be open went out that way then must have hit fence brick paving between there be sign of bullet there hewitt replied push sash a high a please shot couldnt have passed over fence without hitting window first a to bedroom window thats impossible mr shanahan friend must not only have heard shot must have seen didnt then whats meaning of meaning of be simply rewse be shot somewhere else body brought here afterwards article whatever be that bullet struck must have be taken away yes of course just piece of evidence destroyed by main thats step go see diabolical completeness of plan now piece of evidence missing only tell more against body alone condemns past redemption hewitt be gazing about room thoughtfully think well have mr hurley over here said must tell if anything be missing constable will ask hurley to step over here mr hurley came at once be brought into sitting room just look about mr hurley hewitt said in room everywhere else tell if anything be missing that can remember be here on morning of day last saw mr rewse looked thoughtfully up down room sure sor said ti all there a ordnary eye rested on mantelpiece added at once except clock indade except clock clock ut be sure ut stud on same mantelpiece on mornin a ut always did what sort of clock be just plain round wan wid metal case american clock said ut be ut kept nigh a good time a own did keep good time say faith ut did sor mine ran together for week wid nivir minute betune thim thank mr hurley thank will do hewitt exclaimed with something of excitement in voice turned to mr bowyer must find that clock said there pistol nothing have be seen of come help search look for loose board hell have taken away with probably pistol perhaps although isnt likely clock evidence man evidence hewitt darted outside walked hurriedly round cottage looking way that about country adjacent presently returned no said think more likely in house stood for moment thought then made for fireplace flung fender across floor round hearthstone open crack extended see there exclaimed a pointed to took tongs with one leg levered stone up till must seize in finger then dragged out pushed across linoleum covered floor in space beneath lay large revolver common american round nickel plated clock see here cried see here rose placed article on mantelpiece glass before clock face be smashed to atom there be gaping rent in face for few second hewitt regarded a stood then turned to mr bowyer mr bowyer said have done mr stanley main sad injustice poor young rewse committed suicide there be proof undeniable pointed to clock illustration took tongs with one leg levered stone up proof how where nonsense man pooh ridiculous if rewse committed suicide why must main go to trouble tell lie to prove that died of small pox more even than what have run away for ill tell mr bowyer in moment first a to clock remember main set watch by cullanin town hall clock mr hurleys clock agreed exactly that have proved ourselves to day by own watch mr hurleys clock still agrees clock be always kept in time with mr hurleys main returned at two exactly look at time by clock time when bullet crashed into stopped time be three minute to one hewitt took clock unscrewed winder quickly stripped off back exposing work see said bullet be lodged firmly among wheel have be torn into snag strip by impact wheel be ruined altogether central axle carry hand be bent see there hand will move in slightest that bullet struck axle fixed hand immovably at moment of time when algernon rewse died look at mainspring be le than half run out proof that clock be going when shot struck main left rewse alive well at half past nine did not return till two when rewse have be dead more than hour then hang how about lie false certificate bolting let tell whole tale mr bowyer a conjecture to have be poor young rewse be a told in bad state of health thoroughly run down think said said something of engagement death of lady pointed clearly to nervous mental upset very well brood so forth must go away find change of scene occupation intimate friend main brings here holiday have good effect perhaps at first after while get monotonous brooding set in again know whether not happen to know be fact that four fifth of person suffering from melancholia have suicidal tendency may never have be suspected by main who otherwise might not have left so long alone at rate be left alone take opportunity writes note to main long letter to mother awful heartbreaking letter with terrible picture of mental agony wherein be to die perhaps with tincture of religious mania in prophesying merited hell for in hereafter done simply stand up from table at have be writing with back to fireplace shoot there lie till main return hour later main find door shut nobody answer knock go round to sitting room window look through perhaps see body anyway push back catch with knife open window get in then see be completely knocked out of time thing be terrible what will what can do poor rewses mother sister dote on mother be invalid heart disease to let see awful letter must be to kill burn letter also note to then idea strike even without letter news of boy suicide will probably kill poor old lady can be prevented hearing of of death must know thats inevitable a to manner must not be possible to concoct kind lie then opportunity of situation occur to nobody know of be medical man fully qualified empowered to give certificate of death more there be epidemic of small pox in neighbourhood what easier with little management than to call death one by small pox nobody must be anxious to examine too closely corpse of small pox patient decides that will do writes letter to mr rewse announcing that son have disease forbids mr hurley to come near place for fear of infection clean floor be linoleum here see stain be fresh burn clothes clean stop wound at turn medical knowledge be of use put smashed clock pistol out of sight under hearth in word carry out whole thing rather cleverly terrible few day must have passed never strike that have dug frightful pit for own foot be suspicious come across in perhaps rather peremptory manner tell how suspicious conduct have be then sense of terrible position come upon like thunderclap see have deliberately of own motion destroyed evidence of suicide there be evidence in world rewse did not die natural death except body that be going to dig up see now remind of in fact that be one man alive who can profit by rewses death there be shot body there be false death certificate there be lying letter tale to neighbour everything have destroyed everything prof suicide remains point to foul murder to a murderer can wonder at complete breakdown flight what else in world must poor fellow do well well yes yes mr bowyer replied thoughtfully seems very plausible of course still look at probability dear sir look at probability look at possibility there be that clock get over if can be there ever more insurmountable alibi must main possibly be here shooting rewse half way between here cullanin at same time remember mr hurley saw come back at two have be watching for hour must see more than mile up road well yes suppose youre right what must do now bring main back think must advertise to begin with say rewse be proved to have died over hour before came safe evidence be wanted something of sort must set telegraph going police already be looking for doubt meanwhile will look here for clue advertisement be successful in two day indeed main afterwards said that be at time once first terror be over in doubt whether not must be best to go back face thing out trusting to innocence must not venture home for money to bank for fear of police chanced upon advertisement a searched paper for news of case decided explanation of matter be precisely a hewitt have expected only thought till mr bowyer first arrived at cottage have be to smother real fact to spare feeling of mr rewse daughter be not till that gentleman put so plainly before that in least realised danger of position that fear for mr rewse be only too well grounded be proved by event for poor old lady only survived son by month event took place little while ago a may be gathered from fact that miss rewse have now be mr stanley main for nearly three year illustration gun broken clock affair of mr seton child have struck that many of reader may wonder that although have set down in detail number of interesting case wherein hewitt figured with success have scarcely a much a alluded to failure for failure have of fair number more than once have found search met perhaps at beginning perhaps after little while by impenetrable wall of darkness through clue led at other time have lost time on false trail while quarry escaped at others still stupidity inaccuracy of person upon whom have depended for information have set plan to naught reason why none of case have be embodied in present paper be simply that problem with answer puzzle with explanation incident with satisfactory end a rule lends poorly to purpose of popular narrative be often difficult to make understood appreciated degree of skill acumen unless produce clear intelligible result that such result attended hewitts effort in extraordinary degree who have followed narrative so far will need assurance withal impossibility still remain impossibility for hewitt a for dullest creature alive on other occasion may perhaps set out at length case in martin hewitt achieved nothing more than unqualified failure for present will content with case although be completely cleared up in end yet for while baffled hewitt because of of reason have alluded to on ground floor of building wherein hewitt kept office in have chamber be office of messrs streatley raikes old fashioned firm of family solicitor messrs streatley raikess junior clerk appeared in hewitts outer office one morning with query be guvnor in kerrett admitted fact will tell mr raikes sends compliment will be obliged if can step downstairs for few minute client of ours lady shes in great state about losing baby something say mr raikes must bring up only seems too ill to get up stair be purport of message kerrett brought into inner room in three minute hewitt be in streatley raikess office thought only useful thing possible must be to send for mr hewitt mr raikes explained indeed if client have be better acquainted with london doubt must have come to direct be in bad state in inner office name be mr seton husband be recent client of ours quite young rather wealthy people so far a know made fortune early believe in south africa came here to live child only child little toddler of two year thereabout disappeared yesterday in most mysterious way effort to find seem to have failed a yet police have be set going everywhere there be news a yet mr seton seems to have passed dreadful night must think of nothing better to do morning than to come to have maid with look to be breaking down entirely believe shes lying on sofa in private room now will see think might hear what have to say whether take case in hand not something may strike in case will comfort to get opinion told about know clutched at chance eagerly will see if may go in mr raikes knocked at door of inner sanctum waited then knocked again set door ajar there be quiet come in pushing open door lawyer motioned hewitt to follow on sofa facing door sat lady very pale exhibiting plain sign of grief physical weariness heavy veil be thrown back over bonnet maid stood at side holding bottle of salt a saw hewitt made a if to rise stepped quickly forward laid hand on shoulder pray dont disturb mr seton said mr raikes have told something of trouble perhaps when know little more will be able to offer advice remember that will be very important for to maintain strength spirit a much a possible illustration on sofa facing door sat lady very pale exhibiting plain sign of grief be mr martin hewitt know mr raikes here put in of whom be speaking mr seton inclined head with very obvious effort began be child know mr hewitt little boy charley cant find mr raikes have told so when did see child last yesterday morning nurse left sitting on floor in room call small morning room where sometimes allowed to play when nurse be out because nursery be out of hearing except from bedroom be in large morning room a seemed to be very quiet went to look found be not there looked elsewhere of course yes be nowhere in house none of servant have seen at first supposed that nurse have gone back to small morning room taken with have sent on errand when returned found be not case can walk oh yes can walk quite well must scarcely have come out from room without hearing two room morning room small sitting room be on opposite side of same passage do door face other door of small room be farther up passage than other in case be nowhere in house if left room must have got out somehow be there other door yes there be french window with lower panel of wood in room give on to few step leading down into garden be closed bolted on inside found trace whatever of take on whole premise not trace of sort have anybody about place seen did actually see in room have merely nurse word for saw put there left playing with box of toy when went to look for toy be there scattered on floor have gone mr seton sank on arm of maid breast heaved im sure hewitt said youll keep nerve a steady a can mr seton much may depend on if have nothing else to tell now think will come to house at once look at question servant meantime have be done police have be notified everywhere of course mr raikes said handing hewitt printed bill damp from press here be bill containing description of child offering reward be being circulated now hewitt glanced at bill nodded be quite right said so far a can tell at present must see place do feel strong enough to come home now mr seton hewitts business like decision confidence of manner gave lady fresh strength brougham be here said can drive home at once live at cricklewood fine pair of horse stood before brougham though still bore sign of hard work indeed have be kept at best pace that morning way to cricklewood hewitt kept mr seton in conversation never for moment leaving attention disengaged missing child learned be only one family have only be in england for something le than year mr seton have become possessed of real property in south africa have sold in london have determined to settle here little way past shoot up hill coachman swung pair off to left presently entering gate pulled up before large old fashioned house here hewitt immediately began complete examination of premise possible exit from ground found be four in number two wide front gate giving on to carriage drive kitchen stable entrance side gate in fence always locked however inside house from central hall passage to right led to wherein be door of small morning room be very ordinary room fifteen foot square so lighted by glass in french window bottom pane of however have be filled in with wood content of box of toy lay scattered on floor box lay near have toy be moved hewitt asked since child be missed havent allowed anything to be disturbed disappearance seemed so wholly unaccountable that thought police might wish to examine place exactly a be did not seem to think necessary however hewitt knelt examined toy without disturbing be of very good quality represented farmyard with horse cart duck goose cow complete one of cart have have string attached so that might be pulled along floor now hewitt said rising think mr seton that child must not have toddled through passage so into other part of house without hearing well mr seton answered with indecision thought so at first begin to doubt because must have done so suppose went into passage door of large morning room be four five yard further toward passage leading to hall on opposite side floor in passage hewitt observed be rather thickly carpeted see here can walk on at good pace without noise mr seton assented of course said if got past here might have got anywhere about house so into ground there be veranda outside drawing room door in various place of course ground have be completely examined oh yes inch weather have be very dry unfortunately hewitt said must be useless for to look for footprint on hard gravel especially of so small child let come back to room be french window fastened a found yes nothing have be changed french window be a be usual one of two casement joining in centre fastened by bolt top bottom be not habit see hewitt observed to open half of window one side be always fastened other secure by bottom bolt because catch of handle doesnt always act properly found that bolt fastened a see now yes hewitt lifted bolt opened door four five step led parallel with face of wall to sort of path ran whole length of house on side be only separated from quiet public lane by low fence thin hedge almost opposite small light gate stood in fence firmly padlocked see hewitt remarked house be placed close against one side of ground be that side gate always keep locked mr seton replied in affirmative hewitt laid hand on gate in question still said if security be object must recommend hinge little le rural in pattern see here gave gate jerk upward lifting hinge pin from socket opening gate from side padlock acting a hinge hinge added be meant for heavier gate than replaced gate illustration hinge be meant for heavier gate than yes mr seton replied be obliged to that doesnt concern now french window be bolted on inside must like to see servant servant be produced hewitt questioned in turn not one must admit having seen anything of master charles seton after have be left in small morning room rather stupid groom fancied have seen master charles on side lawn then remembered that must have be day before cook uncommonly thin sharp featured woman for one of trade be especially positive that have not seen day must be sure to have remembered if have seen leaving house said because be more particular since be lost last time be news to hewitt lost last time asked why what be mr seton be lost once before oh yes mr seton answered six seven week ago be quite different strayed out at front gate be brought back from police station in evening may be most important hewitt said must certainly have told tell now exactly what happened on first occasion be really quite ordinary sort of accident be left alone got out through open gate of course be very anxious have back same evening need waste time in talking about will be waste of time assure be that happened exactly nurse be about to take for short walk just before lunch on front lawn suddenly remembered whip have be left in nursery insisted on taking with left went back for taking however little time to find when returned be nowhere to be seen one of gate be couple of foot more open have caught on loose stone in swinging to doubt have wandered off way lady found distance away not knowing to whom belonged took that evening to police station a message have be sent to police station have back soon after be left there do know who lady be name be mr clark left name address at police station of course wrote to thank there be mistake in taking down suppose for letter be returned marked not known then never saw lady think will make note of exact description of child then visit police station to lady took six week ago fair curly hair think blue eye age two year three month walk run well speaks fairly plainly dress pale blue llama frock with lace white under linen linen overall pale blue silk sock tan shoe everything good a new except shoe be badly worn at back through habit have of kicking back downward with heel when sitting be rather old shoe only used indoors if remember aright nothing be said of shoe in printed bill be that so believe not have be so worried yes mr seton of course be most creditable in to have kept up so well while have be making inquiry go now take good rest while do what be possible by way where be mr seton yesterday morning when missed boy in city have important business in hand just now to day have gone to city again of course be sadly worried saw that everything possible be done business be very important just so mr seton be not married before presume if may certainly not why do ask beg pardon have habit of asking almost question can think of cant know too much of case know most unlikely piece of information sometimes turn out useful thank for patience will try plan now mr seton have kept up remarkably well during hewitts examination be plainly by mean strong woman maid came again to assistance a hewitt left hewitt made for police station few inspector indeed of metropolitan police force did not know hewitt by sight one here in charge knew well remembered very well occasion six week so before when mr clark brought mr seton child to station be on duty at time turned up book containing entry on subject from appeared that lady gave address sedgby road belsize park suppose didnt happen to know lady hewitt asked by sight otherwise didnt im not sure must swear to again inspector answered wore heavy veil didnt see much of face one rum thing noticed though seemed rather taken with baby a stooped down to kiss before went away must see old scar on throat be just sort of scar ive seen on man thats have throat cut got over wore high collar to hide stooping shifted collar so saw did seem educated woman oh yes perfect lady spoke very nice told baby have be inquired after by mr seton from description id doubt be one so be at what time be pm exactly here be entered properly now a to sedgby road belsize park do happen to know oh yes very well very quiet respectable road indeed only know through walking through see suburban directory on shelf behind do mind pulling down thanks let find sedgby road here be see there be no highest number be more there be inspector answered running finger down column there clark in road thats more false address thats plain so theyve lost again have have notice yesterday of course ive just got bill last seems queer sort of affair dont child sitting inside house disappeared like ghost door window fastened inside hewitt agreed that affair have very uncommon feature presently left station sought cab way back to office considered matter deeply a matter of fact be at loss certain evidence have seen in house went very little way beyond there be merely clue there be feature of child first estrayal also that attracted though might very easily be case that nothing connected two event there be unknown woman apparently lady who have once have throat cut bringing child back after several hour giving false name address for since address be false same be probably case with name why be time child be still absent nothing whatever be there to suggest in what direction might be followed be there anything to indicate why must be detained anywhere if detained be hewitt determined while awaiting result that bill might bring to cause certain inquiry to be made into antecedent of seton moreover other work be waiting seton business must be put aside for few hour at least hewitt sat late in office that evening at about nine oclock mr seton returned poor woman seemed on verge of serious illness have received two anonymous letter brought with with scarcely word placed before hewitts eye first opened read a follows writer observes that be offering reward for recovery of child there be necessity for charley be quite safe happy in good hand pray instruct detective take such step just yet child be well will be returned to swear solemnly errand be one of mercy pray have patience hewitt turned letter envelope in hand good paper of same sort a envelope remarked only half sheet freshly torn off probably because other side bore address heading therefore most likely from respectable sort of house writing be woman good though writer be agitated when did posted afternoon at willesden see mr seton said anxiously know name call charley yes hewitt answered there may be something in there may not name charles seton be on bill isnt have be visible publicly day to day so that name may be more easily explained than other part of letter for instance writer say that child errand be one of mercy little fellow may be very intelligent doubt be child of two year old a rule practise errand of mercy indeed errand of sort can think of anything mr seton in connection with family history indeed anything else may throw light on phrase looked keenly at a asked expression be one of blank doubt merely a shook head slowly answered in negative hewitt turned to other letter read madam if want child have better make arrangement with fancy have strayed a matter of fact have be stolen little know by whom will never get back except through may rest assured of be prepared to pay one hundred pound if hand to question asked present reward be paltry may finally bid good bye to child if will not accept term if do say a much in advertisement to standard addressed to veritas man handwriting hewitt commented fairly well formed shaky writer be not in first rate health line totters away in downward slope at end shouldnt be surprised to hear that gentleman drank postmark hampstead posted afternoon also striking thing be paper envelope be of exactly same kind size a of other letter paper also be half sheet torn off on same side a other confirmation of suspicion that object be to get rid of printed address will be surprised if be not written in same house that look like traitor in enemy camp question be be traitor hewitt regarded letter intently for few second then proceeded plainly said if letter be written by people who know anything about matter one writer be lying woman promise that child will be returned without reward search talk generally a if taking away of child estrayal whatever be be very virtuous sort of proceeding man say plainly that child have be stolen with attempt to gloss matter asserts nothing will get child back heavy blackmail very different story on other hand can there be concerted design in two letter be intended from own side to play up to certain result hewitt paused thought then asked suddenly do recognise anything familiar in handwriting stationery of letter nothing very well hewitt said will come to closer quarter with blackmailer think neednt commit to paying anything of course mr hewitt will gladly pay do anything hundred pound be nothing will pay gladly if can only get child well well will see man may not be able to do what offer after that will test be too late now for advertisement in to morrow morning standard there be evening standard may even mean next morning will have advertisement inserted in inviting man to make appointment prove genuineness of offer will fetch if want money can do anything for have nothing else to tell nothing have ascertained nothing dont say ive to pas night in such dreadful suspense im afraid mr seton must ask to be patient little longer have ascertained something have not carried far a yet remember that if there be anything at in anonymous letter think there be child be at rate safe to be found one way agree in said mainly to comfort client for in fact have learned very little news from city a to mr seton early history have be meagre be known a successful speculator be almost there be indefinite notion that have be married once before nothing more next day hewitt did nothing in case affair previous engagement kept hard at work in office day indeed have not be case must have done little city inquiry be still in progress awaited moreover reply to advertisement at about half past seven in evening telegram arrived child returned come at once seton in five minute hewitt be making north west in hansom in hour be ringing bell at seton house within mr seton be still semi hysterical clasping child intelligent looking little fellow in arm refusing to release hold of for moment mr seton stood before fire in same room be smart looking scrupulously dressed man of thirty five thereabouts began explaining telegram a soon a have wished hewitt good evening child back said of course thats great thing im not satisfied mr hewitt want to know why be taken away want to punish somebody really very extraordinary poor wife have be driving about day called on by bye be out hewitt credited to kerrett who have be told must not be disturbed have be over place uselessly unable to rest of course well have be at home since half past four at about six be smoking in small morning room often use a smoking room looking out at french window came away from there hour more later a be getting dusk remembered have left french window open sent servant to shut went straight to room there on floor where be seen last found child playing with toy a though nothing have happened how be dressed a be now yes just a be when missed hewitt stepped up to child a sat on mother lap rubbed cheek speaking pleasantly to little fellow looked up smiled observed one thing be noticeable linen overall be almost clean little boy like dont keep one white overall clean for three day do see shoe arent new have be old think said tan coloured shoe now on child foot be of white leather with noticeable sewn ornamentation in silk mother have not noticed before a looked lifted little foot higher said look mummy more new shoe ask suggested hewitt hurriedly who gave to father asked little fellow looked puzzled after pause said mummy mother answered didnt thought moment then said not vi mummy course not for little while after that only answer procurable from be course not seemed to be favourite phrase of have asked where have be yes mother answered only say ta ta ask again did time after little reflection pointed chubby arm toward door said be dere who took asked mr seton again charley seemed puzzled then looking doubtfully at mother said mummy not mummy answered reply be course not after attempted to climb on shoulder then at hewitts suggestion be asked whom went to see time reply be prompt poor daddy said what daddy not vi daddy course not be must be got from will probably say thing in next day two may be useful hewitt said if listen pretty sharply now must like to go to small morning room in time room in question door be still open outside moon have risen made evening almost a clear a day hewitt examined step path at foot be dry hard showed footmark then a eye rested on small gate see here exclaimed suddenly somebody have be in lifting gate a showed mr seton when be last here gate have be replaced in hurry only top hinge have dropped in place bottom one be disjointed lifted gate once more set back ground just along foot be softer than in part surrounding here hewitt perceived print of heel be heel mark of woman boot small sharp of usual curved d shape nowhere else within without be there slightest mark hewitt went distance way in outer lane without discovering anything more think will borrow new shoe hewitt said on return think must be disposed to investigate further in case for own satisfaction thing interest by way mr seton tell must shoe be more likely to have be bought at regular shoemaker at baby linen shop certainly must say at baby linen shop mr seton answered be of excellent quality for baby shoe of fancy description one must never go to ordinary shoemaker so much better because baby linen shop be fewer than shoemaker may take then perhaps before go have better make quite certain that there be nothing else about child be not own there be nothing with shoe in pocket hewitt regained cab travelled back to office case from very bareness simplicity puzzled why be child taken plainly not to keep for have be returned almost a went plainly also not for sake of reward blackmail for here be child safely back before anonymous blackmailer have have chance of earning money more advertised reward have not be claimed also must not be matter of malice revenge for child be quite unharmed indeed seemed to have be quite happy conceivable family complication previous to marriage of mr mr seton must induce anybody to take away return child be undoubtedly mr seton then who must be poor daddy mummy not vi daddy not vi mummy that child have be with seton knew nothing of be difficult to see what must mean arrived at office hewitt took map setting leg of pair of compass on site of seton house described circle including in radius willesden hampstead then with suburban directory to help began searching out noting baby linen shop in area after there be not many about dozen done hewitt went home in morning began hunt design be to call at of shop until have found in pair of shoe of particular pattern have be sold on day of little charley seton disappearance first two shop tried did not keep shoe of pattern have never have young lady behind counter seemed vastly amused at hewitts inquiry nothing perturbed tried next shop on list in hampstead district there kept such shoe a rule be out of at present hewitt immediately sent card to proprietress requesting few minute interview lady very dignified lady indeed in black silk gray corkscrew curl spectacle came out with hewitts card between finger apologised for troubling stepping out of hearing from counter explained that business be urgent child have be taken away by unauthorised person whom be endeavouring to trace person bought pair of shoe on monday keep such shoe find though be not in stock at present a appear to be of uncommon sort possibly be bought here lady looked at yes said pattern of shoe be made especially for think can buy at other place illustration pattern of shoe be made especially for then may ask to inquire from assistant if be sold on monday to whom certainly then there be consultation behind counter desk examination of carbon papered book in end proprietress came to hewitt followed by young lady of rather pert confident aspect find said that two pair of shoe be sold on monday one pair be afterwards brought back exchanged for others le expensive young lady sold ah then possibly may remember something of person who bought pair be not exchanged yes assistant answered at once addressing to lady be mr butcher servant proprietress frowned slightly oh indeed said mr butcher servant be there have be inquiry about mr butcher before believe though not here mr butcher be woman who take baby to mind be said to make trade of adopting finding people anxious to adopt know nothing of do want to life somewhere not far off can get address believe from greengrocer round corner doe keep more than one servant oh think not doubt greengrocer can say lady seemed to feel affront that must be supposed to know anything of mr butcher hewitt consequently started for greengrocer now be just one of case in dependence on information given by other people put hewitt on wrong scent spent that day in fatiguing pursuit of mr butcher servant with adventure rather amusing in quite irrelevant to seton case in end when have captured proceeded to open cunning battery of inquiry under plea of bet with friend that shoe must not be matched soon found that have be purchaser who after buying just pair of shoe have returned exchanged for something cheaper only outcome of visit to baby linen shop be waste of day be indeed just one of check while may hamper progress of narrative for popular reading be nevertheless inseparable from matter of fact experience of hewitts profession with very natural rage in heart with a polite exterior a possible hewitt returned to baby linen shop in evening whole case seemed barren of useful evidence at turn a yet have found helpless at shop self confident young lady calmly admitted that soon after have left something have caused to remember that be other customer who have kept white shoe not mr butcher servant do know other customer asked be quite stranger brought in little boy from cab bought lot of thing for suit of outdoor clothes a well a shoe ah now probably be what want can remember anything of child yes be pretty little fellow about two year old so with curl called charley did put thing on

about child say dont know anything about drunken freak name oliver neale life at morton terrace hampstead with sister name mr isitt youre to take note bring back with at rate money youre to say he truly repentant inspector concluded with grin distance be short hewitt walked morton terrace be short row of pleasant old fashioned villa ivy grown neat be a neat a to servant who answered ring hewitt announced a gentleman with message from mr isitts brother did not seem to prepossess girl in hewitts favour backed to end of hall communicated with somebody on stair before finally showing hewitt into room where be quickly followed by mr isitt be rather tall woman of perhaps thirty eight have probably be attractive though now face bore line of sad grief hewitt noticed that wore very high black collar good morning mr isitt said im afraid errand be not altogether pleasant fact be brother mr neale be not altogether sober last night be now at police station where wrote note mr isitt did not appear surprised took note with more than sigh yes said cant be concealed be not first time by many a probably know if be friend of read note a looked up hewitt said have not known long happened to be at station last night rather attracted attention by insisting in intoxicated state on giving up for kidnapping child charles seton mr isitt started a though shot pale of cheek glanced fearfully in hewitts face there met keen gaze seemed to read brain saw that secret be known for moment struggled lip worked convulsively charles seton charles seton said yes mr isitt be name child a matter of fact be stolen by person who bought shoe for do recognise produced shoe held before woman sank on sofa behind terrified unable to take eye from hewitts come mr isitt said have be recognised here be card be commissioned by parent of child to find who removed think have succeeded took card glanced at dazedly then sank with groaning sob with face on head of sofa a did so hewitt must see scar on side of neck peeping above high collar illustration sank with groaning sob with face on head of sofa oh god woman moaned then have come to will die will die woman anguish be piteous to see hewitt have gained point be willing to spare placed hand on heaving shoulder begged not to distress matter be rather difficult to understand mr isitt said if will compose perhaps can explain can assure that there be desire to be vindictive im afraid manner upset pray reassure may sit down nobody must by manner more easily restore confidence trust than hewitt when pleased mr isitt lifted head gazed at once more with troubled though quieter expression think wrote seton anonymous letter hewitt said producing first of mr seton have brought be kind of to reassure poor woman oh tell mr isitt asked be much upset at missing little boy did make ill be upset of course perhaps joy of recovering compensated for yes took back a soon a possibly must really did mr hewitt oh be so tempted life have be so unhappy if only knew buried face in hand will tell suggested gently see happens explanation of sort be first thing yes yes of course oh be wretched woman paused for little while then went on mr hewitt husband be lunatic paused again there be never man mr hewitt so devoted to wife child a husband bore even with continual annoyance of brother whom saw because be brother little more than year ago a result of accident tumour formed on brain thing be incurable except a remote possibility by most dangerous operation doctor fear to attempt except under most favourable condition without that must die sooner later meantime be insane though with many sometimes long interval of perfect lucidity when disease attacked there be little warning except from pain in head till one dreadful night then rose from bed maniac killed child little girl of six whom be devotedly attached to also cut own throat with razor recovered must rather say nothing more of that be too dreadful though indeed think about little else there be child baby boy about year old when sister died died of scarlet fever scarcely four month ago husband be taken to private asylum at willesden where now be visited frequently took baby be almost terrible to see part of insanity doubt how fondness for child grew when died never dared to tell indeed doctor forbade in state must have died raving asked for sometimes earnestly sometimes angrily till almost feared to visit then began to demand of doctor attendant excitement increased day by day be told to prepare for worst when visited sometimes failed to recognise at others demanded child fiercely must tell that be only just about time that be found that tumour existed idea of operation be suggested of course be impossible in disturbed condition scarcely dared to go to see yet did so long to dr bailey did indeed suggest that possibly might find must be quieted by being shown child felt that to be very unlikely be while thing be in state about six seven week ago that walking toward cricklewood one morning saw little fellow trotting along alone who actually startled startled very much by resemblance to poor little one likeness be one of extraordinary one one only find among young child child be little bigger stronger than ours be when died then be older probably very nearly age size own must have be have lived nobody else be in sight fancied child looked about to cry so went to spoke plainly have strayed must not tell where lived only that name be charley took in arm grew quite friendly a talked to suddenly dr bailey suggestion came in mind if child must deceive poor husband surely be one of course must have to find parent probably through police why not at rate take to willesden in meantime for hour so must not resist temptation took first available cab result of experiment almost frightened poor husband received child with transport of delight kissed laughed wept over like mother rather than father refused to give up for hour child of course must not answer to strange name at first seemed adaptable little thing presently began calling poor husband daddy have not be so happy for month a be a watched have told dr bailey what fear be not strictly true have borrowed child from friend at length felt must go take boy to police with great difficulty managed to get away poor husband cry like child well took little fellow to station judged nearest to where found gave up to care of inspector be little frightened at having kept so long gave false name address still learned from inspector that child have be inquired after by whom illustration daddy husband be quiet for day after then began to ask for boy with more vehemence than ever grew worse worse soon raving be terrible dr bailey urged to bring child again what must do formed desperate idea of going to mr seton telling whole thing imploring to let take child again then must that be likely must allow child to be placed in arm of lunatic one indeed who have already killed child of own felt that thing be impossible still went to house walked about again again scarcely knew why poor husband in confinement screamed for child till dared not go near so be when one morning last monday morning have passed front of seton house turned up lane at side must see over low fence hedge a came to french window with step saw that window be open at one side little charley be standing on top step recognised smiled called just a own child must have done indeed a stood there almost fell into delusion of poor mad husband took gate in hand shaking impatiently in attempting to open from wrong end found hinge lift out must see that nobody else be in room behind french window there be temptation overwhelming temptation be distracted took little fellow hurriedly in arm pulled window to so that bottom bolt fell into floor socket then replaced gate a found ran to where knew there be cab stand oh mr hewitt be so very sinful meant to bring back that same afternoon really did child be in indoor clothes have hat called at baby linen shop bought hat cloak frock new pair of shoe then hurried to willesden again effect be magical husband be happy once more when at last attempted to take child away must not let go be terrible oh cant describe scene dr bailey told that come what might must stay that night in room wife must provide for keep child perhaps must sit up with husband let child sleep on knee in end be latter did by morning sens be blunted scarcely cared what happened determined that a have gone so far must keep child day at least indeed a say whether by influence of husband know not almost felt falling into delusion that child be ours went home for hour at midday taking child then wretched brother saw got whole story from told that reward bill be out about child then dimly realised that mother must be suffering pain wrote note spoke of perhaps have little idea of delaying pursuit dont know at rate wrote posted at willesden a went back husband have be asleep when left now be awake again asking for child once more there be little more to say stayed night next day by time husband have become tranquil rational a have not be for month if only improvement can be sustained think of operating to morrow next day carried charley back in dusk intending to put inside one of gate ring watch safely in from little way off a passed down side lane saw french window open again nobody near have be way before felt bolder there took hat cloak have already changed frock after kissing put hastily through window came away have forgotten new shoe remembered however when got home immediately conceived fear that child parent might trace by mean mentioned fear to brother appeared to frighten borrowed money of yesterday seems got intoxicated in state be always anxious to do noble action though be capable be grieved to say of almost meanness when sober life here at expense indeed borrows money from friend for drink may seem hard thing for sister to say everybody know have wearied have lost shame of suppose in muddled state got notion that must accuse of what have done so shield expect repented of self sacrifice morning though hewitt knew that have said nothing also said nothing of anonymous letter have in pocket wherein mr oliver neale have covertly demanded hundred pound for restoration of charley seton guessed however that gentleman have feared making appointment that advertisement answering letter have suggested to mr mr seton hewitt told whole story omitting at first name address saw plainly said in course of talk that child might easily have be taken from french window did not say so for mr seton be already sufficiently distressed notion that child be kidnapped not simply lost might have made worse just then toy cart with string on in particular have be dragged in direction of window then nothing must be easier than for child to open window there be nothing drop bolt working very easily child must often have seen lifted will remember that catch did not act once child have opened window got outside whole thing be simple gate must be lifted child taken window pulled to so that bolt must fall into place leave a before a to previous occasion thought curious at first that child must stray before lunch yet not be heard of again till evening then apparently not be over fatigued beyond little thing what inferred from letter have very little to help indeed nothing in fact till got shoe didnt carry very far drunken rant of man in police station attracted because spoke not only of taking away child of buying shoe now nobody must know of buying of shoe who did not know something more knew be woman who have taken charley a know from heel mark evidence of shop people so that when bemused fool talked of sister sacrificing for keeping out of trouble so on ranged case up in mind so far a ventured guessed aright police inspector knew nothing of matter of shoe of fact of person be after being woman so thought thing no more than drunken freak now hewitt said before tell woman name dont think poor creature have suffered enough mr seton husband agreed that have that so far a be concerned further step must be taken when be told where to go mr seton went off at once to offer mr isitt forgiveness sympathy mr isitts punishment came in twenty four hour when husband died in surgeon hand case of ward lane tabernacle among few personal friendship martin hewitt have allowed to make there be one for eccentric very excellent old lady named mr mallett must be more than seventy now be of robust active not to say masculine habit relation with hewitt be irregular curious may not see for many week perhaps for month until one day will appear in office push directly past kerrett who know better than to attempt to stop into inner room salute hewitt with shake of hand savage glare of eye must appall stranger be quite amiably meant a for myself be long ere must find resource instant retreat before gaze though be on term of moderate toleration now after first glare sits in chair by window directs glance at hewitts small gas grill kettle in fireplace glance hewitt with expedition translates into tea slightly mollified by tea mr mallett condescends to remark in tone of tragic truculence on passing matter of conventional interest weather influenza own health hewitts health so forth reply of hewitts being commonly received with disregard contempt in hour time so leaf office with stern command to hewitt to attend at house drink tea on day at time named command hewitt obediently fulfils when pass through similarly exhilarating experience in mr malletts back drawing room at little freehold house in fulham altogether mr mallett to stranger be singularly uninviting personality indeed except hewitt who have learnt to appreciate hidden good quality doubt if have friend in world studiously concealed charity be matter of a much amusement a gratification to hewitt who naturally in course of peculiar profession come across many sad example of poverty suffering commonly among decent sort who hide trouble from stranger eye suffer in secret when case be in mind be hewitts practice to inform mr mallett of at one of tea ceremony mr mallett receives story with snort of incredulity scorn take care while expressing most callous disregard contempt of trouble of sufferer to ascertain casually name address twenty four hour after hewitt need only make visit to find difficulty in mysterious way alleviated illustration slightly mollified by tea mr mallett never have child be early left widow appearance for reason commonly lead stranger to believe old maid life in little detached house with square piece of ground attended by housekeeper older than one maid servant lost only sister by death soon after event be about to set down now have believe relation in world be also soon after event present housekeeper first came to in place of older very deaf woman quite useless who have be with before believe be moderately rich one two charity will benefit considerably at death also must be far from astonished to find hewitts own name in will though be more than idle conjecture one possession to cling with soul one pride treasure be great uncle joseph snuff box lid of steadfastly belief to be made of piece of noah original ark discovered on top of mount ararat by intrepid explorer of vague identity about hundred year ago be one weakness woe to unhappy creature who dare hint suggestion possibly wood of ark rotted away to nothing few thousand year before great uncle joseph ever took snuff believe must be bodily assaulted box be brought out for hewitts admiration at tea ceremony at fulham when hewitt handle reverently express a much astonishment interest a if have never seen heard of before be on occasion only that mr malletts customary stiffness relaxes side of box be of cedar of lebanon explains very possibly be gold mounting be worked up from spade guinea one can believe without undue strain on reason be usually time when old lady softens under combined influence of tea uncle joseph snuff box that hewitt seizes to lead up to hint of starving governess distressed clerk with full confidence that more savagely story be received better will poor people be treated a soon a turn back be jealous care of uncle joseph snuff box first brought mr mallett into contact with martin hewitt occasion though not perhaps testing acuteness to extent that did be nevertheless one of most curious fantastic on have ever be engaged be then ten twelve year younger than be now hewitt assures looked exactly same be to say be harsh angular seemed little more than fifty year of age be before time of kerrett youth occupied outer office hewitt sat late one afternoon with door ajar when heard stranger enter outer office voice afterwards knew well a mr malletts ask be mr martin hewitt in yes maam think so if will write name be in there with three stride mr mallett be at inner door stood before hewitt while routed office lad stared helplessly in rear mr hewitt mr mallet said have come to put affair into hand will require to be attended to at once hewitt be surprised bowed politely said with suspicion of hint in tone yes rather supposed be in hurry glanced quickly in hewitts face went on be not accustomed to needle ceremony mr hewitt name be mallett mr mallett here be card have come to consult on matter of great annoyance danger to myself fact be be being watched followed by number of person hewitts gaze be steadfast reflected that possibly curious woman be lunatic delusion of being watched followed by unknown people being perhaps most common of also be unusual thing to have lunatic visit office with just complaint so only said soothingly indeed that must be very annoying yes annoyance be bad enough perhaps answered shortly be chiefly concerned about great uncle joseph snuff box utterance sounded trifle more insane than other so hewitt answered little more soothingly still ah of course very important thing snuff box doubt be mr hewitt be important a think will admit when have seen here be produced from small handbag article that hewitt be destined so often again to see affect interest in may be incredulous mr hewitt be nevertheless fact that lid of snuff box be made of wood of original ark rested on mount ararat handed box to hewitt who murmured indeed very interesting very wonderful really returned to lady immediately that mr hewitt be property of great uncle joseph simpson who once have honour of shaking hand with late majesty king george fourth box be presented to uncle by then mr mallett plunged into whole history adventure of box in formula wherewith hewitt subsequently became so well acquainted need not be here set out in detail when box have be properly honoured mr mallett proceeded with business be convinced mr hewitt said that systematic attempt be being made to rob of snuff box be not nervous weak minded woman perhaps might have sought assistance before watching following of might have disregarded when come to burglary think be time to do something certainly hewitt agreed well have be pestered with demand for box for time past have here of letter have received be sure know at whose instigation be sent placed on table handful of paper of various size hewitt examined one after be mostly in same handwriting be unsigned one be couched in fanatically toned imitation of scriptural diction sort of threat be expressed with many emphatic underlinings spelling be not of best writing be mostly uncouth grammar be in ill shape in many place thou thees accompanying verb falling over other disastrously purport of message be rather vaguely expressed seemed to make demand for restoration of article held in extreme veneration be alluded to in many figurative way a token of life seal of woman so forth sometimes mr mallett be requested to restore to ark of covenant one of least vague of singular document ran thus thou of faith put bond of woman clothed with sun on stoan sete in thy back garden night thy blood beest on own hed give back to five righteous only in citty give that what save faithful when erth be swalloed up hewitt read over fantastic missive one by one till began to suspect that client mad not certainly corresponded with mad quaker then said yes mr mallett be most extraordinary letter be there more of bless man yes there be lot that burnt same crack brained sort of thing be mostly in one handwriting hewitt said though be in confess dont see very direct reference to snuff box oh only thing can mean mr mallett replied with great positiveness why wanted to sell last night house be broken into in absence everything ransacked turned over not thing be taken why because have box with at sister be only sacred relic in possession what saved faithful when world be swallowed up why ark of course old lady manner be odd notwithstanding bizarre disjointed character of complaint hewitt have now have time to observe that have none of unmistakable sign of lunatic eye be steady clear have none of restless habit of mentally deranged even at time hewitt have met with curious adventure enough to teach not to be astonished at new one now set seriously to get at client case in full order completeness come mr mallett said be stranger can never understand case till have not a present to mind in order of importance of event in exact order in happened have great uncle understand living in early part of century who left at death snuff box value so highly now suspect that somebody be attempting to extort steal from tell a clearly simply a can whom suspect whole story of attempt thats just what im coming to old lady answered rather pettishly uncle joseph have old housekeeper who of course knew about snuff box be son reuben penner who be trying to get from old woman be half crazy with one extraordinary religious superstition son seems to be just same great uncle be man of strong common sense churchman though did think must write play if hadnt be for restraint believe that be have be told mr penner must have gone clean demented with religious mania well died in course of time great uncle died time after leaving most important thing in possession allude to snuff box of course good bit of property tin box full of worthless manuscript became widow at twenty six since then have lived very quietly in present house in fulham couple of year ago received visit from reuben penner didnt recognise wasnt wonderful since hadnt seen for thirty year more be well over fifty now large heavy faced man with uncommonly wild eye for greengrocer be what be though dress very well considering be quite respectful at first very awkward in manner took little time to get courage then began questioning about religious feeling well mr hewitt be not sort of person to stand lecture from junior inferior religious opinion may be pretty soon made realise somehow persevered wanted to know if must go to place of worship that called tabernacle asked who be pastor said asked how many member of congregation there be man be a solemn a owl assure mr hewitt actually said five kept countenance asked why such small number couldnt attend church at rate attach to decent dissenting chapel then man burst out mad mad a hatter be a incoherent a such people usually be a far a must make out talked among lot of other thing of imaginary woman woman standing on moon driven into wilderness on wing of eagle man be so madly possessed of fancy that assure for while almost ceased to look ridiculous be so earnest in rant soon cut short best to be severe with people only chance of bringing to sens reuben penner said shut up mother be very decent person in way believe be lunatic with superstitious notion youre bigger fool than be imagine grown man of age coming asking of people in world to leave church make fool in congregation of five with to rave at about woman in moon go away look after greengrocery go to church chapel like sensible man go away dont play fool longer wont hear word illustration reuben penner said shut up when talk like be usually attended to in case penner went away with scarcely word saw nothing of for about month six week then came spoke to a be cutting rose in front garden time talked to begin with at least more sensibly mr mallett said have in keeping very sacred relic have said left by great uncle joseph what then well hummed hawed little wanted to ask if might be disposed to part with said dropping scissors sell well yes answered putting on a bold face a must notion of selling uncle joseph snuff box in possible circumstance almost made speechless what repeated sell sell must be sinful sacrilege face quite brightened when said replied yes of course must think so maam fancied thought otherwise in case maam not being believer im sure must consider graceful pious act to present to little tabernacle where must be properly valued having be mother property got further be not woman to be trifled with mr hewitt believe beat out of garden with basket be so infuriated can scarcely remember what did suggestion must sell uncle joseph snuff box to greengrocer be bad enough request must actually give to tabernacle be infinitely worse to claim that have belonged to mother well dont know how strike mr hewitt to seemed last insult possible illustration be not woman to be trifled with shocking shocking of course hewitt said since seemed to expect reply called unbeliever too what happened after after took care not to bother personally again wretched anonymous demand came in with sort of darkly hinted threat a to sin be committing in keeping own property didnt trouble much put em in fire a fast a came until began to find be being watched followed then kept very sensible hewitt observed very sensible indeed to do tell a to paper have here be nearly in one handwriting a have already said be in now before business did ever see reuben penners handwriting never then be not by mean sure that have written of thing then who else must that of course be thing to be found out at present at rate know that if penner have anything to do with letter be not alone because of second handwriting also must not bind past other conviction that wrote one of by way be assuming that arrived by post yes did envelope be not here have kept of hardly know there may be at home be important may be can see at time please go on thing continued to arrive a have said continued to burn till began to find watched followed then kept be two three month ago be most unpleasant sensation that of feeling that unknown person be dogging footstep from corner to corner observing movement for purpose be doubtful of once twice turned suddenly back never must catch creature of whom be sure penner be one saw people of course well yes in way with corner of eye know be mostly in evening be woman once several time feel certain be penner once saw man come into garden at back in night feel quite sure that be penner be that after have request to put article demanded on stone seat in garden same night sat up watched from bath room window expecting someone must come be dark night tree made darker must plainly see someone come quietly over wall go up to seat must distinguish face be too dark feel sure be penner have penner decided peculiarity of form gait he just big common sort of man tell feel certain be penner for particular reason perhaps not who else must have be im very sure must have be penner hewitt repressed smile went on just so said what happened then went up to seat a said looked at passing hand over top then called out to said if found on premise again by day night id give in charge of police assure got over wall second time good deal quicker than first then went to bed though got shocking cold in head sitting at open bath room window nobody came about place after till last night few day ago only sister be taken ill saw day got worse yesterday be so bad that wouldnt leave sent home for thing stopped in house for night to day got urgent message to come home when went found that entrance have be made by kitchen window whole house have be ransacked not thing be missing be drawer box opened everywhere most seemed to have be opened with key be broken place be turned upside down a said before not thing be missing very old woman very deaf who used to be housekeeper who doe nothing now be in house so be general servant slept in room at top be not disturbed of course old woman be too deaf to have heard anything maid be very heavy sleeper girl be very frightened pacified before came away a happened took snuff box with have got very suspicious of late of course something seemed to suggest have better make sure of so took pretty strong evidence that have be watching closely isnt that must break in very first night left place be quite sure that nothing have be taken quite certain have spent long time in very careful search want presume to find out definitely who people be get such evidence a may ensure being punished be case of course know reuben penner be moving spirit im quite certain of still can see plainly enough that a yet there legal evidence of mind im not afraid of not bit be not character im not afraid of madman in england im not going to have steal property snuff box especially precisely hope have left disturbance in house exactly a found oh of course have given strict order that nothing be to be touched to morrow morning must like to come look at must look at certainly hewitt said must rather go at once pooh nonsense mr mallett answered with airy obstinacy hewitt afterwards knew so well im not going home again now to spend hour two more sister will want to know what have become of mustnt suspect that anything be wrong may do sort of harm place will keep till morning have snuff box safe with have card mr hewitt havent very well can be at house to morrow morning at half past ten will be there can see want by daylight well consider that settled good day hewitt saw to office door waited till have half descended stair then made for staircase window gave view of street evening be coming on murky foggy street light be blotchy vague outside four wheeled cab stood driver eagerly watched front door when mr mallett emerged instantly began to descend from box with quick invitation cab mum cab seemed very eager for fare though mr mallett hesitated second eventually entered cab drove off hewitt tried in vain to catch glimpse of number of cab behind be always habit of to note such identifying mark throughout case whether seemed important at time not have often have occasion to be pleased with outcome now however light be too bad sooner have cab started than man emerged from narrow passage opposite followed be large rather awkward heavy faced man of middle age have appearance of respectable artisan small tradesman in best clothes hewitt hurried downstairs followed direction cab man have taken toward strand cab by time be swallowed up in strand traffic heavy faced man have also disappeared hewitt returned to office little disappointed for man seemed rather closely to answer mr malletts description of reuben penner illustration cab mum ii punctually at half past ten next morning hewitt be at mr malletts house at fulham be pretty little house standing back from road in generous patch of garden have evidently stood there when fulham be outlying village hewitt entered gate made way to front door where two young female evidently servant stood be in very disturbed state when asked for mr mallett assured that nobody knew where be that have not be seen since previous afternoon said be to stay at sister last night believe yes sir answered more distressed of two girl in cap hasnt be seen there be sister servant shes be sent over to know where be why hasnt be there other girl in bonnet shawl corroborated nothing have be seen of

when came in morning didnt sleep here ought to have done sir after mr mallett went yesterday got so frightened went home at ten girl showed sign of tear have apparently be already indulging in what about old woman deaf woman where be be in house sir there be nowhere else for to go be deaf didnt know anything about what happened night before confined to room so didnt tell see hewitt said with slight smile left here didnt see hear anything did sir cant hear didnt see nothing how do know thief have be in house everythinks tumbled about worse than ever sir different from what be yesterday

hewitt have come down now to meet by appointment did say be going anywhere else a well a to office to sister sir shes got snuff box with latter circumstance seemed largely to augment girl terror for mistress safety very well hewitt said think id better just look over house now then consider what have become of mr mallett if isnt heard of in meantime girl found great relief in hewitts presence in house deaf old house keeper who seldom spoke never heard being a said worse than nobody have be in room hewitt asked sir be afraid when came in went straight upstairs to room a be coming away see

prim rigid a ever except that bonnet be sadly out of shape mantle be torn thank mr hewitt said thought youd come though where be know more than adam somebody will smart severely for why woman that woman pointed contemptuously at woman in corner who be about two third height be going to search why mr mallett blazing with suddenly revived indignation took step forward woman vanished through outer

front room be lighted by hole in shutter have rough reading desk table with dozen wooden chair said hewitt be doubt tabernacle proper there be very little to see in come back now mr mallett to house well see if explanation of thing be not possible hope snuff box be quite safe mr mallett drew from pocket exhibited triumphantly told must never get said saw meant left off trying have straightened bonnet concealed rent in mantle a best must a emerged in street said first thing of course be to bring police into place think wont do yet hewitt said in first place case be one of assault detention remedy be by summons action then there be other thing to speak of will get cab in high street will tell have happened to mr malletts story be simple cab in left hewitts office have travelled west be apparently making for locality of sister house evening be dark fog increased greatly shut window took particular notice of street through be passing indeed with fog must have be impossible have sort of undefined notion that of street be rather narrow dirty thought nothing of since cabman be given to selecting unexpected route after time however cab slowed made sharp turn pulled up door be opened here be mum said cabby did not understand sharp turn have general feeling that place must not be sister a alighted found have stepped directly upon threshold of narrow door into be immediately pulled by two person inside be sure must have be side door in stable yard through hewitt have lately obtained entrance to tabernacle before have recovered from surprise door be shut behind struggled stoutly screamed place be in be absolutely dark be taken by surprise found resistance useless be men who held voice of only one who spoke did not know demanded in firm distinct tone that sacred thing must be given up that mr mallett must sign paper agreeing to prosecute nobody before be allowed to go however a asserted with customary emphasis be not sort of woman to give in to resolutely declined to do anything of sort promised captor whoever be full legal return for behaviour then became conscious that woman be somewhere present man threatened that woman must search threat mr mallett met a boldly a others must like to meet woman who must dare attempt to search said defied anybody to attempt a for uncle joseph snuff box matter where be be where must not be able to get that must never have sooner later must have something very unpleasant for attempt to steal declaration have immediate effect importuned more be left in inner room key be turned on there sat dozing occasionally whole night indomitable spirit remaining proof through doubtful hour of darkness once twice heard people enter move about time called aloud to offer a hewitt have heard reward to anybody who must bring police communicate situation to hewitt day broke still waited sleepless unfed till hewitt at last arrived released on mr malletts arrival at house mr rudd servant be at once despatched with reassuring news hewitt once more addressed to question of burglary first mr mallett said did ever conceal anything anything at mind in frame of engraving never be of engraving framed before have not one can remember be mostly uncle joseph kept with lot of others in drawer be rather collector know very well now come up to attic something have be opened there be not touched at first attempt mr malletts indignation at second burglary be something to see there be triumph in manner still have snuff box see now said hewitt when attic be reached here be box full of paper do know everything be in dont mr mallett replied there be lot of uncle manuscript play here see dead bridegroom drum of fortune so on there be lot of autograph took interest in although be rather valuable believe now bring recollection to bear a strongly a can hewitt said do ever remember seeing in box paper bearing nothing upon wax seal oh yes remember well enough ive noticed time ive turned box over be very seldom be plain slip of vellum paper with red seal cracked rather worn celebrated person seal suppose what about hewitt be turning paper over one at time doesnt seem to be here now said do see mr mallett returned examining paper herself isnt appears to be only thing missing why must take think be at bottom of mystery now hewitt answered quietly be seal of woman what dont understand fact be mr mallett that people have never wanted uncle joseph snuff box at that seal not wanted snuff box nonsense why didnt tell penner asked for wanted to buy yes did so far a can remember never spoke of single instance of penner mentioning snuff box by name spoke of sacred relic of course very naturally assumed spoke of box none of anonymous letter mentioned box know once twice actually did mention seal though usually thing be spoken of in roundabout figurative way a be manner of many people of strange belief in speaking of anything particularly venerate moreover remember that when have entrapped last night moment mentioned snuff box specifically by name ceased troubling contented with shutting up along people reuben penner others have be after seal have be defending snuff box why seal did never hear of joanna southcott oh yes of course be ignorant visionary who set up a prophetess eighty ninety year ago more joanna southcott a may see by suitable book of reference gave out a prophetess in be ignorant woman doubt deceived really believed in extravagant claim put forward be to be mother of messiah said be woman driven into wilderness a foretold in twelfth chapter of book of revelation died at end of when follower numbered more than fanatic believer though of course mostly ignorant people have made rather good thing in lifetime by sale of seal of be to secure eternal salvation of holder at death of course many of believer fell away others held on a faithfully a ever asserting that holy joanna must rise again fulfil prophecy poor people dwindled in number gradually although attempted to bring up child in own faith whole belief have be practically extinct for year now will remember that told of penners mother being superstitious fanatic of sort that uncle joseph have checked extravagance thing seems pretty plain now uncle joseph possessed of joanna southcotts seal by way of removing from poor old mr penner object of sort of idolatry kept a curiosity reuben penner grew up strong in mother delusion to few believer have gathered round at tabernacle seal be object worth risking anything to get must think that probably be only one remaining in existence at present moment see tried way of getting at first tried to convert to belief then tried to buy will remember mentioning that have be mother suggestion thinking of snuff box naturally resented after that friend tried anonymous letter at last grown desperate resorted to watching burglary kidnapping first night raid be unsuccessful so last night tried kidnapping by aid of cabman possibly one of when have got have at last given to understand that be uncle joseph snuff box be defending tried house again time be successful on occasion of first burglary avoided top floor because of servant sleeping there time went home probably saw go got at box in attic guessed have succeeded then from simple circumstance have begun to cut out back of framed engraving for purpose of search only of engraving be so treated that meant that article wanted be found behind one of that intruder broke off in picture examination to search somewhere else be then successful so under necessity of opening other engraving assured that nothing must have be concealed in of engraving so at once assumed that have found what be after in only place wherein have not searched night before attic probably among paper in trunk then if found there why didnt return let go because must have found where have brought probably intended to keep there till dark of next evening then take away in cab again leave distance off to prevent following possibly finding left here on looking glass note hewitt produced threatening sort of vague consequence if be not left to knew have come to of course having followed to office now penner feel anything safe have relinquished greengrocery dispensed stock in charity probably having got seal only thing coveted in world have taken off not so much perhaps from fear of punishment a for fear seal may be taken from with salvation odd belief teach will confer then hewitt related circumstance of smudgy boy sack of coal mr mallett sat silently for little while then said in rather softened voice mr hewitt be not what be called woman of sentiment a may have observed have be most shamefully treated over wretched seal if be really what penner wanted if tell have be actually what have happened have sort of perverse inclination to forgive man in spite of thing probably have be mother at rate believed so giving up little to attain object of ridiculous faith distributing good among poor people really worthy of old martyr if only be done in cause of faith little le stupid though of course think be only religion a others do of theirs then mr mallett stiffened again there not much to prove theory be there hewitt smiled perhaps not said except to mind at rate everything point to explanation being only possible one thing presented to from beginning a attempt on snuff box value so highly possibility of seal being object aimed at never entered mind saw whole from outside on thinking thing over after first interview remembered joanna southcott think will find be right well if be a said half believe will forgive man will advertise if like telling have nothing to fear if can give explanation of conduct consistent with what call religious belief absurd a may be that night fell darker foggier than last advertisement went into daily paper reuben penner never saw late next day bargeman passing old swan pier struck large object with boat hook brought to surface be body of drowned man be afterwards identified a of reuben penner late greengrocer of hammersmith how came into water there be nothing to show others have be drowned by accident on foggy night then there have also be suicide in river thames on night just a foggy nobody knew there be money valuable found on body there be story of large heavy faced man who have given poor woman perfect stranger watch chain handful of money down near tower hill on foggy evening again be only story not definitely authenticated what be certain be that tied securely round dead man neck with cord gripped crumpled tightly in right hand be soddened piece of vellum paper blank carrying old red seal of device be almost entirely rubbed cracked away nobody at inquest quite understood transcriber note final paragraph contains apparent printing error after word nobody knew possibly involving missing line of text transcriber note text in ebook follows book edition of story differs from earlier version published in windsor magazine principally in
