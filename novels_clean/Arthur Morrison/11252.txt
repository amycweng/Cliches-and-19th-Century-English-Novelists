quantity of remarkable unusual evidence presented by plaintiff side evidence took other party completely by surprise overthrew case like house of card affair will perhaps be more readily recalled a occasion of sudden rise to eminence in profession of messrs crellan hunt crellan solicitor for plaintiff result due entirely to wonderful ability shown in case of building up apparently out of nothing smashing weight of irresistible evidence that firm have since maintained indeed enhanced position then won for need scarcely be said here name be familiar to everybody there be not many of outside public who know that credit of whole performance be primarily due to young clerk in employ of messrs crellan who have be given charge of seemingly desperate task of collecting evidence in case mr martin hewitt have however full credit reward for exploit from firm from client more than one other firm of lawyer engaged in contentious work made good offer to entice hewitt to change employer instead of however determined to work independently for future having conceived idea of making regular business of doing on behalf of such client a might retain similar work to that have just done with such conspicuous success for messrs crellan hunt crellan be beginning of private detective business of martin hewitt action at time have be completely justified by brilliant professional success have since achieved business have always be conducted in most private manner have always declined help of professional assistant preferring to carry out such of many investigation offered a must manage have always maintained that have never lost by policy since chance of refusing case begets competition for service fee rise by natural process at same time man must know better how to employ casual assistance at right time curiosity have be expressed a to mr martin hewitt system a always consistently maintains that have system beyond judicious use of ordinary faculty intend setting forth in detail few of more interesting of case in order that public may judge for if be right in estimating mr hewitt ordinary faculty a faculty very extraordinary indeed be not man who have made many friendship probably for professional reason notwithstanding genial companionable manner first made acquaintance a result of accident resulting in fire at old house in hewitt office be situated in upper floor of occupied bachelor chamber be able to help in saving quantity of extremely important paper relating to business while repair be being made allowed to lock in old wall safe in one of room fire have scarcely damaged acquaintance thus begun have lasted many year have become rather close friendship have even accompanied hewitt on of expedition in humble way helped such of case however a personally saw nothing of have put into narrative form from particular given consider brett said addressing most remarkable journalist alive not because be particularly clever know because between ourselves hope will admit be not because have known something of doings for year have never yet be guilty of giving away of little business secret may have become acquainted with be afraid be not so enterprising journalist a brett now since ask will write something if think worth while said a said most thing with cheery chaffing good nature must have be perhaps surprising to stranger who thought of only a grim mysterious discoverer of secret crime indeed man have always a little of aspect of conventional detective a may be imagined nobody must appear more cordial le observant in manner although there be to be seen certain sharpness of eye might after only be twinkle of good humor did think while to write something of martin hewitt investigation description of one of adventure follows at head of first flight of dingy staircase leading up from ever open portal in street by strand stood door dusty ground glass upper panel of carried in center single word hewitt while at right hand lower corner in smaller letter clerk office appeared on morning when clerk in ground floor office have barely hung up hat short well dressed young man wearing spectacle hastening to open dusty door ran into arm of man who suddenly issued from beg pardon first said be hewitt detective agency office yes believe will find so other replied be stoutish clean shaven man of middle height of cheerful round countenance 'd better speak to clerk in little outer office visitor be met by sharp lad with inky finger who presented with pen printed slip printed slip having be filled with visitor name present business conveyed through inner door lad reappeared with invitation to private office there behind writing table sat stoutish man who have only just advised appeal to clerk good morning mr lloyd mr vernon lloyd said affably looking again at slip will excuse care to start even with visitor must know come from sir james norris see yes be secretary have only to ask to go straight to lenton croft at once if can on very important business sir james must have wired have not precise address can go by next train eleven thirty be first available from paddington quite possibly do know thing of business be case of robbery in house rather fancy of several robbery jewelry have be stolen from room occupied by visitor to croft first case occurred month ago nearly year ago in fact last night there be think have better get detail on spot sir james have told to telegraph if be coming so that may meet at station must hurry a drive to station will be rather long one then take will go mr hewitt twyford be station yes will come by be going by train have several thing to attend to now be in town good morning will wire at once mr martin hewitt locked drawer of table sent clerk for cab at twyford station sir james be waiting with dog cart sir james be tall florid man of fifty thereabout known away from home a something of county historian nearer own part a great supporter of hunt gentleman much troubled with poacher a soon a hewitt have found one baronet hurried detective into dog cart have something over seven mile to drive said can tell about wretched business a go be why came for alone hewitt nodded have sent for a lloyd probably told because of robbery at place last evening appears a far a can guess to be one of three by same hand by same gang late yesterday afternoon pardon sir james hewitt interrupted think must ask to begin at first robbery tell whole tale in proper order make thing clearer set in proper shape very well eleven month ago thereabout have rather large party of visitor among colonel heath mr heath lady being relative of own late wife colonel heath have not be long retired know used to be political resident in indian native state mr heath have rather good stock of jewelry of one sort about most valuable piece being bracelet set with particularly fine pearl quite exceptional pearl in fact have be one of heap of present from maharajah of state when heath left india be very noticeable bracelet gold setting being mere feather weight piece of native filigree work almost too fragile to trust on wrist pearl being a have said of size quality not often seen well heath wife arrived late one evening after lunch following day most of men being off by shooting think daughter sister who be very often down here mr heath took into head to go walking fern hunting so on sister be rather long dressing while waited daughter went into mr heath room where mr heath turned over treasure to show a woman do know when sister be at last ready came straight away leaving thing littering about room rather than stay longer to pack up bracelet with other thing be on dressing table then one moment a to door locked a came away daughter suggested turning key a have one two new servant about window that left open a be going to tell well went on walk came back with lloyd whom have met somewhere carrying fern for be dusk almost dinner time mr heath went straight to room bracelet be gone be room disturbed not bit everything be precisely where have be left except bracelet door have be tampered with of course window be open a have told called police of course yes have man from scotland yard down in morning seemed pretty smart fellow first thing noticed on dressing table within inch two of where bracelet have be be match have be lit thrown down now nobody about house have have occasion to use match in room day if have certainly must have thrown on cover of dressing table so that presuming thief to have used that match robbery must have be committed when room be getting dark immediately before mr heath returned in fact thief have evidently struck match passed hurriedly over various trinket lying about taken most valuable nothing else be even moved nothing at then thief must have escaped by window although be not quite clear how walking party approached house with full view of window saw nothing although robbery must have be actually taking place moment two before turned up there be water pipe within practicable distance of window ladder usually kept in stable yard be found lying along edge of lawn gardener explained however that have put ladder there after using early in afternoon of course might easily have be used again after put back just what scotland yard man said be pretty sharp too on gardener very soon decided that knew nothing of stranger have be seen in neighborhood have passed lodge gate besides a detective said scarcely seemed work of stranger stranger must scarcely have known enough to go straight to room where lady only arrived day before have left valuable jewel away again without being seen so people about house be suspected in turn servant offered in body to have box searched be done everything be turned over from butler to new kitchen maid know must have have carried quite so far if have be loser be guest be in such horrible position well there be little more to be said about unfortunately nothing came of thing a great mystery now a ever believe scotland yard man got a far a suspecting before gave up altogether give up did in end think that be know about first robbery be clear oh yes will probably want to ask few question when have seen place can wait what next well sir james pursued next be very trumpery affair must have forgotten about probably if have be for one circumstance even now hardly think must have be work of same hand four month thereabout after mr heath disaster in february of year in fact mr armitage young widow who have be school fellow of daughter stayed with for week so girl trouble about london season know have town house so be glad to have old friend here for little in dull time mr armitage be very active young lady be scarcely in house hour before arranged drive in pony cart with eva daughter to look up old people in village that used to know before be married so set off in afternoon made round of that be late for dinner mr armitage have small plain gold brooch not at valuable know two three pound suppose used to pin up cloak anything of sort before went out stuck in pin cushion on dressing table left ring rather good one believe lying close by asked hewitt be not in room that mr heath have occupied take be in part of building well brooch went taken evidently by one in deuce of hurry for when mr armitage got back to room there be pin cushion with little tear in where brooch have be simply snatched off curious thing be that ring worth dozen of brooch be left where have be put mr armitage did remember whether not have locked door although found locked when returned niece who be indoors time went tried once because remembered that gas fitter be at work on landing near by found safely locked gas fitter whom did know at time who since seems to be quite honest fellow be ready to swear that nobody niece have be to door while be in sight of be almost time a to window sash line have broken that very morning mr armitage have propped open bottom half about eight ten inch with brush when returned that brush sash be exactly a have left now scarcely need tell what awkward job must have be for anybody to get noiselessly in at unsupported window how unlikely must have be to replace with brush exactly a found just so suppose brooch be really gone mean there be chance of mr armitage having mislaid oh none at there be most careful search then a to getting in at window must have be easy well yes sir james replied yes perhaps must be first floor window look over roof skylight of billiard room built billiard room built out from smoking room just at corner must be easy enough to get at window from billiard room roof then added must have be way somebody other be in billiard room whole time nobody must have got over roof be nearly skylight without being seen heard be there for hour two taking little practice well be anything done strict inquiry be made among servant of course nothing came of be such small matter mr armitage must hear of calling in police anything of sort although felt pretty certain that there must be dishonest servant about somewhere servant might take plain brooch know who must feel afraid of valuable ring loss of must be made greater matter of well yes perhaps so in case of inexperienced thief who also must be likely to snatch up took in hurry be doubtful what made connect two robbery together nothing whatever for month seemed quite of different sort scarcely more than month ago met mr armitage at brighton talked among other thing of previous robbery that of mr heath bracelet described circumstance pretty minutely when mentioned match found on table said 'how strange why thief left match on dressing table when took poor little brooch hewitt nodded yes said spent match of course yes of course spent match noticed lying close by pin cushion threw away without mentioning circumstance still seemed rather curious to that match must be lit dropped in case on dressing cover inch from where article be taken mentioned to lloyd when got back agreed that seemed significant scarcely said hewitt shaking head scarcely so far to be called significant although worth following up everybody us match in dark know well at rate coincidence appealed to so far that struck might be worth while to describe brooch to police in order that must trace if have be pawned have tried that of course over bracelet without result fancied shot might be worth making might possibly lead on track of more serious robbery quite so be right thing to do well well found woman have pawned in london at shop in chelsea be time before pawnbroker have clean forgotten about woman appearance name address gave be false so be end of business have of servant left between time brooch be lost date of pawn ticket be servant at home on day brooch be pawned oh yes made that inquiry very good what next yesterday be what made send for late wife sister came here last tuesday gave room from mr heath lost bracelet have with very old fashioned brooch containing miniature of father set in front with three very fine brilliants few smaller stone here be though at croft will tell rest indoors hewitt laid hand on baronet arm pull up sir james said drive little farther must like to have general idea of whole case before go in very good sir james norris straightened horse head again went on late yesterday afternoon a sister in law be changing dress left room for moment to speak to daughter in room almost adjoining be gone no more than three minute five at most on return brooch have be left on table have gone now window be shut fast have not be tampered with of course door be open so be daughter anybody walking near must have be heard strangest circumstance one almost make wonder whether have be awake to day not be that there lay used match on very spot a nearly a possible where brooch have be be broad daylight hewitt rubbed nose looked thoughtfully before um curious certainly said anything else nothing more than will see for have have room locked watched till must examine sister in law have heard of name suggested that must be called in so of course did exactly a wanted that must have lost that brooch of thing in house be most unfortunate see there be small difference about thing between late wife sister when mother died left be almost worse than heath bracelet business altogether be not pleased with thing can assure see what position be for here be three lady in space of one year robbed one after in mysterious fashion in house ca find thief be horrible people will be afraid to come near place can hing ah well will see perhaps have better turn back now by by be thinking of having alteration addition made to house what make ask think might at least consider question of painting decorating sir james say putting up coach house something because must like to be to servant architect builder if please come to look around have told of about business not word nobody know relative lloyd took precaution at once a to little disguise be architect by mean do a please if can only find thief put end to horrible state of affair will do greatest service have ever asked for a to fee will gladly make be usual three hundred in addition martin hewitt bowed be very generous sir james may be sure will do what can a professional man of course good fee always stimulates interest although case of yours certainly seems interesting enough by most extraordinary think so here be three person lady in house two even in same room successively robbed of piece of jewelry from dressing table used match left behind in case in most difficult one must say impossible circumstance for thief yet there be clue well wo say just yet sir james must see must guard against undue predisposition to consider robbery in lump here be at lodge gate again be that gardener man who left ladder by lawn on first occasion spoke of mr hewitt nodded in direction of man who be clipping box border yes will ask anything at rate not now remember building alteration think if there be objection will look first at room that lady mr hewitt looked up inquiringly sister in law mr cazenove oh yes will come to room at once thank think mr cazenove have better be there alighted boy from lodge led horse dog cart away mr cazenove be thin faded quick energetic lady of middle age bent head very slightly on learning martin hewitt name said must thank mr hewitt for very prompt attention need scarcely say that help can afford in tracing thief who have property whoever may be will make most grateful room be quite ready for to examine room be on second floor top floor at part of building slight confusion of small article of dress be observable in part of room take inquired hewitt be exactly a be at time brooch be missed precisely mr cazenove answered have used room put to other inconvenience to avoid disturbance hewitt stood before dressing table then be used match observed exactly where be found yes where be brooch must say almost on very same spot certainly no more than very few inch away hewitt examined match closely be burned very little remarked must appear to have gone out at once must hear struck heard nothing whatever absolutely nothing if will step into miss norris room now for moment hewitt suggested will try experiment tell if hear match struck how many where be match stand match stand proved to be empty match be found in miss norris room test be made striking must be heard distinctly even with one of door pushed to own door miss norris be open understand window shut fastened inside a be now nothing brooch be disturbed yes be so thank mr cazenove think need trouble further just at present think sir james hewitt added turning to baronet who be standing by door think will see other room take walk outside house if please suppose by by there be getting at match left behind on first second occasion sir james answered certainly not here scotland yard man may have kept room that mr armitage have occupied presented peculiar feature few foot below window roof of billiard room be visible consisting largely of skylight hewitt glanced casually about wall ascertained that furniture hanging have not be materially changed since second robbery expressed desire to see window from outside before leaving room however wished to know name of person who be known to have be about house on occasion of three robbery just carry mind back sir james said begin with for instance where be at time when mr heath lost bracelet be in tagley wood afternoon when mr armitage be robbed believe be somewhere about place most of time be out yesterday be down at farm sir james face broadened know whether call suspicious movement added laughed not at only asked so that remembering own movement might better recall of rest of household be anybody to knowledge anybody mind in house on three occasion well know be quite impossible to answer for servant will only get that by direct questioning ca possibly remember thing of sort a to family visitor why suspect of do suspect soul sir james hewitt answered beaming genially not soul see ca suspect people till know something about where be be quite possible there will be independent evidence enough a be must help if can visitor now be there visitor here time even on first last occasion only no not one own sister perhaps will be pleased to know be only there at time of first robbery just so daughter a have gathered be clearly absent from spot time indeed be in company with party robbed niece now why hang mr hewitt ca talk of niece a suspected criminal poor girl under protection really ca allow hewitt raised hand shook head deprecatingly dear sir have said that suspect soul do let know how people be distributed a nearly a possible let see be niece think who found that mr armitage door be locked door in fact on day lost brooch yes be just so at time when mr armitage have forgotten whether locked not yesterday be out then think not indeed go out very little health be usually bad be indoors too at time of heath robbery since ask come now like be ridiculous to suppose that know anything of suppose a have said be only asking for information be resident family take know nothing of anybody else movement except perhaps mr lloyd lloyd well know that be out with lady when first robbery took place a to others remember yesterday be probably in room writing think that acquits eh sir james looked quizzically into broad face of affable detective who smiled replied oh of course nobody can be in two place at once else what must become of alibi a institution a have said be only setting fact in order now see get down to servant unless stranger be party wanted will go outside now lenton croft be large desultory sort of house nowhere more than three floor high mostly only two have be added to bit by bit till zigzagged about site a sir james norris expressed like game of domino hewitt scrutinized external feature carefully a strolled around stopped little while before window of two bed room have just seen from inside presently approached stable coach house where groom be washing wheel of dog cart do mind smoking hewitt asked sir james perhaps will take cigar be not so bad think will ask man for light sir james felt for own match box hewitt have gone be lighting cigar with match from box handed by groom smart little terrier be trotting about by coach house hewitt stooped to rub head then made observation about dog enlisted groom interest be soon absorbed in chat with man sir james waiting little way off tapped stone rather impatiently with foot presently moved away for full quarter of hour hewitt chatted with groom when at last came away overtook sir james that gentleman be about re entering house beg pardon sir james hewitt said for leaving in unceremonious fashion to talk to groom dog sir james good dog will draw anywhere oh replied sir james shortly there be one other thing hewitt went on disregarding other curtness must like to know there be two window directly below of room occupied yesterday by mr cazenove one on floor what room do light that on ground floor be morning room other be mr lloyd secretary sort of study sitting room now will see at once sir james hewitt pursued with affable determination to win baronet back to good humor will see at once that if ladder have be used in mr heath case anybody looking from of room must have seen of course scotland yard man questioned everybody a to nobody seemed to have be in of room when thing occurred at rate nobody saw anything still think must like to look out of window myself will at least give idea of what be in view what be not if anybody have be there sir james norris led way to morning room a reached door young lady carrying book walking very languidly came out hewitt stepped aside to let pas afterward said interrogatively miss norris daughter sir james niece do want to ask anything dora dear sir james added following in corridor be mr hewitt who be investigating wretched robbery for think must like to hear if remember anything happening at of three time lady bowed slightly said in plaintive drawl uncle really remember anything nothing at found mr armitage door locked believe asked hewitt when tried on afternoon when lost brooch oh yes believe be locked yes be have key be left in key oh think not do remember anything out of common happening anything matter how trivial on day mr heath lost bracelet really ca remember at yesterday nothing remember anything thank said hewitt hastily thank now morning room sir james in morning room hewitt stayed few second doing little more than casually glance out of window in room above took little longer time be comfortable room with rather effeminate indication about content little piece of draped silk work hung about furniture japanese silk fan decorated mantel piece near window be cage containing gray parrot writing table be decorated with two vas of flower lloyd make pretty comfortable eh sir james observed be likely anybody must be here while be out at time bracelet went replied hewitt meditatively suppose not stared thoughtfully out of window then still deep in thought rattled at wire of cage with quill toothpick played moment with parrot then looking up at window again said that be mr lloyd be coming back in fly yes think so be there anything else must care to see here thank hewitt replied think there be went down to smoking room sir james went away to speak to secretary when returned hewitt said quietly think sir james think that will be able to give thief presently what have clue who do think began to believe be hopelessly stumped well yes have rather good clue although ca tell much about just yet be so good clue must like to know now whether be determined to prosecute when have criminal why bless of course sir james replied with surprise doe rest with know property belongs to friend even if be disposed to let thing slide must allow must after have be robbed in house of course of course then if can must like to send message to twyford by somebody perfectly trustworthy not servant must anybody go well there be although be only just back from journey if be important will go be important fact be must have policeman two here evening 'd like mr lloyd to fetch without telling anybody else sir james rang in response to message mr lloyd appeared while sir james gave secretary instruction hewitt strolled to door of smoking room intercepted latter a came out be sorry to give trouble mr lloyd said must stay here for little somebody who can be trusted must go will just bring back police constable with rather two two must be better be be wanted wo let servant know will of course there will be female searcher at twyford police station ah of course well need bring know that sort of thing be done at station chatting thus confidentially martin hewitt saw off when hewitt returned to smoking room sir james said suddenly why bless soul mr hewitt have fed be awfully sorry came in rather late for lunch know business have bothered so clean forgot everything else there be dinner till seven so 'd better let give something now be really sorry come along thank sir james hewitt replied wo take much few biscuit perhaps something of sort by by if mind rather think must like to take alone fact be want to go over case thoroughly by can put in room room like where will go dining room rather large there be study be pretty snug perhaps can go into mr lloyd room for hour so think will mind be pretty comfortable certainly if 'd like will tell to send have got thank very much perhaps will also send lump of sugar walnut be be little fad of mine what lump of sugar walnut sir james stopped for moment with hand on bell rope oh certainly if 'd like certainly added stared after detective with curious taste a left room when vehicle bringing back secretary policeman drew up on drive martin hewitt left room on first floor proceeded down stair on landing met sir james norris mr cazenove who stared with astonishment on perceiving that detective carried in hand parrot cage think business be about brought to head now hewitt remarked on stair here be police officer from twyford men be standing in hall with mr lloyd who on catching sight of cage in hewitt hand paled suddenly be person who will be charged think hewitt pursued addressing officer indicating lloyd with finger what lloyd gasped sir james aghast not lloyd nonsense doe seem to think nonsense doe hewitt placidly observed lloyd have sank on chair gray of face be staring blindly at man have run against at office door that morning lip moved in spasm there be sound wilted flower fell from button hole to floor did not move be accomplice hewitt went on placing parrot cage on hall table though doubt whether there will be use in charging eh polly parrot put head aside chuckled polly quietly gurgled come along sir james norris be hopelessly bewildered lloyd lloyd said under breath lloyd that be little messenger useful mercury hewitt explained tapping cage complacently in fact actual lifter hold up last remark referred to wretched lloyd who have fallen forward with something between sob loud sigh policeman took by arm propped in chair system said hewitt with shrug of shoulder hour two after in sir james study ca say have system call nothing common sense sharp pair of eye nobody using must help taking right road in case began at match just a scotland yard man did have advantage of taking line through three case to begin with be plain that match being left there in daylight in mr cazenove room must not have be used to light table top in full glare of window therefore have be used for other purpose what purpose must not at moment guess habitual thief know often have curious superstition will never take anything without leaving something behind pebble piece of coal something like in premise have be robbing seemed at first extremely likely that be case of kind match have clearly be brought in because when asked for match there be none in stand not even empty box room have not be disturbed also match probably have not be struck there nothing having be heard although of course mistake in matter be just possible match then be fair to assume have be lit somewhere else blown out immediately remarked at time that be very little burned plainly must not have be treated thus for nothing only possible object must have be to prevent igniting accidentally following on became obvious that match be used for purpose not a match merely a convenient splinter of wood so far so good on examining match very closely observed a can see for certain rather sharp indentation in wood be very small see scarcely visible except upon narrow inspection there be position be regular see there be two on side opposite corresponding mark of other pair match in fact must seem to have be gripped in fairly sharp instrument holding at two point above two below instrument a may at once strike not unlike beak of bird now here be idea what living creature bird must possibly have entered mr heath window without ladder supposing ladder to have be used must have got into mr armitage window without lifting sash higher than eight ten inch be already open plainly nothing further be significant that only one article be stolen at time although others be about human being must have carried reasonable number bird must only take one at time why must bird carry match in beak certainly must have be trained to do for purpose little consideration made that purpose pretty clear noisy chattering bird must probably betray at once therefore must be trained to keep quiet while going for coming away with plunder what readier more probably effectual way than while teaching to carry without dropping to teach also to keep quiet while carrying one thing must practically cover other thought at once of course of jackdaw magpie bird thievish reputation made guess natural mark on match be much too wide apart to have be made by beak of conjectured therefore that must be raven so that when arrived near coach house seized opportunity of little chat with groom on subject of dog pet in general ascertained that there be tame raven in place also incidentally by getting light from coach house box of match ascertained that match found be of sort generally used about establishment large thick red topped english match further found that mr lloyd have parrot be most intelligent pet have be trained into comparative quietness for parrot also learned that more than once groom have met mr lloyd carrying parrot under coat having a owner explained learned trick of opening cage door escaping said nothing of course to of because have a yet nothing train of argument result got to lloyd room a soon a possible chief object in going there be achieved when played with parrot induced to bite quill toothpick when left in smoking room compared quill match very carefully found that mark corresponded exactly after felt very little doubt indeed fact of lloyd having met lady walking before dark on day of first robbery proved nothing because since be clear that match have not be used to procure light robbery might a easily have taken place in daylight a not must have so taken place in fact if conjecture be right that be right felt doubt there must be other explanation when mr heath left window open door shut anybody climbing upon open sash of lloyd high window must have put bird upon sill above match placed in bird beak for purpose have indicated struck first in case by accident must ignite by rubbing against something startle bird match must of course be dropped just where object to be removed be taken up a know in case match be found almost upon spot where missing article have be left scarcely likely triple coincidence have match be used by human thief must have be done a soon after lady have left a possible there must then have be plenty of time for lloyd to hurry out meet before dark especially plenty of time to meet coming back a must have be since be carrying fern match be article well chosen for purpose a being not altogether unlikely thing to find on dressing table if noticed likely to lead to wrong conclusion adopted by official detective in mr armitage case taking of inferior brooch leaving of more valuable ring pointed clearly either to operator being fool unable to distinguish value certainly from other indication thief seemed fool door be locked gas fitter so to speak on guard window be only eight ten inch open propped with brush human thief entering window must have disturbed arrangement must scarcely risk discovery by attempting to replace especially thief in so great hurry a to snatch brooch up without unfastening pin bird must pas through opening a be must have to tear pin cushion to pull brooch off probably holding cushion down with claw while now in yesterday case have alteration of condition window be shut fastened door be open only left for few minute during time sound be heard of coming going be not possible then that thief be already in room in hiding while mr cazenove be there seized first opportunity on temporary absence room be full of drapery hanging what not allowing of plenty of concealment for bird bird must leave place noiselessly quickly that whole scheme be strange mattered not at robbery presenting such unaccountable feature must have be effected by strange mean of one sort there be improbability consider how many hundred of example of infinitely higher degree of bird training be exhibited in london street week for copper so that on whole felt pretty sure of ground before taking definite step resolved to see if polly must not be persuaded to exhibit accomplishment to indulgent stranger for purpose contrived to send lloyd away again have quiet hour alone with bird piece of sugar a everybody know be good parrot bribe walnut split in half be better especially if bird be used to so got to furnish with polly be shy at first generally get along very well with pet little perseverance soon led to complete private performance for benefit polly must take match mute a wax jump on table pick up brightest thing must see in great hurry leave match behind scuttle away round room at first must give up plunder to be enough also took liberty a know of general look round discovered little collection of brummagem ring trinket that have just seen used in polly education no doubt when sent away struck that might a well be usefully employed a not so got to fetch police deluding little fear by talking about servant female searcher there will be trouble about evidence will confess of be sure know sort of man doubt if will get mr cazenove brooch back see have be to london to day by time swag be probably broken up sir james listened to hewitt explanation with many expression of assent of surprise when be over smoked few whiff then said mr armitage brooch be pawned by woman exactly expect friend lloyd be rather disgusted at small luck probably gave brooch to female connection in london realized on such person always trouble to give correct address two smoked in silence for few minute then hewitt continued expect friend have have easy job altogether with bird success at most have only be three suspect have many failure not few anxious moment that know nothing of must judge a much merely from what groom told of frequently meeting lloyd with parrot plan be not bad one not at all even if bird have be caught in act must only have be 'that mischievous parrot see master must only have be looking for ii loss of sammy crockett be of course always part of martin hewitt business to be thoroughly at home among class of people to be able to interest intelligently to appear to do so in various pursuit in one of most important case ever placed in hand must have gone short way toward success have not displayed knowledge of more sordid aspect of professional sport great interest in undertaking of certain dealer therein great case have nothing to do with sport indeed from narrative point of view be somewhat uninteresting man who alone held one piece of information wanted be keeper backer gaffer of professional pedestrian be through medium of pecuniary interest in such matter that hewitt be enabled to strike bargain with man be publican on outskirt of padfield northern town pretty famous for sporting taste to padfield therefore hewitt betook arrayed in way to indicate inclination of own toward sport began to frequent bar of hare hound kentish landlord be stout bull necked man of great communicativeness at first after little acquaintance opened out wonderfully became quite jolly rather intelligent companion came out with innumerable anecdote of sporting adventure must put very decent dinner on table too at hare hound hewitt frequent invitation to to join therein divide bottle of best in cellar soon put two on very best of term good term with mr kentish be hewitt great desire for information wanted be of sort must never be extracted by casual questioning must be matter of open communication by publican extracted in what way might be look here said kentish one day will put on to good thing boy real good thing of course know about padfield yard handicap being run off now well have looked into much hewitt replied ran first round of heat last saturday monday did did well kentish spoke in stage whisper a leaned over rapped table have got final winner in house nodded head took puff at cigar added in ordinary voice say nothing of course not got something on of course rather what do think got price liked be saving up for why be got twenty one yard can do even time way fact why must win runnin ' back'ards won heat on monday like like like that gaffer snapped finger in default of better illustration went on might have ' took little easier think be shortened price of course jumpin ' in by two yard can get decent odds now if go about right take tip back for

when went back for sweater crockett remained see various print in loose cinder at end of path where moved way then two three pace toward fence not directly toward door notice there stop dead there be more either back forward now if have wing must be tempted to opinion that flew straight away in air from spot unless earth swallowed closed again without leaving wrinkle on face kentish stared

up here reproduced in fac simile illustration six scrap of paper mmy throw ou right away left hi hate lane wr landlord turned scrap over regarding dubiously be much to recognize anyhow know writing where did find be lying in lane at back little way down plainly be piece of note addressed to one called sammy something very like see first piece with bemy be clearly from beginning of note because there be line between smooth straight edge of paper above also nothing follows on same line one writes to crockett presuming to be letter addressed to a do for other reason a sammy be pity that there be more of letter to be found than piece expect person who tore up put rest in pocket dropped by accident kentish who have be picking up examining piece in turn now dolorously broke out oh be plain be

like be nice why 'd twist neck if must get hold of will hewitt smiled perhaps be not quite so uncomplimentary after said if ca recognize writing never mind if be gone away to sell be much use finding be wo win if doe want to why must dare to rope under very eye 'd 'd well well perhaps will get to run after a well a can one thing be certain left place of own will further think be in padfield now went toward town believe think mean to sell well must have made worth while to stick to have put fifty on for out of own pocket told so if won must bring lump more than 'd probably get by going crooked besides prize money anything might give over seems to be putting in cart altogether that will see meantime mention anything have told to one not even to steggles ca help might blurt thing out inadvertently say anything about piece of paper will keep by by steggles be indoors be very well keep in let be seen hunting about evening will stay here to night will proceed with crockett business in morning now will settle business please in morning hewitt took breakfast in snuggery carefully listening to conversation might take place at bar soon after nine o'clock fast dog cart stopped outside red faced loud voiced man swaggered in greeting kentish with boisterous cordiality have drink with landlord said how thing fancy of 'em for sprint handicap got lad o ' own in have oh yes kentish replied crockett only young un not got to proper mark yet reckon think old taylor got time capital lad other replied with confidential nod must wonder at want to do anything over think so be not on at present might have little flutter on ground just for fun nothing else there be few more casual remark then red faced man drove away who be that asked hewitt who have watched visitor through snuggery window be danby bookmaker cute chap be be told crockett missing will bet anything come here to pump good though a matter of fact have worked sammy crockett into book for about half be in for altogether through third party of course hewitt reached for hat be going out for hour now said if steggles want to go out before come back let let go smooth over track on cinder path very carefully by by must manage to have son about place to day in case happen to want little help out of door certainly will get to stay in what do want cinder smoothed for hewitt smiled patted host shoulder will explain trick when job done said went out on lane from padfield to sedby village stood plough beer house wherein j webb be licensed to sell by retail beer to be consumed on premise off a thirsty list nancy webb with very fine color very curly fringe wide smiling mouth revealing fine set of teeth came to bar at summons of stoutish old gentleman in spectacle who walked with stick stoutish old gentleman have glass of bitter beer then said in peculiarly quiet voice of very deaf man can tell if please way into main catton road down lane turn to right at cross road then first to left old gentleman waited with hand to ear for few second after have finished speaking then resumed in whispering voice be afraid be very deaf morning fumbled in pocket produced note book pencil may trouble to write down be so very deaf at time thank girl wrote direction old gentleman bade good morning left down lane walked slowly with stick at cross road turned put stick under arm thrust spectacle into pocket strode away in ordinary guise of martin hewitt pulled out note book examined miss webb direction very carefully then went off way altogether toward hare hound kentish lounged moodily in bar well boy said hewitt have steggles wiped out track not yet have told be somewhere about will tell now think will have done after expect will want to go out soon at rate time during day let go whenever like will sit upstairs bit in club room very well how do know steggles will be going out well be pretty restless after lost protege be suppose will be able to remain idle long about crockett do give up oh be impatient ca say be quite confident yet of laying hold of time be so short see think will at least have news for by evening hewitt sat in club room until afternoon taking lunch there at length saw through front window raggy steggles walking down road in instant hewitt be down stair at door road bent eighty yard away a soon a steggles passed bend detective hurried after way to padfield town more than half through hewitt dogged trainer in end steggles stopped at corner gave note to small boy who be playing near boy ran with note to bright well kept house at opposite corner martin hewitt be interested to observe legend h danby contractor on board over gate in side wall of garden behind house in five minute door in side gate opened head shoulder of red faced man emerged steggles immediately hurried across disappeared through gate be interesting instructive hewitt took up position in side street waited in ten minute trainer reappeared hurried off way have come along street hewitt have considerately left clear for then hewitt strolled toward smart house took good look at at one corner of small piece of forecourt garden near railing small baize covered glass fronted notice board stood on two post on top edge appeared word h danby house to be sold let only notice pinned to green baize within be old dusty one inviting tenant for three shop be suitable for business must be fitted to suit tenant apply within hewitt pushed open front gate rang door bell there be shop to let see said when maid appeared must like to see if will let have key master out sir ca see shop till monday dear be unfortunate be afraid ca wait till monday did mr danby leave instruction in case anybody must inquire yes sir a have told said anybody who called about must come again on monday oh very well then suppose must try one of shop be in high street be sir be in new part granville road ah be afraid will scarcely do will see good day martin hewitt walked away couple of street length before inquired way to granville road when at last found that thoroughfare in new muddy suburb crowded with brick heap half finished street took slow walk along entire length be melancholy example of baffled enterprise row of dozen more shop have be built before population have arrived to demand good must be tradesman have taken many of shop failure disappointment stared from window be half covered by shutter because scanty stock scarce sufficed to fill remaining half others be shut almost altogether inmate only keeping open door for own convenience perhaps keeping down shutter for sake of little light others again have not yet fallen so low struggled bravely still to maintain show of business prosperity with very little success opposite shop there still remained dusty ill treated hedge forlorn looking field old board offered on building lease altogether most depressing spot there be little difficulty in identifying three shop offered for letting by mr h danby be together near middle of row be only one appeared not yet to have be occupied dusty to let bill hung in window with written direction to inquire of mr h danby at now be melancholy baker shop with stock of three loaf plate of stale bun disappointed baker assured hewitt that usually kept key of shop that landlord mr danby have taken away day before to see how ceiling be standing have not returned if be thinking of taking shop here poor baker added with hesitation if will excuse advising must recommend have have sickener of hewitt thanked baker for advice wished better luck in future left to hare hound pace be brisk come said a met kentish inquiring glance have be very good day on whole know where man be now think can get by little management where be oh down in padfield a matter of fact be being kept there against will will find see that friend mr danby be builder a well a bookmaker not regular builder speculates in street of new house now again be be in be a deep in a anybody think now fly into passion there be few others in a well will do harm if keep quiet go get police come fetch if know where be keeping why so will if ca do without be quite possible can without disturbance perhaps delay that calling in police must involve consider now in reference to own arrangement must pay better to get back quietly without soul knowing perhaps not even danby knowing till heat be run to morrow well yes must of course very good then so be remember what have told about keeping mouth shut say nothing to steggles anybody be there cab brougham son can have for evening there be old hiring landau in stable can shut up into cab if will do excellent will run down to town in a soon a be ready first word about crockett what sort of lad be likely to give trouble show fight make disturbance must say not be plucked un certainly manhood in leg believe see ai big sort o ' chap at best 'd be pretty easy put upon at least guess so very good so much better for then wo have be damaged will probably only have one man to guard now carriage please young kentish be six foot sergeant of grenadier home on furlough luxuriating in plain clothes hewitt walked little way toward town allowing landau to catch up traveled in to within hundred yard of empty shop then alighted bidding driver wait will show three empty shop hewitt said a young kentish walked down granville road be pretty sure that sammy crockett be in one of be pretty sure that be middle one take look a go past when shop have be slowly passed hewitt resumed now did see anything about shop told tale of sort sergeant kentish replied ca say noticed anything beyond fact that be empty likely to stay so must think will stroll back look in at window if nobody watching hewitt said see be reasonable to suppose have put in middle one because must suit purpose best shop at side of three be occupied if prisoner struggled shouted made uproar might be heard if be in one of shop next inhabited so that middle shop be most likely now see there went on a stopped before window of shop in question over at back there be staircase not yet partitioned off go down below up above on stair on floor near there be muddy footmark must have be made to day else must not be muddy dry dusty since there have be shower for week till to day move on again then noticed that there be other such mark in shop consequently man with muddy foot did not come in by front door by back otherwise must have made trail from door so will go round to back ourselves be now growing dusk small piece of ground behind shop be bounded by low fence containing door for house door be bolted inside of course hewitt said there be difficulty in climbing think have better wait in garden till dark in meantime jailer whoever be may come out in case will pounce on a soon a open door have few yard of cord in pocket think handkerchief properly rolled will make very good gag now over climbed fence quietly approached house placing in angle of outhouse out of sight from window there be sound light appeared just above ground about foot of window be visible with grating over apparently lighting basement suddenly hewitt touched companion arm pointed toward window faint rustling sound be perceptible a nearly a must be discerned in darkness white blind covering be placed over glass from inside then came sound of striking match at side edge of window there be faint streak of light be place hewitt whispered come will make push for stand against wall at one side of door will stand at other will have a come out quietly now will startle took stone from among rubbish littering garden flung crashing through window there be loud exclamation from within blind fell somebody rushed to back door flung open instantly kentish let fly heavy right hander man went over like skittle in moment hewitt be upon gag in mouth hold hewitt whispered hurriedly will see if there be others peered down through low window within sammy crockett bare leg dangling from beneath long overcoat sat on packing box leaning with head on hand back toward window guttering candle stood on mantel piece newspaper have be stretched across window lay in scattered sheet on floor other person besides sammy be visible led prisoner indoors young kentish recognized a public house loafer race course ruffian well known in neighborhood so be be browdie said have caught one hard clump have mind to make score more will get pretty warm one way before job forgotten sammy crockett be overjoyed at rescue have not be ill treated explained have be thoroughly cowed by browdie who have from time to time threatened savagely with iron bar by way of persuading to quietness submission have be fed have taken no worse harm than slight stiffness from adventure due to light under attire of jersey knee short sergeant kentish tied browdie elbow firmly together behind carried line round ankle bracing up tight then ran knot from one wrist to other over back of neck left prisoner trussed helpless on heap of straw have be sammy bed wo be very jolly expect kentish said for time ca shout ca walk know ca untie will get bit hungry too perhaps that will give appetite suppose will be disturbed till time to morrow unless friend danby turn up in meantime can come along to jail instead if prefer left where lay took sammy to old landau sammy walked in slipper carrying spiked shoe hanging by lace in hand ah said hewitt think know name of young lady who gave slipper crockett looked ashamed indignant yes said have done nicely between 'em will pay will hush hush hewitt said must talk unkindly of lady know get into carriage will take home will see if can tell adventure without making mistake first have note from miss webb telling that be mistaken in supposing have slighted that a matter of fact have quite done with somebody else left of whom be jealous be that so well yes young crockett answered blushing deeply under carriage lamp see how come to know that then went on to ask to get rid of steggles on thursday afternoon for few minute speak to in back lane now running pump with thin sol almost like paper heel long spike hurt foot horribly if walk on hard ground ay that do enough to cripple 'd never go on much hard ground with be not like cricket shoe see not bit cricket shoe can walk anywhere in well knew think know who told promised to bring new pair of slipper to throw over fence for to come out in s'pose be be tellin crockett said mournfully must have ' seen letter saw tear up put bit in pocket asked for in lane in case steggles saw well at rate sent steggles away slipper did come over went into lane walked with a far a road at end then be seized gagged put into carriage be browdie did that said crockett chap know why be padfield high street looked through window regarded familiar shop with astonishment of course be where did think be why where be that place found in granville road padfield suppose told be in town told be newstead hatch drove for about three four hour kept down on floor between seat so a must see where be going done for two reason said hewitt first to mystify prevent discovery of people directing conspiracy second to be able to put indoors at night unobserved well think have told know yourself now a far a carriage there be hare hound just in front will pull up here will get out see if coast be clear fancy mr kentish must rather came in unnoticed in few second hewitt be back crockett be conveyed indoors by side entrance hewitt instruction to landlord be few emphatic tell steggles about said make excuse to get rid of send out of house take crockett into other bedroom not own let son look after then come here will tell about sammy crockett be undergoing heavy grooming with white embrocation at hand of sergeant kentish when landlord returned to hewitt doe danby know have got asked how did do danby doe know yet with luck wo know till see crockett running to morrow man who have sold be steggles steggles steggles be at very first when steggles rushed in to report sammy crockett missing suspected did suppose be always be considered straight man looked a startled a anybody yes must say acted very well there be something suspicious in story what did say crockett have remarked chilliness asked for sweater steggles went to fetch now just think understand thing must trainer who knew business a steggles doe have gone to bring out sweater for man to change for jersey in open air at very time man be complaining of chilliness of course not must have taken man indoors again let change there under shelter then supposing steggles have really be surprised at missing crockett must have looked about found gate open told be open when first came in said nothing of found gate open for ourselves so that from beginning have certain opinion of steggles what say seems pretty plain now although did strike at time if steggles be selling why must have drugged lad must have be deal simpler because steggles be good trainer have certain reputation to keep up must have done good to have have runner drugged while under care certainly must have cooked goose with be much safer thing to connive at kidnapping put active work into other hand left safe even if trick failed now remember that traced print of crockett spiked shoe to within couple of yard from fence that there ceased suddenly yes said looked a though have flown up into air so did be sure that be by gate crockett have left by other must have got through house without being seen there be other way let alone evidence of unbolted gate therefore a footprint ceased where did be not repeated anywhere in lane knew that have taken spiked shoe off probably changed for something else because runner anxious a to chance must never risk walking on bare foot with chance of cutting ordinary broad smooth soled slipper must leave impression on coarse cinder bordering track nothing short of spiked shoe must leave mark on hard path in lane behind spike track be leading not directly toward door in direction of fence when stopped somebody have handed thrown slipper over fence have changed on spot enemy have calculated upon spike leaving track in lane might lead in search have arranged accordingly so far so good must see footprint near gate in lane will remember sent steggles off to watch at cop before went out to back merely of course to get out of way went out into lane leaving behind walked whole length first toward old kiln then back toward road found nothing to help except small piece of paper be here in pocket book by by of course bemy might have meant 'jimmy a possibly a beammy ' be not to be rejected on account certainly crockett have be decoyed out of ground not taken by force there must have be mark of scuffle in cinder a request for sweater be probably excuse because be not at cold afternoon must have previously designed going out inference letter received here be piece of letter now in light of what have said look at piece first there be bemy have dealt with then see 'throw ov ' clearly part of 'throw over ' exactly what have probably be done with slipper then 'poor f ' coming just on line before seen by joining up with other piece might easily be reference to 'poor foot coincidence one on other went far to establish identity of letter to confirm previous impression then there be something else two other piece evidently mean 'left 'right away perhaps there be containing almost of word 'hate ' with word 'hate underlined now who writes 'hate with emphasis of underscoring who woman writing be large not very regular might easily be that of half educated woman here be something more sammy have be enticed away by woman now remembered that when went into tap room on wednesday of companion be chaffing crockett about certain nancy webb chaff went home a be plain to see woman then who must most easily entice sammy crockett away be nancy webb resolved to find who nancy webb be learn more of meantime took look at road at end of lane be damper than lane being lower overhung by tree there be many wheel track only one set turned in road went back way came toward town be narrow wheel carriage wheel crockett tell now that drove about for long time before shutting up probably inconvenience of taking straight to hiding place did strike when first drove off few inquiry soon set in direction of plough miss nancy webb have curiosity to look around place a approached there in garden behind house be steggles young lady in earnest confabulation conjecture became certainty steggles be lover of whom crockett be jealous have employed girl to bring sammy out watched steggles home gave hint to keep there thing remained be to find steggles employer in business be glad to be in when danby called came of course to hear if must blurt out anything to learn if possible what step be taking failed by way of making assurance doubly sure took short walk morning in character of deaf gentleman got miss webb to write direction comprised three of word on scrap of paper 'left 'right 'lane see correspond peculiar f ' ' now felt perfectly sure that steggles must go for pay to day in first place knew that people mixed up with shady transaction in professional pedestrianism be not apt to trust one far know better therefore steggles must have have bribe first must take care to get before saturday heat be run because once be over thing be done principal conspirator might have refused to pay up steggles must have helped again hinted must not go out till must follow afternoon when went follow did saw go into danby house by side way come away again danby be then who have arranged business nobody be more likely considering large pecuniary stake against crockett winning race now how to find crockett made up mind must be in danby own house must be deal too risky with servant about so on saw that danby be builder have three shop to let be on paper before house what more likely prison than empty house knocked at danby door asked for key of shop must have servant told danby be out manifest lie for have just seen that nobody must see shop till monday got out of address of shop be wanted at time now why be nobody to see shop till monday interval be suspicious just enough to enable crockett to be sent away again cast loose after saturday racing supposing to be kept in one of empty building went off at once looked at shop forming conclusion a to must be most likely for danby purpose here have confirmation of idea poor half bankrupt baker in one of shop have by bill custody of set of key too told must have danby have taken away on thursday very day with trivial excuse have brought back be wanted must expect in way of guidance whole thing be plain rest know about well be certainly a smart a give credit for must say suppose danby have taken down 'to let ' notice what must have done then have course even then must have gone to danby astounded by telling about little game terrorized with threat of law made throw up hand send crockett back a be see doe know at moment probably wo know till to morrow afternoon that lad be safe sound here will probably use interval to make pay for losing game by of ingenious financial device be doubt familiar with ay will will give price against crockett now so long a bet come direct from about crockett now hewitt went on wo confinement be likely to have damaged speed for day two ah perhaps landlord replied bless ye wo matter there be four more in heat to morrow two know be tryers other two can hold in at couple of quid apiece day third round final wo be till to morrow week will be a fit a ever by then be a safe a ever be how much be going to have on will lump on for safe enough be chance not to be missed be picking money up thank think will have anything to do with professional pedestrian business doe seem pretty one at call moralist if will excuse saying so thing be scarcely game care to pick tap money at in way oh very well if think so wo persuade ye though think so much of smartness a did after still wo quarrel have done mighty good turn must say only feel be level without doing something to pay debt come now have got trade a have got mine let have bill will pay like lord feel deal more pleased than if made favor of not that be above favor of course 'd prefer paying be fact dear sir have paid hewitt said with smile paid in advance be bargain be must do business if must help in mine very well bargain bargain have performed part must be offended at what said just now wo a to raggy steggles once heat be over to morrow will well be on following sunday week that martin hewitt in room in london turned over paper read under head padfield annual yard handicap announcement final heat crockett first willis second trewby third owen howell runaway win by nearly three yard iii case of mr foggatt almost only dogmatism that martin hewitt permitted in regard to professional method be one on matter of accumulative probability often when have remarked upon apparently trivial nature of clew by allowed to be guided sometimes to seeming in very face of likelihood have replied that two triviality pointing in same direction became at once by mere agreement triviality at enormously important consideration if be in search of man must say of whom knew nothing that squinted bore birthmark on right hand limped observed man who answered to first peculiarity so far clue must be trivial because thousand of men squint now if man presently moved exhibited birthmark on right hand value of squint that mark must increase at once hundred thousand fold apart be little together much weight of evidence be not doubled merely must be only doubled if men who squinted have right hand birthmark whereas proportion if must be ascertained must be perhaps more like one in ten thousand two triviality pointing in same direction become very strong evidence when man be seen to walk with limp limp triviality re enforcing others brings matter to rank of practical certainty bertillon system of identification what be summary of triviality thousand of men be of same height thousand of same length of foot thousand of same girth of head thousand correspond in separate measurement may name be when measurement be taken together that have man identified forever just consider how few if of friend correspond exactly in two personal peculiarity hewitt dogma received illustration unexpectedly close at home old house wherein chamber hewitt office be situated contained besides own two three more bachelor den in addition to office on ground first second floor at very top of at back fat middle aged man named foggatt occupied set of four room be only after long residence by accidental remark of housekeeper learned man name be not painted on door displayed with others on wall of ground floor porch mr foggatt appeared to have few friend lived in something a nearly approaching luxury a old bachelor living in chamber can live ascending case of champagne be common phenomenon of staircase have more than once seen picture destined for top floor of sort went far to awaken green covetousness in heart of poor journalist man be not altogether prepossessing fat a be have way of carrying head forward on extended neck gazing widely about with pair of roundest most prominent eye remember to have ever seen except in fish on whole appearance be rather vulgar rather arrogant rather suspicious without very pronounced quality of sort certainly be not pretty in end however be found shot dead in sitting room be in way hewitt have dined together at club late in evening have returned to room to smoke discus came uppermost have made bargain that day with two speculative odd lot at book sale of contained hidden prize sat talking turning over book while time went unperceived when suddenly be startled by loud report clearly be in building listened for moment heard nothing else then hewitt expressed opinion that report be that of gunshot gunshot in residential chamber be not common thing wherefore got up went to landing looking up stair down at top of next flight saw mr clayton housekeeper appeared to be frightened told that report came from mr foggatt room thought might have have accident with pistol usually lay on mantel piece went upstairs with knocked at mr foggatt door there be reply through ventilating fanlight over door must be seen that there be light within sign mr clayton maintained that mr foggatt be not out knocked again much more loudly called still ineffectually door be locked application of housekeeper key proved that tenant key have be left in lock inside mr clayton conviction that something have happened became distressing in end hewitt pried open door with small poker something have happened in sitting room mr foggatt sat with head bowed over table quiet still head be ill to look at by lay large revolver of full sized army pattern mr clayton ran back toward landing with faint scream run brett said doctor policeman bounced down stair half flight at time first thought doctor may not be dead must think of doctor in immediate neighborhood ran up street away from strand a being more likely direction for doctor although le so for policeman took good five minute to find medico after being led astray by red lamp at private hotel five to get back with policeman foggatt be dead without doubt probably have shot doctor thought from powder blackening other circumstance certainly nobody must have left room by door must have passed landing while fact of door being found locked from inside made thing impossible there be two window to room of be shut one being fastened by catch while catch of other be broken old fracture below window be sheer drop of fifty foot more without foot hand hold near window in other room be shut fastened certainly seemed suicide unless be one of accident will occur to people who fiddle ignorantly with firearm soon room be in possession of police be turned out looked in at housekeeper kitchen where daughter be reviving calming mr clayton with gin water must upset mr clayton hewitt said what will become of doctor think be accident took small bottle of sewing machine oil from pocket handed to daughter thanking for loan there be little evidence at inquest shot have be heard body have be found that be practical sum of matter friend relative of dead man came forward doctor gave opinion a to probability of suicide accident police evidence tended in same direction nothing have be found to indicate that other person have be near dead man room on night of fatality on other hand paper bankbook etc proved to be man of considerable substance with apparent motive for suicide police have be unable to trace relative indeed nearer connection than casual acquaintance fellow clubmen so on jury found that mr foggatt have died by accident well brett hewitt asked afterward what do think of verdict said that seemed to be most reasonable one possible to square with common sense view of case yes replied perhaps doe from point of view of jury on information verdict be quite reasonable nevertheless mr foggatt did not shoot be shot by rather tall active young man perhaps sailor certainly gymnast young man whom think must identify if saw how do know by simplest possible inference may easily guess if will think then why did say at inquest dear fellow want inference conjecture at inquest only want evidence if have traced murderer of course then must have communicated with police a matter of fact be quite possible that police have observed know a much a do more give everything away at inquest know must do if be right how did man get away come be near home now let take look at back of house must have left by foggatt landing door a know a be there be certain of a chimney be out of question for there be good fire in grate must have gone out by window only one window be possible that with broken catch for others be fastened inside out of window then went how window be fifty foot up of course be why will persist in assuming that only way of escape by window be downward see now look up there window be at top floor have very broad sill over window be nothing flat face of gable end to right foot two above level of top of window iron gutter end observe be not of lead composition strong iron gutter supported just at end by iron bracket if tall man stood on end of window sill steadying by left hand leaning to right must just touch end of gutter with right hand full stretch toe to finger be seven foot three inch have measured active gymnast sailor must catch gutter with slight spring by draw upon roof will say must have to be very active dexterous cool so must very fact help because narrow field of inquiry know sort of man to look for because being certain a be that man be in room know that left in way be telling must have left in way other way being impossible alone remains difficult a feat may seem fact of shutting window behind further prof coolness address at so great height from ground be very plain main point be still dark say know that man be in room said how do know that a said by obvious inference come now will guess how arrived at inference often speak of interest in work attention with follow will be simple exercise for saw everything in room a plainly a bring scene back to memory think over various small object littering about how must affect case quick observation be first essential for work did see newspaper for instance yes there be evening paper on floor did examine anything else on table there be whisky decanter taken from tantalus stand on sideboard one glass by by added looked a though only one person be present so did perhaps although inference must be very strong go on there be fruit stand on sideboard with plate beside containing few nutshell piece of apple pair of nut cracker think orange peel there be of course ordinary furniture chair pulled up to table except used by foggatt be noticed think stay there be ash tray on table partly burned cigar near only one cigar though excellent excellent indeed a far a memory simple observation go saw everything plainly remember everything surely now know how found out that man have just left unless there be different kind of ash in ash tray be fairly good suggestion there be not there be only single ash corresponding in way to on cigar remember everything did a went down stair returned bottle of oil to housekeeper daughter think did doe that give hint come surely have now have then sha' tell deserve think mention subject again till have at least one guess to make thing stare in face see remember yet wo see wo encourage slovenliness of thought boy by telling what can know for if like good by be off now there be case in hand ca neglect propose to go further into then hewitt shrugged shoulder be not policeman said case be in very good hand of course if anybody come to to do a matter of business will take up be very interesting ca neglect regular work for naturally will keep eye open memory in order sometimes thing come into hand by a be in case of course be loyal citizen ready to help law au revoir be busy man thought little more of hewitt conundrum for time indeed when did think saw way to answer week after inquest took holiday have written nightly leader regularly day for past five year saw more of hewitt for six week after return with still few day of leave to run one evening together turned into luzatti off coventry street for dinner have be here several time lately hewitt said feed very well no not that table seized arm a turned to unoccupied corner fancy be draughty led way to longer table where dark lithe a well a must be seen tall young man already sat took chair opposite have scarcely seated before hewitt broke into torrent of conversation on subject of bicycling a previous conversation have be of literary sort a have never known hewitt at other time to show slightest interest in bicycling rather surprised have however such general outsider grasp of subject a be usual in journalist of work managed to keep talk going from side a went on must see face of young man opposite brighten with interest be rather fine looking fellow with dark though very clear skin have hard angry look of eye prominence of cheek bone squareness of jaw gave rather uninviting aspect a hewitt rattled on however neighbor expression became one of pleasant interest merely of course hewitt said have number of very capital men just now believe deal in forgotten rider of five ten fifteen year back osmond believe be better than man riding now think must puzzle of to beat furnivall a be at best poor old cortis really believe be a good a anybody nobody ever beat cortis except let see think somebody beat cortis once who be now ca remember liles said young man opposite looking up quickly ah yes liles be charley liles be championship mile championship cortis won other three though yes so did saw cortis when first broke old mile record straightway hewitt plunged into whirl of talk of bicycle tricycle record racing cyclist hillier synyer noel whiting taylerson appleyard talk wherein young man opposite bore animated share while be left in cold new friend seems have be prominent racing bicyclist few year back be presently at hewitt request exhibiting neat gold medal that hung at watch guard be won explained in old tall bicycle day day of bad track when racing cyclist carried cinder scar on face from numerous accident pointed to blue mark on forehead told be track scar described bad fall have cost two teeth broken others gap among teeth be plain to see a smiled presently waiter brought dessert young man opposite took apple nut cracker fruit knife lay on side of stand hewitt turned stand to offer knife thanks said only polish good apple never peel be mistake except with thick skinned foreign one began to munch apple a only boy healthy athlete can presently turned head to order coffee waiter back be turned have to be called twice to unutterable amazement hewitt reached swiftly across table snatched half eaten apple from young man plate pocketed gazing immediately with abstracted air at painted cupid on ceiling neighbor turned again looked doubtfully at plate table cloth about then shot keen glance in direction of hewitt said nothing however took coffee bill deliberately drank former gazing quietly at hewitt a did paid latter left immediately hewitt be on foot taking umbrella stood near followed just a reached door met late neighbor who have turned suddenly back umbrella think hewitt asked offering yes thanks man eye have more than former hardness jaw muscle tightened a looked turned went hewitt came back to pay bill said go back to room will come on later must follow man be foggatt case a went out heard cab rattle away immediately after paid bill went home be ten o'clock before hewitt turned up calling in at office below on way up to mr sidney mason said be gentleman police will be wanting to morrow expect for foggatt murder be a smart man a remember ever meeting have done rather neatly twice evening mean man sat opposite at luzatti of course yes got name of course from reverse of gold medal be good enough to show fear have bilked over address suspected that be plain left umbrella by way of experiment to see if be watching sharply enough to notice circumstance to avail of to follow be hasty fell into trap cabbed away from luzatti cabbed after have led pretty dance up down london to night two cabby have made stroke of business out of in end entered house of of course have taken address expect doe live there be too smart man to lead to den police can certainly find something of at house went in at expect left by back way by way never guessed that simple little puzzle a to how found that be murder did see now of course something to do with apple stole suppose something to do with must think so worthy innocent just ring bell will borrow mr clayton sewing machine oil again on night broke into foggatt room saw nutshell bitten remains of apple on sideboard remembered yet must see that in piece of apple possibly lay important piece of evidence of course never expected to have arrived at conclusion a have because have ten minute in to examine that apple to do what did with at least must have seen possibility of evidence in first now apple be white bitten apple a must have observed turn of reddish brown color if left to stand long different kind of apple brown with different rapidity browning always begin at core be one of twenty thousand tiny thing that few people take trouble to notice be useful for man in position to know russet will brown quite quickly apple on sideboard be a near a must tell newtown pippin other apple of kind will brown at core in from twenty minute to hour in other part in quarter of hour more when saw be white with barely tinge of brown about exposed core inference somebody have be eating fifteen twenty minute before perhaps little longer inference supported by fact that be only partly eaten examined that apple found bore mark of very irregular teeth while be gone oiled over rushing down to room where always have little plaster of paris handy for such work took mold of part where teeth have left clearest mark then returned apple to place for police to use if thought fit looking at mold be plain that person who have bitten that apple have lost two teeth one at top one below not exactly opposite nearly so other teeth although must appear to have be fairly sound be irregular in size line now dead man have a saw very excellent set of false teeth regular sharp with none missing therefore be plain that somebody else have be eating that apple do make clear quite go on there be other inference to be made slighter pointing same way for instance man of foggatt age doe not a rule munch unpeeled apple like school boy inference young man healthy why came to conclusion that be tall active gymnast perhaps sailor have already told when examined outside of foggatt window be also pretty clear that robbery be not motive since nothing be disturbed that friendly conversation have preceded murder witness drinking eating of apple whether not police noticed thing ca say if have have best men on certainly must think case to rough observer looked so clearly one of accident suicide possibly did a said after inquest be unable to devote immediate time to case resolved to keep eye open man to look for be tall young strong active with very irregular set of teeth tooth missing from lower jaw just to left of center from upper jaw little farther still toward left might possibly be person have seen about premise have good memory for face of course possibly might not just before returned from holiday noticed young man at luzatti whom remembered to have seen somewhere about office in building be tall young so on have client with be unable to examine more narrowly indeed a be not exactly engaged on case a there be several tall young men about took little trouble to day finding same young man with vacant seat opposite took opportunity of making closer acquaintance certainly managed to draw out oh yes easiest person in world to draw out be cyclist easiest cyclist to draw out be of course novice next easiest be veteran when see healthy well trained looking man who nevertheless have slight stoop in shoulder maybe medal on watch guard be always safe card to try first with little cycle racing talk soon brought mr mason out of shell read name on medal have chance of observing teeth indeed spoke of now a observed just now there be several tall athletic young men about also there be several men who have lost teeth now saw that tall athletic young man have lost exactly two teeth one from lower jaw just to left of center from upper jaw farther still toward left triviality pointing in same direction became important consideration more teeth be irregular throughout a nearly a must remember looked remarkably like little plaster mold of mine produced from pocket irregular lump of plaster about three inch long on one side of appeared in relief likeness of two irregular row of six eight teeth one in row where deep gap be seen in position spoken of by friend proceeded be enough at least to set after young man gave greatest chance of when turned left apple eaten unpeeled remember important triviality on plate be afraid be at polite ran risk of arousing suspicion must resist temptation to steal did a saw here be brought apple from coat pocket one bitten side placed against upper half of mold fitted precisely projection of apple filling exactly deep gap other side similarly fitted lower half there be getting behind that see hewitt remarked merely observing man teeth be guide to extent be a plain a signature thumb impression will never find two men bite exactly alike matter whether leave distinct teeth mark not here by by be mr clayton oil will take mold from apple compare oiled apple heaped little plaster in newspaper took water jug rapidly pulled off hard mold part corresponding to merely broken place in apple be of course dissimilar a to teeth mark impression be identical will do think hewitt said tomorrow morning brett will put up thing in small parcel take round to bow street be sufficient evidence quite sufficient for police purpose there be man rest movement on day so forth be simple matter of inquiry at rate be police business have scarcely sat down to breakfast on following morning when hewitt came into room put long letter before from friend of last night said read letter began abruptly undated be a follows to martin hewitt esq sir must compliment on adroitness exhibited evening in extracting from name address be able to balk of for time being although by time read will probably have found through law list a be admitted solicitor that however will be of little use to for be removing think beyond reach even of ability of search knew well by sight be perhaps foolish to allow to be drawn a did still have idea that must be dangerous especially after seeing a witness with very little to say at inquest upon scoundrel shot somewhat discourteous seizure of apple at first amazed indeed be little doubtful a to whether have really taken be first warning that might be playing deep game against incomprehensible a action be to mind subsequently reflected that have be eating apple instead of taking drink first offered in dead wretch room on night came to merited end from

without leaving trace of intention iv case of dixon torpedo hewitt be very apt in conversation to dwell upon many curious chance coincidence that have observed not only in connection with own case also in matter dealt with by official police with whom be on term of pretty regular indeed friendly acquaintanceship have told many anecdote of singular happening to scotland yard official with whom have exchanged experience of inspector netting for instance who spent many weary month in search for man wanted by american government in end found by merest accident misdirected call that man have be lodging next door to whole of time just a ignorant of course a be inspector a to enemy at other side of party wall also of inspector whose name can not recall who having be given rather meager insufficient detail of man whom anticipated having great difficulty in finding went straight down stair of office where have received instruction actually fell over man near door where have stooped down to tie shoe lace there be case too in when great notorious crime have be committed various person have be arrested on suspicion be found among who have long be badly wanted for other crime altogether many criminal have met desert by venturing out of own particular line of crime into often man who got into trouble over something comparatively small found in for startlingly larger trouble result of previous misdeed otherwise must have gone unpunished ruble note forger mirsky might never have be handed over to russian authority have confined genius to forgery alone be generally supposed at time of extradition that have communicated with russian embassy with view to giving up foolish proceeding on part must seem since whereabouts indeed even identity a forger have not be suspected have communicated with russian embassy be true for quite different purpose a martin hewitt well understood at time what that purpose be be now for first time published time be half past one in afternoon hewitt sat in inner office examining comparing handwriting of two letter by aid of large lens put down lens glanced at clock on mantel piece with premonition of lunch a did so clerk quietly entered room with one of printed slip be kept for announcement of unknown visitor be filled up in hasty almost illegible hand thus name of visitor f graham dixon address chancery lane business private urgent show mr dixon in said martin hewitt mr dixon be gaunt worn looking man of fifty so well although rather carelessly dressed carrying in strong though drawn face dullish eye look characterizes life long strenuous brain worker leaned forward anxiously in chair hewitt offered told story with great deal of very natural agitation may possibly have heard mr hewitt know there be rumor of new locomotive torpedo government be about adopting be in fact dixon torpedo own invention in respect not merely in own opinion in of government expert by far most efficient certain yet produced will travel at least four hundred yard farther than torpedo now made with perfect accuracy of aim very great desideratum let tell will carry unprecedentedly heavy charge there be other advantage speed simple discharge so forth that need bother about machine be result of many year of work disappointment design have only be arrived at by careful balancing of principle mean be expressed on only four existing set of drawing whole thing need hardly tell be profound secret may judge of present state of mind when tell that one set of drawing have be stolen from house from office in chancery lane morning four set of drawing be distributed thus two be at admiralty office one being finished set on thick paper other set of tracing therefrom other two be at own office one being penciled set uncolored sort of finished draft understand other set of tracing similar to at admiralty be last set have gone two set be kept together in one drawer in room be there at ten morning of be sure for have to go to very drawer for something else when first arrived at twelve tracing have vanished suspect somebody probably can not be most extraordinary thing nobody have left office except then only to come to since ten morning there have be visitor yet drawing be gone have searched place of course have be twelve o'clock when first discovered loss have be turning place upside down ever since assistant drawer have be emptied desk table turned over very carpet linoleum have be taken up there be not sign of drawing men even insisted on turning pocket inside out although never for moment suspected of must take pretty big pocket to hold drawing doubled up a small a might be say men there be two understand have left office be staying in now worsfold suggested that must be more satisfactory if did not leave till something be done toward clearing mystery up although a have said suspect in least acquiesced just so now be assuming that wish to undertake recovery of drawing engineer nodded hastily very good will go round to office first perhaps can tell something about assistant something might be awkward to tell in presence know mr worsfold for instance be draughtsman very excellent intelligent man very smart man indeed feel sure quite beyond suspicion have prepared many important drawing for have be with nearly ten year now have always found trustworthy of course temptation in case must be enormous still can not suspect worsfold indeed how can suspect anybody in circumstance other now name ritter be merely tracer not fully skilled draughtsman be quite decent young fellow have have two year consider particularly smart must have learned little more of business by time see least reason to suspect a said before ca reasonably suspect anybody very well will get to chancery lane now if please can tell more a go have cab waiting what else can tell understand position to be succinctly drawing be in office when arrived nobody came out nobody went in yet vanished be that so be so when say that absolutely nobody came in of course except postman brought couple of letter during morning mean absolutely nobody came past barrier in outer office usual thing know like counter with frame of ground glass over quite understand that think said that drawing be in drawer in own room not outer office where draughtsman be presume be case be inner room rather room parallel with other communicating with just a own room be have just left then say never left office yet drawing vanished apparently by unseen agency while be there in room let explain more clearly cab be bowling smoothly along strand engineer took out pocket book pencil fear proceeded that be little confused in explanation be naturally rather agitated a will see presently office consist of three room two at one side of corridor other opposite thus made rapid pencil sketch illustration in outer office men usually work in inner office work room communicate a see by door ordinary way in out of place be by door of outer office leading into corridor first pas through usual lifting flap in barrier door leading from inner office to corridor be always kept locked on inside suppose unlock once in three month have not be unlocked morning drawer in missing drawing be kept in saw at ten o'clock morning be at place marked d be large chest of willow drawer in plan lie flat quite understand then there be private room opposite what of be sort of private sitting room rarely use except for business interview of very private nature when said never left office did not mean that never stirred out of inner office be about in one room outer inner office once went into private room for five minute nobody came either in out of of room at time for door of private room be wide open be standing at book case have gone to consult book just inside door with full view of door opposite indeed worsfold be at door of outer office most of short time came to ask question well hewitt replied come to simple first statement know that nobody left place arrived except postman who must get near drawing yet drawing went be office cab have stopped before large stone building mr dixon alighted led way to first floor hewitt took casual glance round of three room there be sort of door in frame of ground glass over barrier to admit of speech with visitor door hewitt pushed wide open left so engineer went into inner office must like to ask worsfold ritter question mr dixon inquired presently be coat take hanging just to right of outer office door over umbrella stand yes be thing coat hat stick umbrella coat be searched say yes be drawer thoroughly searched of course oh certainly drawer be taken out turned over well of course must assume made mistake in hunt now tell did anybody know where plan be beyond two men a far a can tell not soul keep office boy there must be nothing for to do except to post letter now again ritter doe quite well for a be quite sure that drawing be there at ten o'clock perhaps thing scarcely matter may a well know if men have key of office neither have patent lock to door keep key if worsfold ritter arrive before in morning have to wait to be let in be always present when room be cleaned have not neglected precaution see suppose object of theft assuming be theft be pretty plain thief must offer drawing for sale to foreign government of course must probably command great sum have be looking a need hardly tell to invention to secure very large fortune will be ruined indeed if design be taken abroad be under strictest engagement to secrecy with admiralty not only must lose labor must lose confidence reposed in at headquarters must in fact be subject to penalty for breach of contract career stopped forever can not tell what serious business be for if can not help consequence will be terrible bad for service of country too of course of course now tell must take be necessary for thief to exhibit drawing to anybody anxious to buy secret mean must describe invention by word of mouth oh must be impossible drawing be of most complicated description full of figure upon whole thing depends indeed one must have to be skilled expert to properly appreciate design at various principle of hydrostatics chemistry electricity pneumatics be most delicately manipulated adjusted smallest error omission in part must upset whole drawing be necessary to thing be gone at moment door of outer office be heard to open somebody entered door between two office be ajar hewitt must see right through to glass door left open over barrier into space beyond well dressed dark bushy bearded man stood there carrying hand bag placed on ledge before hewitt raised hand to enjoin silence man spoke in rather high pitched voice with slight accent be mr dixon now within asked be engaged answered one of draughtsman very particularly engaged be afraid wo be able to see afternoon can give message be two second time have come to day not two hour ago mr dixon tell to call again have very important very excellent steam packing to show be very cheap best of market man tapped bag have just taken order from largest railway company can not see for one second only will not detain really be sure ca afternoon be seeing anybody if will leave name name be hunter what good of that ask to call little later come now be engaged be very great pity man snatched up bag walking stick stalked off indignantly hewitt stood still gazing through small aperture in doorway 'd scarcely expect man with name a hunter to talk with accent must observed musingly be french accent german seems foreign happen to know suppose called here about half past twelve just while be in middle of search be frantic over loss of drawing be in outer office myself told to call later have lot of such agent here anxious to sell sort of engineering appliance what will do now will see men think said hewitt rising think will get to question yes have reason will trust with 'key of private room opposite will go over there for little while talk to men in room bring in here shut door can look after office from across corridor know ask to detail exact movement about office morning get to recall visitor who have be here from beginning of week will let know reason of later come across to in few minute hewitt took key passed through outer office into corridor ten minute later mr dixon having questioned draughtsman followed found hewitt standing before table in private room on lay several drawing on tracing paper see here mr dixon said hewitt think be drawing be anxious about engineer sprang toward with cry of delight why yes yes exclaimed turning over one of where how must have be in place after then what fool have be hewitt shook head be afraid be not quite so lucky a think mr dixon said drawing have most certainly be out of house for little while never mind how will talk of after there be time to lose tell how long must take good draughtsman to copy must possibly be traced over properly in le than two two half long day of very hard work dixon replied with eagerness ah then be a feared tracing have be photographed mr dixon task be one of possible difficulty if have be copied in ordinary way one might hope to get hold of copy photography upset everything copy can be multiplied with such amazing facility once thief get decent start be almost hopeless to checkmate only chance be to get at negative before copy be taken must act at once fear between ourselves may be necessary for to step very distinctly over line of law in matter see to get at negative may involve something very like house breaking there must be delay no waiting for legal procedure mischief be done indeed very much question whether have legal remedy strictly speaking mr hewitt implore do what can need not say that have be at disposal will guarantee to hold harmless for anything may happen do entreat do everything possible think of what consequence may be well yes so do hewitt remarked with smile consequence to if be charged with house breaking might be something that amount of guarantee must mitigate however will do what can if only from patriotic motif now must see tracer ritter be traitor in camp ritter how never mind that now be upset agitated have better not know more than be necessary for little while in case say do something unguarded with ritter must take deep course what know must appear to know will seem more likely to if disclaim acquaintance with what do know first put tracing safely away out of sight dixon slipped behind book case now hewitt pursued call mr worsfold give something to do will keep in inner office across way tell to send ritter here mr dixon called chief draughtsman requested to put in order drawing in drawer of inner room have be disarranged by search to send ritter a hewitt have suggested ritter walked into private room with air of respectful attention be puffy faced unhealthy looking young man with very small eye loose mobile mouth sit down mr ritter hewitt said in stern voice recent transaction with friend mr hunter be well known to mr dixon ritter who have at first leaned easily back in chair started forward at paled be surprised observe must be more careful in movement out of door if wish acquaintance to be known mr hunter believe have drawing mr dixon have lost if so be certain that have given to that know be theft for law provides severe penalty ritter broke down completely turned appealingly to mr dixon oh sir pleaded be so bad assure be tempted confess hid drawing be still in office can give to really can indeed hewitt went on then in case perhaps 'd better get at once just go fetch in wo trouble to observe hiding place will only keep door open to be sure lose way know down stair for instance wretched ritter with hanging head slunk into office opposite presently reappeared looking if possible ghastlier than before looked irresolutely down corridor a if meditating run for hewitt stepped toward motioned back to private room must try more of sort of humbug hewitt said with increased severity drawing be gone have stolen know well enough now attend to if received desert mr dixon must send for policeman moment have hauled off to jail be proper place unfortunately accomplice who call hunter who have other name besides that a happen to know have drawing be absolutely necessary that must be recovered be afraid that will be necessary therefore to come to arrangement with scoundrel to square in fact now just take pen paper write to confederate a dictate know alternative if cause difficulty ritter reached tremblingly for pen address in usual way hewitt proceeded say have be alteration in plan have got that have be alteration in plan will be alone here at six o'clock please come without fail ' have got very well sign address envelope must come here then may arrange matter in meantime will remain in inner office opposite note be written martin hewitt without glancing at address thrust into pocket when ritter be safely in inner office however drew out read address see observed us same name hunter little carton street westminster be address there will go at once with note if man come here think have better lock in with ritter send for policeman may at least frighten object be of course to get man away then if possible to invade house in way steal smash negative if be there to be found stay here in case till return forget to lock up tracing be about six o'clock when hewitt returned alone with smiling face that told of good fortune at first sight first mr dixon said a dropped into easy chair in private room let ease mind by information have be most extraordinarily lucky in fact think have further cause for anxiety here be negative be not quite dry when well what stole suppose must say so that have stuck together bit probably film be damaged mind that suppose laid small parcel wrapped in newspaper on table engineer hastily tore away paper took up five six glass photographic negative of half plate size be damp stuck together by gelatine film in couple held one after up to light of window glanced through then with great sigh of relief placed on hearth pounded to dust fragment with poker for few second neither spoke then dixon flinging into chair said mr hewitt ca express obligation to what must have happened if have failed prefer not to think of what will do with ritter now other man have be here yet by by fact be did deliver letter worthy gentleman saved world of trouble by taking out of way hewitt laughed be afraid have rather got into mess by trying two kind of theft at once may not be sorry to hear that attempt on torpedo plan be likely to bring dose of penal servitude for something else will tell have happened little carton street westminster found to be seedy sort of place one of old street have seen much better day good many people seem to live in house be fairly large house by way there be quite company of bell handle on doorpost down side like organ stop barber have possession of ground floor front of for trade purpose so to went 'can tell ' said 'where in house can find mr hunter looked doubtful so went on 'his friend will do know ca think of name foreign gentleman dark with bushy beard ' barber understood at once be mirsky expect said come to think of have have letter addressed to hunter once twice have took in top floor back be good so far have got at ber hunter ' other alias so by way of possessing with idea knew about determined to ask for a mirsky before handing over letter addressed to a hunter little bluff of sort be invaluable at right time at top floor back stopped at door tried to open at once be locked must hear somebody scuttling about within a though carrying thing about knocked again in little while door opened about foot there stood mr hunter mirsky a like man who in character of traveler in steam packing came here twice to day be in shirt sleeve cuddled something under arm hastily covered with spotted pocket handkerchief have called to see m mirsky said confidential letter yas yas ' answered hastily know know excuse one minute ' rushed off down stair with parcel here be noble chance for moment thought of following in case there might be something interesting in parcel have to decide in moment decided on trying room slipped inside door finding key on inside locked be confused sort of room with little iron bedstead in one corner sort of rough boarded inclosure in rightly conjectured to be photographic dark room made for at once there be plenty of light within when door be left open made at once for drying rack be fastened over sink there be number of negative in began hastily examining one after in middle of friend mirsky returned tried door rattled violently at handle pushed then called at moment have come upon first of negative have just smashed fixing washing have evidently only lately be completed negative be drying on rack seized of course others stood by 'who be there inside ' mirsky shouted indignantly from landing 'why for go in room like open door at once call police took notice have got full number of negative one for drawing be not by mean sure that have not taken extra set so went on hunting down rack there be more so set to work to turn out undeveloped plate be quite possible see that other set if existed have not yet be developed mirsky changed tune after little more banging shouting must hear kneel down try key hole have left key there so that must see nothing began talking softly rapidly through hole in foreign language did not know in least believe be russian what have led to believe understood russian must not at time imagine though have notion now went on ruining stock of plate found several box apparently of new plate a there be mean of telling whether be really unused be merely undeveloped with chemical impress of drawing on dragged one ruthlessly from hiding place laid out in full glare of sunlight destroying thereby of course whether be unused not mirsky left off talking heard quietly sneaking off perhaps conscience be not sufficiently clear to warrant appeal to police seemed to rather probable at time that be what be going for so hurried on with work found three dark slide part carried plate in back of camera know one of fixed in camera opened exposed plate to ruination a before suppose nobody ever did so much devastation in photographic studio in ten minute a managed have spoiled plate must find have developed negative safely in pocket when happened to glance at porcelain washing well under sink there be one negative in took up be not negative of drawing of yours of russian twenty ruble note be discovery only possible reason man must have for photographing bank note be manufacture of etched plate for production of forged copy be almost a pleased a have be at discovery of negative might bring police now a soon a liked must turn table on completely began to hunt about for anything else relating to negative found inking roller old piece of blanket used in printing from plate in corner on floor heaped over with newspaper rubbish small copying press there be also dish of acid not etched plate printed note to be seen be looking at press with negative in one hand inking roller in other when became conscious of shadow across window looked up quickly there be mirsky hanging over from ledge projection to side of window staring straight at with look of unmistakable terror apprehension face vanished immediately have to move table to get at window by time have opened there be sign sound of rightful tenant of room have doubt now of reason for carrying parcel down stair probably mistook for visitor be expecting knowing must take visitor into room threw paper rubbish over press put up plate paper in bundle secreted somewhere down stair lest occupation must be observed plainly duty now be to communicate with police so by help of friend barber down stair messenger be found note sent over to scotland yard awaited of course for arrival of police occupied interval in look round finding nothing important however when official detective arrived recognized at once importance of case large number of forged russian note have be put into circulation on continent lately seems be suspected that came from london russian government have be sending urgent message to police here on subject of course said nothing about business while be talking with scotland yard man letter be left by messenger addressed to mirsky letter will be examined of course by proper authority be not little interested to perceive that envelope bore russian imperial arm above word 'russian embassy now why must mirsky communicate with russian embassy certainly not to let official know that be carrying on very extensive lucrative business in manufacture of spurious russian note think be rather more than possible that wrote probably before actually got drawing to say that must sell information of highest importance that letter be reply further think quite possible that when asked for by russian name spoke of ' confidential letter at once concluded that have come from embassy in answer to letter must account for addressing in russian through key hole of course official from russian embassy must be very last person in world whom must like to observe indication of little etching experiment anyhow be that a may hewitt concluded drawing be safe now if once mirsky be caught think likely for man in shirt sleeve with scarcely start perhaps money about have great chance to get away if be caught say will probably get something handsome at st petersburg in way of imprisonment siberia what not so that will be amply avenged yes at understand business of drawing even now how in world be taken out of place how in world did find out nothing must be simpler yet plan be rather ingenious will tell exactly how thing revealed to from original description of case many people must consider that impossibility have be performed nobody have gone out nobody have come in yet drawing have be taken away impossibility be impossibility after a drawing run away of plainly somebody have taken unaccountable a might seem now a be in inner office only people who must have got at besides be assistant so that be pretty clear that one of at least have something to do with business told that worsfold be excellent intelligent draughtsman well if such man a meditated treachery must probably be able to carry away design in head at rate little at time must be under necessity to run risk of stealing set of drawing ritter remarked be inferior sort of man particularly smart ' think be word only mechanical sort of tracer must be unlikely to be able to carry in head complicated detail of such design a yours being in subordinate position continually overlooked must find impossible to make copy of plan in office so that to begin with thought saw most probable path to start on when looked round room pushed open glass door of barrier left door to inner office ajar in order to be able to see thing might happen in part of place without actually expecting definite development while be talking a happened friend mirsky hunter a please came into outer office attention be instantly called to by first thing did did notice anything peculiar really ca say did seemed to behave much a traveler agent might well what be fact that a soon a entered place put walking stick into umbrella stand over there by door close by where stood most unusual thing for casual caller to do before even knowing whether be in made watch closely perceived with increased interest that stick be exactly of same kind pattern a one already standing there also curious thing kept eye carefully on stick be more interested edified to see when left that took other stick not one came with from stand carried away leaving own behind might have followed decided that more must be learned by staying a in fact proved to be case by by be stick carried away with took liberty of fetching back from westminster because conceive to be ritier property hewitt produced stick be ordinary thick malacca cane with buck horn handle silver band hewitt bent across knee laid on table yes dixon answered be ritter stick think have often seen in stand what in world one moment will just fetch stick mirsky left behind hewitt stepped across corridor returned with stick apparently exact fac simile of other placed by side of other when assistant went into inner room carried stick off for minute two knew be not worsfold because there be umbrella there with initial on handle look at martin hewitt gave handle twist rapidly unscrewed from top then be seen that stick be mere tube of very thin metal painted to appear like malacca cane be plain at once that be malacca cane must bend inside found tracing rolled up tightly can get marvelous quantity of thin tracing paper into small compass by tight rolling be way be brought back engineer exclaimed see that clearly how did get away be a mysterious a ever not bit of see here mirsky get hold of ritter agree to get drawing photograph ritter be to let confederate have drawing mirsky be to bring back a soon a possible so that sha' be missed for moment ritter habitually carry malacca cane cunning of mirsky at once suggests that tube must be made in outward fac simile morning mirsky keep actual stick ritter come to office with tube seizes first opportunity probably when be in private room worsfold be talking to from corridor to get at tracing roll up tightly put in tube putting tube back into umbrella stand at past twelve whenever be mirsky turn up for first time with actual stick exchange just a afterward did when brought drawing back yes mirsky came hour after be oh yes see what fool be be forgetting of course when first missed tracing be in walking stick safe enough be tearing hair out within arm reach of precisely mirsky took away before very eye expect ritter be in rare funk when found that drawing be missed calculated doubt on not wanting for hour two must be out of office how lucky that struck to jot pencil note on one of might easily have made note somewhere else then must never have known that have be away yes did give too much time to miss well think rest pretty clear brought tracing in here screwed up sham stick put back identified tracing found none missing then course be pretty clear though looked difficult knew must be very naturally indignant with ritter so a wanted to manage told nothing of what have actually done for fear that in agitated state might burst out with something must spoil game to ritter pretended to know nothing of return of drawing how have be stolen only thing did know with certainty did pretend to know about mirsky hunter when a matter of fact knew nothing at except that probably went under more than one name put ritter into hand completely when found game be up began with lying confession believing that tracing be still in stick that knew nothing of return said that have not be away that must fetch a have expected must let go for alone when returned utterly broken up by discovery that be not there have altogether at mercy see if have known that drawing be time behind book case might have brazened out sworn that drawing have be there time must have done nothing with must have sufficiently frightened by threat of prosecution for theft because there thing be in possession to knowledge a be answered helm capitally gave mirsky address on envelope wrote letter be to have got out of way while committed burglary if disgraceful expedient have not be rendered unnecessary on whole case have gone very well have gone marvelously well thanks to yourself what will do with ritter here be stick knock down stair with if like must keep tube if be a memento suppose respectable mirsky will ever call to ask for must certainly kick ritter out of door out of window if like without delay mirsky be caught after two remand at police court be extradited on charge of forging russian note came out that have written to embassy a hewitt have surmised stating that have certain valuable information to offer letter hewitt have seen delivered be acknowledgment request for more definite particular be what gave rise to impression that mirsky have informed russian authority of forgery real intent be very different be never guessed wonder hewitt have once twice observed whether after must not have paid russian authority better on whole if have never investigated mirsky little note factory dixon torpedo be worth good many twenty ruble note v quinton jewel affair be comparatively rarely that hewitt came into contact with member of regular criminal class mean who be thief of one sort by exclusive profession still nobody must have be better prepared than hewitt for encountering class when became necessary by mean never quite understood managed to keep abreast of very latest fashion in ever changing slang dialect of fraternity be perfect master of more modern debased form of romany so much so frequently gypsy who began a always do by pretending that understood nothing never heard of gypsy language ended by confessing that hewitt must rokker better than most romany chals by acquaintance with habit talk hewitt be sometimes able to render efficient service in case of especial importance in quinton jewel affair hewitt came into contact with very accomplished thief case will probably be very well remembered sir valentine quinton before married have be a poor a only man of rank with old country establishment to keep up can be marriage however with daughter of wealthy financier have changed now quinton establishment be carried on on a lavish scale a might be indeed extravagant habit of lady quinton rendered extremely lucky thing that have brought fortune with among other thing jewel made quite collection chief among be great ruby one of very few that be sent to country to be sold at average price of somewhere about twenty thousand pound apiece believe by burmese king before annexation of country let ruby be of great size color equally fine diamond can approach value well great ruby be set in pendant by by together with necklace brooch bracelet ear ring indeed greater part of lady quinton collection be stolen robbery be effected at usual time in usual way in case of carefully planned jewelry robbery time be early evening dinner time in fact entrance have be made by window to lady quinton dressing room door screwed up on inside wire artfully stretched about ground below to overset anybody who might observe pursue thief on investigation by london detective however feature of singularity be brought to light there have plainly be only one thief at work at radcot hall other have be inside ground alone have planted wire opened window screwed door picked lock of safe clearly be thief of most accomplished description few day passed although police have made various arrest appeared to be mistake suspected person be released one after be talking of robbery with hewitt at lunch asked if have received commission to hunt for missing jewel hewitt replied have be commissioned be offering immense reward however very pleasant sum indeed have have short note from radcot hall informing of amount be probably fancy may take case up a speculation be great mistake be not beginner must be commissioned in regular manner hit miss if be to deal with case have quite enough commission going now time to waste hunting for problematical reward be nearer clue to quinton jewel than then supposed talked of other thing presently rose left restaurant strolling quietly toward home little distance from strand near own door passed excited

suspect leamy of having taken from bag then who be mr w whose portrait have in possession see here hewitt turned over small pile of recent newspaper selected one pointing at particular paragraph kept that in mind because to seemed to be most likely arrest of lot said be evening paper of previous thursday paragraph be very short one thus man wilks who be arrested at euston station yesterday in connection with robbery of lady quinton jewel have be released nothing being found to incriminate how doe that strike asked hewitt wilks be man well known to police one of most accomplished burglar in country in fact have have dealing with a yet found mean time ago to add portrait to little collection in case might want to day have be quite useful thing be plain now wilks must have be bringing booty to town calculated on getting out at chalk farm thus eluding watch doubtless felt pretty sure must be kept by telegraphic instruction at euston for suspicious character arriving from direction of radcot transaction with leamy be only possible expedient to save from being hopelessly taken with swag in possession paragraph told why leamy have waited in vain for mr w in cab what will do now asked will go to gold street house find out what can a soon a cab turn up there seemed possibility of excitement in adventure so asked will want help hewitt smiled think can get through alone said then may come to look on said of course want to be in way result of business whatever be will be to credit alone be curious come then by mean cab will be four wheeler there will be plenty of room gold street be short street of private house of very fair size of half vanished pretension to gentility drove slowly through leamy have difficulty in pointing out house wherein have be paid five pound for carrying bag at end cab turned corner stopped while hewitt wrote short note to official of scotland yard take note instructed leamy to scotland yard in cab then go home will pay cabman now will sor ' will be protected oh yes stay at home for rest of day expect will be left alone in future perhaps will have something to tell in day two if do will send good by cab rolled off hewitt strolled back along gold street think hewitt said will drop in on mr hollams for few minute while can in few hour expect police will have house too if attend promptly to note have ever seen not to knowledge though may know by other name wilks know by sight though doe know what will say will depend on circumstance may not get cue till door open even till later at worst can easily apply for reference a to leamy who remember be looking for work be destined not to make mr hollams acquaintance after a approached house great uproar be heard from lower part giving on to area suddenly man hatless with sleeve of coat nearly torn away burst through door up area step pursued by two others have barely time to observe one of pursuer carried revolver that hesitated retired on seeing that several people be about street when hewitt gripping arm exclaiming be man started at run after fugitive turned next corner saw man thirty yard before walking pulling up sleeve at shoulder so a to conceal rent plainly felt safe from further molestation be sim wilks hewitt explained a followed 'juce of foine jintleman ' who got leamy to carry bag man who know where quinton ruby be unless be more than usually mistaken stare after in case look round presently when get into busier street will have little chat with for time man kept to back street in time however emerged into buckingham palace road saw stop look at hat shop after general look over window glance in at door went on good sign observed hewitt got money with make easier for in little while wilks approached small crowd gathered about woman fiddler

taking money be blowed if remember who be pal hewitt jerked hand in direction winked said in low voice be all right having rest ca stand manchester winked again wilks laughed nodded understood from that hewitt have very flatteringly given credit for being wanted by manchester police lurched into public house drank very little very bad whisky water wilks still regarded curiously must see again again glancing doubtfully in hewitt face loan of three pound have largely reassured presently hewitt said how about old pal down in gold street do anything with now seen lately wilks looked up at ceiling shook head be good job 'ud be awkward if be about there to day can tell why never mind so long a be not there know something if have be away be glad have have truck with gold street lately be d'you mean reeler be on hewitt looked cautiously over shoulder leaned toward wilks said look here be straight tip know got from very narka that be given show away by six o'clock gold street will be turned inside out like old glove everyone in place will be finished sentence by crossing wrist like handcuffed man what be more went on know about what be gone on there lately everybody be be in out for last two moonsb will be wanted particular will be found be told hewitt concluded with confidential frown nod wink took mouthful of whisky then added a after thought so be glad have be there lately footnote police spy footnote b month wilks looked in hewitt face asked be that straight be replied hewitt with emphasis go have look if ai afraid of being smugged only sha go near just yet know that wilks fidgeted finished drink expressed intention of going very well if wo have replied hewitt have gone good said hewitt moving toward door have suddenly developed hurry will keep in sight have better take cab go straight to euston take ticket to nearest station to radcot kedderby think be look up train arrangement show too much keep eye on entrance unless be mistaken wilks will be there pretty soon will be on heel if be wrong then wo see end of fun be hewitt hurried after wilks took cab did a wished there be hour few minute found to wait for next train that time occupied a best might keeping sharp lookout across quadrangle barely five minute before train be to leave just a be beginning to think about time of next cab dashed up hewitt alighted hurried in found drew aside into recess just a cab arrived here be hewitt said followed a far a euston road then got cabby to spurt up pas have have mustache shaved off feared might recognize so let see from retreat must see wilks hurry into booking office watched through to platform followed wasted time made best of way to third class carriage at extreme fore end of train have three minute hewitt said everything depends on not seeing get into train take cap fortunately be in tweed suit have bought couple of tweed cricket cap assumed sending bowler hat to cloak room hewitt also put on pair of blue spectacle then walked boldly up platform entered first class carriage followed close on heel in such manner that person looking from fore end of train must be able to see very little of so far so good said hewitt when be seated train began to move off must keep lookout at station in case friend go off unexpectedly waited time said where did go to first went bought that hat be wearing then walked distance dodging main thoroughfare keeping to back street in way that made following difficult till came to little tailor shop there entered came out in quarter of hour with coat mended be in street in westminster presently worked way up to tothill street there plunged into barber shop took cautious peep at window saw two three other customer also waiting took opportunity to rush over to 'notion shop buy blue spectacle to hatter for cap of regret to observe yours be too big be rather long while in barber finally came out a saw with mustache be good indication made plainer than ever that have believed warning a to police descent on house in gold street frequenter be right proper for what told be quite true rest know cabbed to station so did now perhaps said after giving character of thief wanted by manchester police forcibly depriving of hat in exchange for too large cap rushing off out of london without definite idea of when be coming back perhaps will tell what be after hewitt laughed wanted to join in know said must take luck a come a matter of fact there be scarcely anything in profession so uninteresting so difficult a watching following business often last for week when alight will have to follow wilks again under most difficult possible condition in country there be often quite impossible to follow man unobserved be only because be only way that be undertaking now a to what be after know that a well a quinton ruby wilks have hidden without help must be impossible to find be following so that will find for must have hidden suppose to avoid sharing with hollams of course availed of fact of leamy having carried bag to direct hollams suspicion to hollams found out by repeated search of leamy lodging that be wrong morning evidently tried to persuade ruby out of wilks possession with revolver saw upshot of kedderby station be about forty mile out at intermediate stopping station hewitt watched earnestly wilks remained in train what fear hewitt observed be at kedderby may take fly to stalk man on foot in country be difficult enough ca follow one vehicle in without being spotted if be so smart a think wo do man traveling in fly be noticed remembered in place did not take fly at kedderby saw jump out quickly hasten from station train stood for few minute be out of station before alighted through railing behind platform must see walking briskly away to right from ticket collector ascertained that radcot lay in direction three mile off to dying day will never forget three mile seemed three hundred in still country almost footfall seemed audible for distance in long stretch of road one must see mile behind before hewitt be cool patient got into fever of worry excitement want of breath back ache at first for little road zig zagged then chase be comparatively easy waited behind one bend till wilks have passed next then hurried in trail treading in dustiest part of road on side grass when there be to deaden sound of step at last of short bend looked ahead saw long white stretch of road with dark form of wilks couple of hundred yard in front must never do to let get to end of great stretch before following a might turn off at branch road out of sight be lost so jumped hedge scuttled along a best might on other side with back bent foot often many inch deep in wet clay have to make continual stoppage to listen peep out on one occasion happening incautiously to stand erect looking after be much startled to see wilks with face toward gazing down road ducked like lightning fortunately seemed not to have observed went on a before have probably heard slight noise looked straight along road for explanation instead of over hedge at hilly part of road there be extreme difficulty indeed on approaching rise be usually necessary to lie down under hedge till wilks have passed top since from higher ground must have seen easily improved clothes comfort temper luckily never encountered difficulty of long high wall once be nearly betrayed by man who shouted to order off field at last saw just ahead square tower of old church set about with thick tree opposite wilks paused looked irresolutely up down road then went on crossed road availed ourselves of opposite hedge followed village be to be seen three four hundred yard farther along road toward wilks sauntered slowly before actually reached house stopped turned back churchyard exclaimed hewitt under breath lie close let pas wilks reached churchyard gate again looked irresolutely about at moment party of child who have be playing among graf came chattering laughing toward out of gate wilks walked hastily away again time in opposite direction be place clearly hewitt said must slip across quietly a soon a be far enough down road now hurried stealthily across through gate into churchyard where hewitt threw blue spectacle away be now nearly eight in evening sun be setting once again wilks approached gate did not enter because laborer passed at time then came back slipped through grass about graf be long under tree be already twilight hewitt two three yard apart to avoid falling over one in case of sudden movement watched from behind gravestone form of wilks stood out large black against fading light in west a stealthily approached through long grass light cart came clattering along road wilks dropped at once crouched on knee till have passed then staring warily about made straight for stone behind hewitt waited saw hewitt dark form swing noiselessly round to other side of stone wilks passed on dropped on knee beside large weather worn slab rested on brick under structure foot so high long grass largely hid brick among wilks plunged hand feeling along brick surface presently drew out loose brick laid on slab felt again in place brought forth small dark object saw hewitt rise erect in gathering dusk with extended arm step noiselessly toward stooping man wilks made motion to place dark object in pocket checked opened what appeared to be lid a though to make sure of safety of content last light straggling under tree fell on brilliantly sparkling object within like flash hewitt hand shot over wilks shoulder snatched jewel man actually screamed one of curious sharp little scream that one may hear from woman very suddenly alarmed sprang at hewitt like cat only to meet straight drive of fist that stretched on back across slab sprang from behind stone helped hewitt to secure wrist with pocket handkerchief then marched struggling swearing to village when in light of village recognized have perfect fit of rage afterward calmed down admitted that be very clean cop there be difficulty in finding village constable sir valentine quinton be dining out did not arrive for at least hour in interval wilks grew communicative how much d think will get asked ca guess hewitt replied a will probably have to give evidence will be giving away if talk too much oh care that will make difference be fair cop be in for got at nicely lending three quid never knew reeler do before blinded be kid about gold street be mr hollams be safely shut up by time expect be avenged for little trouble with afternoon what did know about well have got up nicely for must say s'pose have be following time well yes have be far off guessed 'd want to clear out of town if hollams be taken knew hewitt tapped breast pocket be what 'd take care to get hold of first hid of course because knew that hollams must probably have searched for if got suspicious yes did too two bloke went over pocket one night somebody got into room expected that hollams be such greedy pig once be got under thumb give half making if kick will have smugged so be going to give that if must help s'pose ai good asking how got put on to mob said hewitt be did get back till next day staying for night despite inconvenient want of requisite at hall there be in fact late train told sir valentine story of irishman much to amusement leamy tale sounded unlikely of course hewitt said be noticeable that one of misfortune pointed in same direction that certain person be tremendously anxious to get at something supposed have when spoke of adventure with bag at once remembered wilks arrest subsequent release be curious coincidence to say least that must happen at very station to proceeds of robbery must come if came to london at on day following robbery kedderby be one of few station on line where train must stop after time of robbery so that thief must have to wait till next day to get back leamy recognition of wilks portrait made feel pretty certain plainly have carried stolen property poor innocent fellow conversation with hollams showed that a in fact did sum five pound paid to by way of begulars customary toll from plunder of service of carriage hollams obviously took leamy for criminal friend of wilks because of use of thief expression beparks begulars suggested in term leamy misunderstood that must sell plunder might obtain to altogether must have be very curious if plunder be not that from radcot hall especially a other robbery have be reported at time now among jewel taken only one be of very pre eminent value famous ruby be scarcely likely that hollams must go to so much trouble risk attempting to drug injuring waylaying burgling room of unfortunate leamy for jewel of small value for jewel in fact ruby so felt pretty strong presumption at event that be ruby hollams be after leamy have not have be convinced from tale manner from what judged of man only other person be wilks certainly have temptation to keep to avoid if possible sharing with london director principal while carriage of bag by irishman gave capital opportunity to put suspicion on with result seen most daring of hollams attack on leamy be doubtless attempted maiming killing at railway station so a to be able in character of medical man to search pocket be probably desperate at time having have doubt be following leamy about day at crystal palace without finding opportunity to get at pocket struggle flight of wilks from hollams confirmed previous impression hollams finally satisfied that very morning that leamy certainly have not jewel on person at lodging knowing from having so closely watched that have be nowhere where must be disposed of concluded that wilks be cheating attempted to extort ruby from by aid of ruffian pistol rest of way be plain wilks knew must seize opportunity of hollams being safely locked up to get at dispose of ruby supplied with fund left to lead to hiding place did think be must have walked straight away from house to churchyard sir valentine remarked to hide pendant be fairly cool only cool hand must carry out such robbery single handed hewitt answered expect tool be in bag leamy carried a well a jewel must have be small neat set be ascertained on return to town next day that bag with content intact including tool have be taken by police at surprise visit to gold street a well a much other stolen property hollams wilks got very wholesome dos of penal servitude to intense delight of mick leamy leamy by by be still to be seen clad in noble uniform guarding door of well known london restaurant have not have more five pound note for carrying bag know london too well now to expect vi stanway cameo mystery be now fair number of year back since loss of famous stanway cameo made sensation only person who have least interest in keeping real fact of case secret have now be dead for time leaving relative other representative therefore harm will be done in making inner history of case public on contrary will afford opportunity of vindicating professional reputation of hewitt who be supposed to have completely failed to make anything of mystery surrounding case at present time connoisseur in ancient object of art be often heard regretfully to wonder whether wonderful cameo so suddenly discovered so quickly stolen will ever again be visible to public eye now question need be asked no longer cameo a may be remembered from many description published at time be said to be absolutely finest extant be sardonyx of three stratum one of rare sardonyx cameo in have be possible for artist to avail of three different color of superimposed stone lowest for ground two others for middle high relief of design in size be for cameo immense measuring seven half inch by nearly six in subject be similar to renowned gonzaga cameo now property of czar of russia male female head with imperial insignia in case supposed to represent tiberius claudius messalina expert considered probably to be work of athenion famous gem cutter of first christian century whose most notable other work now extant be smaller cameo with mythological subject preserved in vatican stanway cameo have be discovered in obscure italian village by one of traveling agent who scour europe for valuable antiquity object of art man have hurried immediately to london with prize sold to mr claridge of st james street eminent a dealer in such object mr claridge recognizing importance value of article lost opportunity of making existence known very soon claudius cameo a be at first usually called be a famous a in world many expert in ancient art examined several large bid be made for purchase in end be bought by marquis of stanway for five thousand pound for purpose of presentation to british museum marquis kept cameo at town house for few day showing to friend then returned to mr claridge to be finally carefully cleaned before passing into national collection two night after mr claridge premise be broken into cameo stolen such in outline be generally known history of stanway cameo circumstance of burglary in detail be mr claridge have be last to leave premise at about eight in evening at dusk have locked small side door a usual assistant mr cutler have left hour half earlier when mr claridge left everything be in order policeman on fixed point duty just opposite who bade mr claridge good evening a left saw nothing suspicious during rest of term of duty did successor at point throughout night in morning however mr cutler assistant who arrived first soon after nine o'clock at once perceived that something unlooked for have happened door of have key be still fastened have not be touched in room behind shop mr claridge private desk have be broken open content turned out in confusion door leading on to staircase have also be forced proceeding up stair mr cutler found door open leading from top landing to small room door have be opened by simple expedient of unscrewing taking off lock have be on inside in ceiling of room be trap door be six eight inch open edge resting on half wrenched off bolt have be torn away when trap be levered open from outside plainly then be path of thief thief entrance have be made through trap door two more door have be opened then desk have be ransacked mr cutler afterward explained that at time have precise idea what have be stolen did not know where cameo have be left on previous evening mr claridge have undertaken cleaning have be engaged on assistant said when left there be doubt however after mr claridge arrival at ten o'clock cameo be gone mr claridge utterly confounded at loss explained incoherently with curse on own carelessness that have locked precious article in desk on relinquishing work on previous evening feeling rather tired not taking trouble to carry a far a safe in part of house police be sent for at once of course investigation made mr claridge offering reward of five hundred pound for recovery of cameo affair be scribbled off at large in earliest edition of evening paper by noon world be aware of extraordinary theft of stanway cameo many people be discussing probability of case with very indistinct idea of what sardonyx cameo precisely be be in afternoon of day that lord stanway called on martin hewitt marquis be tall upstanding man of spare figure active habit well known a member of learned society great patron of art hurried into hewitt private room a soon a name have be announced a soon a hewitt have given chair plunged into business probably already guess business with mr hewitt have seen early evening paper just so then need tell again what already know cameo be gone badly want back of course police be hard at work at claridge be not quite satisfied have be there for two three hour ca see that know more about than do then of course police naturally properly enough from point of view look first to find criminal regarding recovery of property almost a secondary consideration now from point of view chief consideration be property of course want thief caught if possible properly punished still more want cameo certainly be considerable loss five thousand pound ah misunderstand be monetary value of thing regret a matter of fact be indemnified for already claridge have behaved most honorably more than honorably indeed first intimation have of loss be check from for five thousand pound with letter assuring that restoration to of amount have paid be least must do to repair result of what called unpardonable carelessness legally be not sure must demand anything of unless must prove very flagrant neglect indeed to guard against theft then take lord stanway hewitt observed that much prefer cameo to money certainly else must never have be willing to pay money for cameo be enormous price perhaps much above market value even for such valuable thing be particularly anxious that must not go out of country public collection here be not so fortunate a must be in possession of very finest example of class of work in short have determined on cameo fortunately happen to be able to carry out determination of sort without regarding extra thousand pound so a obstacle so that see what want be not value thing indeed think can possibly keep money claridge have sent affair be more misfortune than fault will say nothing about returning for little while may possibly have effect of sharpening everybody in search just so do understand that must like to look into case independently on behalf exactly want if can to approach matter entirely from point of view sole object being to find cameo of course if happen on thief a well so much better perhaps after looking for one be same thing a looking for other not always usually be course even if be not together certainly have be at one time to have one be very long step toward having other now to begin with be anybody suspected well police be reserved believe fact be have nothing to say claridge wo admit that suspect one though belief that whoever be must have watched yesterday evening through back window of room must have seen put cameo away in desk because thief must seem to have gone straight to place half fancy that in inner mind be inclined to suspect one of two people see robbery of sort be different from others that cameo must never be stolen imagine with view of being sold be much too famous thing man might a well walk about offering to sell tower of london there be only very few people who buy such thing one of know about dealer must touch must never even show much le sell without being called to account so that really seems more likely that have be taken by somebody who wish to keep for mere love of thing collector in fact who must then have to keep secretly at home never let soul besides see living in consciousness at death must be found theft known unless indeed ordinary vulgar burglar have taken without knowing value be likely hewitt replied ordinary burglar ignorant of value must have gone straight to cameo have taken in preference to many other thing of more apparent worth must be lying near in such place a claridge true suppose must although police seem to think that breaking in be clearly work of regular criminal from jimmy mark know so on well what of two people think mr claridge suspect of course ca say that doe suspect only fancied from tone that might be possible insists that ca in justice suspect anybody one of men be traveling agent who sold cameo man character doe not appear to be absolutely irreproachable dealer trust very far of course claridge doe say what paid for cameo dealer be very reticent about profit believe be a often something like five hundred per cent a not seems hahn bargained to have something extra depending on amount claridge must sell carving for according to appointment must have turned up morning have be seen nobody seems to know exactly where be yes other person well scarcely like mentioning because be certainly gentleman believe in ordinary way quite incapable of anything in least degree dishonorable although of course say collector have conscience in matter of own particular hobby certainly mr wollett be a keen collector a man alive life in chamber in next turning past claridge premise can in fact look into claridge back window if like examined cameo several time before bought made several high offer appeared in fact very anxious indeed to get after have bought made understand rather strong remark about people like bepoiling market by paying extravagant price altogether cut up 'crusty a say at losing specimen lord stanway paused few second then went on be not sure ought to mention mr woollett name for moment in connection with matter be personally perfectly certain that be a incapable of anything like theft a be telling know precisely ca know too much in case like can do harm if know about fifty innocent people may save from risk of knowing nothing about thief now let see mr wollett room say be near mr claridge place of business be there mean of communication between roof yes be told that be perfectly possible to get from one place to other by walking along lead very good then unless can think of other information may help think lord stanway will go at once look at place do by mean think will come back with somehow like to feel idle in matter though suppose ca do much a to more information think there be in regard to mr claridge assistant now do know anything of only that have always seemed very civil decent sort of man honest must say claridge must have kept so many year there be good many valuable thing about at claridge besides man have key of place even if be thief must need to go breaking in through roof so said hewitt have directly connected with cameo besides people mr claridge dealer mr cutler assistant in mr claridge business hahn who sold article to claridge mr woollett who made bid for be know of other gentleman made bid believe know take people in order mr claridge be out of question a dealer with reputation to keep up must be even if have immediately sent five thousand pound more than market value understand of cameo assistant be reputable man against whom nothing be known who must never need to break in who must understand business well enough to know that must never attempt to sell missing stone without instant detection hahn be man of shady antecedent probably clever enough to know a well a anybody how to dispose of such plunder if be possible to dispose of at also hahn have be to claridge to day although have appointment to take money lastly mr woollett be gentleman of most honorable record perfectly rabid collector who have made effort to secure cameo before bought who moreover must have seen mr claridge working in back room who have perfectly easy access to mr claridge roof if find ca be none of then must look where circumstance indicate there be unwonted excitement at mr claridge place when hewitt client arrived be dull old building in window there be never more show than odd blue china vase two mayhap few old silver shoe buckle curious small sword nine men out of ten must have passed without glance tenth at least must probably know for place famous through world for number value of old curious object of art have passed through on day two three loiterer having heard of robbery extracted what gratification might from staring at nothing between railing guarding window within mr claridge brisk stout little old man be talking earnestly to burly police inspector in uniform mr cutler who have seized opportunity to attempt amateur detective work on own account be groveling perseveringly about floor among old porcelain loose piece of armor in futile hope of finding clue that thief might have considerately dropped mr claridge came forward eagerly leather case have be found be pleased to be able to tell lord stanway since left empty of course unfortunately yes have evidently be thrown away by thief behind chimney stack roof two away where police have found be clue of course ah then gentleman will give opinion of lord stanway said turning to hewitt mr claridge be mr martin hewitt who have be kind enough to come with here at moment notice with police on one hand mr hewitt on other will certainly recover that cameo if be to be recovered think mr claridge bowed beamed on hewitt through spectacle be very glad mr hewitt have come said indeed have already decided to give police till time to morrow then if have found nothing to call in mr hewitt hewitt bowed in turn then asked will let see various breakage hope have not be disturbed nothing have be disturbed do exactly a seems best need scarcely say that everything here be perfectly at disposal know circumstance of course in general yes suppose be right in belief that have resident housekeeper claridge replied have have one housekeeper who sometimes pawned property in evening then who used to break most valuable china till must never sleep take moment ease at home for fear stock be being ruined here so gave up resident housekeeper felt confidence in doing because of policeman who be always on duty opposite can see broken desk mr claridge led way into room behind shop desk be really sort of work table with lifting top lock top have be forced roughly open by instrument have be pushed in below used a lever so that catch of lock be torn away hewitt examined damaged part mark of lever then looked out at back window there be several window about here remarked from might be possible to see into room do know of people who live behind two three know mr claridge answered there be two window pair almost immediately before belonging to room office be to let stranger might get in there watch do roof above of window communicate in way with yours none of directly opposite at left do may walk way along lead whose window be mr claridge hesitated well said be mr woollett excellent customer of mine be gentleman well really think be absurd to suspect in case like hewitt answered one must disregard nothing impossible somebody whether mr woollett person must possibly have seen into room from window equally possibly must have reached room from one therefore must not forget mr woollett have of neighbor be burgled during night mean that stranger anxious to get at trap door must probably have to begin by getting into other house close by so a to reach roof mr claridge replied there have be nothing of sort be first thing police ascertained hewitt examined broken door then made way up stair with others unscrewed lock of door of top back room required little examination in room below trap door be dusty table on stood chair at other side of table sat detective inspector plummer whom hewitt knew very well who bade good day then went on with docket chair table be found a be now take hewitt asked yes said mr claridge thief must think dropped in through trap door after breaking open have to place chair where be to be able to climb back hewitt scrambled up through trap way examined from top door be hung on long external barn door hinge have be forced open in similar manner to practiced on desk jimmy have be pushed between frame door near bolt door have be pried open bolt being torn away from screw in operation presently inspector plummer having finished docket climbed up to roof after hewitt two together went to spot close under chimney stack on next roof one where case have be found plummer produced case have in coat tail pocket for hewitt inspection see anything particular about do said show way went though being found just here well yes hewitt said if kept on in direction must be going toward mr woollett house trap door must inspector pursed lip smiled shrugged shoulder of course have waited till now to find out said of course a say did think there be much to be learned from leather case be almost new there be mark on hewitt handed back to inspector well said plummer a returned case to pocket what be opinion be rather awkward case yes be between mind telling be having sharp lookout kept over there plummer jerked head in direction of mr woollett chamber because robbery unusual one there be only two possible motif sale of cameo keeping of sale out of question a know thing only salable to who must collar thief at once who must have thing in place now for anything so that must be taken to keep be thing nobody maddest of collector must do just such person a inspector nodded again toward mr woollett quarter take that with other circumstance added think will agree be worth while looking little farther way of course of work taking off lock so on look rather like regular burglar be just possible that one badly wanting cameo must like to hire man who be up to work yes be possible do know anything of hahn agent plummer asked moment later have found yet have yet be after have found be at charing cross day two ago booking ticket for continent failing to turn up to day seem to make while not to miss if can help be sort of man let chance of drawing bit of money go for nothing returned to room well said lord stanway what be result of consultation have be waiting here very patiently while two clever men have be discussing matter on roof on wall just beneath trap door very dusty old tall hat hung on peg hewitt took down examined very closely smearing finger with dust from inside lining be one of valuable crusted old antique asked with smile of mr claridge be only old hat used to keep here for use in bad weather mr claridge said with surprise at question have touched for year more oh then must have be left here by last night visitor hewitt replied carelessly replacing on hook left here at eight last night think eight exactly within minute two just so think will look at room on opposite side of landing if will let certainly if 'd like to claridge replied have be there be exactly a be left only lumber room see concluded flinging door open number of partly broken up packing case littered about room with much other rubbish hewitt took lid of one of newest looking packing case glanced at address label then turned to rusty old iron box stood against wall must like to see behind said tugging at with hand be heavy dirty be there small crowbar about house similar lever mr claridge shook head have such thing in place said never mind hewitt replied time will do to shift old box perhaps after there be little reason for moving will just walk round to police station think speak to constable who be on duty opposite during night think lord stanway have seen be necessary here suppose asked mr claridge be too soon yet to ask if have formed theory in matter well yes be hewitt answered perhaps may be able to surprise in hour two that promise by by added suddenly suppose be sure trap door be bolted last night certainly mr claridge answered smiling else how must bolt have be broken a matter of fact believe trap have be opened for month mr cutler do remember when trap door be last opened mr cutler shook head certainly not for six month said ah very well be not very important hewitt replied a reached front shop fiery faced old gentleman bounced in at street door stumbling over umbrella stood in dark corner kicking three yard away what deuce do mean roared at mr claridge by sending police people smelling about room asking question of servant what do mean sir by treating a thief ca gentleman come into place to look at article without being suspected of stealing when disappears through wretched carelessness will ask solicitor sir if there be remedy for sort of thing if catch of spy fellow on staircase crawling about roof will will shoot really mr woollett began mr claridge somewhat abashed angry old man must hear nothing talk to sir will talk to solicitor be to understand lord turning to lord stanway that thing be being done with approval be being done lord stanway answered be being done by police on own responsibility entirely without prompting believe by mr claridge certainly without suggestion of sort from think that personal opinion of mr claridge certainly own be that anything like suspicion of position in wretched matter be ridiculous if will only consider matter calmly consider calmly imagine considering such thing calmly lord stanway wo consider calmly will will wo have if find man on roof will pitch off mr woollett bounced into street again mr woollett be annoyed hewitt observed with smile be afraid plummer have clumsy assistant somewhere mr claridge said nothing looked rather glum for mr woollett be most excellent customer lord stanwood hewitt walked slowly down street hewitt staring at pavement in profound thought once twice lord stanway glanced at face refrained from disturbing presently however observed seem at least mr hewitt to have noticed something have set thinking doe look like clue hewitt came out of cogitation at once clue said case bristle with clue extraordinary thing to be that plummer usually smart man doe seem to have seen one of must be out of sort be afraid case be decidedly most remarkable one remarkable in what particular way in regard to motive now must seem a plummer be saying to just now on roof that there be only two possible motif for robbery man who took trouble risk to break into claridge place must have desired to sell cameo at good price must have desired to keep for being lover of such thing of have be actual motive perhaps think can extort good sum from by way of ransom be that be jealousy spite anything of kind know motive think wish must get hold of hahn will shut up alone turn over in mind for hour presently meanwhile what want to know be apart from professional subtlety confess ca understand can get back cameo said hewitt stopping at corner of street be rather afraid can not anybody else be pretty sure know thief then surely that will lead to cameo may of course then be just possible that by evening may not want to have back after lord stanway stared in amazement not want to have back exclaimed why of course will want to have back understand in least talk in conundrum who be thief speak of think lord stanway hewitt said that perhaps have better not say until have quite finished inquiry in case of mistake case be quite extraordinary one of quite different character from what one must at first naturally imagine must be very careful to guard against possibility of error have very little fear of mistake however hope may wait on in few hour at piccadilly with news have only to see policeman certainly come whenever please why see policeman have already most positively stated that saw nothing whatever suspicious in house near will not ask anything at about house hewitt responded will just have little chat with about weather with smiling bow turned away while lord stanway stood gazed after with expression implied suspicion that special detective be making fool of in rather more than hour hewitt be back in mr claridge shop mr claridge said think must ask one two question in private may see in own room went there at once hewitt pulling chair before window sat down with back to light dealer shut door sat opposite with light full in face mr claridge hewitt proceeded slowly when did first find that lord stanway cameo be forgery claridge literally bounced in chair face paled managed to stammer sharply what what what d'you mean forgery do mean to say sell forgery forgery be forgery then continued hewitt in same deliberate tone watching other face while if be forgery why did destroy burst trap door desk to imitate burglary sweat stood thick on dealer face gasped struggled hard to keep faculty together ejaculated hoarsely destroy what what did did destroy threw into river then prevaricate about detail be lie who say that go away be insulting claridge almost screamed come come mr claridge hewitt said more placably for have gained point distress attempt to deceive ca assure know everything did before left here last night everything claridge face worked painfully once twice appeared to be on point of returning indignant reply hesitated finally broke down altogether expose mr hewitt pleaded beg wo expose have harmed soul have paid lord stanway penny back never knew thing be forgery till began to clean be old man mr hewitt professional reputation have be spotless until now beg wo expose be voice softened make unnecessary trouble of said see decanter on sideboard let give little brandy water come there be nothing criminal believe in man breaking open own desk own trap door for matter of course be acting for lord stanway in affair must in duty report to without reserve lord stanway be gentleman will undertake will hing inconsiderate of feeling if be disposed to be frank let talk affair over tell about be that swindler hahn who deceived in beginning claridge said have never made mistake with cameo before never thought so close imitation be possible examined most carefully be perfectly satisfied many expert examined afterward be equally deceived felt a sure a possibly must feel that have bought one of finest if not actually finest cameo known to exist be not until after have come back from lord stanway be cleaning evening before last that in course of work became apparent that thing be nothing consummately clever forgery be made of three layer of molded glass nothing more le glass be treated in way have never before known of surface have be cunningly worked on till defied ordinary examination of glass imitation cameo made in latter part of last century may tell be regarded a marvelous piece of work indeed command very fair price be something quite beyond of be amazed horrified put thing away went home night lay awake in state of distraction quite unable to decide what to do to let cameo go out of possession be impossible sooner later forgery must be discovered reputation highest in matter in country may safely claim growth of nearly fifty year of honest application good judgment reputation must be gone forever without considering there be fact have taken five thousand pound of lord stanway money for mere piece of glass money must in mere common honesty a well a for own sake return how name of stanway cameo have become household word to confess that whole thing be sham must ruin reputation destroy confidence past present future in in transaction way spelled ruin even if confided in lord stanway privately returned money destroyed cameo what then sudden disappearance of article so famous must excite remark at once have be presented to british museum if never appeared in collection news be to be got of people must guess at truth at once to make known that have be deceived must have availed nothing be business not to be deceived to have known that most expensive specimen might be forgery must equally mean ruin whether sold cunningly a rogue ignorantly a fool indeed pride reputation a connoisseur be thing near to heart must be unspeakable humiliation to to have known have be imposed on by such forgery what must do expedient seemed useless one one adopted be not straightforward admit oh mr hewitt consider temptation remember that must do soul harm matter who might be suspected knew there must not possibly be evidence to make suffer next day yesterday be anxiously worrying out thing in mind carefully devising trick be afraid will call that by extraordinary mean have seen through seemed only thing what else be there more need tell know have only now to beg that will use best influence with lord stanway to save from public derision exposure will do anything pay anything anything exposure at age with position well see hewitt replied thoughtfully have doubt lord stanway will show consideration certainly will do what can to save in circumstance though must remember that have done harm have caused suspicion to rest on at least one honest man a to reputation have professional reputation of own if help to conceal professional failure will appear to have failed in part of business case be different mr hewitt consider be not expected must be impossible to succeed invariably there be only two three who know have looked into case then other conspicuous success well well will see one thing know though whether climbed out of window to break open trap door whether got up through trap door pulled bolt with string through jamb so a to bolt after there be available window used string a say poor little cunning must seem very transparent to fear spent hour of thought over question of trap door how to break open so a to leave genuine appearance especially how to bolt inside after have reached roof thought have succeeded beyond possibility of suspicion how penetrated device surpasses comprehension how to begin with must possibly know that cameo be forgery did ever see never if have seen fear must never have be able to express opinion on be not connoisseur a matter of fact did know that thing be forgery in first place what knew in first place be that be who have broken into house be from that arrived at conclusion after certain amount of thought that cameo must have be forged gain be out of question beyond men must never sell stanway cameo again besides have paid back lord stanway money knew enough of reputation to know that must never incur scandal of great theft at place for sake of getting cameo for when might have kept in beginning with trouble mystery consequently have to look for motive at first motive seemed impossibility why must wish to take trouble to lose five thousand pound have nothing to gain perhaps have something to save professional reputation for instance looking at so be plain that be suppressing cameo burking since once taken a have taken must never come to light again that suggested solution of mystery at once have discovered after sale that cameo be not genuine yes yes see say began with knowledge broke into place how did know can not imagine trace dear sir left trace everywhere in first place struck a curious before came here that have sent off check for five thousand pound to lord stanway hour so after robbery be discovered looked so much a though be sure of cameo never coming back be in hurry to avert suspicion of course understood so far a then knew case be most unlikely person in world that eagerness to repay lord stanway might be most creditable thing possible point be worth remembering remembered when came here saw suspicious indication in many direction conclusive piece of evidence be that old hat hanging below trap door never touched assure mr hewitt never touched hat have touched for month of course if have touched might never have got clue will deal with hat presently be what struck at first trap door first took attention consider now here be trap door most insecurely hung on external hinge burglar have screwdriver for took off door lock below with why then did take trap off by hinge instead of making noise taking longer time trouble to burst bolt from fastening why if be stranger be able to plant jimmy from outside just exactly opposite interior bolt there be only one mark on frame precisely in proper place after saw leather case have not be thrown away corner must have shown sign of fall have be put down carefully where be found thing however be of small importance compared with hat hat a know be exceedingly thick with dust accumulation of month on top side presented toward trap door be score so of raindrop mark be be new mark for there be dust over have merely have time to dry cake dust have fallen on now there have be no rain since sharp shower just after seven o'clock last night at time by own statement be in place left at eight rain be over at ten minute quarter past seven trap door also told have not be opened for month thing be plain somebody who be here when be have opened that trap door during just before shower said little then went a soon a have left to police station there made perfectly certain that there have be no rain during night by questioning policeman who be on duty outside time there have be none knew everything only other evidence there be pointed with rest there be rain mark on leather case have be put on roof a after thought when there be rain very poor after thought let tell for thief must throw away useful case concealed booty protected from breakage throw away just so a to leave clue a to what direction have gone in also saw in lumber room number of packing case one with label dated two day back have be opened with iron lever yet when made excuse to ask for said there be such thing in place inference did want to compare with mark on desk door be think mr claridge looked dolorously down at floor be afraid said that took unsuitable role when undertook to rely on wit to deceive men like thought there be single vulnerable spot in defense walk calmly through at first attempt why did never think of raindrop come said hewitt with smile sound unrepentant be going now to lord stanway if be think must apologize to mr woollett in way lord stanway who in hour two of reflection left after parting with hewitt have come to belief that have employed man whose mind be not always in order received hewitt story with natural astonishment for time be in doubt a to whether must be doing right in acquiescing in anything straightforward public statement of fact connected with disappearance of cameo in end be persuaded to let affair drop on receiving assurance from mr woollett that unreservedly accepted apology offered by mr claridge a for latter be at least sufficiently punished in loss of money personal humiliation for escapade bitterest last blow sustained when unblushing hahn walked smilingly into office two day later to demand extra payment agreed on in consideration of sale have be called suddenly away exclaimed on day must have come hoped missing appointment have occasioned no inconvenience a to robbery of cameo of course be very sorry pishness be pishness must be glad of check for sum agreed on unhappy claridge be obliged to pay knowing that man have swindled unable to open mouth to say so reward remained on offer for long time indeed be never publicly withdrawn believe even at time of claridge death several intelligent newspaper enlarged upon fact that ordinary burglar have completely baffled defeated boasted acumen of mr martin hewitt well known private detective vii affair of tortoise very often hewitt be tempted by fascination of particularly odd case to neglect other affair to follow up matter from business point of view be of little value to a rule have sufficient regard for own interest to resist such temptation in one curious case at least believe allowed largely to influence be certainly extremely odd case one of affair coming to light at interval more often remaining unheard of by general public convince one after there be very little extravagance about mr rl stevenson bizarre imaginings of doings in london in new arabian night there be nothing in world be at possible have often heard martin hewitt say have not happened be not happening in london certainly have opportunity of knowing case have referred to occurred time before own acquaintance with began in in fact have called one monday morning at office in regard to something connected with one of uninteresting though often difficult case formed perhaps bulk of practice when be informed of most mysterious murder have taken place in part of same building on previous saturday afternoon owing to circumstance of case only vaguest account have appeared in morning paper even a chanced hewitt have not read building be one of new row in partly rebuilt street near national gallery whole row have be built by speculator for purpose of letting out in flat suite of chamber in one two case on ground floor office room have let very well to desirable tenant a rule least satisfactory tenant proprietor reluctantly admitted be mr rameau negro gentleman single who have three room on top floor one of particular building that hewitt be visiting rent be paid regularly behavior have produced complaint from other tenant got uproariously drunk screamed howled in unknown tongue fell asleep on staircase lady be afraid to pas bawled rough chaff down stair along corridor at butcher boy messenger played on errand boy brutal practical joke ended in police court summons once have way of sliding down baluster shouting ho ho ho yah a went a be big heavy man baluster have be built for different treatment have very soon very firmly be requested to stop have plenty of money spent freely be generally felt that there be too much of light hearted savage about to fit to live among quiet people how much longer landlord must have stood sort of thing hewitt informant said be matter of conjecture for on saturday afternoon in question tenancy have come to startling full stop rameau have be murdered in room body have in most unaccountable fashion be secretly removed from premise strongest possible suspicion pointed to man who have be employed in shoveling carrying coal cleaning window chopping wood for several of building who have left that very saturday crime have in fact be committed with man chopper man have be heard again again to threaten rameau who in brutal fashion have made butt of man be frenchman victor goujon by name who have lost employment a watchmaker by reason of injury to right hand destroyed steadiness so have fallen upon evil day odd job be little man of great strength extraordinarily excitable coarse gibe horse play of big negro drove almost to madness rameau must often after more than ordinarily outrageous attack contemptuously fling goujon shilling little frenchman although wanting shilling badly enough must hurl back in face almost weeping with impotent rage pig canaille must scream dirty pig of africa take sheelin ' to vere 'ave stole voleur pig there be tortoise living in basement of goujon have made rather pet negro must sometimes use animal a missile flinging at little frenchman head on one such occasion tortoise struck wall so forcibly a to break shell then goujon seized shovel rushed at tormentor with such blind fury that latter made bolt of be few of passage between rameau fuel porter illustrate state of feeling between goujon after correspondence with relative in france who offered work gave notice to leave expired on day of crime at about three afternoon housemaid proceeding toward rameau room met goujon a be going away goujon bade good by pointing in direction of rameau room said exultantly dere will be more of black pig for vit 'im 'ave done for zut mock of 'im e vill never tracasser more went away girl went to outer door of rameau room knocked got reply concluding that tenant be out be about to use key when found that door be unlocked passed through lobby into sitting room there fell in dead faint at sight met eye rameau lay with back across sofa head drooping within inch of ground on head be fearful gash below be pool of blood girl must have lain unconscious for about ten minute when came to sens dragged terrified from room up to housekeeper apartment where being excitable nervous creature only screamed murder immediately fell in fit of hysteric lasted three quarter of hour when at last came to herself told story hall porter having be summoned rameau room be again approached blood still lay on floor chopper with crime have evidently be committed rested against fender body have vanished search be at once made trace of must be seen anywhere seemed impossible that must have be carried out of building for hall porter must at once have noticed anybody leaving with so bulky burden still in building be not to be found when hewitt be informed of thing on monday police be of course still in possession of rameau room inspector netting hewitt be told be in charge of case a inspector be acquaintance of be then in room upstairs hewitt went up to see netting be pleased to see hewitt invited to look around room perhaps can spot something have overlooked said though be not case there can be much doubt about think be goujon think well rather look here a soon a got here on saturday found piece of paper pin on floor showed to housemaid then remembered be too much upset to think of before when be in room paper be laying on dead man chest pinned there evidently must have dropped off when removed body be case of half mad revenge on goujon part plainly see read french paper be plain large half sheet of note paper on sentence in french be scrawled in red ink in large clumsy hand thus puni par un vengeur de la tortue puni par un vengeur de la tortue hewitt repeated musingly 'punished by avenger of tortoise seems odd well rather odd understand reference of course have told about rameau treatment of goujon pet tortoise think be mentioned among other prank be extreme revenge for thing of sort queer way of announcing oh be mad mad with rameau continual ragging baiting netting answered anyway be plain indication plain a though 'd left own signature besides be in own language french there be chopper too speaking of signature hewitt remarked perhaps have already compared with other specimen of goujon writing did think of seem to have specimen to hand anyway doe seem very important there be 'avenger of tortoise plain enough in man own language tell everything besides handwriting be easily disguised have got goujon well have there seems to be little difficulty about expect to have by time to morrow here come mr style landlord mr style be thin querulous withered looking little man who twitched eyebrow a spoke spoke in short jerky phrase news eh inspector eh eh found out nothing else eh terrible thing for property terrible who be friend netting introduced hewitt shocking thing eh mr hewitt terrible come of having anything to do with blood thirsty foreigner eh new building character ruined one come to live here now eh tenant noisy nigger murdered by own servant terrible formed opinion eh dare say might if went into case yes yes same opinion a inspector eh mean opinion of own old man scrutinized hewitt face sharply if 'd like to look into matter hewitt began eh oh look into well ca commission know matter for police mischief done police doing very well think must be goujon look about place certainly if like if see anything likely to serve interest tell perhaps will employ eh eh good afternoon landlord vanished inspector laughed like to see what be buying doe mr style said hewitt first impulse be to walk out of place at once interest in case have be roused determined at rate to examine room did very minutely by side of lobby be bath room in be fitted tip up wash basin hewitt inspected with particular attention then called housekeeper made inquiry about rameau clothes linen housekeeper must give idea of how many overcoat how much linen have have have negro love of display be continually buying new clothes indeed be lying hanging littering choking up bedroom in direction housekeeper however on hewitt inquiring after garment in particular did remember one heavy black ulster rameau have very rarely worn only in coldest weather after body be discovered hewitt asked housekeeper be stranger observed about place whether carrying anything not sir housekeeper replied there be be particular inquiry about of course after knew what be wrong body be gone nobody be seen 'd have be stopped hall porter say be certain no stranger came went for hour more before that time about when housemaid saw body fainted at moment clerk from landlord office arrived handed netting paper here be said netting to hewitt have found specimen of goujon handwriting at last if 'd like to see want be not graphologist case be clear enough for anyway hewitt took paper said be different sort of handwriting from on paper red ink note about avenger of tortoise be in crude large clumsy untaught style of writing be small neat well formed except that be trifle shaky probably because of hand injury be nothing contended netting handwriting clue be worse than useless a rule be so easy to disguise imitate writing besides if goujon be such good penman a seem to say why must all easier alter style say now can fiddling question of handwriting get over thing about 'avenging tortoise ' practically written confession to say nothing of chopper what said to housemaid a left well said hewitt perhaps not will see meantime turning to landlord clerk possibly will be good enough to tell one two thing first what be goujon character excellent a far a know never have complaint about except for little matter of carelessness leaving coal scuttle on staircase for people to fall over losing shovel so on be certainly bit careless a far a must see quite decent little fellow one must never have thought capable of committing murder for sake of tortoise though be rather fond of animal tortoise be dead now understand yes have lift in building only for coal heavy parcel goujon used to work sometimes going up down in with coal so on go into basement be coal kept under building store for whole row be under next two house basement communicate do know rameau other name cesar rameau signed in agreement did ever mention relation be to say did say something one day when be very drunk of course be rot one told not to make such row be beastly tenant said be best man in place brother be prime minister sort of thing mere drunken rant never heard of saying anything sensible about relation know nothing of connection came here on banker reference thanks think that be want to ask notice hewitt proceeded turning to netting only ink in place be scented violet only paper be tinted scented too with monogram characteristic of negro with money paper be pinned on rameau breast be in red ink on common rather grubby paper therefore be written somewhere else brought here inference premeditation yes yes be inch nearer with speculation can get nearer than be now without well perhaps not hewitt replied profess at moment to know criminal do will concede point for present offer opinion a to who removed rameau body think know who be then come try guess yourself be goujon mind letting know that be person quite within knowledge of case have mentioned person name more than once netting stared blankly understand in least said of course mean that mysterious person speak of a having moved body committed murder nobody must have be more innocent of well netting concluded with resignation be afraid one of be rather thick headed what will do interview person who took away body hewitt replied with smile man alive why why bother about person if be criminal never mind never mind probably person will be most valuable witness do mean think person whoever be saw crime think very probable indeed well wo ask more will get hold of goujon be simple direct enough for prefer to deal with heart of case murder when there be such clear evidence a have will look little into too perhaps hewitt said if like will tell first thing will do what be will have good look at map of west indie advise to do same good morning netting stared down corridor after hewitt continued staring for nearly two minute after have disappeared then said to clerk who have remained what be talking about know replied clerk must make head tail of believe there be head to declared netting tail be kidding netting be better than word for within two hour of conversation with hewitt goujon be captured safe in cab bound for bow street have be stopped at newhaven in morning on way to dieppe be brought back to london now netting met check late afternoon called on hewitt to explain matter have got goujon said gloomily there be difficulty be got two friend who can swear alibi rameau be seen alive at half past one on saturday girl found dead about three now goujon two friend seems be with from one o'clock till four in afternoon with exception of five minute when girl saw then left to take key something to housekeeper before finally leaving be waiting on landing below when goujon spoke to housemaid heard speaking have seen go way up to housekeeper room back a looked up wide well of staircase be men employed near place seem to have good character perhaps will find something unfavorable about be drinking with goujon seems by way of beeeing off ' well hewitt said scarcely think need trouble to damage men character be probably telling truth come now be plain have come here to get hint a to whether theory of case help have well if can give friendly hint although of course may be right after still wish 'd explain bit a to what meant by looking at map mystery nice thing for to be taking lesson in own business after year perhaps deserve see now hewitt remember what map told to look at west indie right well here be hewitt reached atlas from book shelf now look here biggest island of lot on map barring cuba be hayti know a well a do that western part of island be peopled by black republic of hayti that country be in degenerate state of almost unexampled savagery with ridiculous show of civilization there be revolution time south american republic be peaceful prosperous compared to hayti state of country be simply awful read sir spenser st john book on president after president of vilest sort force way to power commits most horrible bloodthirsty excess murdering opponent by hundred seizing property for satellite who be usually a bad if not worse than president whole family men woman child be murdered at instance of ruffian a consequence most deadly feud spring up president follower be always in danger of reprisal from others perhaps very worst of president in recent time have be notorious domingue who be overthrown by insurrection a be sooner later compelled to fly country domingue nephew one of whom be chief minister while in power committed cruellest bloodshed many member of opposite party sought refuge in small island lying just to north of hayti be sought out there almost exterminated now will show island on map what be name tortuga be 'tortuga ' however be only old spanish name haytians speak french creole french here be french atlas now see name of island la tortue la tortue be tortoise tortuga mean same thing in spanish island be always spoken of in hayti a la tortue now do see drift of paper pinned to rameau breast punished by avenger of from tortoise la tortue clear enough must seem that dead man have something to do with massacre there somebody from island be avenging thing be most extraordinary now listen name of domingue nephew who be chief minister be septimus rameau be cesar rameau brother probably see well be case think relationship probable now understand why be inclined to doubt that goujon be man wanted of course of course now suppose must try to get nigger chap who wrote that paper wish have be such ignorant nigger if 'd only have put capital to word tortue ' might have thought little more about instead of taking for granted that meant that wretched tortoise in basement of house well have made fool of start will be after nigger now a said before said hewitt will be after person carried off rameau body have have something else to do afternoon must have begun already said thought saw crime how did judge that hewitt smiled think will keep little secret to myself for present said will know soon very well netting replied with resignation suppose must grumble if tell everything feel too great fool altogether over case to see farther than show inspector netting left on search while martin hewitt a soon a be alone laughed joyously slapped thigh there be cab rank shelter at end of street where mr style building stood early that evening man approached hailed cabman waterman one must have known new comer at once for cabman taking holiday brim of hat bird eye neckerchief immense coat button more than rolling walk wrinkled trouser marked out distinctly watcheer exclaimed affably with self possessed nod only possible to cabby 'busmen be lookin ' for bilker be told one o ' bloke off rank carried 'im last saturday want to know where went ai 'ad chance o ' gettin ' address yet took cab just a got dark be told tallish chap muffled up lot in long black overcoat of ye seen 'im cabby looked at one shook head chanced that none of have be on particular rank at time waterman said 'old on bet ' e bloke wot old bill stammer took yorkey be fust on rank bloke must 'ave 'ansom wanted four wheeler so old bill took 'im biggish chap in long black coat collar up muffled thick soft wide awake pulled over 'be eye be in 'urry too jumped in sharp a weasel did see 'be face did ye not inch of too much muffled must tell if 'ad face be arm in sling ay looked so have stuffed through breast of coat like a though there might be sling inside be 'im of ye tell where might run across old bill stammer will tell where precious bilker went to a to there be plenty of information in five minute martin hewitt who have become unoccupied cabman for occasion be on way to find old bill stammer that respectable old man gave full particular a to place in east end where have driven muffled fare on saturday hewitt then begun eighteen twenty hour search beyond whitechapel at about three on tuesday afternoon a netting be in act of leaving bow street police station hewitt drove up in four wheeler prisoner appeared to be crouching low in vehicle leaving to take care of hewitt hurried into station shook netting by hand well said have got murderer of rameau yet netting growled unless well goujon under remand still after have be thinking that may know something pooh nonsense hewitt answered 'd better let go now have got somebody hewitt laughed slapped inspector shoulder have got man who carried rameau body away deuce have where bring in must have right be in hurry wo bolt hewitt stepped out to cab produced prisoner who pulling hat farther over eye hurried furtively into station one hand be stowed in breast of long coat below wide brim of hat small piece of white bandage must be seen a lifted face be seen to be that of negro inspector netting hewitt said ceremoniously allow to introduce mr cesar rameau netting gasped what at length ejaculated what be rameau negro looked round nervously shrank farther from door yes said please not so loud please not loud zey may be near be 'fraid will certify will not asked hewitt with malicious glee not only that be not murdered last saturday by victor goujon that in fact be not murdered at also that carried own body away in usual fashion on own leg yes yes responded rameau looking haggardly about be not zis zis room publique must not be seen nonsense replied hewitt rather testily exaggerate danger own importance enemy ability a well be safe enough suppose then netting remarked slowly like man on whose mind something vast be beginning to dawn suppose why hang must have just got up while fool of girl be screaming fainting upstairs walked out say there be nothing so hard a nigger skull yours have certainly made fool of then somebody must have chopped over head who be enemy great enemy enemy politique be great man with faint revival of vanity amid fear great man in countree zey have great secret club sieties to kill fren one enemy coming in room doe zis one two indicated wrist head wiz choppa rameau made case plain to netting so far a actual circumstance of assault on be concerned negro whom have noticed near place more than once during previous day two have attacked suddenly in room dealing two savage blow with chopper first have caught on wrist be seriously damaged a well a excruciatingly painful second have taken effect on head assailant have evidently gone away then leaving for dead a matter of fact be only stunned by shock have thanks to adamantine thickness of negro skull ill direction of chopper only very bad scalp wound bone being more than grazed have lain insensible for time must have come to sens soon after housemaid have left room terrified at knowledge that enemy have found out only thought be to get away hide hastily washed tied up head enveloped in biggest coat must find let down into basement by coal lift for fear of observation waited in basement of one of adjoining building till dark then got away in cab with idea of hiding in east end have have very little money with on flight be by reason of circumstance hewitt when found have prevailed on to leave hiding place since must be impossible for to touch of large sum of money in keeping of bank so long a be supposed to be dead with much difficulty promise of ample police protection be at last convinced that must be safe to declare get property then run away hide wherever pleased netting hewitt strolled off together for few minute chatted leaving wretched rameau to cower in corner among several policeman well mr hewitt netting said case have certainly be shocking beating for must have be a blind a bat when started on yet see that have deal to go on even now what struck first well in beginning seemed rather odd to that body must have be taken away a have be told be after written paper have be pinned on why must murderer pin label on body of victim if meant carrying that body away who must read label learn of nature of revenge gratified plainly that indicated that person who have carried away body be not person who have committed murder a soon a began to examine place saw probability that there be murder after there be number of indication of fact ca understand not observing first although there be good deal of blood on floor just below where housemaid have seen rameau lying there be none between place door now if body have be dragged even carried to door blood must have become smeared about floor at least there must have be drop there be none seemed to hint that corpse might have come to sat up on sofa stanched wound walked out reflected at once rameau be full blooded negro that negro head be very nearly invulnerable to anything short of bullet then if body have be dragged out a such heavy body must have be almost of necessity carpet rug must show sign of fact there be such sign beyond there be fact that long black overcoat be left with other clothes although housekeeper distinctly remembered rameau possession of such garment judged must use such thing to assist disguise be why asked why must want to disguise be plain a will see presently there be towel left in bath room inference used for bandage everything seemed to show that only person responsible for rameau removal be rameau why then have gone away secretly hurriedly without making complaint why have stayed away what reason must have for doing if have be goujon that have attacked none goujon be going to france clearly rameau be afraid of attack from implacable enemy whom be anxious to avoid one against whom feared legal complaint defense must be useless brought at once to paper found on floor if be work of goujon open reference to tortoise why must be at such pain to disguise handwriting must have be already pointing out by mere mention of tortoise if must not avoid shake in natural small handwriting how must have avoided in large clumsy slowly drawn assumed hand no paper be not goujon a to writing on paper netting interposed have told how made mistake took readiest explanation of word since seemed so pat must let anything else outweigh that a to other thing evidence of rameau having gone off by well usually miss such obvious thing never thought of possibility of victim going away on quiet not coming back a though 'd done something wrong come of starting with set of fixed notion well answered hewitt fancy must have be rather 'out of form a say everybody have stupid day ca keep up to concert pitch forever to return to case evidence of chopper be very untrustworthy especially when have heard of goujon careless habit losing shovel leaving coal scuttle on stair nothing more likely than for chopper to be left lying about criminal who have calculated chance must know advantage to of using weapon belonged to place leaving behind to divert suspicion be quite possible by way that man who attacked rameau got away down coal lift out by adjoining basement just a did rameau however be mere conjecture must be murderer have plainly prepared for crime witness previous preparation of paper declaring revenge indication of pride at having run enemy to earth at distant place a although expect be only in england by chance for haytians be not persistently energetic race in regard to use of small instead of capital letter in word tortue ' on paper observed in beginning that first letter of whole sentence ' p ' in 'puni be small one clearly writer be illiterate man be at once plain that may have made same mistake with ensuing word on whole be plain that everybody have begun with too ready disposition to assume that goujon be guilty everybody insisted too that body have be carried away be true of course although not in sense intended so did trouble to contradict to say more than guessed who have carried body off to tell truth be little piqued at mr style manner indisposed interested in case a be to give away theory too freely rest of job be not very difficult found out cabman who have taken rameau away can always get readier help from cabby if go a one of especially if be after bilker from got sufficiently near east end direction to find rameau after inquiry ventured by way on rather long shot described man to cabman a having injured arm wrist turned out correct guess see man making attack with chopper be pretty certain to make more than single blow a there appeared to have be only single wound on head seemed probable that have fallen somewhere else almost certainly on arm a must be raised to defend head at limehouse found have have head wrist attended to at local medico big nigger in fright with long black coat broken head lame hand be not so difficult to find in small area how persuaded up here know already think frightened little too by explaining how easily have tracked giving hint others might do same be in great funk seems to have quite lost faith in england a safe asylum police failed to catch rameau assailant chiefly because rameau must not be got to give proper description of to do anything except get out of country in hurry in truth be glad to be quit of matter with nothing worse than broken head little goujon made wild storm about arrest before did go to france managed to extract twenty pound from rameau by way of compensation in spite of absence of strictly legal claim against old tormentor so that on whole goujon be about only person who derived particular profit from tortoise mystery end
