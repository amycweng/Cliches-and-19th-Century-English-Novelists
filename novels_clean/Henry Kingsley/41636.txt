with same stem cold expression on face now more marked perhaps from effect of masculine habit wore be consummate horsewoman rode furious black irish mare be brought out for with ease possession seeming to enjoy rearing plunging of sour tempered brute far more than charles companion did who must rather have seen on quieter horse sweeping gallop under noble old tree through deep valley past herd of deer scudded away through thick strewn leaf brought to great stable large building at edge of park close to down twenty thirty long legged elegant nonchalant looking animal covered to tip of ear with cloth ridden by queer looking brown faced lad be in act of returning from afternoon exercise adelaide mare molly asthore charged dispersed like flock of sheep then adelaide pointing with whip

greeting made joke with adelaide hand fidgeted with rein kept turning back towards horse have left wondering impatiently what be keeping boy at last saw beautiful beast shake head give two three playful plunge then come striding rapidly towards over short springy turf then turned rode full speed soon heard mighty hollow sounding hoof behind came rapidly towards devouring space then colt rushed by in pride with chin on chest hard held hind foot coming forward under girth stride casting turf behind in shower then adelaide horse after few mad plunge bolted overtook colt actually raced for few hundred yard then colt be pulled up on breezy hill stood little together talking congratulating one on beauty of horse charles adelaide rode away together over down intending to make little detour so lengthen ride have have chance of conversation since parted at conservatory door took up nearly where have left adelaide began may say went on too a have most of talking must like to be duchess then must be mistress of only thing be afraid of what be poverty said be only terror be inevitable fate must have thought adelaide that be too high spirited to care for anything ah know relation be poor know what be know what must be for beauty like will never be poor friendless while lady ascot life how long will be home now depends very much on horse oh if be only man must welcome poverty must force to action charles blushed not many day before marston have have battle royal in former have said that only hope for charles be that must go two three time without dinner be made to earn that a long a have mag to bless with must always be lazy useless humbug now here be young lady uttering same atrocious sentiment called attention to prospect three hundred foot below thames be winding along under down yellow woodland past chalk quarry grey farm house blood red beneath setting sun soft rich autumnal haze be over everything smoke from distant village hung like curtain of pearl across valley long straight dark wood crowned high grey wold be bathed in dim purple mist on darkest side to perfect air of dreamy stillness distant bell sent golden sound floating on peaceful air be quiet day in old age of year peace seemed to make felt on two wild young bird for be silent more than way home then charles said in low voice dear adelaide hope have chosen aright time will come when will have to make more important decision than have made yet at one time in man woman life say there be choice between good evil in god name think before make charles said in low disturbed voice if conjurer be to offer to show face in glass a must be ten year hence must have courage to look suppose so must not oh how do know what horrid thing must look at scare to death ten year hence

joke though feeble sometimes possibly rather close to wind served purpose served to show that maker of be desirous to make agreeable to best of ability never once laughed during dinner be very unusual be evident that lord saltire have performed commission charles be afraid that be furiously angry with welter on one occasion when latter looked up suddenly asked question father answered kindly in usual tone of voice spoke to so for time lady ascot be host in with noble self sacrifice at risk of being laughed at resolved to attract attention by airing of most remarkable opinion accordingly attacked lord saltire on subject of end of world putting total destruction by fire at about nine month from time lord saltire have opinion to offer on probability of dr going theory sincerely hoped that might last time that might be allowed to get out of way in ordinary manner did not for moment doubt correctness of calculation put to a woman of world whether such occurrence a described must not be in last degree awkward disconcerting adelaide said did believe word of nothing must induce to do so until took place brought old lady wrath down upon helped flagging conversation on little after dinner got so dull in spite of one effort that lord saltire confided to young friend a went upstairs that have idea that something be wrong at event that house be getting so insufferably dull that must rat pardieu for must stand must rat into devon to friend lord segur welter took occasion to tell charles lord ascot have sent for told that knew about what have happened debt that did not wish subject mentioned a if be likely to talk about that debt must if possible be paid that have then gone on to say that did not wish to say anything harsh to welter on subject that doubted whether retained right of reproving son that needed forgiveness one from other that hoped in what be to follow must display that courtesy mutual forbearance to one gentleman must what deuce doe mean eh never

poor cuthbert must at time within knowledge of man have acted a damper on liveliest party affection for charles seemed for reason to increase day by day be sometimes very hard to keep peace between welter if there be one man beyond cuthbert hated be lord welter sometimes after dinner such scene a must take place will perhaps have remarked have never yet represented cuthbert a speaking to mary real fact be that never did speak to to woman anything beyond merest commonplace circumstance made charles very much doubt truth of ellen statement that priest have caught talking together in wood however cuthbert be in way fond enough of bonny little soul swear be in love with myself over head ear so one day when came cry in told a being first person met that little bantam cock have be killed

standing alone charles be gone chapter xxvii coup de grace in long watch of winter night when one have awoke from evil dream lie sleepless terrified with solemn pall of darkness around one on one of deadly still dark night when window only show murky patch of positive gloom in contrast with nothingness of wall when howling of tempest round chimney roof must be welcomed a boisterous companion in such still dead time only lying a in silence of tomb one realises that day will lie in bed not think at that time will come soon when must die preacher remind of often enough can not realise in pew in broad daylight must wake in middle of night to do face thought like man that will come come to nine in hundred of not in maddening clatter of musquetry a day be won in carrying line to stranded ship in such like glorious time when soul be in mastery over body in bed by slow degree be in darkness silence only that realise then let hope that humbly remember death have be conquered for that in spite of unworthiness may defy after sometimes will come thought be there evil worse even than death have made few remark have made very few in story for want to suggest thought not to supply ready made because charles ravenshoe have said to in wild way that did not fear death for have died once already did not say anything waited for to go on for what continued do make out death even at worst terror then pang more le severe then total severance of tie on earth entire permanent loss of everything one have loved after remorse useless regret horrible torture of missed opportunity without number thrust continually before one monotonous song of fiend late too late ' have suffered thing have known what very few men have known lived despair perhaps most terrible agony for time be feeling of loss of identity be not that whole existence from babyhood have be lie at time at time only mind washed away from only spar to must cling feeling be gentleman when deluge came be only creed have be left alone a be on midnight ocean out of sight of land swimming with failing strength have made charles speak for in know be right now must go on with through gathering darkness without flinching in terror perhaps not in despair a yet never for one moment entered into head to doubt truth of what father mackworth have set up if have have doubt even to last have none after mackworth have looked compassionately in face said god judge between if paper be not true though distrusted mackworth felt that man be never so profound actor must have looked so spoken so if be not telling what believed to be truth that norah be mistaken justly felt to be impossibility no be child of petre ravenshoe bastard son by irish peasant girl who hour before have be heir to proud old name to noble old house pride of west country to hundred of acre of rolling woodland to mile beyond mile of sweeping moorland to twenty thriving farm deep in happy valley perched high up on side of lofty down be now just peasant impostor tenantry fisherman servant must come to know have died ah how much better than must have mourned for what must say think now that patron intercessor condescending young prince must be

land beyond sea where man must win fortune in few year perhaps in one there be canada australia india where man needed nothing energy never must take one farthing from ravenshoes save twenty pound have be determination nothing must alter why need there be gold to be won forest to be cleared in happier land ala poor charles have never yet set foot out of england perhaps never will never thought seriously about once never have put before strongly by one men only emigrate from idleness restlessness necessity with two first of be not troubled last have not come yet must perhaps have be better for to have gone to backwoods digging a say reason why did be that did at sad crisis of life gave comfort for little to think about only for little then thought terror came sweeping back again lord saltire must be told of by others must be charles duty not to see lord saltire again with present position in society a servant son there be nothing to prevent asking lord saltire to provide for except what be pride well hardly pride be humble enough god know felt a if have gained goodwill a be by false pretence duty must forbid presuming on goodwill longer must lord saltire be same to lady maid son a must to heir presumptive of ravenshoe there must be humiliation before stern grey eye now began to see that loved owner of eye more deeply than have thought there be gleam of pleasure in thinking that when lord saltire heard of fighting bravely unassisted with world must say that lad be brave fellow gentleman after marston must terrible business be so new terrible a to be a yet only half appreciated must make difference to perhaps might whether must humble there take from just reproach for idleness missed opportunity however bitter might be mary poor little mary ah must be safe with good lady hainault be ah charles what pale little sprite be that outside door now listening dry eyed terrified till must move who saw come up with hand clutched in hair like madman hour ago heard throw upon floor have waited patiently ever since to see if must comfort be never so little ah charles foolish fellow thinking thinking now with anger now with tear now with terror till head be hot hand dry thought began to run into one channel saw that action be necessary came to great noble resolution worthy of world be on one side alone on other must meet world humbly bravely conquer must begin at beginning find own value in world then if found worthy must claim once more love respect of who have be friend hitherto how must begin knew not cared must be from beginning when have come to resolution rose up faced light of day once more there be still figure sitting in chair watching be william william how long have be here nigh on hour came in just after have be lying on hearthrug ever since moaning hour be only hour short hour seemed like year why be not dark yet sun still shine doe went to window looked out spring said early spring fifty more of between rest most likely do look

william look at matter in point of view will cuthbert let come with care be coming william be sitting where have be in charles chair charles be standing beside if william have be looking at charles

that believe owe thanks for forbearance so long said charles though be for sake of father more than will tell sir now be alone how long have known nearly eighteen month said father mackworth promptly mackworth be not ill natured man when be not opposed being brave man must well appreciate bravery in others have knowledge enough of men to know that revelation of to day have be a bitter blow to passionate sensitive man like charles a must well endure live knew that charles distrusted that out of way expression of condolence must be thrown away so departing from usual rule of conduct spoke for once in way naturally sincerely said be very very sorry must have done much to avoid then mary came in tiernays cuthbert did not come down there be long dull dinner at charles forced to eat having resolution before mary sat scared at head of table scarcely spoke word when rose to go into drawing room again charles followed saw that be coming waited for in hall when shut dining room door after

window be open fresh spring air be blowing in book clothes gun rod be piled about in usual confusion dog be lying on hearthrug stretched a came to greet dog have glove at foot wondered at curtain of bed be drawn close cuthbert went softly to drew aside be not there bed be smooth gone gone cried cuthbert half feared fly william for god sake to lord ascot to ranford catch there never leave again come get money begone may be in time if must lose after after william needed second bidding in hour be at stonnington mr charles ravenshoe have arrived there at daybreak have gone on in coach started at eight william posted to exeter at eleven o'clock in evening saw lady ascot at ranford charles ravenshoe have be there that afternoon be gone then lady ascot weeping wildly told such news a made break from room with oath dash through scared servant in hall out into darkness to try to overtake carriage have discharged reach london morning before adelaide have eloped with lord welter chapter xxviii flight when william left charles in room at ravenshoe latter sat down in chair began thinking smart of blow have fallen so heavily at first have become le painful knew by intuition that must be worse on morrow on many morrow at present be alleviated began to dread sleeping for fear of waking dreaded night dream more than morrow departure felt that ought to see cuthbert again dreaded that dreaded servant seeing go have horror of parting from have known so long formally be natural must be so much pain to concerned be not better avoided thought of thing tried to persuade that be reason made do what have a good a determined to do hour two before what have in mind when called william back in corridor to go away alone hide mope like wounded stag for little time be instinct to do so perhaps must have be best thing for at event determined on packed up portmanteau carpet bag then sat down again waiting said to will be better to do must get away from william poor lad must not follow fortune for many reason dog have be watching looking with bright loving eye first at then at baggage wondering what journey be going on now when charles have done packing have sat down again in chair before fire dog leapt up in lap unbidden laid head upon breast grip grip said charles be going away to leave for ever grip dog live so long a men boy will be quietly under turf at rest when will have forty long year more to go through with dog wagged tail pawed waistcoat wanted biscuit charles got then went on talking be going to london old dog be going to see what world be like sha' come back before be dead grip expect have got to win money name for sake of one who be worth winning for very likely will go abroad to land where stuff come from make sovereign of try luck at getting of yellow rubbish will wait in old house at ranford paused here thought came upon must not be more honourable to absolve adelaide from engagement be acting generously in demanding of to waste best part of life in waiting till ruined man have won fortune mean answer came love if can wait why not have wronged by such thought grip have boy so on need continue telling nonsense charles talked to dog men will talk nonsense to dog friend when be in love such nonsense be poor reading at time to who know what have happened how worthless false adelaide be must be merely painful humiliating to hear more of only gave so much to show how completely charles be in dark poor fool with regard to adelaide character to render le surprising folly of behaviour after heard news at ranford charles judged one by own standard have told that loved perhaps did for time believed a for vanity selfishness fickleness calculation coming in conquering love knew be impossible in own case so conceived impossible in hers think have be very careful to impress on that charles be not wise at event if have softened matter so far hitherto a to leave in doubt action will have to chronicle immediately will leave not slightest doubt of love man love very fault in way be reality to though may not have art to make so to mad impulsive way of forming resolution honourable obstinacy in sticking to resolution afterwards even to death be very great fault be more le fault of men who have made very great figure in world have read history wrong men with charles ravenshoe character power of patience application superadded turn out very brilliant character for most part charles have not be drilled into habit of application early enough densil unthinking indulgence have done much harm be just sort of boy to be spoilt at school favourite among master boy always just up to work more be possible that eton in one way rugby in might have done for what shrewsbury certainly did not at eton thrown at once into great free republic might have be forced to fight way up to proper place believe must not have be low one at rugby must have have place to win same to help must have have traditionary school policy great man have left behind a immortal legacy be not to be be sent to good manly school enough one where there be for too little of competition shrewsbury be in most respect third of old school in england be unluckily not school for be too great man there at oxford too hardly have fair chance lord welter be there before have got just set about a one must expect from young gentleman character bringing up

powerful than curious position prospective wealth be connection with charles ravenshoe now horton be hero of evening half william light be borrowed from quickly became aware of made happy how strange be that men have power of winning such love from meet knew one gone from now by glorious death who have that faculty only few knew great worth goodness yet a biographer most truly say who once saw face never forgot charles ravenshoe have that faculty also though ala value in worth utility be far inferior to of man to whom have alluded above have same infinite kindness towards everything created be part of secret first hint william have a to how deeply important person charles be among present company be given at dinner various subject have be talked of indifferently william have listened till lord hainault said to william what strange price people be giving for cob saw one sold to day at tattersall for ninety guinea william answered good cob be very hard to get lord hainault must get

who did best in end chapter xli charles second expedition to st john wood what happy place man bed be probably best place in ever find very few people will like to deny think be to say a general rule

ball when have to pull down blind that impudent sun may not roast awake in two hour for in case hundred more bed be very pleasant know a well a do that there be time when must sooner be on frozen deck in wildest bush in worst weather waltzing in hall of eblis with vathek mama almost in very grave than in bed awake oh weary watch when soul in sleep must leave tortured body to rest ramble off in dream hold on by mere thread yet thread strong enough to keep nerve in tense agony when one waking dream of past be a vivid a of sleep there be always present through dreadful lurking thought that one be awake that be real when looking back kindly impulsive action heartily spoken word make fancy that have only earned contempt where merit kindness when past look like hell of missed opportunity future like black hopeless hell of uncertainty imminent misfortune of kind oh weary watch let be at such time on bleakest hill side in coldest night ever blew rather than in warmest bed that money will buy when be going to have night of kind seldom know beforehand for certain sometimes if have have much experience in sort of thing if have lost money gone in debt if sweetheart have cut very often may at least guess before get boot off that be going to have night of in case read to sleep in bed never mind burning house down must be rather desirable a distraction from thought read till be sleepy with clothes on then undress because if do will find by time have undressed that be terribly wide awake when candle be blown out will be ready for regular walpurgis night charles poor lad have not a yet have much experience of walpurgis night before catastrophe have never have one have be used to tumble tired into bed sleep heavy dreamless sleep till hour before waking then indeed might begin to dream of horse dog so on then gradually wake into state more sweet than sweetest dream state in sense be awake to outward object in soul be taking few last airy flutter round home before coming to rest for day even since then have not have experience enough to make dread night night came home from st john wood thought must go to bed sleep off poor fellow fellow servant slept in same room with younger better tempered of two though charles have complaint against of lad be asleep before charles put out light looked at cheek be laid on arm seemed so calm happy that charles knew that be not there far away be right a looked lad smiled babbled out something in dream strange soul have still sufficient connection with body to make smile wonder if miss martineau mr atkinson ever watched face of one who slept dreamt said charles rambling on a soon a have got into bed pish why fellow body be mere tool of soul soul be out walking body be only log hey wo do be a bad a miss martineau must have said that body be only fine piece of clockwork clockwork smile of dear madam mr atkinson be going to leave body behind be off to ravenshoe in five minute be to say be going to

of feverish despondency fell into cheerful train of thought be quite inclined to look at already pleasant prospect from hopeful point of view poor dear fellow may say that be heartless to make fun of just now when everything be going so terribly wrong really story be so very sad that must try to make little feeble fun where can must be unreadable tried to face future manfully lo there be future to

limit to human misery in many way believe that condemned man waiting through weary night for gallows think night through of fate read generally in account of terrible last night be so rightly published in newspaper be most terrifying part of punishment that conversed cheerfully slept did something showing that half forgot for time what be coming so before little window grew to lighter grey poor charles have found relief from misery be between sleep waking have fulfilled challenge to miss martineau though later than intended have gone to ravenshoe there be before dawn behind eastern headland have flooded amphitheatre of hill till crag behind house have turned from grey to gold vane upon priest tower shone like star sea have changed from black to purple fishing boat be stealing lazily homewards over gentle rolling ground swell surf be whispering to sand of coming a window after window blazed out before sun a woodland hill side stream park village lonely farm in distant valley waked before coming day charles watched in mind eye dark old porch till there came out figure in black stood solitary in terrace gazing seaward a said cuthbert fell into dreamless happy sleep determined that must not go to see ellen till afternoon hornby be on duty in morning never saw charles day avoided a though on purpose charles on part did not want to meet till have made definite arrangement so be glad of towards two o'clock came across mind that must saunter round to st peter church see comical little imp of boy who be generally to be found there beguile quarter of hour by listening to prattle have given up reading have hardly opened book since misfortune may seem odd thing to have to record about gentleman to certain extent scholar so be wanted to lower be beginning to succeed there be essential honesty in made hate to appear what be not feeling carried to absurd extent prevented taking refuge in most obvious remedy for trouble except hunger book did not know a do determined reading reading of anything even advertisement in newspaper will stop craving except of stomach will even soften guessed nevertheless why must read said must learn to do a rest of so did a

frantic in play be very glad to see charles parted matted hair from face looked at admiringly with pleasant smile then suddenly said be drunk last night wor charles said that never got drunk wor really though said boy look a tho ' have be look wild about eye then hazarded theory to account for charles appearance charles also negatived emphatically gave halpenny for one said boy showing ball

flanigan must be how must rather like to know for curiosity sake picture drew of in mind be not exactly like original a will see be very pleasant summer weather weather in idle man must be inclined to dawdle under circumstance charles be more inclined to dawdle because very much disliked errand on went must loiter at street corner now with best of talk to one who happened to be loitering there too be getting on so loitered at street corner talked found out something to day for first time have be so absorbed in own trouble that rumour have be to like buzzing of bee to day began to appreciate that rumour of war be no longer mere rumour likely to grow into awful reality if be only free said to if must only provide for poor ellen gad if must get up regiment of fellow in same state of mind a be went into public house drank glass of ale be talking of there sir charles napier be to have fleet said one man if bring cronstadt about ear in two hour be dutchman a for odessa man in seedy black who let hope have seen better day suggested first man have not heard of sebastopol must not be place of much importance must have heard of talk to about petersburg moscow must listen to sort of talk heard everywhere on slow walk excited charles thinking over came to door of lord welter house rang door be barely opened when saw lord welter in hall who called to by christian name bade come in charles followed lord welter into room when latter turned round charles saw that be disturbed anxious charles said ellen be gone charles said where for hardly understood where god know must have left house soon after saw last night left note for take read see be free from blame in matter charles took read lord must have consented to accept shelter of roof for longer period be not that by doing so must be continually tempted to commission of dishonourable action action must bring speedy punishment on by ruining too surely man whom of others in world love respect lieutenant hornby have proposed marriage to lordship fine sense of honour will show at once how impossible be for to consent to ruin prospect by union with one a distrusting own resolution have fled henceforth be dead to to ah welter welter might have be loved a be once that time be gone by for ever must have made better wife than adelaide might have loved once fell more through anger vanity than through love brother whom call charles ravenshoe be in weary world somewhere have idea that will meet used to love one let quarrel with for worthless straw a be tell always loved a brother be better that must not meet yet tell that must make own place in world before meet then have something to say to mary mother of god blessed saint before throne bless here hereafter charles have nothing to say to lord welter not one word saw that letter be genuine understood that welter have have time to tell of coming that be gone neither welter knew where be likely to know be only bid good bye walked home again when know whole story will think that charles run of ill luck at time be almost incredible will call to witness that be not so be first stroke of real ill luck that have have other misfortune came from mad determination of alienating from friend if have even left lord welter free to have mentioned that have be seen might have gone well made promise secrecy now after having so to speak made ill luck for lamented over here be real stroke of with vengeance did not know be not anxious about ellen future felt sure at once that be going into roman catholic refuge where must be quiet happy in fact with new fancy have in head be almost content to have missed ellen meanwhile never dreamt of position state of mind must have searched out at end of world thought be just a always have be perhaps turning attention to useful career with cuthbert assistance thought must wait wait did went apart not to meet till valley of shadow of death have be passed life be not so well worth having a have be a for old friend father mackworth a said once before be use wondering do wonder whether father mackworth have known how near ellen charles have be to meeting night before must not have whistled lillibulero a uncle toby did in time of dismay be if have known tune chapter xlii ravenshoe hall during villager at ravenshoe who loved charles be very much puzzled put out by sudden disappearance although have little idea of real cause of absence yet be understood to be truth not to be gainsayed that be permanent a be heavily felt misfortune to a really have idea why be gone where be gone to became necessary that must comfort by formula at time master lee up to slarrow erected theory that master charles be gone to indie be found to be doctrine so comfortable to soul of adopted a being hazy vague a leaving return open question that be unanimously adopted who ventured to doubt be treated a heretic heathen be additional puzzle to to find that william have turned out to be gentleman ravenshoe fact must not of course be concealed from though other fact of case be carefully hushed up not very difficult matter in simple feudal village like ravenshoe when william appeared after short absence suffered greatly in popularity from belief that have allowed charles to go to indie by old master james lee of tor head old master james lee of withycombe barton old master james lee up to slarrow three great quidnunc of village be sunning one day under wall divide part of village from shore when by there came talking earnestly together william john marston three old men raised hat courteously be in distinguishable relation to one from similarity of name age always hunted in leash sporting men will notice confusion here about word leash let pas when one be by have heard fall out squabble together about date such like when others be present must so to speak trump one trick to amount if on occasion one of three took up untenable position other two must lie out of like jesuit only fall foul of when be alone together to say least of be neighbourly decent god save gentleman said old master lee up to slarrow who be allowed to commit by other two who be waiting to be down on in private news from indie lately william marston stopped william said master lee have not heard from captain archer for seven month more ask pardon said lee up to slarrow war speaking of be speaking of own darling boy master charles when be coming back to see when indeed said william wish knew master lee indie said old man be well enough what be there no more than other gentleman why come home to own who be keeping on away william john marston walked on without answering then two other master lee fell on to master lee up to slarrow verbally ill treated partly because have got information out of william partly because having sat quiet given plenty of rope have not hanged master lee up to slarrow have evil time of blessed spring afternoon ended by dratting companion for couple of old fool after adjourned to public house hard cider sent to drink for sin will never make scholar of marston said william will go on at for year more will away soon to hunt up charles be there police in america marston answered absently yes believed so be evidently thinking of something else have gone sauntering out for walk together marston have come down from oxford day before after examination for exeter fellowship believe for change of air thought must like to walk with william up to top of lofty promontory bounded ravenshoe bay on west catch pleasant summer breeze coming in from atlantic on loftiest point of with whispering blue sea on three side of four hundred foot below there sat down on short sheep eaten turf looked westward cape after cape stretched away under afternoon sun till last seemed only dark cloud floating on sea beyond cape there be nothing water for three thousand weary mile scene be beautiful enough very melancholy long coastline trending away into dim distance on quiet sunny afternoon be very melancholy indeed far more melancholy than same place in howling gale when nearest promontory only be dimly visible black wall echoing thunder of bursting wave when sea air sky like three fury be rushing on with mad destructive unanimity lay two on short turf looking westward after time john marston broke silence spoke very low quietly without looking at william have something very heavy on mind william be not fool with morbid conscience have be very wrong have done what never can undo loved that fellow william william said ay know what must say must say that one who ever knew charles loved be right be so utterly unselfish so entirely given up to trying to win others one loved must not help cleverest man in england with cleverness must not gain so many friend a charles seemed to think such self evident proposition that did not think while to say anything charles be not clever what make mad with be have influence over abused be not gentle enough with used to make fun of be flippant priggish dictatorial with god help now have taken desperate step in fear of ridicule have not told of felt sure must come to have lost hope now may god forgive god forgive in few moment said if pause to think marston will see how unjust be to must not be afraid of yet have never come near of course not said marston seem hardly to know so well a fear that must make take money that must be burthen on never expected that must come back to know that must never leave know a well a know that must sacrifice time opportunity of education to by being dependent on must be dependent on father mackworth only man in world dislike distrust william uttered form of speech concerning good father be considered by foreigner to be merely harmless national facon de parler sometimes perhaps intensive when participle be used in general more than expletive in case speaker be fear in earnest meant what said most heartily marston never swore certainly did not correct william for swearing in case a must have done there be silence for time after little william laid hand on marston shoulder said never have truer friend than blame do will until find marston said william what have done with where deuce be gone lord saltire be over same problem for two hour other night must make nothing of that be gone to america australia hardly took money enough with to keep till now can make nothing of do think must be likely to seek out welter if be going to do so must have done so by now must have heard of said william be capable of doing very odd thing said marston do remember that easter vacation when lord welter mowbray went away together remember said william why be with glorious fun be rather fast fun though too fast by half went up lived on severn avon canal among bargeman dressing accordingly charles have nothing to do with folly beyond joining in spending day in laughing be lord welter doing bargee nicknamed lord welter sweep ' said be good fellow terrible blackguard so be for time at event marston laughed after time said did ever seem to care about soldiering do think be likely to enlist be possible said william be quite possible yes have often talked to about soldiering mind remember must say that once be hot about going into army gave up because must have taken away from mr ravenshoe too much turned walked homewards without speaking word way on bridge paused leant upon coping looking into stream of sudden william laid hand on marston arm looking in face said day lose feel be getting farther from know what may happen will go seek will get educated at leisure only think of what may be happening now be fool to have given up so soon to have tried waiting till came to will never come must go fetch here be cuthbert too good fellow fretting to death about let go talk to john marston said right true heart let go of acquaintance there be only one who must have given information lord welter of others be very last dreamt of going to begin to see dare say that when charles be found story will nearly be at end story be not near finished yet assure standing where be on bridge must look along village street be a neat street a one ever see in fishing village be to say rather untidy one for of human employment fishing involves more lumber mess than other everything past use be hit a say in berkshire out into street of inorganic part of refuse be to say tile brick potsherd so on child built shop bazaar sold one organic orts be to say cabbage stalk fish bone orange peel be paid for in mussel shell a marston william looked along street a one may say at high market time saw cuthbert come slowly riding along among child dog pig herring bone brickbat be riding noble horse be dressed with usual faultless neatness good taste a clean a new pin from top to toe a came along picking way gently among child fisherman wife came out right left from door greeted kindly in olden time must not have done have got about that be pining for loss of brother heart have warmed to did not take much to make heart warm to ravenshoe though be sturdy independent rogue enough at time be very great admirer of old feudal feeling when be not abused by party in part of australia where something near akin to be very strong indeed have seen act on high low most beneficially giving to one side sense of responsibility to other feeling of trust reliance here be 'captain dash ' blank ' so so ' wo see wronged know have served father for forty year be gentleman so be father before be sort of thing will hear often enough in australia even on digging with leaven of americanism european radicalism one find there be much easier for warden to get on with digger if come of known colonial family than if be unknown man old colonial digger people of greatest real weight talk of others listen mark people prate a may like guarantee for respectability in colony guarantee be given by man being tolerably well off come of decent people in england be given in case by man man forefather having be good landlord honest men such guarantee be given by such people a ravenshoes be not whole secret of influence that come more from association feeling strong enough a one see to make educated clever men use talent eloquence towards keeping school in crowded unhealthy neighbourhood instead of moving into country merely because a far a one can gather from speech be educated at twenty year ago hereby visiting sin of father on child with vengeance somewhat too much of must be stretching point to say that cuthbert be handsome man though be very near being so indeed be tall not too slender for have developed in chest somewhat since first knew face be rather pale complexion perfectly clear save that have black mark round eye feature be decidedly marked not so strongly a charles there be air of stately repose about showing in way of carrying head perfectly upright firm not harsh settling of mouth with lower lip slightly pouting be very attractive be consummate horseman too a said perfectly dressed a came towards looking apparently at nothing william marston thought have never seen finer specimen of gentleman have strangely altered in two month a great change have come over a come over rustic when drill sergeant get make soldier of there be same body same feature same hair eye bill jones be bill jones if be to believe mother bill jones soldier be not bill jones ploughboy be quite different person so since night when charles departed cuthbert have not be cuthbert of former time be no longer wayward irritable be a silent a ever have grown so staid so studiously courteous to one so exceedingly humble minded patient with one save one two wondered at change in have be passionately fond of charles though have seldom shown be terribly cut up at loss have greatly humiliated to by what be certainly felonious offer to father mackworth have found estate somewhat involved have determined to set to work bring to right three cause have made

amusement on face lord ascot william stared like couple of gabies lady ascot have time to make slightest change either in feature position before adelaide dressed for evening in cloud of white pink with bare arm loaded with bracelet swansdown fan hanging from left wrist sailed swiftly into room with outstretched hand bore down on lady ascot began kissing a though old lady be fruit of sort be dove pecking at dearest grandma peck so glad to see peck must help calling in on a went to lady brittlejug how well be looking peck peck can spare ten minute do tell news since saw dear lord ascot be so sorry to hear of illness look better than expected how do do dear lord saltire lord saltire be pretty well be delighted to see lady welter apparently in enjoyment of such health spirit so on aloud secretly lord saltire be wondering what on earth must have brought here perhaps only wanted to take lady ascot by surprise force into recognition of a lady welter lord saw there be something more than that be restless absent with lady ascot eye kept wandering in middle of rattling talk wherever wandered always came back to william of whom have hitherto taken notice whatever have come after for what thought lord wonder if jade know anything of charles lady ascot have steeled against meeting have determined firstly that mortal power must ever induce to set eye on adelaide again secondly that lady ascot must give adelaide piece of mind must never forget to dying day first of rather contradictory determination have be disposed of by adelaide audacity a for second why piece of lady ascot mind be to be given to adelaide be somehow not ready instead of only silent tear withered trembling finger wandered lovingly over beautiful young hand made gaudy bracelet on wrist click one against other what must say brook what must do said lady ascot to maid that night when saw own self come back with own old way love girl more than ever brook believe beat took by surprise must not resist if have proposed to put in wheelbarrow wheel into middle of disgraceful detestable woman brittlejug drawing room there then must have let do believe might have begged for time to put on bonnet must have gone sat there ten minute more talking then said that be time to go that must come see lady ascot on morrow then turned to william to whom have not be introduced asked must see to carriage lord saltire be next bell looking steadily in face raised hand slowly to pull adelaide begged eagerly not to trouble with smile promptly dropped hand out sailed on william arm lord saltire holding door open shutting after with somewhat singular rapidity hope none of fool of servant will come blundering upstairs before have said say remarked aloud give of south african experience mr smith did ever see woman beautiful enough to go clip lion claw singlehanded eh william convoying adelaide downstairs have got no farther than first step when felt hand drawn from arm have got one foot on step below when turned to see cause of adelaide be standing on step above with glorious face bent sternly almost fiercely down on hand from fan hung pointed towards be a beautiful sight a have ever seen calmly wondered what meant perfect mouth be curved in scorn from came sharp ringing word decisive hard clear like sound of hammer on anvil be party to shameful business sir who have taken name place prospect in society who professed a hear to love like life dearer than own who lay on same breast with tell in god name that be sinning in ignorance william a have remarked before have certain amount of shrewdness determined to let go on only said be speaking of charles ravenshoe ay said sharply of charles ravenshoe sir ex stable boy came here to night to beard to ask did know did dare to suffer if have not given answer must have said such thing to a must have made stop ear lord saltire have biting tongue have let hear what mine be when saw among determined to save scene speak to alone shameful william looked quietly at will ladyship remark that of have be moving heaven earth to find charles ravenshoe that have be utterly unable to find if have information about must not be a well to consider that desperation caused by treatment of be principal cause of extraordinary resolution of hiding instead of scolding others who be doing can to give information in power well well said perhaps be right consider rebuked will have goodness saw charles ravenshoe to day to day ay talked to how did look be pale be thin did seem to want money did ask after did send message can take to where be did seem much broken down doe know have be seeking lady welter for god sake do something to repair wrong did take to where be know where be tell saw for just one moment picked up hat in park be dressed like groom came from know not where like ghost from grave did not speak to gave hat be gone know whose groom be think welter know will tell to night dared not ask to day lest must think be going to see when tell where have be describe what have passed here will tell come to to morrow morning will tell will be better have sense enough to see why see thing have seen sister ellen yet thing when ran away with lord welter have idea of what have happened to of miserable esclandre must have known that before if be inclined to do justice come to morrow morning must go now so went to carriage by herself after william stood still on stair triumphant charles be a good a found two clergyman passed on way downstairs bade good night then returned to drawing room said lord lady welter have seen charles to day spoken to with god help will have here with to morrow night be half past eleven what charles in headlong folly stupidity have contrived to do before time must be told in chapter have not patience to wait patience be exhausted one act of folly following so fast must exhaust patience of job if one did not love so well one must not be so angry with will tell here have done with when have left adelaide have gone home with hornby have taken horse to stable have written note to hornby then have packed up bundle of clothes walked quietly off round by st peter church have particular reason for going there except perhaps that poor foolish heart yearned that evening to see one who cared for though be only shoeblack there be still one pair of eye must throw light for one instant into thick darkness be gathering fast around little friend be there charles talked for while at last said will not see again be going to war be going to windsor to enlist in hussar to night will kill said boy most likely said charles so must say good bye mind now go to school at night say that prayer gave on paper must say good bye have better be quick about boy looked at steadily then began to draw breath in long sigh longer longer yet till chest seemed bursting then out came in furious hurricane of tear leant head against wall beat brick with clenched hand be never to see more more more more said charles thought might soften poor boy grief did think too at moment that must go see house where kind old aunt lived before went away for ever so said will be in south audley street to morrow at noon now must not cry dear must say good bye so left thinking to see more once more charles only once more then god help went off night to windsor enlisted in th hussar chapter xlv million so see here be at six seven once more apparently a near end of story a when wrote adventure of alured ravenshoe at court of henry eighth in very first chapter if charles have have little of worthy impudence instead of being shy sensitive fellow be why story must have be over long ago in point of fact know that must ever have be written at so be best a be for party although charles have enlisted in hornby own regiment have craftily calculated that there be not slightest chance of hornby finding out for time hornby troop be at regent park head quarter be at windsor only officer likely to recognise be hornby captain so went to work at new duty with easy mind rather amused than otherwise wondering where when must end from sheer unadulterated ignorance can not follow during first week so of career have suspicion almost amounting to certainty that if must must not believe that reader of ravenshoe must care to hear about sword exercise riding school stable guard so on can however tell thus much that charles learnt duty in wonderfully short space of time be great favourite with high low when went to see adelaide by appointment morning after interview with have interview with lord welter who told in answer to inquiry that charles be groom to lieutenant hornby promised must say nothing about continued think ought lady welter have be persuading to do so if inquiry be made only morning be deuced glad ravenshoe that none of have forgotten must be great shame if have be good fellow have be infernally used by of by for instance william in gladness said never mind lord let bygone be bygone will all be to one a be before please god have found charles at event so there be gap in old circle except father have message for lady welter be not down be really not well morning

welter with lady ascot last night william be obliged to say yes felt a if have committed indiscretion by having said anything about deuce be said lord welter thought be somewhere else tell father will come see to day if think must be too much for ah lord welter must have come before if have known know know must know that have reason for not coming well hope that will be better acquainted in new position be intimate enough in old when william be gone lord welter went up to wife dressing room said lady welter be jewel if go on like will be recognised will die at ranford rich respectable couple if 'ifs ands be pot pan lady welter must do surprisingly well if for instance lord saltire must be got to like something better than mad dog must leave father whole of landed estate cut charles horton whilom ravenshoe off with comparatively insignificant sum of eighty thousand pound amount of funded property eh lady welter adelaide actually bounded from chair be drunk welter said seeing that be third hour of day be not lady welter be fool lord saltire must clear father now if did not know that must be more for benefit than believe must sooner leave money to hospital than see get one farthing of said adelaide eagerly if charles get hold of lord saltire again will have whole old man adores know see now why did never think of before think be like lord barkham son there be time yet if man william ravenshoe come morning must know nothing of charles mind that nothing must not meet may forget mind welter answer be walking up down room rapidly now lord welter be looking at with satirical smile on face lady welter said man william ravenshoe have be here got answer by time charles be receiving lordship blessing fool be that adelaide must say well hardly that said lord welter at least must hardly call so understood position of affair long before be reckless young cub not to have paid lord saltire more court in old time never knew state of affair till very shortly before crash came might have done so in present case have not be fool charles be restored to lord saltire through instrumentality very good basis of operation lady welter at risk of about million of money remarked adelaide there be risk in other course certainly said lord welter for must never have seen farthing of besides lady welter well have attention good may seem strange to who care about one in heaven earth love fellow charles horton always did be worth men ever met put together be glad to have be able to give lift morning even if have not be helping must have done same be comical be not for lord

around like grass surely summons must come soon james be weary weary waiting chapter l shred patch lord welter be now lord ascot be thinking at one time must continue to call by old title a being one most familiar to on second thought prefer to call by real name a see plainly that to follow other course must produce still worse confusion only ask that will bear change of title in mind new lady ascot will continue to call adelaide choosing rather to incur charge of undue familiarity with people so far above in social position than to be answerable for inevitable confusion must be caused by speaking so often a will have to speak of two lady ascot with vast difference between of age character colonel whisker tenant of lord ascot have kindly placed house at disposal of lordship for father funeral never be there more opportune act of civility for ranford be dismantled door of casterton be a firmly closed to adelaide a gate of great mosque at ispahan to christian two three day after lord ascot death be arranged that must be buried at ranford night new lord ascot came to wife dressing room a usual to plot conspire ascot said be asked to casterton for funeral do think will ask oh dear said lord ascot why not said adelaide ought to be civil enough to tell know wo be speaking about to day be looking over shoulder into glass saw bite lip ah said what did say oh came up in infernal cold insolent way said that must be delighted to see at casterton during funeral lady hainault feared that must hardly find room for lady ascot maid did knock down did kick did take by throat knock hateful head against wall said adelaide a quietly a if be saying how d 'ye do dear did said lord ascot partly see because did not know how lord saltire must take remember adelaide always told that must take year year before people of sort must receive what did say to well a much a must expect to say sneered a insolently much more coarsely than must possibly sneer said that declined staying at house where wife be not received so bowed parted adelaide turned round said be kind manly of welter thank for welter so went down to colonel whisker cottage for funeral colonel probably knew quite how land lay for be man of world so have done very good natured action just at right time lord ascot lived for fortnight there in most charming style adelaide used to make laugh by describing what be possible other party be doing up at solemn old casterton used to put nose in air imitate young lady hainault to perfection at time must imitate old lady hainault disagreeable saying equally well be very amusing that fortnight though never affectionate knew be useless tried to keep lord ascot in good humour with have reason wanted to get ear wanted to confide entirely to exact state of affair between lord saltire here be lord ascot dead charles ravenshoe probably at alyden in middle of cholera lord saltire vast fortune so to speak going begging if be to be clumsy now now that link formed by father lord ascot between lord saltire be taken away be ruined indeed be so terribly outspoken so strained wit till face grew sharp thin to keep in good humour have hard task at time for there be something lying up in deserted house at ranford made lord ascot gloomy savage now then when thought of believe that man coarse brutal a be loved father in own way very deeply night so after funeral there be dressing room conference between two a conversation ensued be very important must transcribe carefully when came up to be sitting with hand folded on lap looking so perfectly beautiful that lord ascot astonished anxious a be at moment remarked felt pleased at proud of beauty greater fool than might probably have met with look of love did not only raised great eye to with look of intelligent curiosity drew chair up close to said be going to make hair stand bolt up on end adelaide in spite of bandoline think so said looked startled nevertheless be what do think of think be time newspaper be there anything in read said pointed to list of death read drowned while bathing in ravenshoe bay cuthbert ravenshoe esq of ravenshoe hall in faith that forefather bled died for rip poor fellow said quietly so be gone brother william groom reign in stead be piece of nonsense of priest about dying for faith never heard that of did that also be there something wrong about grammar ca say said lord ascot be at eton have advantage that have of learning english grammar did ever play game of trying to read time right across from one column to see what funny nonsense make must think be good fun do now did exactly opposite announcement of cuthbert death be advertisement have seen before lord saltire advertisement for missing register be attentive eager enough now after time said oho lord ascot said hey what do think of lady ascot be abroad will see if can fetch home again petre ravenshoe in married milkmaid remembered duty of position so far a to conveniently die before of family knew what fool have made of so far forgot a to give birth to boy who lived to be one of best shot one of jolliest old cock ever saw old james ravenshoe keeper now dearly beloved grandmother ascot be at present speaking le than eighty six year old so at time of occurrence be remarkably shrewd girl of ten appears that petre ravenshoe sneaking away here there with pretty protestant wife out of way of priest finding life unendurable not having have single chance to confess sin for two long year came to good natured sir cingle headstall grandmamma papa opened grief trying to persuade to break matter to fox hunting old turk of father of howard sir cingle be too cowardly to face old man for time before pair of must summon courage to speak poor young thing died at manger hall where have be staying with headstall month solved difficulty nothing be said about matter petre went home have heard report about living with woman having have baby born asked very few question about child mother of course be forgotten conveniently long before marriage with grandaunt lady alicia staunton came on tapis took place in when grandma be fourteen year of age now grandma have a girl of ten heard marriage of petre ravenshoe with maria dawson discussed in presence from point of view by father petre night morning at bed time at meal time sober very frequently drunk have heard possible particular when heard of second marriage mouth be a dry a dust with talking ring bell send maid down for claret water when heard of second marriage never dreamt of saying anything of course chit of fourteen with great liability to having ear boxed so held tongue when afterwards grandfather made love to held tighter for grandaunt sake of whom be fond petre after time have boy james home to ravenshoe kept about own person made gamekeeper treated with marked favour so on whole thing be sort of misprision of felony poor silly old grandma be party to be telling very well ascot said adelaide will a reward go so far out of usual habit a to mix claret water be not going to be tender know will do so much now that be dear good fellow go on now come something unimportant inexplicable old lady hainault knew held tongue how why be mystery can not fathom want to grandma say that must have married petre that hatred for grandma came from belief that grandma must have stopped marriage with grandaunt by speaking after be over think that lady hainault have sufficient love left for petre to hold tongue be nothing to purpose james real heir of ravenshoe married english girl daughter of steward on one of irish estate who have be born in ireland be called nora be see irish enough at heart for committed bull of changing own child poor dear charles real heir for youngest cousin william by way of bettering position then confessed whole matter to priest now new discovery must blow honest priest boat out of water yes why grandma ca for life of remember where be married be certain that be in north of hampshire say why wherefore ca say say resided necessary time be married by license say be sure of because heard more than once say to father that have be so careful of poor maria honour that sent from ravenshoe to house of clergyman who married who be friend of farther than know nothing hence advertisement then why be not inserted before why appears that when whole esclandre took place when lady ascot jilted poor fellow for man who be not worth little finger communicated with lord saltire at once result be that began advertising in so mysterious manner that advertisement be wholly unintelligible appears that lord saltire agreed not to disturb cuthbert till be perfectly sure of everything now be dead lord saltire have insisted on instantly advertising in sensible way so see advertisement appears actually in same paper contains cuthbert death news of william got night before last by telegraph william eh how doe like cup being dashed from lip like lord ascot laughed that ex groom be born fool lady ascot love foster brother better than nine thousand year lady ascot be going to start to varna hunt through army bring back be incredible said adelaide know might have be fool once who know who know indeed thought adelaide who know now so said aloud charles be heir of ravenshoe after yes be foolish to jilt be be alyden healthy know be not fellow be dying like dog do know what regiment be in think from lady hainault mary corby description that be th why did not william start on expedition before know new impulse have written to sort of commanding officer wo turn up till chooses if know right if william brings back why then will come into nine more probably twelve thousand year for tin lode have turned up trump whole of lord saltire property suppose so remain beggar suppose so said lord ascot be time to go to bed lady ascot be exactly proper place to give result of william expedition to varna arrived there just after army have gone forward men be left behind invalided among whom be two three of th one of william selected a being likely man from whom to make inquiry be young man likely enough kind hearted one when found inquired of by handsome well dressed young gentleman obviously in search of missing relative lying spirit entered into lied horribly appeared that have be intimate cherished comrade of charles horton of whom have never heard in life that have ridden together drunk together slept side by side that have nursed through cholera then seeing other way out of maze of falsehood in have entangled that assisted to bury with own hand lastly lying on through mere recklessness into desperation so into kind of sublimity led out of town pointed out to charles untimely grave when saw william pick dry grass from grave when saw down on knee with cheek on earth then be sorry for what have done when be alone saw william shadow pas across blazing white wall for one instant before went under dark gateway of town then chinking gold piece

mountain woodland more so a have got about among men that be only to take sebastopol by sudden attack in rear spend winter there there must be work for cavalry one said be just worthy of notice how when one once begin vagabond life one get attached to place where one may chance to rest even for week when one get accustomed to change of locality day for long while week pause give one more familiarity with place than month residence in strange house must give if one be habitually stationary remark be almost platitude just worth writing down charles liked devna have got used to parted from a must from home brings up to point where after death burial have described a riding along shore of bay of eupatoria watching fleet th have very little to do be on extreme left on seventeenth thought be going to have work for saw of lancer coming in driving lot of cattle before about cossack hanging on rear when light dragoon rode leisurely out to support cossack rode off th be still condemned to inactivity hornby have recovered be with regiment have not recognised charles of course even if have come face to face with be almost unlikely that must have recognised in moustache be not to meet a yet in evening of nineteenth there be rumble of artillery over hill in front of died away in hour most of rest of cavalry be further to front of extreme left be at so be understood with cossack th be still idle on morning of twentieth charles rest of sitting in saddle heard gun booming in front on right became understood among men that fleet be attacking battery also be whispered that russian be going to stand fight charles be sixth man from right of rear rank of third troop must see tail of horse immediately before must remark that front rank man have great patch of oil on right shoulder of uniform must also see hornby in troop before gun went moaning on in distance till half past one still sat there idle about time there be new sound in air close on right made prick up ear look at one even head of column must have seen nothing for be behind hill must hear guess know that sound well enough now hear now thank god on village green in england when cricket be over crack crack crack crack noise of advancing skirmisher so grew from right towards front towards left till air be filled with shrill treble of musketry then a french skirmished within reach of artillery deep bass roared up men who dared not whisper before must shout at one without rebuke louder again a artillery came into range air be tortured with concussion charles must have given ten year of life to know what be going on on other side of hill there sat have to look at back of man before at time came to conclusion that patch of grease on right shoulder be of same shape a map of sweden long weary two hour more be spent like charles by looking forward to right between two right hand men of troop before must see ridge of hill see smoke rising from beyond drifting away to left before sea breeze saw aide de camp come over ridge dismount beside captain of hornby troop loosening girth laughed together then captain shouted to hornby laughed waved sword over head after be reduced to watching back of man before studying map of sweden be becoming evident that map of north america if existed must be on left shoulder under hussar jacket that pacific island must be round in front about left breast when word be given to go forward advanced to top of hill wheeled charles for one instant have glimpse of valley below seething roaring like volcano everywhere bright flash of flame single running along in line blazing out in volley smoke driven to left by wind hung across valley like curtain on opposite hill ring of smoke fire in front of thin scarlet line disappearing be next moment wheeled to right charles saw only back of man before patch of grease on shoulder that night be night of spur for hard riding for far into night field of alma have be won be ordered forward to harass cossack who be covering rear of russian army never got near ever after when battle of alma be mentioned before charles at once used to begin thinking of map of sweden chapter lii what lord saltire father mackworth said when looked out of window how do do dear sir said lord saltire enjoy same perfect health a ever thank lord said mackworth allow to say that be glad to see lordship looking just same a ever may have forgotten that be greatest benefactor that ever have have not nay nay said lord saltire let bygone be bygone dear sir by bye mr mackworth lord hainault be delighted to see at casterton mr mackworth said lord hainault be such rabid protestant here that mere presence of catholic ecclesiastic of kind be source of pleasurable excitement to when however get among man like man of whose talent have heard so much man personally endeared to through love bore to one of who be dead give threefold welcome lord saltire used in tete tetes with lady ascot to wish to gad that hainault must cure of making speech be one of best fellow in world must always talk a if be in house of lord be very true about lord hainault although might be little stilted in speech meant word said be affectionate good hearted man withal clever one father mackworth bowed be pleased with compliment nerve be in perfect order be glad to find that lord hainault be well inclined towards though just at time most noble marquis of hainault be of le importance to than one of groom in stable what required of just now be to act look in particular way to do naturally without effort genius rose to situation puzzled lord saltire be sad business said lord saltire bitter business said mackworth loved that man lord looked suddenly up a said lord saltire saw that be in earnest waited for to go on watching intently with eyelid half dropped over grey eagle eye be not of much consequence though said mackworth speaking to man of world what be more to purpose be to hear what be reason of lordship having sought interview be very anxious to know so if appear rude must crave forgiveness lord saltire looked at minutely steadily how mackworth looked be of more importance to lord saltire than what said on other hand mackworth now then calmly steadily raised eye to lord saltire kept fixed there while spoke to not at dear sir said lord saltire if will have business first however be possibly best plan will have improve acquaintance afterwards asked to come to to speak of family matter have seen advertisement have indeed said mackworth looking up with smile be utterly taken by surprise do think that can be right about marriage oh be sure of said lord saltire can not believe said mackworth will tell why if ever took place must have heard of father clifford predecessor be petre ravenshoe confessor need not tell that must have be in possession of fact knowledge of world will tell how impossible be that in house so utterly priest ridden a house of ravenshoe affair of such moment must be kept from knowledge of father confessor especially when delinquent if may so express be most foolishly bigoted cowardly representative of house have appeared for many generation assure upon honour that clifford must have known if have known of must have communicated to priest must possibly have died without leaving secret to successor secret must make owner of be priest so completely master of ravenshoe in confessed that man on death bed lord said mackworth looking quietly at lord saltire with smile can only tell if can bring to believe priest that there be not one word said about marriage said lord saltire pensively looking out of window yet lady ascot seems so positive sincerely hope said mackworth that may be wrong must be sad thing for be comfortable happy at ravenshoe poor dear cuthbert have secured position there during lifetime present mr ravenshoe be not so tractable a brother can get on well enough with in case of story being true mr charles horton coming back position must be untenable ravenshoe must be in protestant hand for first time in history must lose home church must lose one of best house in west best in fact have sooner be at ravenshoe than at segur be very much pleased at lordship having sought conference show have trust in to consult upon matter in own interest be on one side lord saltire bowed there be way to look at matter too dear sir if prove case be possible in case of poor dear charles dying getting killed be probable why then william come in for estate again suppose now such possibility a dying without heir why then miss ravenshoe be greatest heiress in west of england have idea where miss ravenshoe be lord saltire lord hainault turned on a former said for instant mackworth looked inquiringly from one to other with lip slightly parted said miss ravenshoe then gave half smile of intelligence said ah yes be puzzled for moment yes in case poor ellen must be miss ravenshoe yes estate must remain in catholic hand what prospect for church penitent heiress management of l year forgive being carried away for moment know be enthusiastic churchman have be bound body soul to church from child such prospect even in such remote perspective have dazzled be afraid will see rather large family of ravenshoes between consummation william be going to marry then know where poor ellen be said lord saltire said mackworth certainly will try to discover most certainly will succeed william might die on very expedition might prove case if anything be to happen to william most certainly hope may will give assistance for loaf be better than bread besides charles also might be killed die of cholera a be will not move in matter will not help to bring protestant to ravenshoe now think heartless man for talking like be nothing of kind be talking to two very shrewd men of world talk a man of world be at point lord hainault said what be left room lord saltire mackworth be alone together now dear sir said lord saltire be glad have spoken merely a man of world make matter so much easier must help if must mackworth laughed of course must lord must bring whole force of catholic church at back to give assistance with power of organisation must discover about marriage in time if ever took place choose to believe just now why must pay to search minutely register in england if be to keep house in hand of church catholic church in poor person politely decline to move vast machinery to give away one of best house to protestant never supposed that dear old lady must do anything of kind a for mr mackworth will nothing induce to move vast machinery in cause be attention lord in case of finding charles then yes said mackworth calmly twenty thousand said mackworth must do twenty million must do see there be difference between soldier disguising going into enemy camp to lie may be murder to gain information for own side same soldier deserting to enemy giving information one be hero other rogue be hero must forgive for putting matter so coarsely distrust so entirely that be forced to do so think have put so coarsely said lord saltire have to ask forgiveness for offer of money have so nobly refused say man have

father mackworth be paragraph last be written in imitation of shandean southey doctorian style imitation be bad one find approach nearer to lower style known among critic a swivellerism consists in saying first thing come into head style must be quite allowable merely a rest to one aching brain after dreadfully keen encounter between lord saltire father mackworth recorded above when mackworth have closed library door behind looked at for moment a if to see be safe then whole face underwent change grew haggard anxious a parted lip to moisten lower one trembled eye seemed to grow more

mistress mackworth living there a master penitential devotee clever man for confessor twelve thousand year if jesuit be such villain a protestant try to make out master william must be unwise to live

neat in good taste from conversation must guess that be sailor unless in very select circle where must if thought pleased amused talk salt water by yard reason why have written to mary in following style be that knew loved wished to make laugh lord saltire set down for mad seaman nothing more will see that have so thoroughly obscured what meant to say that left mary with very natural impression that be going to propose to have done said from port philip head in sixty four day at last in consequence of one of young gentleman merchant midshipman having stole black cat in flinder lane brought

good blundering archer be going to propose to if give against declare that there be nothing in above letter leading to conclusion can only say that lord saltire went with with regarded letter a written preparatory to proposal archer dismay when afterwards let know be delightful to behold wife be put in possession of fact by one who will be nameless have heard that jolly soul use information against in most telling manner on critical occasion before captain archer came there came letter from william from varna announcing charles death of cholera there be melancholy scene more than enough in book ala one more to come so may spare description of woe at intelligence know to be false letter be closely followed by william who showed grass from grave helped to confirm impression of truth however unreasonable lord saltire have correspondence with horse guard long windy resulted after month in discovering that man have enlisted in th under name of horton proved nothing for charles might have enlisted under false name yet might have be known by real name to intimate comrade lord saltire wrote to general mainwaring by time letter reached that have happened made easy for fool to count

only have known if must only have have ten minute talk together charles must have known that know about previous marriage of grandfather if conversation have taken place must have known more than of for hornby knew something thought of importance be very important indeed knew where ellen be charles turned face away recognition did not take place poor charles said afterwards that be piece of luck that star in course fought against sisera be not case turned away eye avoided recognition what meant be a hornby face be touching be bending over dead man whom must hardly believe to be dead men

think that there be faint gleam of consciousness in delirium in first say be lying on back above be mast spar of ship sailor boy be sitting out on yard in clear blue mending rope doing something may have be dream not afterwards there be period distinctly remembered when seemed conscious conscious of pain space time to certain extent at time began to understand in way that be dead in hell delirium be better than at ordinary time in spite of headlong incongruity be not so unbearable save at time when there came feeling too horrible for human brain to bear of being million million of mile of century away with road back at such time there be nothing to be done to leap out of bed cry aloud for help in god name then there came time when began at interval to see great vaulted arch overhead to wonder whether be roof of pit began after studying matter many time to find pain have ceased that great vaulted arch be real heard low voice once at time blessed voice of fellow men be content to wait at last soul consciousness seemed to return to in strange way seemed to pas out of abnormal state into natural one for became aware that be alive nay more that be asleep dreaming silly pleasant dream that must wake at time awoke expecting to awake in old room at ravenshoe be not there looked round in wonder arch remembered be overhead that be real enough three people be round bed doctor in undress

education whatever vicar have taught catechism prayer after shrewsbury oxford read on condemn at least not yet that thanked god with earnestness of warm heart night remembered that name doctor told may be sure when prayer be finished began to think whether be sincere whether must not be better that must die that must be over done creed be that if died in faith of christ bearing ill will to one having repented of sin must not go ill with must not be better to die now that must fulfil condition not tempt horrible black future certainly in time left watching great arch overhead creeping shadow patch of light on wall shaped into faint rhomboid at noon crept on till defined into perfect square at sundown then grew golden died out began to notice other thing till last there be one effect of light shadow always lay awake to see faint flickering on wall roof came slowly nearer till light be in eye know what be have be described twenty time can believe that story of dying man kissing shadow on wall when miss nightingale lamp be forgotten will be time to consider whether one must prefer to turn turk mormon began to take notice that there be men in bed beside one a know have be carried out
