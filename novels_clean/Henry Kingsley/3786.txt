done yet be only secondary object to amusement main village of drumston be about mile from church have before noticed consisted of narrow street of cob house whitewashed thatched crossing at right angle by little stone bridge over pretty clear trout stream around village immediately behind back of house rose abrupt red hill divided into field by broad oak hedge thickly set with elm water of stream intercepted at point higher up be carried round crown of hill for purpose of irrigation even at dead season showed advantage by brilliant emerald green of tender young grass on hill side

common place civility challenged james to play let show muff what play be said be disgrace to county to see such work james have objection so having put on jacket set to work to great admiration of bystander one of whom drunken tinker expressed applause in such remarkable language mildly asked to desist of course made worse two wrestler made very pretty play of for time till james feinting at outlandish manoeuvre put george on back by simple trip akin to scholar mate at chess george fell heavily for be heavy men rose from ground walked to where coat be sulkily james thinking might have be hurt went up to speak to other greeting with oath turned walked away through crowd be in furious passion went on to little bridge crossed stream saw standing looking into water below when short light

treacherous young sweep will hang for be lee first word ten thousand pound must not save now dick be jewel if have listened to must have trusted life to murdering vagabond will remember to night boy a long a live although appeared at first ten thousand pound must not prevent lee handing george over to justice yet after long stormy argument appeared that lesser sum of five hundred must be amply sufficient to stay ulterior proceeding provided money be forthcoming in week so that ultimately george found at liberty again to great astonishment in higher spirit than must have expected at event said to a limped back lame bruised have not got that on mind even if other thing be found out there be chance of getting off surely own father must prosecute though must like to trust to unless got madge on side father think have mentioned be too blind to read george used to keep account so that nothing must seem at first to look more easy than to imitate father signature obtain what money wished george knew well that old man be often in habit of looking through banker book with assistance of madge so that be quite unsafe without former embezzlement have kept secret by altering figure in banker book next one of much larger amount felt somewhat anxious about however knew woman well took measure accordingly on day mentioned met lee gave money agreed on having received assurance that

peaceful bathed in misty halo of afternoon sunshine familiar sight sound be same be different be about to break rudely through from old world of simple routine homely pleasure to cast unthinking into new world of passion chance take consequence of such step let be what might felt a if be possessor of guilty secret felt sometimes a if one must rise in church denounce how must all quiet folk talk of to morrow morning be not to be thought of must harden heart think of nothing only that tomorrow must be far away with lover poor mary many woman many man who sat so quiet calm in old church afternoon have far guiltier secret than ever have to trouble yet drank slept died a quietly a many honest good men poor girl let judge a kindly of a can for paid fearful penalty for self will did break through prejudice of education may say if be undutiful what girl be not under influence of passion if such poor excuse a will cause to think more kindly of let make leave rest to god perhaps brother may stand

there be nothing to do to wait for end a patiently a might be during summer got out of bed sat in chair tom used to lift dexterously into verandah there must sit very quietly sometimes getting mr buckley who came lived at toonarbin summer to read hymn for during time told where must like to be buried on little knoll said lay to right of house barely two hundred yard from window here grass grew

went home to quarter comrade thought be father who be dead when heard be only sister old governess wondered exceedingly for fred said be not given to be sentimental now in year two began to be very difficult to keep master charley in order when be about thirteen there be regular guerilla war between mother on subject of learning ended ultimately in boy flatly refusing to learn anything natural capacity be small under circumstance knowledge must only have be acquired by with infinite pain a be with selfishness fostered so excessively by mother indulgence tom good humoured carelessness became totally impossible to teach anything in vain mother scolded wept in vain tom represented to beauty excellence of learning learn boy must not so that at fourteen be given up in despair by mother having learnt nearly enough of reading writing ciphering to carry on most ordinary business of life most lamentable state of thing for lad who in after life must be rich man who in young rapidly rising country might become by help of education politically influential think that when samuel buckley james brentwood be grown to be young men of eighteen nineteen be about seventeen so stranger must have seen great deal of difference between two former latter must probably have remarked that james sam spoke behaved like two gentleman that charles did not seemed a though have come from lower grade in society with truth too for there be circumstance in bringing up brought more harm than neglect of learning mother foolish indulgence major buckley captain brentwood made law of medes persian that of son must hold conversation with convict servant save in presence of competent authority indeed a soon a increased emigration enabled removed old household servant replaced by free men newly arrived lazy independent class certainly with exaggerated notion of own importance in new phase of life without worse vice of convict rule even in such well regulated household be very hard one to get observed even under flogging penalty indeed formed staple affliction of poor thoughtless jim early life a little anecdote will show one day going to see captain brentwood when jim be about ten year old met that young gentleman looking thought little out of sort about two hundred yard from house turned with to go back after first salutation said well jim boy hope have be good since saw last oh

what must do eh must tell about said ah then will catch again see have better wait till wale be gone down must if be answered 'd tell at once wonder why be so particular said jim delisles donovans spend a much of time in hut a do in house fine young blackguard will turn out said in be right in two instance although have seen young fellow brought up among convict who have turned out respectable in end yet be not promising school for good citizen at toonarbin such precaution a be taken with regard to charles tom be too careless mary too indulgent be hard enough to restrain boy during lesson hour falsely so called after that be allowed to go where liked even mother sometimes felt relieved by absence so that be continually in men hut listening to yarn sometimes harmless bush adventure sometimes perhaps ribald story must not understand one day tom troubridge coming by hut looked in quietly saw master charles smoking black pipe be not more than fourteen heard conversation going on that advanced suddenly upon ordered boy home in sterner tone than have ever used to before looked out of door till have disappeared then turned round to men there be three of convict one of whom one have heard talking when came in be large desperate looking fellow when men mean to deprecate anger have remarked always look blankly in face if mean to defy be impudent never look at always begin fumbling fidgetting with something so when tom saw that big man before mentioned daniel harvey by name be stooping down before fire knew be going to have row waited so bos began ruffian not looking at ai fit company for like of kinchin eh be not fit company for man except hangman said tom looking more like six foot six than six foot three oh colonial oath said other oh 'cabbage tree ' so there be going to be coil about scrubby little myrnonger eh fret bingy bos will be a good man a father yet for instant dark shadow passed over tom face so thought fellow know about george hawker eh well never mind what odds if do then said aloud turning round on harvey look here dog if ever hear of talking in style before boy other boy by george will twist head off advanced towards a if to perform feat on spot in moment convict have snatched knife from belt rushed upon very suddenly indeed not quite quick enough to take champion of devon by surprise ere be well within reach tom have seized hand held knife with backward kick of left foot sent embryo assassin sprawling on back on top of fire whence tom dragged by heel far more astonished than burnt other two men have meanwhile sat taking notice seeming to take none of disturbance now however one of spoke said be sure sir did hear say nothing wrong to young gent so on in whining tone till tom cut short by saying that if have more nonsense among must send three over to captain desborough to tune of fifty lash piece after little emeute charles did not dare to go into hut soon after three men be exchanged there remained one man whose conversation teaching though not perhaps so openly outrageously villanous a of worthy harvey still have very unfortunate effect on character be rather small wiry active man by name jackson native

so have happened deuce of job be here sit to deliberate what be to be done with regard to so so did not laugh however bit lip stopped then rose leaning great shoulder against mantelpiece stood before

abraham cann kicked leg from under that unlucky easter monday deuce curl hair for doing never forgave till heard of fine bit of play with polkinghorn yes must have known lee lit fire while tom blowing out candle drew curtain so that one outside must not see into room nevertheless left french window open then went outside secured dog in dog house night be wonderfully still dark a paused before entering house must hear bark falling from tree quarter of mile off opossum scratching snapping little twig a passed from bough to bough somewhere apparently at immense distance morepork be chanting monotonous cry frog in creek be silent even so hot be night good night for watching said to lee when came in lie down will take first watch blew out candle lee be in act of lying down when arrested held up finger to tom listened motionless in silence until must hear spider creeping on ceiling there be again stealthy step on gravel troubridge lee crouched down breathless one minute two five did not come again at length moved a if by concert lee said 'possum not bit said troubridge then lee lay down again slept in light of flickering fire one giant arm be thrown around head other hung down in careless grace great chest be heaved up head thrown back seamed rugged feature seemed more stern marked than ever in chiaroscuro whole man be picture of reckless strength such a one seldom see tom have dozed have awoke again now sat thinking what terrible tough customer that fellow must be when suddenly crouched on floor reaching out hand touched lee who woke silently rolled over with face towards window there be mistake time be opossum there came stealthy step again now a lay silent glass door be pushed gently open showing landscape beyond gibbous moon be just rising over forest blurred with streaky cloud between light must see figure of man standing inside room tom must wait no longer started up fell headlong with crash over little table stood in way dashed into garden only in time to hear flying footstep immediately after gallop of horse echo of soon died away be still missed by george said lee be precious close thing though what must mean by coming into house eh just a expected trying to get interview with mistress will be more cautious in future take wonder if will try again know said troubridge might not to night however went in lay down again troubridge be soon asleep very soon that sleep be disturbed by dreadful dream at one time thought be riding madly through bush for bare life spurring on tired horse be failing moment more more always through tree stem on right saw glancing ghost on white horse kept pace with do what must now be among precipice on range on left lofty inaccessible cliff on right frightful blue abyss while slaty soil kept sliding from beneath horse foot behind unseen came phantom always gaining on driving along giddiest wallaby track if must only turn face might conquer dare not at length path grew narrower narrower turned in desperation awoke woke to see in dim morning light dark figure bending over sprang up clutched by throat most excellent fellow said voice of doctor mulhaus sends frantic midnight message for friend to come to regardless of personal convenience horseflesh when friend come quietly in try to wake without disturbing sick folk seizes by throat nearly throttle beg thousand pardon doctor said tom have be dreaming took for devil be glad to find mistake have good reason said doctor now how be patient asleep at present believe housekeeper be with what be matter with have have great blow have shaken intellect be afraid what sort of blow asked doctor tom hesitated did not know whether to tell not nay said doctor have better let know can help then know now for instance have heard of husband have doctor how on earth came to guess that mere guess though have always thought quite possible a account of death be very uncertain tom then set to work told doctor that know looked very grave be far worse than have thought said remained thoughtful mary awoke in fever delirious kept charles a much from a possible lest must let drop hint of matter to boy even in delirium kept secret well towards evening doctor finding quieter saddled horse rode away ten mile to township where resided drunken surgeon one of greatest blackguard in country surgeon be at home be drunk of course always be hardly more so to day than usual so doctor hoped for success in object be to procure certain drug be in medicine chest at buckleys at toonarbin putting on sweetest smile when surgeon came to door made remark about beauty of weather to other very gruffly responded come to beg favour said doctor mulhaus can let have little so so see d d first be polite reply man come matter of fourteen thousand mile make pretty little practice then get cut into by parcel of ignorant foreigner whose own country be too hot to hold not content with have brass to ask for loan of man drug a said before will see d d first then wo so saying slammed door doctor mulhaus be beside with rage for first last time since have known forgot discretion instead of going away quietly treating man with contempt began kicking at door calling man scoundrel c between interval of kicking roaring through keyhole bring out diploma do hear impostor then fell to work kicking again bring out forged diploma will villain soon attracted idler from public house couple of sawyer shepherd two tipsy of course except one of sawyer who be drunk drunken sawyer at length made out to own complete satisfaction that doctor mulhaus ' wife be in labour that be come for surgeon who be probably drunk asleep inside so being able to sympathize having have wife in straw thirteen month regularly for last fifteen year prepared to assist for purpose took stone about hundredweight coming behind doctor when be in full kick balanced with difficulty sent at lock with force of arm of course broke door in in throwing stone lost balance came full butt against dr mulhaus propelled into passage into arm of surgeon who be rushing out infuriated to defend property down went three in passage together two doctor beneath drunken sawyer on top of drunken surgeon if to use parliamentary language will allow to call so be of course underneath others being londoner consequently knowing use of fist ere went down delivered one two straight from shoulder in poor dear doctor face gave most disreputable black eye besides cutting upper lip open doctor being must remember foreigner not having rule of british ring before eye resented by getting on top of taking round throat banging back of head against brick floor of passage until began to goggle eye choke meanwhile sawyer exhilarated beyond measure in drunken mind at having raised real good promising row having turned on back lay procumbent upon twain kicking everything soft human came across with heel struck up bay of biscay oh until be dragged forth by two of friend being in state of wild excitement ready to fight world hit own mate violent blow in eye be only quieted by receiving sound thrashing being placed in sitting posture in verandah of public house from saw doctor mulhaus come forth from surgeon with rumpled feather triumphant be deeply grieved to have recorded above scene must not omit having undertaken to place character of very noble gentleman doctor mulhaus before reader be forced not to omit a general rule be a self contained a calm a frigid a best englishman among under there be to speak in carefullyselected scientific language substratum of pepper box have be apparent to on more than one occasion have noticed above occasion per force let others rest in oblivion man so true so wise so courteous so kindly need not poor excuse for having once in way made fool of will read will be angry with for time know well that like who knew say heartily god bless old doctor consequence of above be be sorry to say eminently disastrous surgeon got warrant against doctor mulhaus for burglary with violence doctor got warrant against for assault with intent to rob so there be deuce to pay affair got out of hand of bench in fact sent party for trial what do think of lord campbell in order to ge rid of matter at session surgeon swore positively that doctor mulhaus have assisted by convict battered door down with stone in open day nearly murdered then in defence

confusion horror swore positively that never took stone in hand on day in question that never saw stone for week before after date that did not deny having rushed into passage to assist complainant drunken surgeon seeing being murdered by defendant lastly that be never near place on day specified so must have gone hard with doctor have not honour called jury attention to discrepancy in witness evidence when dr mulhaus be acquitted delivered stinging reproof to magistrate for wasting public time by sending trumpery case to jury on other hand dr mulhaus charge of assault with intent fell dead

flaunting in gaudiest green atmosphere be so amazingly pure that mile away across plain traveller must distinguish herd of turkey bustard stalking to fro while before that noble maritime mountain cape chatham towered up sharply defined above gleaming haze marked distant sea for time way lay straight across broad well grassed plain marked with ripple a though retiring sea have just left then green swamp through tall reed native companion king of crane waded majestic brilliant porphyry water hen with scarlet bill leg flashed like sapphire among emerald green water sedge willow lake dotted with wild duck here there group of wild swan black with red bill floating calmly on bosom long stretch of grass a smooth a bowling green sudden rocky rise clothed with native cypress exocarpus oh botanical reader honeysuckle banksia oak casuarina here there stunted gum cape chatham began to show grander nearer topping soon saw broad belt of brown sandy heath lay along shore here said doctor riding up leave last limit of lava stream from mirngish organ hill now immediately will see how pas from richly grassed volcanic plain into barren sandstone heath from productive pasture land into useless flower garden nature here be economical a always be make choicest ornamental effort on spot otherwise useless will see greater variety of vegetation on one acre of sandy heath than on two square mile of thickly grassed country have be passing over be a said came soon on to heath dark dreary expanse dull to look upon after so long journey upon bright green grass stretched away right left interminably only broken here there with island of dull coloured tree a melancholy piece of country a one must conceive yet far more thickly peopled with animal a well a vegetable life than rich pastoral down further inland now began to see little red brush kangaroo grey forester skipping away in direction have be summer must have be startled more than once by brown snake copper snake deadliest of tribe painted quail brush quail largest of australian game bird believe whirred away from beneath horse foot ground parrot green with mottling of gold black rose like partridge from heather flew low here too doctor flushed white thrush close to outlying belt of forest got into great state of excitement about only known bird said be found in europe america australia alike then pointed out emu wren little tiny brown fellow with long hairy tail feather flitting from bush to bush then leaving ornithology called attention to wonderful variety of low vegetation that be riding through hakea acacia grevillea what not in spring brown heath must have be brilliant mass of flower now nothing be to be seen save few tall crimson spike of epacris here there bunch of lemon coloured correas altogether kept so well amused that be astonished to come so quickly upon station placed in snug cove of forest where bordered on heath beside sluggish creek then seeing mountain towering up close to hearing a stayed at door low continuous thunder behind high roll in heath lay before knew that old ocean be close at hand journey be done people at station be very glad to see of course barker paterfamilias be old friend of major captain found so much to talk about after heavy midday meal excellent in kind though kind be coarse certain libation of pale ale cold claret water older of

marrying man sam be so very very glad have won now wear like pearl beyond price think that be worthy of more than must not be shook hand soon sam be at side again toiling up steep ascent soon distanced others went forward by there be such rise in ground seaward that broad ocean be invisible till be way up grassy down then right left began to see nether firmament stretching away infinitely happy lover paused not till stood upon loftiest breezy knoll seemed alone together between blue cloudless heaven azure sphere lay beneath foot cloudless sky sailless sea far beneath heard saw not eternal surge gnawing at mountain few white albatross skimmed sailed below before seaward sheet of turf falling away stretched into shoreless headland fringed with black rock snow white surf stood there flushed excited with exercise bright hair dishevelled waving in free sea breeze most beautiful object in glorious landscape noble mate beside awe wonder admiration kept of silent for few moment then spoke do know of chorus in beessiah asked said sam be rather sorry for said because be so very like of can quite imagine said sam can quite imagine music express what see now something infinitely broad must say be that nonsense now not to said alice imagined said sam that sea must be much rougher than in spite of ceaseless thunder below there be very calm calm eh said doctor voice behind god

groundswell in world off coast must country ever have large coast trade will find out in calm weather with anchorage great coasting trade have arisen doctor remark have proved terribly true let monumental city schomberg duncan dunbar catherine adamson bear witness to let drowning cry of hundred of good sailor who have be missed never more heard of bear witness that be most pitiless unprotected even in calm weather most dangerous coast in world jim came panting up throwing on short turf said so be great southern ocean eh how far can one see now halbert about thirty mile how far to india eh about seven thousand long way said jim however not so far a to england fancy said halbert one of old dutch voyager driving on unknown coast on dark night what sudden end to voyage yet must have happened to many ship have never come home perhaps when come to explore coast little more may find old ship rib jammed on reef rib of ship whose name memory have perished very thing mention be

shipwrecked mariner last of crew shipwrecked mariner must hardly wear breech boot dear doctor said jim that man be stockman not one of ours however said george barker even at distance can see see be gone strange know of way down cliff thereabouts must like to come down to shore so began descent to shore by winding path of turf among tumbled heap of granite down towards rock walled cove horseshoe of smooth white sand lying between two long black reef among whose isolated pinnacle groundswell leapt spouted ceaselessly halbert remarked granite coast be hardly so remarkable a cornish one there be none of queer pinnacle tor one see there just ready to topple down into sea granite be not half so fantastic earthquake of have none in cornwall said doctor will just account for difference have felt one near here quite a strong a famous lieutenant who capsized logan stone now getting on level sand fell to gathering shell sea weed like child jim trying to see how near must get to wave without being caught got washed up like jetsam alice took sam pocket handkerchief filled indiscriminately with everything must lay hand on principally trochuses a big a one fist venus ear scarlet outside after hour wetfooted happy dragging yard so of sea tang behind looked round for doctor saw far out on reef lying flat on stomach closely examining large still pool of salt water contained in crevice of rock held up hand beckoned sam alice advanced towards over slippery bed of seaweed sam bravely burying foot in wet cleft holding out hand to help along once there be break in reef too broad to be jumped then for first time have fairly in arm swung across be undoubtedly very delightful unfortunately soon over at length however reached doctor who be seated like cormorant on wet rock lighting pipe what have collected asked show alice proudly displayed inestimable treasure contained in sam handkerchief rubbish rubbish said doctor do believe in mermaidens of course do if wish said alice have seen one here be one of flower garden bend down look into pool bent looked first thing saw be own exquisite face sam brown phiz peering over shoulder golden tress of hair loosened by sea breeze fell down into water have to be looped up again then gazing down once more saw beneath crystal water bed of flower dahlia ranunculus carnation chrysanthemum of colour in rainbow save blue gave cry of pleasure what be doctor what do call sea anemone in english believe said doctor actinia serpulas sabellas may see something like on european coast on small scale there be nothing ever have seen like great crimson fellow with cream coloured tentacle know name suspect have never be described common european anemone call 'crassicornis ' be something like not half a fine be there mean of gathering keeping doctor asked sam have flower in garden like possible mean said doctor be lump of jelly let come away get round headland before tide come in wandered on from cove to cove under dark cliff till rounding little headland doctor called out here be something in cornish style halbert thin wall of granite like vast buttress ran into sea pierced by great arch sixty foot high aloft sharp grey stone below wherever salt water have reached mass of dark clinging weed while beyond a though set in dark frame be soft glimpse of blue sky snow white seabird there be nothing so grand a in cornwall doctor said halbert can pas under mr barker said alice must like to go through have be into none of cave yet oh yes said george barker may go through for next two hour tide have not turned yet will volunteer first said doctor if there be anything worth seeing beyond will come for be a said thin wall of granite ran out from rest of hill seaward be pierced by tall arch block have formerly filled void now lay weed grown half buried in sand forming slippery threshold over doctor climbed looked beyond little sandy cove reef bound like have seen before lay under dark cliff on water washed rock not hundred yard from stood man have seen on down above looking steadily seaward doctor slipped over rock like otter approached man across smooth sand unheard in thunder of surf when be close upon stranger turned doctor uttered low cry of wonder alarm be george hawker doctor knew in moment whether recognition be mutual never found out for hawker stepping rapidly from stone to stone disappeared round headland thunderstruck doctor retraced step to arch there be young people gathered wondering delighted alice came to meet said who be that with just now mermaid replied that indeed said alice what did say said

here with man said knew say be on horseback what sort of horse have good looking roan with new bridle on lee horse said troubridge must have murdered for poor william when tom saw pistol read name on said thing be coming to crisis doctor net seems closing round unfortunate partner god grant storm may come clear air anything be better than continual alarm will be very terrible when doe come dear friend said doctor can not be much more terrible than said tom when servant be assassinated in bed traveller in lonely hut have to wrestle for life doctor did ever nourish passion for revenge yes once said doctor have gratified in fair open duel when saw lying white on grass before thought that be dead be like one demented prayed that life might be taken instead of be sure tom that revenge be of devil like everything else get from be not worth having in least doubt doctor said tom oh if must only have five minute with on turf yonder with one to interfere between want weapon let meet in shirt trowsers like devon lad what must do to if be there to see 'd never tell why nourish feeling tom old friend know what pain give to see noble open character like yours distorted like leave to desborough why must feel so deadly towards man have injured others more than stand between hope of happy old age stand between light must stand on one side night brought poor lee body down in dray buried in family burying ground close beside old miss thornton then next morning rode back home to buckleys where found that family with just arrived from brentwoods of course be brimful of intelligence when doctor arrived be thrown into shade at once however time be to be lost despatched messenger post haste to fetch back captain desborough trooper who have now be moved off about week have not be a yet very far withdrawn be examining into black outrage to northward mary hawker be warned a delicately a possible that husband be in neighbourhood remained buried in thought for time then rousing said suddenly there must be end to get horse let go home in spite of persuasion to contrary still said same mr buckley will go home see if can meet alone ask of be to keep charles with let father son meet in god name what can do urged mr buckley something at event find out what want buy off perhaps pray argue with be quite determined then became necessary to tell of lee death though fact of having be murdered be concealed deeply affected to hear of loss of old faithful servant faithful to at event fault may have be nevertheless went off alone took up abode with troubridge there two sat watching in lonely station for who be to come though watched together there be sympathy confidence between never guessed what purpose be in tom heart never guessed what made so pale gloomy why never stirred from house slept day on sofa ere have be week at home found out thus must sit two silent thoughtful beside that unhappy hearth watching fire brooding over past have that in heart made silent to one felt horror of great overshadowing formless calamity instant might take form overwhelm must sit late dreading weary night when overstrained sens caught sound in distant forest however late sat always left tom behind over fire not taking comfortable glass gloomily musing a much changed from old self a man must be now lay always in clothes ready for emergency one night about week after lee murder dreamt that husband be in hall bidding in whisper thrilled heart to come forth fancy be so strong upon that saying aloud to herself end be come arose in state little short of delirium went into hall there be one there went to front door looking out into profoundly black gloom of night said in low voice george george come to let speak to george will be better for of to speak answer heard slight noise in sitting room behind opening door gently saw light there tom sitting with parted lip watching door holding in hand cocked pistol be not in least astonished alarmed be too much tete montee to be surprised at anything said only with laugh be watching too old mastiff must grip wolf old dog if came be there mary did speak to said dream wandering dream what must do if came eh cousin nothing nothing said tom go to bed bed eh answered cousin shooting be easier death than hanging eh tom felt creeping at root of hair a answered yes believe so can shoot straight old man must shoot straight true if stood there before ah think must now hand must shake when saw go to bed mary said tom talk like let future lie cousin turned went to room again be told long after by tom tom believed said believed that be only sounding to see what intention be in case of meeting with george hawker must not for world have have suppose disagreed with take darker interpretation of strange word night think that never very strong minded person now grown quite desperate from terror actually contemplated husband death with complacency nay hoped in secret heart one mad struggle between tom might end matter for ever leave free woman may do injustice think one never know what woman of kind with strong passion not over strong intellect may be driven to knew for forty year loved for twenty knew in spite of selfishness violence that there be many good nay noble point in character can not disguise from that night conversation with tom showed darker point in character than knew of before let forget must wish to have none kindly recollection of woman loved so truly so long for secret must be told sooner later loved before of before james stockbridge before george hawker before thomas troubridge loved more deeply more truly than of last remnant of love departed from heart twenty year ago be why can write of so calmly now be reason too why remain old bachelor to day chapter xxxix
