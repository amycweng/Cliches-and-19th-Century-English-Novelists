held forth with great energy on subject of road railway canal tunnel manufacture machinery in short said thing look on attests progress of mankind in art of life demonstrates gradual advancement towards state of unlimited perfection mr escot who be somewhat younger than mr foster rather more pale saturnine in aspect here took up thread of discourse observing that proposition just advanced seemed to perfectly contrary to true state of case for said improvement a call appear to only so many link in great chain of corruption will soon fetter whole human race in irreparable slavery incurable wretchedness improvement proceed in simple ratio while factitious want unnatural appetite engender proceed in compound one thus one generation acquires fifty want fifty mean of supplying be invented in turn engenders two new one so that next generation have hundred next two hundred next four hundred till human being becomes such helpless compound of perverted inclination that be altogether at mercy of external circumstance loses independence singleness of character degenerate so rapidly from primitive dignity of sylvan origin that be scarcely possible to indulge in other expectation than that whole specie must at length be exterminated by own infinite imbecility vileness opinion said mr jenkison round faced little gentleman of about forty five seem to differ toto coelo have often debated matter in own mind pro con have at length arrived at conclusion that there be not in human race tendency to moral perfectibility deterioration that quantity of be so exactly balanced by reciprocal result that specie with respect to sum of good evil knowledge ignorance happiness misery remains exactly perpetually in statu quo surely said mr foster can not maintain such proposition in face of evidence so luminous look at progress of art science see chemistry botany astronomy surely said mr escot experience deposes against look at rapid growth of corruption luxury selfishness really gentleman said reverend doctor gaster after clearing husk in throat with two three hem be very sceptical must say atheistical conversation must have thought out of respect to cloth

philosopher unfortunate divine whom left limping with sprained ankle into breakfast room of inn where two supporter deposited safely in large arm chair with wounded leg comfortably stretched out on morning being extremely cold contrived to be seated a near fire a be consistent with other object of having perfect command of table apparatus consisted not only of ordinary comfort of tea toast of delicious supply of new laid egg magnificent round of beef against mr escot immediately pointed artillery of eloquence declaring use of animal food conjointly with of fire to be one of principal cause of present degeneracy of mankind natural original man said lived in wood root fruit of earth supplied simple nutriment have few desire disease when began to sacrifice victim on altar of superstition to pursue goat deer by pernicious invention of fire to pervert flesh into food luxury disease premature death be let loose upon world such be clearly correct interpretation of fable of prometheus be symbolical portraiture of disastrous epoch when man first applied fire to culinary purpose thereby surrendered liver to vulture of disease from period stature of mankind have be in state of gradual diminution have not least doubt that will continue to grow small by degree lamentably le till whole race will vanish imperceptibly from face of earth can not agree said mr foster in consequence being so very disastrous admit that in respect use of animal food retard though can not materially inhibit perfectibility of specie use of fire be indispensably necessary a aeschylus virgil expressly assert to give being to various art of life in rapid interminable progress will finally conduct individual of race to philosophic pinnacle of pure perfect felicity in controversy concerning animal vegetable food said mr jenkison there be much to be said on side question being in equipoise content with mixed diet make point of eating be placed before provided be good in kind in opinion two brother philosopher practically coincided though ran down theory a highly detrimental to best interest of man be really astonished said reverend doctor gaster gracefully picking off supernal fragment of egg have just cracked clearing away space at top for reception of small piece of butter be really astonished gentleman at very heterodox opinion have heard deliver since nothing can be more obvious than animal be created solely exclusively for use of man even tiger devours said mr escot certainly said doctor gaster how do prove said mr escot requires proof said doctor gaster be point of doctrine be written therefore be so nothing can be more logical said mr jenkison have be said continued that ox be expressly made to be eaten by man may be said by parity of reasoning man be expressly made to be eaten by tiger a wild ox exist where there be men men where there be tiger must seem that in instance properly answer end of creation be mystery said doctor gaster not to launch into question of final cause said mr escot helping at same time to slice of beef concerning will candidly acknowledge be a profoundly ignorant a most dogmatical theologian possibly can be just wish to observe that pure peaceful manner homer ascribes to lotophagi at day characterise many nation hindoo for example who subsist exclusively on fruit of earth depose very strongly in favour of vegetable regimen may be said on contrary said mr foster animal food act on mind a manure doe on flower forcing into degree of expansion must not otherwise have attained if can imagine philosophical auricula falling into train of theoretical meditation on original natural nutriment till must work up into profound abomination of bullock blood sugar baker scum other unnatural ingredient of rich composition of soil have brought to perfection insist on being planted in common earth must have advantage of natural theory on side that most strenuous advocate of vegetable system must desire must soon discover practical error of retrograde experiment by lamentable inferiority in strength beauty to auricula around be afraid in instance at least analogy hold true with respect to mind one will make comparison in point of mental power between hindoo ancient greek anatomy of human stomach said mr escot formation of teeth clearly place man in class of frugivorous animal many anatomist said mr foster be of different opinion agree in discerning characteristic of carnivorous class be anatomist said mr jenkison can not decide where doctor disagree in meantime conclude that man be omnivorous on conclusion act conclusion be truly orthodox said reverend doctor gaster indeed loaf fish be typical of mixed diet practice of church in age show that never loses sight of loaf fish said mr escot never loses sight of point of sound doctrine said reverend doctor coachman now informed time be elapsed must all pathetic remonstrance of reverend divine who declared have not half breakfasted succeed in gaining one minute from inexorable jehu will allow said mr foster a soon a be again in motion that wild man of wood must not transport over two hundred mile of forest with a much facility a one of vehicle transport through
