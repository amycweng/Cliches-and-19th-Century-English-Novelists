macmillan co ltd new york macmillan co introduction gryll grange last mellowest fruit from peacock tree be like most mellow fruit not matured hastily in saying refer to long period exactly generation in conventional sense intervened between crotchet castle of of for know a matter of fact from preface to edition of melincourt that peacock be planning gryll grange at time considerably nearer to still year from actual publication there might perhaps have be room for fear lest proceeding on part of man of seventy five who be living in retirement must result in ill digested mass of detail tempered rather distempered by grumbling of old age exhibiting mark of failing power anticipation must have be more happily falsified advance in good temper of gryll grange even upon crotchet castle be denied by one book though long for author be not in least overloaded sign of failure have ever be detected in except by who upbraid still further severance between line of peacock thought line of what be vulgarly accounted 'progress who almost openly impute decay to power no longer used on side against only plausible pretext for insinuation be very advance in mildness mellowness have be noted that comparative absence of sharper cruder stroke of earlier work since wit be a bright a ever though le hard seems unreasonable to impute a defect what for very obvious reason must be admitted a improvement except brougham who still come in for severe language one of peacock old favourite abomination undergoes personal chastisement on contrary indirect pretty distinct apology be tendered to wordsworth southey coleridge by appreciative citation of work even among general victim scotchman political economist have still more direct olive branch extended to by introduction of personage of mr macborrowdale there be more blasphemy of scott at present moment remember very distinct slap at paper money peace have be made long ago with church of england through powerful medium of dr folliott be ratified cemented anew here not merely by presentation of dr opimian in rather odd fashion perhaps by trait of falconer devotion to st catharine so also a fair hand of lady clarinda despite hard knock administered to father brother have beckoned peacock away from cut dried satire of aristocracy so now lord curryfin exhibit further stage of reconciliation in short element of society to very young men not wanting in brain heart often take crude fanciful objection have by time approved a always do with rarest exception to le me bien ne at worst graceful if unnecessary ornament to life at best valuable to social fabric a solid indispensable buttress of in beconciliations forgiveness of injury however be very important to observe that there be mawkishness may have be sometimes thought said there be 'ratting in real sense a must be obvious to attentive reader of novel a have be pointed out once twice before in introduction peacock have at time be anything like enrolled much le convinced member of radical party may have be republican in youth though for part must like more trustworthy evidence for than of thomas jefferson hogg very clever distinctly unscrupulous person if be be not at improbable that have republican measles very common disease of youth pretty early certainly have never be democrat even earlier satire be double edged a must be constantly repeated remembered be always taste endeavour to shoot folly a flew to attack existent not extinct form of popular fashionable delusion such folly whether in since have certainly not a rule be of aristocratic monarchical tory order generally found plenty of folly however in other kind kind have begun to satirise smartly in crotchet castle showed pretty decisively that hand have not lost cunning sword sharpness satire though partly be not mainly political be interesting detail though only refreshes memory of who knew fact then have studied since barely year before far more sweeping reform than of very acute judge who disliked resisted spoke of reform lunacy a 'not likely to arise in time word must be remembered be put in mouth of mr macborrowdale who be represented a merely middle aged be fortunate however for interest of gryll grange that politics in strict sense occupy so small part of for of subject lose interest first to very select number of reader bulk of satiric comment of book be devoted either to purely social matter to debateable land between politics proper little not very much of be obsolete obsolescent american slavery be more 'pantopragmatic society ' in official language social science congress have ceased to exist a single recognised institution there be not much about slavery here if pantopragmatics have lost special society flourish more than ever a general fashionable subject of human attention will not open number of time twice perhaps not once in week without finding column of debate harangue letter writing purely pantopragmatical still more be case with subject have even more attention on what think central golden sentence of book be laid down by dr opimian in often quoted word nonsense in last quarter of century be appalling to think that quarter be getting on for three quarter now have be talked on other subject be thrown into one scale have be talked on subject of education alone be thrown into other think latter must preponderate ' indeed can not be said that after nearly five thirty year up to including present moment during competitive examination have be field of battle much have be added to peacock attack on anything said on other side to weaken cogency of attack doubt be to extent prejudiced judge for though few people must at time of youth have have le to fear from competitive examination own fortune have be made by opposite system competitive scheme must infallibly tend rather to exclude than to admit person like wise criticism doe not ask cut bone in case of argument simply look to see whether advocacy be sound not whether advocate have received expects fee peacock advocacy be here not merely sound be in so far a go inexpugnable be true there be still more irrefragable rejoinder to have kept competition safe hitherto though for obvious reason will very rarely be found openly expressed by defender of system be that under popular jealousy resulting from wide universal suffrage there be alternative competitive examination else american system of alternating spoil to victor be demonstrably worse for public not demonstrably much better for private interest a for table turning lecture 'excess of hurrying about ' beiberian dinner so forth be certainly not dead table turning may have changed name others have not even adopted well known expedient of alias appear just a be thirty year ago in social satiric dictionary of to day must be odd if comparative freshness actuality of subject did not make gryll grange one of lightest brightest of peacock novel think fully deserves that description must be doing extremely scant justice to allow one to suppose that attraction consist solely even mainly in 'valuable thought expression of sense satire scholarship to combine wordsworth with warrington in lighter respect in respect of form movement be absolutely impossible that must have be evangelical must not dismiss without special mention episode though be not properly episode inasmuch a have throughout important connection with working of story of 'aristophanes in london ' have sometimes be adversely criticised a not sufficiently antique seems to overlook obvious retort that if have be more so must not by possibility have be sufficiently modern who know something of aristophanes something of london may doubt whether must have established nexus much better have elsewhere pointed out curious connection with mansel phrontisterion be considerably earlier in date with sentiment of peacock must have be in heartiest agreement be extremely unlikely that ever saw antipathy to english university appears to have be one of most enduring of craze probably because be always most unreasonable though there be active renewal of hostility in novel none of importance be noticeable there be also direct indirect palinode a there be in most other case a for play seems to very good miss gryll must have looked delightful a circe get more distinct description of personality here than anywhere else gryllus have excellent standpoint dialogue though unequal be quite admirable at best indeed there be gilbertian tone about whole piece must be rather more surprised at being first to note so far a know if be not pretty well prepared to find that study of average dramatic critic be not much in peacock choric trochee by way be tautology be of highest excellence especially piece beginning before pike will fly ' in coeur de lion discomfiture of beeptemvirate of quack be hymned finale be quite attic know whether thing have ever be attempted a actual show though rather exacting in machinery ought to have be novel be rather full of other verse except 'love age ' so often mentioned never to be mentioned enough for strange admirable commixture of sense sentiment of knowledge of heart knowledge of life be not of first class for peacock certainly not worthy to be ranked with play death of philemon ' be indeed beautiful piece in first second be better 'cut ' dappled palfrey ' very charming fabliau in original chiefly suggests superiority of lochinvar to be sort of counterpart complement 'the new order of chivalry ' with good deal of truth have also good deal of illiberality amusing a be be relapse into peacock old vein of almost insolent personality sir moses montefiore sir jamsetjee jejeebhoy did not deserve though might afford to despise sort of cheap rallying here applied to might have retaliated not without point on person who drew large salary at india house with frequent additional gratification stood up for 'chivalry ' in leisure moment legend of st laura ' be not first rate italian translation make wish for more of same on whole however though may like thing more le here can not conceive whole being otherwise than delightful to person of knowledge sense taste a close peacock novel there be interesting though rather melancholy thought that 'close book ' in more sens than one have never be imitated save afar off even far off imitation have not be very
