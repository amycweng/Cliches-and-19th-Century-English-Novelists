't be true lover have power to enforce desperate amour a have two string to bow burn for love money too butler friar have often have experience of baron testy humour have always before confined to word in habit of testiness often mingled more expression of displeasure than internal feeling prompted knew baron to be hot choleric at same time hospitable generous passionately fond of daughter often thwarting in seeming always yielding to in fact early attachment between matilda earl of huntingdon have given baron serious reason to interfere with habit pursuit be so congenial to of lover not being over burdened with orthodoxy be to say not being seasoned with more of salt of spirit than be necessary to preserve from excommunication confiscation philotheoparoptesism be not sorry to encourage daughter choice of confessor in brother michael who have more jollity le hypocrisy than of fraternity be very little anxious to disguise love of good thing of world under semblance of sanctified exterior friar matilda have often sung duet together have be accustomed to baron chiming in with stormy capriccio be usually charmed into silence by sudden turn in witching melody of matilda have therefore naturally calculated a far a wild spirit calculated at on same effect from same cause circumstance of preceding day have made essential alteration in case baron knew well from intelligence have received that earl offence be past remission must have be of le moment for awful fact of castle being in possession of king force in day possession be considerably more than eleven point of law baron be therefore convinced that earl outlawry be infallible matilda must either renounce lover become with outlaw fugitive in proportion therefore to baron knowledge of strength duration of attachment be fear of difficulty of ever being overcome love of forest chase have never before discouraged now presented to a matter of serious alarm if cheerfulness gave hope on one hand by indicating spirit superior to disappointment be suspicious to on other a arising from latent certainty of being soon united to earl circumstance concurred to render song of vanished deer greenwood archery yoicks harkaway extremely mal propos to make anger boil bubble in cauldron of spirit till more than ordinary excitement burst forth with sudden impulse into active manifestation a sometimes happens from might of rage in mind can farther go a high a have mounted in despite in remission do sink a low to bold baron did happen so for discobolic exploit proved climax of rage be succeeded by immediate sense that have passed bound of legitimate passion sunk immediately from very pinnacle of opposition to level of implicit acquiescence friar spirit be not to be marred by little incident be half inclined at first to return baron compliment love of matilda checked when baron held out hand friar seized cordially drowned recollection of affair by pledging other in cup of canary friar having stayed long enough to see thing replaced on friendly footing rose moved to take leave matilda told must come again on morrow for have very long confession to make to friar promised to do departed with knight sir ralph on reaching abbey drew follower together led to locksley castle found in possession of lieutenant whom again left there with sufficient force to hold in safe keeping in king name proceeded to london to report result of enterprise now henry royal king be very wroth at earl evasion swore by saint thomas becket whom have translated into saint by having knocked on head that must give castle land of locksley to man who must bring in earl hereupon ensued process of thought in mind of knight eye of fair huntress of arlingford have left wound in heart only who gave must heal have seen that baron be no longer very partial to outlawed earl that still retained old affection for land castle of locksley now land castle be very fair thing in must be pretty appurtenance to adventurous knight must be doubly valuable a certain passport to father favour be one step towards that of daughter at least towards obtaining possession of quietly perforce for knight be not so nice in love a to consider lady free grace sine qua non to think of being by mean whatever lord of locksley arlingford husband of bewitching matilda be to cut in shade of futurity vista very tempting to
