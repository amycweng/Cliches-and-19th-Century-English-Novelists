child be irksome made excuse strolled out in turn into silent night be calm clear thousand holy eye under men prefer to do crime except when be in too great hurry to wait looked down seemed to wonder anything can be so silly a to sin beneath pure gaze man of world pondered with soul tormented with conjecture through what channel did alfred suspect through dodds be aware of loss have pocket book spoken if so why have not mr dodd son attacked then perhaps alfred be agent wished to try friendly remonstrance through mutual friend before proceeding to extremity accorded with mr dodd character a remembered solution be reasonable be relieved of by recollecting what alfred have said that have not entered house since bank broke on began to hope alfred might be mere suspicion must not establish by proof at event must lock in own breast like good son never having given hint even to sister favoured supposition thus meditating mr hardie found at gate of albion villa yet have strolled out with

coming sign of have not be detected by medical attendant birth of topsy be idiopathic in learned lady opinion not bled enough why sampson say be because be bled too much osmond be amused at repeated that mania came of not being bled enough discussion be turned into unexpected quarter by entrance of jane hardie who came timidly in said oh mr osmond can not let go without telling how anxious be about alfred be so thin pale depressed nonsense jane said mr hardie have not cause to be dejected in house persisted gently that there be more in than headache be worse must not be easy longer without

quickly a have mounted out went arm on table forehead sank on arm tear began to run silently down sweet face so brave for moment w will y allow to light cigar said edward be wretched miserable tempest in petticoat made sign of assent with hand be dangling languidly did not speak did appeal to more alienation be commencing what be worse than speaking mind be for ever at window now looking up down street walking with felt arm often tremble sometimes jerk secret be agitating nerve destroying tranquillity a much perhaps more than if have known mr dodd wrote from portsmouth whereof anon mr peterson called soon after mr hurd edward be glad to see especially latter whose visit seemed always to do julia good moreover a peterson hurd be rival afforded edward innocent amusement to see ill

at station inquired whether friend have called again be answered in negative waited few minute then with superintendent permission wrote note to alfred inviting to dine at simpson at six left with fireman done be about to return home when thought struck got messenger sent off single line to dr wolf to tell alfred hardie must be at simpson at seven o clock when messenger be gone regretted what have done have done for alfred good still be treason felt unhappy wended way homeward disconsolately realising more more that have not brain for difficulty imposed upon on entering pembroke street heard buzz looked up saw considerable crowd collected in semicircle why be near house said quickened step when got near saw that people eye be bent on dashed into crowd what on earth be matter cried matter plenty matter young man cried one murder matter said at that turned pale a death intelligent man saw violent agitation asked hurriedly if belonged to house yes for mercy sake what be make way there shouted man belongs madman have broke loose got into house be sorry to say have just killed two men with pistol cried several voice speaking together chapter xlv alfred hardie spent three day writhing in little lodging situation have be sadder never more irritating by right possessor of thousand yet in fact reduced to one suit two shirt crown rich in intellect yet hunted a madman affianced to loveliest girl in england yet afraid to go near for fear of being torn from again for ever must last one week more week positive torture be trifle to contemplate with rival at julia ear time suppose must have be faithful month in last week must be worn out give to such thing have be known went to lincoln inn with irritating fear tearing like vulture mr compton received cheerfully told have begun operation in hardie versus hardie have written to thomas hardie two day ago inquired london solicitor whether gentleman must accept service of writ in hardie versus hardie to thomas hardie why what have to do with asked alfred be defendant in suit then seeing amazement incredulity on alfred face explained that commissioner of lunacy have treated with great courtesy have at once furnished with copy not only of order certificate of other valuable document there said lie order signed by thomas hardie of clare court yorkshire curse impudence cried alfred in fury why sir be next door to idiot doe that matter ah now if have gone in passion indicted there must be defence directly malice defendant being non compos whereas by gently quietly suing even if be lunatic must make estate pay round sum for falsely imprisoning sane briton by by here be counsel opinion on case handed short opinion of distinguished queen counsel concluding word of be if certificate order be in legal form be made given bona fide action lie for capture detention of mr hardie why be dead against said alfred there go one rotten reed have left singularly dead said attorney coolly doe not even say ' be of opinion be in great practice hardworked in hurry have taken up lunacy act have forgotten that right of sane englishman be not creature of little trumpery statute thank right be century older prevail wherever by good luck statute of realm be silent now be silent about incarcerating sane men besides give case what be opinion without precedent lawyer guess thought so little of opinion sent case to clever junior who have got time to think before writes colls entered soon after with said junior opinion mr compton opened saying now let see what say read to alfred ran thus there be clearly right of action under common law have be exercised anderdon v brother paternoster v wynn c such right can only be annulled by express term of statute now victoria cap sect so annuls a against madhouse proprietor only that therefore be statutory exception tends to confirm common right if fact be a represented on of course can form opinion mr hardie can safely sue person who signed order for alleged false imprisonment agree with that usual course by praying court of chancery for commission de lunatico inquirendo be timorous rest on prejudice plt if successful be saddled with own cost sometimes with deft obtains compensation seems clear that jury sitting at nisi prius can deal a well with main fact a can jury sitting by order of chancellor need not say cost will go with verdict to say nothing of damage may be heavy on other hand indictment be hazardous think can lose nothing by beginning with suit by having shorthand writer at trial may collect material for indictment also feel pulse of court can then confer upon evidence with counsel better versed in criminal law than advice be to sue thomas hardie declare in tort signed barrow nb have be thus particular because hardie v hardie if carried to verdict will probably be leading case who will decide when counsel disagree inquired alfred satirically that depends on where do if in court judge if here attorney appear sanguine mr compton said alfred perhaps must not mind advancing little money have only crown be ready for in drawer said compton cheerfully see thirty sovereign then need not go to bank what knew must borrow client begin by bleeding be rule of office then why give up business because bleed opposite attorney client pound two more than own bleeds then made alfred sign promissory note for thirty pound advised to keep snug for one week more promised to write to in two day send thomas hardie answer alfred left address went from mr compton lighter man convinced of courage prudence shifted one care off

of heart grew so strong overpowered alike patience prudence jumped into cab drove to fireman station on surrey side of river inquiring for edward at last hit upon right one learned that julia lived in pembroke street number unknown drove home to lodging bought ready made clothes dressed like gentleman then told cabman to drive to pembroke street knew be acting imprudently must not help besides mr compton have now written to uncle begun attack must surely intimidate enemy turn thought to defence not to fresh offence however catching sight of gunsmith shop on way suddenly resolved to arm on bare chance of attack stopped cab went in bought double barrelled pistol with powder flask bullet wad cap complete loaded in cab felt quite prudent after prudence of youth paid off cab in pembroke street set about task of discovering julia inquired at several house be unsuccessful then walked slowly down street looking up at window think if have done day before might have seen be so often at window now just then have company to keep in order be unlucky in respect edward came out of went up street when be going down not so very many yard off if alfred face have only be turned other way must have

imprudent interference in rescuing from drayton house chapter l law minute study of fellow creature have revealed to that there be many intelligent person who think that suit at law commences in court be not so many suit be fought decided by special pleader so never come into court a stiff encounter of kind actually took place in hardie v hardie word of prefatory explanation may be proper suitor come into court only to try issue issue be mutual lie direct towards party be driven upon paper by law of pleading may be thus summed statement of adversary must either be contradicted flat confessed avoided avoided mean neutralised by fresh matter nothing must be advanced by plaintiff doe not disclose ground of action at law nothing advanced by defendant if true must not be defence to action rule exclude in vast degree pitiable defect vice mark unprofessional argument one ever hears for on breach of one of said rule other party can demur demurrer be argued before judge in banco if successfully faulty plaint faulty plea be dismissed often of course cause won lost thereby country saved trouble suitor expense of trying issue so writ being served by plt attorney appearance put in by deft paper battle began by alfred hardie through attorney serving on deft attorney declaration be drawn by junior counsel garrow ran thus after specifying court date middlesex to wit alfred hardie by john compton attorney sue thomas hardie for that deft assaulted plt gave into custody to certain person caused to be imprisoned for long space of time in certain place to wit lunatic asylum whereby plt be much inconvenienced suffered much anguish pain in mind body be unable to attend to affair be injured in credit circumstance plt claim l mr compton conveyed copy of to alfred said be sweet declaration what said alfred be that have suffered at miscreant hand why be written with icicle mr compton explained that be outline counsel will lay colour on in court a thick a like defendant replied to above declaration by three plea by statute vic c s deft by joseph heathfield attorney say be not guilty for further plea deft say that before at time of alleged imprisonment plt be person of unsound mind incompetent to take care of proper person to be taken care of detained be unfit unsafe improper dangerous that must be at large thereupon deft being uncle of plt proper person to cause plt to be taken charge of under due care treatment in behalf did cause plt to be so taken charge of detained under due care treatment c c third plea be stinger too long to cite verbatim went to tune that plaintiff at before time c have conducted like person of unsound mind c two certificate that be insane have be given by two person duly authorised under statute to sign such certificate defendant have believed did bona fide believe certificate to be true c c first of plea be mere formal plea under statute second raised very issue at common law plaintiff wished to try third made john compton knit brow with perplexity be very nasty plea said to alfred regular trap if join issue on must be defeated for how can deny certificate be in form yet plaguy thing be not loose enough to be demurred to colls who drew plea for mr colvin sir make note to employ in next stiff pleading alfred be staggered have thought to ride rough shod over defendant common expectation of plaintiff seldom realised lawyer fight hard plea be taken to garrow said there be one course to demur to so plaintiff joined issue on defendant plea a to last plea plaintiff said same be bad in substance defendant rejoined that same be good in substance thus hardie v hardie divided into two case question of law for judge issue for mixed tribunal loosely called jury need hardly say must defendant win of must gain cause postponing history of legal question will show how messrs heathfield fought off issue cooled ardent alfred sickened of law in theory englishman have right to be tried by peer in fact there be five gentleman in court of whom have by precedent power to refuse jury by simply postponing trial term after term until death of one of party when action if personal one dy too by singular anomaly of judicial practice if slippery deft ca persuade b judge of common law court to connive at what venture to call postponement swindle can actually go to c d b one after with rejected application previous refusal of other

with more alacrity alfred left court hid scalding tear forced way down cheek at heartless proceeding to let witness come into court at vast expense to party raise cup of justice to lip of oppressed then pretend knew trial must last more than two day so shirk 'd have made that reason for sitting till midnight said poor alfred not for prolonging poor injured man agony four mortal month then prayed

suddenly turning on alfred asked did sailor tell that hesitated moment be lost have seen screamed be in london be in house feel near went into something very like hysteric alfred be alarmed whispered truth doctor sent off to meet recommended caution nerve be in such state violent shock even of happiness might kill thus warned julia came into room alone while dr sampson be inculcating restraint for

child ventured to witness scene so strange so sacred may try imagine that meeting few of can conceive by light of narrow experience yet one two there may be world be wide adventure emotion of race be many one by one be have up to sacred room to talk to happy pair found david seated calmly at wife foot soft hand laid on white hair lest must leave again told sorrow behind genial kindly a ever told happiness before spoke like master of house father of family friend of with goodness be sternly resolved to have l out of richard hardie have interview with mr compton very night lawyer wrote letter to mr hardie saying nothing about death of skinner notifying that client captain dodd have recovered from noah skinner receipt for l s d be instructed to sue for unless repaid immediately added captain dodd be mercifully restored remembered distinctly particular of transaction thought in innocence that hardie v hardie be now at end captain dodd must prove alfred soi disant illusion to be simple truth compton thought that evidence have come too late what may not get up say here be papa be true cried julia indignant miss dodd case be closed take advice subject father to agitation of trial can do without well then must all go a spectator pray that justice might prevail did go sat together to hear matter puzzled over have david come one day earlier must have set at rest for ever dick absolom be put in to prove that alfred have put two sovereign on stump for to bowl if must after defendant mr thomas hardie mild benevolent weak gentleman be put into box swore boy father have come to with story after story of plaintiff madness trouble must get into so have done for best simplicity be manifest saunders worked ably when colt got hold of badgered showed something more than simplicity stuttered contradicted perspired wept colt be sure have spite against deft colt be not sure eh candid interpretation of word knocked defendant stupid made reply looked utterly flabbergasted colt did not provoke did not call idiot deft might colt satirically of course might laughter did deft plucking up little spirit called soft tommy revelation singular appropriateness of nickname be so highly relished by intelligent audience that be long time before trial must go on for roar plaintiff ringing laugh be heard among rest cross examination proceeded in style till defendant began to drivel at mouth little at last after struggle said with piteous whine that must not help hated signing name mischief always came of time have option option said colt what do mean with one two more turn of screw out came astounding revelation richard said if did put taff in one must put in one judge in one what deft weeping in one madhouse lord peal followed announcement colt sat down grinning saunders rose smiling be much obliged to learned counsel for making case said need not prolong suffering of innocent can go down mr hardie judge have defence to action certainly lord do call richard hardie lord then have not better confine to question of damage sturdy saunders must not take hint replied upon whole case fought hard for verdict line took be bold described richard hardie a man who have acquired complete power over weaker brother have not only persuaded by statement even compelled by threat to do what believed must be salvation of nephew will imitate learned counsel cruelty will strike child in short made powerful appeal to pity while pretending to address judgment then colt rose like tower assuming verdict a certain asked jury for heavy damage contrasted powerfully defendant paltry claim to pity with anguish plaintiff have undergone drew wedding party insult to bride despair of kidnapped bridegroom lashed whole gang of conspirator concerned in crime regretted that must only make one of villain smart hinted that richard thomas hardie be in one boat that heavy damage inflicted on thomas must find darker culprit out rapped out mr cowper line on liberty be new to jury though probably not to warned jury that liberty depended on in vain said have beheaded one tyrant banished to secure liberty if men be to be allowed to send away own flesh blood into worst of prison for life not smart for in lamentably few case in law find out lay hold of must task ability to utmost occupy more time than be left to do anything like justice to fluent fiery eloquence of colt q c when got great chance like tonat fulgurat et rapidis eloquentiae fluctibus cuncia proruit et proturbat burst of applause that crier judge must suppress bore witness to deep indignation briton feel when hard earned liberty be tampered with by power fraud in defiance of law when sat down jury be ready to fly out at with l in hand then rose passionless voice of justice according to law wish must give very word following be effect a understood lawyer forgive deficiency be important not difficult case plaintiff sue defendant under law of england for falsely imprisoning in madhouse imprisonment be admitted suffering of plaintiff not disputed question be whether be insane at time of act now must tell that in case of kind lie upon defendant to prove plaintiff insanity rather than on plaintiff to prove own sanity have defendant overcome difficulty illusion be best proof of insanity serious endeavour be certainly made to fasten illusion on plaintiff about sum of l proof be weak went partly on assumption that error be hallucination be illusory must if acted on set one kingdom imprisoning other half after did not demonstrate that plaintiff be in error advanced undeniable proof mr richard hardie have not embezzled l say be proved on other hand that did embezzle sum richard hardie sueing alfred hardie for libel on evidence might possibly obtain verdict for then burden of proof must lie on alfred hardie here lie on who say be insane fact appears to be that plaintiff imbibed reasonable suspicion of own father integrity be suspicion founded on evidence imperfect indeed of sound character a far a went there have be letter from captain dodd to family announcing return with l upon while a yet unaware of letter plaintiff heard david dodd accuse richard hardie of possessing improperly l identical sum at least swears to a richard hardie be not called to contradict be at liberty to suppose richard hardie have difficulty in contradicting on oath here then true false be rational suspicion man have right to rational suspicion of neighbour even to utter within due limit if overstep party slandered have legal remedy if omits legal remedy make attempt of doubtful legality not to confute to stifle voice of reasonable suspicion shrewd men will suspect more then come distinct respectable kind of evidence for defendant urge that plaintiff be going to sign away property to wife relation now be proved draft of deed put in sworn to taken singly have very extraordinary look still must consider plaintiff reasonable suspicion that money belonging to dodds have passed irregularly to hardy then wonder be diminished young noble mind have in age done generous self denying delicate act older get le likely be to be incarcerated for crime of character be not to imprison youth chivalry merely because have outgrown to go from particular to general defendant on whom proof lie have advanced hearsay conjecture not put originator into box plaintiff on whom proof doe not lie have advanced abundant evidence that be sane at time of incarceration be proved to demonstration by friend stranger by here judge analysed testimony of several of plaintiff witness a to party be curious how impersonated so to speak respective line of argument representative of evidence sound reasoning though accused of insanity be precise frank rational dignified in witness box think must have noticed good temper party who relied on hearsay conjecture be a feeble a be be almost imbecile a observed looking at party really seems monstrous that plaintiff must be one confined a lunatic defendant allowed to run wild lock up intellectual superior if mean to lock up even be hardly safe laughter only serious question apprehend be on basis damage ought to be assessed plaintiff counsel have made powerful appeal to passion call for vengeance now must tell have right to make yourselves minister of vengeance even to punish defendant in suit of kind still le ought to strike defendant harder than otherwise must in vague hope of punishing indirectly true mover of defendant other puppet must warn against suggestion of learned counsel if plaintiff want vengeance criminal law offer come here not for vengeance for compensation restoration to society be way fitted to adorn more than sympathy be not for to give then defendant counsel went too far other way client say be next door to idiot so forsooth purse must be spared entirely be very well if must be done without ignoring plaintiff just claim to compensation why if defendant instead of being weak minded be idiot lunatic must protect from punishment a felon not from damage in suit sane man be not to be falsely imprisoned by lunatic without full compensation from lunatic estate fortiori be not to be so imprisoned by mere fool without just compensation supposing verdict then to be for plaintiff think vindictive damage must be unfair on feeble defendant who have acted recklessly under error without malice bad faith on other hand nominal even unsubstantial damage must be unjust to plaintiff perhaps leave in mind doubt that think yourselves entertain a to plaintiff perfect sanity during whole period of life a soon a lordship have ended foreman of jury said mind be quite made up long ago si lence in court find for plaintiff with damage three thousand pound verdict be received with surprise
