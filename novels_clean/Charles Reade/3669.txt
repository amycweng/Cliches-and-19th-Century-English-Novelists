obstetric that together with occasional treatment of child nursing of sex be semi medical be monopoly seems on whole to have contented till late year when view be enlarged by wider education other cause abstinence from general practice like monopoly of obstetrics lay with woman not with law of england that law be same in respect a common law of italy france constitution of bologna where so many doctresses have filled chair of medicine other science make more direct provision for female student than doe constitution of scotch english university whole thing lay with woman with local civilization year ago italy be far more civilized than england so italian woman took large sphere of late anglo saxon have gone in for civilization with usual energy be eclipsing italy therefore woman

incapable doctor not against capable doctresses doctor act excludes from medical practice person male female unless registered in certain register to get upon register person male female must produce license diploma granted by one of british examining board specified in schedule attached to act now examining board be member of leading medical school if legislature have taken usual precaution have added clause compelling board to examine worthy applicant act must have be sound public measure for want of foresight without foresight lawgiver be impostor public pest state robbed woman of old common law right with one hand with other enabled respectable trade union to thrust out of new statutory right unfortunately respectable union to whom legislature delegated unconstitutional power did not claim of excluding qualified person from examination so robbing of license bread have overpowering interest to exclude qualified woman from medicine have same interest a watchmaker union printer painter on china calico engraver others have to exclude qualified woman from branch though peculiarly fitted for not more so than be for practice of medicine god having made not men medical unmusical sex wherever there be trade union weakest go to wall vulgar union have mentioned exclude woman from skilled labor excel in by violence conspiracy though law threatens with imprisonment for be in

be practicing in england at date of act although with equal incapacity omits to provide that future foreign doctor will be able to demand examination in with old foreign fogy blindfold right wrong out with rising foreign luminary of ever advancing science right wrong secondly let in without examination to experiment on vile body of public person qualified unqualified who may have be made doctor by very venerable equally irrelevant functionary guess now who be that british parliament set above law a doctor maker for public professes to love protect regius professor of medicine tyndall huxley no then give up archbishop of canterbury oh come joke be joke be joke bright monument of british funkyism imbecility there stand clause setting that reverend irrelevant doctor maker above law set grace female relation below law in practice outlaw whole female population starving who desire to practice medicine learnedly oppressing who out of modesty not yet quite smothered by custom monopoly desire

before apothecary society received six hundred letter from medical small fry in town country threatened to send more boy to apothecary to college of surgeon if ever woman received apothecary license now know men tremble in england at threat of trade union so apothecary instantly cudgeled brain to find way to disobey law obey union medical press gave hint passed by law forbidding student to
