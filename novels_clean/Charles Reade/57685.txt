misunderstanding go fancy that everybody be thinking of be not be like be thinking of well well thought griffith if be not to have what better place for than grave entered mr houseman private room opened business at once singular concurrence of circumstance induced lawyer houseman to confide to third party substance of what passed between young gentleman so to avoid repetition best way will be to let houseman tell part of tale instead of only hope communication when come may be half a interesting to reader a be to hearer suffice for to say that lawyer client be closeted good hour be still conversing together when card be handed in to mr houseman seemed to cause surprise pleasure in five minute said to clerk griffith took hint bade good bye directly a went out gentleman who have sent in

that in contest with formidable rival be throwing away advantage after kate have shown great favor have ridden neville horse after made resign purpose of leaving surely then preferred on whole to neville yet must go risk chance of possessing upon personal encounter in neville be at least a likely to kill a to kill neville saw too late that be playing rival game felt cold despondent more more convinced that must never marry kate that must very likely bury with be too game to recoil indeed hated rival too deeply so like many man before be going doggedly to field against judgment with little to win to lose deeper more solemn anxiety be diversified by lighter one few day ago have invited county to bury mr charlton on nineteenth of february now have gone fixed friday eighteenth for duel fine thing if must be corpse on friday afternoon who be to receive quest who conduct funeral man with fault have grateful heart mr charlton be benefactor felt have right to go get killed until have

griffith vexation at possibility of benefactor being buried without due honor owing to own intemperate haste to be killed resolved to provide against contingency so on thursday wrote urgent letter to mr houseman telling must come early to funeral be prepared to conduct letter be carried to mr houseman office at three o'clock on thursday afternoon mr houseman be not at home be gone to country house

handsome jolly lawyer felt sorry ashamed did not show rankled in very next day took advantage of little business have to do in mr peyton neighborhood drove to peyton hall asked for mistress kate be curious errand indeed think must not be easy to find parallel to for here be attorney calling upon beautiful girl to do what to soften on daughter to do what to persuade to permit to lend father on insufficient security well reminded of ancient obligation to family assured must well afford to risk hundred even thousand pound then told that father have shown great pain at refusal that be human must not divest of gratitude pity good nature for in word said have brought money must give in for once let lend without more ado miss peyton be gratified affected tear trembled moment in eye went indoors again left firm a rock sprinkled with dew told must quite understand feeling thanked for have long seriously weighed matter must not release from promise more of base borrowing said clenched white teeth indomitably attacked with good many weapon parried so gently yet so nobly so successfully that admired more than ever still lawyer fight hard die very hard houseman got warm in cause cross examined defendant asked whether must refuse to lend father out of full purse question be answered only by flash of glorious eye magnificent look of disdain at doubt implied well then said houseman be father surety for repayment with interest at six per centum then there will be nothing in business to wound dignity have many hundred out at six per centum excuse must be dishonest said kate have money to repay with have expectation nay not beg pardon methinks must know sir what expectation have from whom houseman fidgeted on seat then with hesitation replied well from two know of be jesting methinks good mr houseman said reproachfully nay dear mistress kate wish too well to jest on theme lawyer then fidgeted again on seat in silence sign of inward struggle during kate eye watched with curiosity at last wavering balance inclined towards revealing something other mistress kate said wife be faithful friend humble admirer often say must grace coronet wish be a rich a be good beautiful

secular somehow sowed first seed of conjugal coolness in hernshaw castle now ryder slily insinuated into griffith ear that mistress told priest everything did nothing by advice thus fire already kindled be fanned by artful woman breath griffith began to hate brother leonard to show so plainly rudely that leonard shrank from encounter came le often stayed few minute then mr gaunt remonstrated gently with griffith received short sullen reply then a servile element of sex be comparatively small in turned bitter cold avenged leonard indirectly openly with terrible pin needle beloved woman

london in due course advertisement be read by servant at hernshaw shown by ryder to mr gaunt made comment whatever contrived to render pale face impenetrable ryder became a silent thoughtful a herself often sat bending black judicial brow by by dark mysterious word began to be thrown out in hernshaw village will never come back at will never come into fortune 't be use advertising for man be past reading like equivocal saying be followed by vague buzz be traceable to individual author seemed to rise on side like dark mist envelope that unhappy house that dark mist of rumor soon condensed into palpable terrible whisper griffith gaunt hath met with foul play one of servant told mr gaunt horrid rumor woman used to look at after with strange eye noticed felt somehow that people be falling away from added one drop to bitter cup began to droop into sort of calm despondent lethargy then came fresh trouble to rouse two of county magistrate called on in official capacity with perfect politeness very grave air requested to inform of circumstance attending husband disappearance replied coldly curtly that knew very little about husband have left in middle of night came to stay believe so came on horseback yes did go away on horseback for horse be now in stable be true there be quarrel between that evening gentleman said mr gaunt drawing back haughtily did come here to gratify curiosity madam said elder of two to discharge very serious painful duty in earnestly request even advise to aid be there quarrel there be mortal quarrel gentleman exchanged glance elder made note may ask

trembled visibly heard pistol shot said not voice distinctly oh hope be not voice ryder heard ryder who be ryder be lady maid bedroom be on side house can see mr ryder certainly said mr gaunt rose rang bell mr ryder answered bell in person very promptly for be listening at door being questioned told magistrate what have heard down by mere said be sure be master voice cried help murder with began to cry mr gaunt trembled turned pale magistrate confined question to ryder elicited however very little more from saw drift of question have impulse to defend mistress there present behind back must have be other wise resolution once taken two child might a well have tried to extract evidence from a two justice of peace then mr gaunt pale face noble feature touched case be mysterious more departed little wiser with apology for trouble have given next week down came mr atkins out of patience determined to find griffith gaunt else obtain proof of decease obtained two interview with ryder bribed to tell knew prosecuted other inquiry with more method than have hitherto be used elicited important fact viz griffith gaunt have be seen walking in certain direction at one o'clock in morning followed at short distance by tall man with knapsack like on back person who gave tardy information be wife of certain farmer man who wired hare upon sly man being assured that in case so serious a particular inquiry must be made how came to be out so late confirmed what wife have let out added that men have taken way must lead to bridge meaning bridge over mere more than that must not say for have met be full mile from mere before men must have reached following up clue mr atkins learned so many ugly thing that went to bench on justicing day demanded full searching inquiry on premise sir george neville after in vain opposing rode off straight from bench to hernshaw in feeling term conveyed bad news to mr gaunt then with utmost delicacy let know that suspicion rested upon must do well to meet with bold front of innocence what suspicion pray said mr gaunt haughtily sir george shrugged shoulder replied that have done gaunt honor to put out of way mr gaunt took very differently from what sir george expected what cried be so sure be dead murdered with went into passion of grief remorse even sir george be puzzled a well a affected by convulsive agitation chapter vii though be known proposed inquiry might result in committal of mr gaunt on charge of murder yet respect in have hitherto be held influence of sir george neville who having be lover stoutly maintained innocence prevailed so far that even inquiry be private at own house only be present in character of suspected person witness be examined before first poacher gave evidence then jane cook proved that pedlar called thomas leicester have be in kitchen secreted about premise till late hour thomas leicester corresponded exactly to description given by poacher threw suspicion on thomas leicester did not connect mr gaunt with deed in way ryder evidence filled gap revealed three serious fact first that by mistress order have introduced very leicester into mistress room about midnight where have remained nearly hour have then left house secondly that mr gaunt have be out of door after midnight thirdly that have listened at door heard threaten griffith gaunt life be mere prcis of evidence altogether looked so suspicious that magistrate after telling mr gaunt must ask witness question chose suggestion treated with marked contempt put head together moment whispered then eldest of mr underhill who lived at considerable distance told gravely must commit to take trial at next assize do what conceive to be duty gentleman said mr gaunt with marvellous dignity if assert innocence be because disdain accusation too much will take part in committal of innocent lady said sir george neville be about to leave room mr gaunt begged to stay to be guilty be one thing said to be accused be will go to prison a easy a to dinner to gallows a to bed presiding magistrate be staggered moment by word be not without considerable hesitation took warrant prepared to fill up then mr houseman who have watched proceeding very keenly put in word be here for accused person sir with good leave object to committal on ground of law what may be mr houseman said magistrate civilly laid pen down to hear briefly sir where murder be proven can commit subject of realm upon suspicion can not suspect murder a well a culprit so commit murder must be proved to sens now in case death of mr gaunt by violence be not proved indeed very death rest upon suspicion admit that law of england in respect have once twice be tampered with person have even be executed where corpus delicti be found what be consequence in ease murdered man turned out to be alive justice be only murderer after harrison case be cumberland jury will ever commit for murder unless corpus delicti have be found with sign of violence upon come come mr atkins be too good lawyer too humane man to send client to prison on suspicion of suspicion know very breath of judge will blow away even if grand jury let go into court offer bail ten thousand pound in two surety sir george neville here present magistrate looked at mr atkins be not employed by crown said that gentleman acting on mere civil ground have right wish to be severe bail by mean be lady so sure of innocence a to lend assistance to find corpus delicti question be so shrewdly put that hesitation must have ruined mr gaunt houseman therefore replied eagerly promptly answer for will mr gaunt bowed head in assent then said atkins ask leave to drag if need be to drain that piece of water there called 'the mere ' drag drain will said houseman said atkins very impressively mark word at bottom of very sheet of water there will find remains of late griffith gaunt at solemn word coming a did not from loose unprofessional speaker from lawyer man who measured word very keen observer might have seen sort of tremor run through mr houseman frame more admirable be perfect coolness seeming indifference with replied find will admit suicide find with sign of violence will admit homicide by person person unknown further remark be interrupted by bustle confusion mr gaunt have fainted dead away chapter viii of course pity be first feeling by time mr gaunt revived fainting so soon after mr atkins proposal have produced sinister effect on mind of present face showed except wary houseman on retiring broke out first in murmur then in plain word a for mr atkins now showed moderation of able man who feel have strong cause merely said think there must be constable about in case of escape being attempted agree with mr houseman that worship will be quite justified in taking bail provided corpus delicti must not be found gentleman be most of neighbor friend of deceased be be sure lover of justice do entreat to aid in searching that piece of water by side of deceased gentleman be heard to cry for help much fear cried in vain person thus appealed to entered into matter with ardor of just men whose curiosity a well a justice be inflamed set of old rusty drag be found on premise men went punting up down mere dragged rude hook be made by village blacksmith fitted to cart rope boat be brought to hernshaw in wagon afternoon bottom of mere be raked curious thing fished up dead man next clay score of amateur drag men be out throwing drag from bridge circulating in boat even in large tub meantime mr atkins crew went steadily up down dragging foot of placid water worked till dinner time brought up good copper pot with two handle horse head several decayed trunk of tree have become saturated sunk to bottom at about three in afternoon two boy who for want of boat be dragging from bridge found something heavy elastic at end of drag pulled up eagerly thing like huge turnip half gnawed came up with great bob blasted sight let go drag stood shrieking shrieking who be nearest called out asked what be matter boy did not reply face showed so white that woman who saw screamed to sir atkins said be sure boy have seen something out of common mr atkins came up found boy blubbering encouraged told fearful thing have come up be like man head shoulder scooped out gnawed by fish have torn drag out of hand mr atkins made tell exact place be soon upon with boat water here be very deep though boy kept pointing to very spot drag found nothing for time at last showed by resistance that have clawed hold of something draw slowly said sir atkins if be be men hold fast men drew slowly slowly presently there rose to surface thing to strike terror loathing into stoutest heart mutilated remains of human face body greedy pike have cleared not feature only entire flesh off face have left hair tight skin of forehead though teeth have raked last remnant have left made what have mutilated doubly horrible since now be not skull not skeleton face man gnawed down to bone hair foot last be in stout shoe resisted even voracious teeth leathern stock have offered little protection to throat men groaned hid face with one hand pulled softly to shore with other then with half averted face drew ghastly remains fluttering rag gently reverently to land mr atkins yielded to nature be violently sick at sight have searched for so eagerly a soon a recovered power bade constable guard body be body in law see that one laid so much a finger on until magistrate have taken deposition also sent messenger to mr houseman telling corpus delicti be found did partly to show gentleman be right in judgment partly out of common humanity since after discovery mr houseman client be sure to be tried for life magistrate soon came viewed remains took careful note of state in be found houseman came be much affected by sight of dead friend so mutilated by probable consequence to mr gaunt however a lawyer fight very hard recovered enough to remark that there be mark of violence before death insisted on being inserted in magistrate note inquest be ordered next day meantime mr gaunt be told must not quit upper apartment of own house two constable be placed on ground floor night day next day remains be removed to little inn where griffith have spent so many jovial hour laid on table covered with white sheet coroner jury sat in same room a be then custom

shoulder upon entering juryman by humane impulse drew sheet over remains again coroner according to custom of day put question to mr gaunt with view of eliciting guilt if remember right asked how came to be out of door so late on night of murder mr gaunt however be in condition to answer query doubt if even heard one lovely eye dilated with horror be fixed on terrible sheet with stony glance show gasped let die too juryman looked with doubtful face at coroner bowed grave assent nearest juryman withdrew sheet now belief be not yet extinct that dead body show sign of murderer approach so eye glared on by turn a with dilated horror stricken orb looked on awful thing chapter ix recoiled with violent shudder at first hid face with one hand then gradually stole horror stricken side glance have not looked at so moment when uttered loud cry pointed at foot with quivering hand shoe shoe be not griffith with fell into violent hysteric be carried out of room at houseman earnest entreaty a soon a be gone mr houseman being freed from fear that client must commit irretrievably recovered show of composure wit went keenly to work on behalf of accused said admit suicide of person unknown wearing heavy hobnailed shoe probably one of lower order of people adroit remark produced little effect notwithstanding strong feeling against accused coroner inquired if there be bodily mark by remains must be identified master have long black mole on forehead suggested caroline ryder 't be here cried juryman bending over remains now gathered in great excitement round corpus delicti there sure enough be long black mole then be there buzz of pity for griffith gaunt followed by stern murmur of execration gentleman said coroner solemnly behold in finger of poor gentleman may well have put

much against romanists in country have already perverted justice in one two case especially in north mr gaunt knew trembled at peril to come spent early part of night in studying defense then laid quite aside prayed long fervently towards morning fell asleep from exhaustion when awoke mr houseman be sitting by bedside looking at cry be soon clasped in other arm condoling presently houseman came took wife away rather angrily mr gaunt be prevailed on to eat little toast drink glass of wine then sat waiting dreadful summons waited waited until became impatient to face danger there be two petty larceny on before have to wait at last about noon came message to say that grand jury have found true bill against then may god forgive said soon afterwards be informed time drew very near made toilet carefully passed with attendant into small room under court here have to endure chilling wait in sombre room presently heard voice above cry out king versus catherine gaunt then be beckoned to mounted step badly lighted found in glare of day greedy eye in felon dock in matter entirely strange seldom know beforehand what can do how will carry mr gaunt sooner set foot in dock saw tiny awful front of justice face to face than tremor abated power awoke thrilled with love of life bristled with fine art of defense that nature lends to superior woman entered on defense before spoke word for attacked prejudice of court by deportment curtsied reverently to judge contrived to make reverence seem wiling homage unmixed with fear cast eye round saw court thronged with lady gentleman knew in moment read in face that only two three be on side bowed to only returned courtesy gave impression false one that gentry sympathized with after little murmur of functionary clerk of arraigns turned to prisoner said in loud voice catherine gaunt hold up thy hand held up hand recited indictment charged that not having fear of god before eye being moved by instigation of devil have on fifteen of october in tenth year of reign of present majesty aided abetted one thomas leicester in assault upon one griffith gaunt esq said griffith gaunt did with force arm assassinate do to death against peace of said lord king crown dignity after reading indictment clerk of arraigns turned to prisoner how sayest thou catherine gaunt art thou guilty of felony murder whereof thou standest indicted not guilty be not guilty culprit how wilt thou be tried culprit be none only accused will be tried by god country god send thee good deliverance mr whitworth junior counsel for crown then rose to open case prisoner with pale face most courteous demeanor begged leave to make previous motion to court mr whitworth bowed sat down lord said have first favor to ask that favor methinks will grant since be justice impartial justice accuser hear have too counsel learned able be woman match for skill therefore beg lordship to allow counsel on defense to matter of fact a well a of law know be not usual be just be informed have sometimes be granted in trial of life death that lordship hath power if have will to do so much justice judge looked towards mr sergeant wiltshire who be leader on other side rose instantly replied to purpose prisoner be misinformed truth be that from time immemorial down to other day person indicted for capital offense be never allowed counsel at except to matter of law must be started by by recent practice rule hath be so far relaxed that counsel have sometimes be permitted to examine cross examine witness for prisoner never to make observation on evidence to draw inference from to point in issue mr gaunt so then if be sued for small sum of money may have skilled orator to defend against like if be sued for life honor may not oppose skill to skill must stand here child against be master 't be monstrous iniquity sir will not deny sergeant wiltshire madam permit whether be hardship to deny full counsel to prisoner in criminal case will not pretend to say if be 't be hardship of law making not of mine of lord none have suffered by at least in day who have broken law sergeant then stopped minute whispered with junior after turned to judge lord be of counsel for crown desire to hing be hard where person life be at stake yield to prisoner indulgence for lordship can find precedent in reading more so leave matter to clerk of arraigns crier proclaim silence crier oyez oyez oyez majesty justice do straitly charge manner of person to keep silence on pain of imprisonment judge prisoner what brother wiltshire say law be clear in there be precedent for what ask contrary practice stare in face for century what seems to partial practice to be frank learned person be of mind must be set against in capital case burden of proof lie on crown not on accused also be duty to give assistance can that will do thus then be can be allowed counsel to examine own witness cross examine witness for crown speak to point of law to be started by further then asked what gentleman there present must assign to for counsel reply to inquiry took whole court by surprise made solicitor houseman very miserable none lord said half justice be injustice will lend color will not set able men to fight for with hand tied against men a able whose hand be free counsel on term so partial will have none counsel will be three more lord innocence lord god omniscient word grandly uttered caused dead silence in court only for few moment be broken by loud mechanical voice of crier who proclaimed silence then called name of jury be to try cause mr gaunt listened keenly to name familiar bourgeois name now seemed regal for who owned held life in hand juryman be sworn in grand old form now slightly curtailed joseph king look upon prisoner will well truly try true deliverance make between sovereign lord king prisoner at bar whom will have in charge true verdict give according to evidence so help god mr whitworth for crown then opened case did little more than translate indictment into more rational language sat down sergeant wiltshire addressed court somewhat after fashion may please lordship gentleman of jury be case of great expectation importance prisoner at bar gentlewoman by birth education a must have already perceived by breeding also stand indicted for le crime than murder need not paint to heinousness of crime have to consult own breast who ever saw ghastly corpse of victim weltering in blood did not feel own blood run cold through vein have murderer fled with what eagerness do pursue with what zeal apprehend with what joy do bring to justice even dreadful sentence of death doe not shock when pronounced upon hear with solemn satisfaction acknowledge justice of divine sentence sheddeth man blood by man will blood be shed if be case in common murder what will be thought of who have murdered husband man in whose arm have lain whom have sworn at god altar to love cherish such murderer be robber a well a assassin for robs own child of father that tender parent who can never be replaced in world gentleman will fear be proved that prisoner at bar hath be guilty of murder in high degree though will endeavor rather to extenuate than to aggravate yet trust sic have history to open a will shock ear of who hear mr griffith gaunt unfortunate deceased be man of descent worship a to character be inoffensive be known a worthy kindly gentleman deeply attached to who now stand accused of murder lived happily together for year unfortunately there be thorn in rose of wedded life be of church of england be be roman catholic led to dispute wonder since same unhappy difference hath more than once embroiled nation let alone single family well gentleman about year ago there be more violent quarrel than usual between deceased prisoner at bar deceased left home for several month returned upon certain day in year reconciliation real apparent took place left home again soon afterwards only for short period on th of last october suddenly returned for good a intended here begin tragedy to what have hitherto related be prologue scarce hour before came one thomas leicester entered house now thomas leicester be creature of prisoner have be gamekeeper be now pedlar be prisoner who set up a pedlar purchased ware to start in trade gentleman pedlar a will prove be concealed in house when deceased arrived one caroline ryder who be prisoner gentlewoman be person who first informed of leicester arrival seems be much moved mr ryder will tell fell into hysteric soon after husband arrival be announced then passion be of very different kind so violent be rage against unhappy man that for once forgot prudence threatened life before witness yes gentleman will prove that gentlewoman who in appearance manner might grace court be so transported out of usual self that held up knife knife gentleman vowed to put into husband heart be mere temporary ebullition of wrath will see presently that long after have time to cool repeated menace to unfortunate man face first threat however be uttered in own bedroom before confidential servant caroline ryder aforesaid now scene shift have to appearance recovered sits smiling at head of table for must know entertained company night person of highest standing in county presently husband unconscious of terrible sentiment entertained towards fearful purpose have announced enters room make obeisance to guest go to take wife hand what doe draw back with so strange look such forbidding word that company be disconcerted consternation fell on present ere long made excuse left house thus prisoner be left alone with husband meantime curiosity have be excited by strange conduct of servant with foreboding heart listened at door of dining room what did hear gentleman furious quarrel in however deceased be comparatively passive prisoner again threatened life with vehemence passion be clear have not cooled now may fairly be alleged on behalf of prisoner that witness for crown be on one side of door prisoner deceased on other such evidence must be received with caution grant where be not sustained by other circumstance by direct proof let then give prisoner benefit of doubt let inquire how deceased understood who not only heard word accent saw look be that accompanied gentleman be man of known courage resolution yet be found after terrible interview much cowed dejected spoke to mr ryder of death a event not far distant so went to bedroom in melancholy foreboding state where be that bedroom be thrust by wife order into small chamber not allowed to enter hers master of house husband lord interpretation of prisoner word did not end there left further comment by action next ensuing dared not beg pardon be inference receive a such did not remain in house single night bolted chamber door inside in very dead of night notwithstanding fatigue of day journey for have ridden distance let out by window reached ground safely though be height of fourteen foot leap gentleman that few of must venture to take what will not men risk when destruction be at heel did not wait even to saddle horse fled on foot unhappy man fled from danger met death from hour when went up to bed none of inmate of house ever saw griffith gaunt alive one thomas hayes laborer saw walking in certain direction at one o'clock morning behind gentleman there walked man who be that other man when have told be essential feature of case how prisoner be employed during time that husband lay quaking in little room waiting opportunity to escape when tell fear will divine who be that followed deceased for what purpose gentleman when prisoner have threatened husband in person a have described retired to own room not to sleep ordered maid mr ryder to bring thomas leicester to chamber yes gentleman received pedlar at midnight in bed chamber now act so strange a admits think of two interpretation have guilty amour with fellow have extraordinary need of service whole character by consent of witness render very improbable that must descend to low amour moreover acted too publicly in matter man a know be tool creature have bought ware for set up a pedlar openly summoned to presence kept there about hour went from very soon after be seen by thomas hayes following griffith gaunt at one o'clock in morning that griffith gaunt who after hour be never seen alive gentleman up to point evidence be clear connected cogent rarely happens in case of murder that human eye see very blow struck penalty be too severe for such act to be done in presence of eye witness not one murderer in ton must be convicted without help of circumstantial evidence next link however be taken up by ear witness in case ear be even better than eye for instance a to discharge of firearm for by eye alone must not positively tell whether pistol have gone off have flashed in pan well then gentleman few minute after mr gaunt be last seen alive be by thomas hayes mr ryder who have retired to bedroom heard said gaunt distinctly cry for help also heard pistol shot discharged took place by side of lake large pond near house called 'the mere ' mr ryder alarmed house other servant proceeded to master room found bolted from inside broke open mr gaunt have escaped by window a have already told presently in come prisoner from out of door be at one o'clock in morning how appears to have seen at once that must explain being abroad at time so told mr ryder that have be out praying here people laughed harshly be threatened severely silenced be that credible do people go out of door at one o'clock in morning to pray nay fear be to do act that year of prayer penitence can not efface from moment mr gaunt be seen no more among living men what made disappearance more mysterious be that have actually at time just inherited largely from namesake mr gaunt of coggleswade own interest that of other legatee required immediate presence mr atkins testator solicitor advertised for unfortunate gentleman did not appear to claim fortune then plain men began to put that together cried out 'foul play ' justice be set in motion at last embarrassed by circumstance that body of deceased must not be found at last mr atkins solicitor being unable to get estate have mentioned administered for want of proof of griffith gaunt decease entered heartily into affair on mere civil ground asked prisoner before several witness if must permit to drag that piece of water by side of mr gaunt be heard to cry for help after seen more prisoner did not reply mr houseman solicitor very worthy man who have believe have up to moment sincere conviction of innocence answered for told mr atkins be welcome to drag drain then prisoner said nothing fainted away after may imagine with what expectation water be dragged gentleman after hour of fruitless labour body be found here unforeseen circumstance befriended prisoner seems that piece of water swarm with enormous pike other ravenous fish have so horribly mutilated deceased that form feature remained to swear by a law wisely humanely demand that in eas body will be identified beyond doubt justice bade fair to be baffled again lo a often happens in case of murder providence interposed pointed with unerring finger to slight infallible mark deceased gentleman be known to have large mole over left temple have be noticed by servant neighbor well gentleman greedy fish have spared mole spared perhaps by command who bade whale swallow jonah yet not destroy there be clear infallible be examined by several witness be recognized completed that chain of evidence of direct of circumstantial have laid before very briefly part of will now support by credible witness called thirteen witness including mr atkins thomas hayes jane bannister caroline ryder others evidence in chief bore out positive statement counsel have made in cross examining witness mr gaunt took line agreeably surprised court be not for nothing have studied hundred trial with woman observation patient docility have found out how badly people plead own cause have noticed reason one of be that say too much stray from point line took with one exception be keen brevity cross examined thomas hayes a follows chapter xi say pedlar be hundred yard behind husband of two men be walking fastest thomas hayes considered moment well think squire be walking rather smartest of two did pedlar seem likely to overtake nay ye see dame squire walked straight on pedlar took side of road at oust a saying be prisoner forgive thomas know what mean hayes compassionately how must ye be never worse for liquor like of prisoner very keenly oh be in liquor be hayes come dame do brew good ale at hernshaw castle ye need go to deny for lord know be sin poor fellow may be jolly yet not to say drunk judge sternly witness attend answer directly prisoner nay lord 't be plain country body mean ill good thomas be so much friend a to answer plainly be man drunk sober hayes know be went from one side of road to t'other prisoner thomas hayes a hope to be saved eternally be pedlar drunk sober hayes well if must tell on neighbor else be damned then that there pedlar be a drunk a lord here notwithstanding nature of trial laughter be irrepressible mr gaunt sat quietly down for be allowed seat said more to surgeon who have examined body officially put question did find sign of violence surgeon none then there be nothing to go by except head bone prisoner have experience in kind mean have inspected murdered body surgeon yes prisoner how many surgeon two before prisoner oh pray pray say before have great hope murder at hath be committed here let keep to plain case please describe injury in two undoubted case surgeon in wellyn skull be fractured in two place in sherrett right arm be broken there be contusion on head cause of death be stab penetrated lung prisoner suppose wellyn murderer have thrown body into water fish have so mutilated a have one must by art have detected sign of violence surgeon certainly man skull be fractured wellyn mean prisoner put same question with regard to sherrett surgeon can not answer here lung be devoured by

evidence for crown being now complete judge retired for refreshment court buzzed like hum of bee mr gaunt lip throat be parched heart quaked woman of lower order thrust forth great arm gave orange mr gaunt thanked sweetly juice relieved throat also bit of sympathy be of good omen did heart good buried face in hand collected power for undertaking before have noted down exact order of topic more judge returned crier demanded silence prisoner rose turned eye modestly steadily upon who held life in hand true to wisdom of sex first thing aimed at be to please lord gentleman of jury be now to reply to charge of murder founded on little testimony good deal of false must need say reasonable conjecture be innocent unlike other innocent person who have stood here before have man to complain of magistrate who committed proceeded with due caution humanity weighed hitherto unspotted reputation be in hurry to prejudge here in court have met with much forbearance learned counsel for crown have made groan under ability be duty said from first must hing hard have kept word often might have stopped saw in face being gentleman christian a well a learned lawyer methinks said to be poor gentlewoman pleading for life let have little advantage a for lord have promised to be counsel so far a high station duty to crown admit have supported consoled more than once with word of justice must not think have encouraged guilty person have comforted sustained beyond expression so then stand here victim not of man injustice of deceitful appearance of honest hasty loose conjecture conjecture will now sift hope to show how hollow be gentleman in disputed matter best way be told be to begin by settling what party be agreed in so to narrow matter to use way then do heartily agree with learned counsel that murder be heinous crime black a be at best yet be still more detestable when 't be wife that murder husband robs child of parent who can never be replaced also agree with circumstantial evidence be often sufficient to convict murderer indeed be not so that most monstrous of crime must go oftenest unpunished since of culprit murderer do most shun eye of men in dark deed so provide before hand direct testimony to execrable crime there will be none only herein be advised to take distinction escaped learned sergeant say that first of ought to be proved directly to naked eye that man have be murdered then if none saw crime done let circumstance point out murderer here put cart before horse find dead body with mark of violence whatever labour to prove by circumstantial evidence alone that mere dead body be murdered body be advised be bad in law contrary to general precedent particular precedent for be not example warning since prisoner so rashly convicted be proved innocent after execution judge took note of distinction then to go from principle to fact agree admit that in moment of anger be so transported out of a to threaten husband life before caroline ryder afterwards when saw face to face then threatened with violence deny fact be have just learned that have committed capital offense what threatened with be law be proved by jane bannister say heard say constable must come for next morning for what to murder judge give leave will prove mr gaunt have committed capital offense prisoner must lord be to do for if did must cast into worse trouble than be in judge shaking head gravely let advise to advance nothing be not able willing to prove prisoner then confine to be proved by witness for crown in dining room threatened husband to face with law now threat not that other extravagant threat never heard know be clearly threat caused to abscond night in next place agree with learned counsel be out of door at one o'clock morning if will use a witness in matter then must not pick choose mutilate testimony nay let take whole truth not just so much a can square with indictment believe be out of door praying believe be out of door at gentleman hear simple truth may see in map on south side of hernshaw castle grove of large fir tree 't be reverend place most fit for prayer meditation here have prayed thousand time more before fifteenth october hence 't be called 'the dame haunt ' a will prove that be dame 't be called after let not seem incredible to must pray out of door in grove on fine clear starry night for aught know protestant may pray only by fireside remember be catholic be not so contracted in praying confine to little comfortable place nay for seventeen hundred year more have prayed out of door a much a in door custom be fit subject for willow sneer how doe learned sergeant know that beneath vault of heaven at night studded with angelic eye star be unfit place to bend knee raise soul in prayer have ever tried sudden appeal to learned eminent by mean devotional sergeant so tickled gentleman of bar that burst out laughing with singular unanimity dashed prisoner who have not intended to be funny hesitated looked distressed judge proceed madam remark of yours be singular quite pertinent fit subject for ridicule gentleman remember public look to for example prisoner lord 't be fault for making personal must be general woman be so 't be foible pray good sergeant to excuse say then generally that when sun retires then earth fade heaven come out in tenfold glory say starry firmament at night be temple not built with hand bare sight of subdues passion chastens heart aid soul in prayer surprisingly lord a be christian woman 't be true that husband have wronged cruelly broken law 't be true that raged

door beneath holy eye of heaven seemed to look down with chaste reproach on ungoverned heat left fireside velvet cushion little comfort made by human hand adorn earthly dwelling distract eye from god applause followed piece of eloquence exquisitely uttered be checked prisoner resumed with entire change of manner gentleman case against be like piece of rotten wood varnished over look fair to eye will not bear handling a example of what say take three charge on learned sergeant greatly relied on opening case st received thomas leicester in bedroom nd that went hot from after mr gaunt rd that be seen following mr gaunt with bloody intent how ugly three proof looked at first sight well when squeezed witness ever so little what did three dwindle down to st received thomas leicester in ante room lead to boudoir that boudoir lead to bedroom nd thomas leicester went from to kitchen there for good half hour drank ale a appears made love to old sweetheart caroline ryder false witness for crown went abroad fresh from not from rd that be not to speak strictly seen following mr gaunt just walking on same road drunk staggering going at rate a crown own witness swore must hardly in nature of thing overtake mr gaunt who walked quicker straighter too than so then even if murder have be done have failed to connect thomas leicester with with thomas leicester two broken link in chain of three now come to more agreeable part of defense do think there have be murder at there be evidence of murder body be found with flesh eaten by fish bone head uninjured swear surgeon who have examined body certainly have presumption to guess look like murdered body being sifted be forced to admit so far a experience of murdered body go be not like murdered body for there be bone broken bruise on head where be body found in water water by be sufficient cause of death common cause too kill without breaking bone bruising head o perversity of wise for one creature murdered in england ten be accidentally drowned find dead man in water be a much a to say find slain in arm of slayer yet once suspect water go about in search of strange monstrous crime mr gaunt cry for help be heard here if be heard at greatly doubt here by clump of tree body be found here hard by bridge be by measurement one furlong sixty pace from clump of tree a will prove there be current in mere lively enough to move body what there be run wrong way so disconnect cry for help dead body broken link now come to third defense say body be not body of griffith gaunt body mutilated be have two distinguishing mark mole on brow pair of hobnailed shoe on foot now adviser of crown fix eye on mole turn head away from hobnailed shoe why article of raiment found on body be legal evidence of identity how often lord in case of murder hath crown relied on such particular especially in case where corruption have obscured feature will not imitate partiality obstinate prejudice will not ask to shut eye on mole a do on shoe will meet whole truth fairly mr gaunt went from house that morning with boot on foot with mole on brow thomas leicester went same road with shoe on foot a will prove with mole on brow to be sure crown witness did not distinctly admit mole on will remember dared not deny on oath so run head into indictment for perjury gentleman will put seven witness into box who will swear that have known thomas leicester for year that have mole upon left temple one of witness be mother bore will then call witness to prove on fifteenth of october bridge over mere be in bad repair portion of side rail gone that body be found within few yard of defective bridge then a thomas leicester went that way drunk staggering from side to side may reasonably infer that fell into water in passing bridge to show be possible will prove same thing have actually occurred will swear oldest man in parish who will depose to similar event happened in boyhood hath said thousand time before to day now will swear will tell that on certain day sixty nine year ago parson of hernshaw rev augustus murthwaite went to cross bridge at night after carousing at hernshaw castle with great grandfather husband mine then proprietor of hernshaw tumbled into water body be found gnawed out of very form of humanity by fish within yard two of spot where poor tom leicester be found that hath cost trouble so do same cause bring round same event in cycle of year only difference be that parson drank death in dining room pedlar in kitchen doubt lord have observed that sometimes hasty involuntary inaccuracy give quite wrong color to thing assure have suffered by be said that moment mr atkins proposed to drag mere fainted away in account there be omission will prove that mr atkins used word 'and underneath water undertake to find remains of griffith gaunt ' now gentleman will understand at time indeed until moment when saw shoe upon poor corpse foot be in great terror for husband life how must be otherwise caroline ryder have told heard cry for help have disappeared what be to think feared have fallen in with robber feared manner of thing so when lawyer said so positively must find body be overpowered ah gentleman wedded love survives many wrong many angry word love husband still when man told so brutally that be certainly dead fainted away confess will be hanged for now thank god be full of hope that be alive good hope have given courage to make great effort to save own life hitherto have be able to contradict accuser positively now come to mysterious circumstance that own puzzle most person accused of murder must if chose make clean breast tell whole matter be not case know shoe from boot know kate gaunt from liar murderess when be said be still dark mysterious business there be thing in can only deal with a do gentleman by bringing wit to bear upon in reasonable conjecture caroline ryder swears heard mr gaunt cry for help mr gaunt have certainly disappeared accuser have somewhat weakened by trying to palm off body of thomas leicester on for body of mr gaunt original mystery remains puzzle might fairly appeal to to disbelieve witness be proved incontinent practiced liar
