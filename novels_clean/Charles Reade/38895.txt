church be glazed rest be at present great jagged opening in outer wall to day uncouth imperfection made church beautiful be glorious summer afternoon sunshine came broken into marvellous form through irregular opening played bewitching prank upon so many broken surface streamed through gaping wall clove dark cool side aisle with river of glory dazzled glowed on white pillar beyond nearly whole central aisle be chequered with light shade in broken outline shade seeming cooler more soothing than ever shade be light like patch of amber diamond animated with heavenly fire above from west to east blue sky vaulted lofty aisle seemed quite close sunny cap of woman made sea of white contrasting exquisitely with vivid vault of blue for mid aisle huge a be be crammed yet quite still word mellow gentle earnest voice of preacher held mute margaret stood spell bound at beauty devotion great calm got behind pillar in north aisle there though must hardly catch word sweet devotional languor crept over at loveliness of place preacher musical voice balmy oil seemed to trickle over wave in heart smooth so leaned against pillar with eye half closed seemed soft dreamy felt good to be there presently saw lady leave excellent place opposite to get out of sun be indeed pouring on head from window margaret went round softly swiftly be fortunate enough to get place be now beside pillar of south aisle not above fifty foot from preacher be at side little behind must hear word attention however be soon distracted by shadow of man head shoulder bobbing up down so drolly have ado to keep from smiling be nothing essentially droll be sexton digging found that out in moment by looking behind through window to whence shadow came now a be looking at jorian ketel digging suddenly tone of preacher voice fell upon ear mind so distinctly seemed literally to strike make vibrate inside out hand went to bosom so strange sudden be thrill then turned round looked at preacher back be turned nothing visible tonsure sighed that tonsure being saw contradicted tone effectually yet now leaned little forward with downcast eye hoping for accent again did not come whole voice grew strangely upon rose fell a preacher warmed seemed to waken faint echo of thousand happy memory must not look to dispel melancholy pleasure voice gave presently in middle of eloquent period preacher stopped almost sighed soothing music have ended must sermon be ended already looked around people did not move good many face seemed now to turn way looked behind sharply there be nothing there startled countenance near now eyed preacher followed look there in pulpit be face of staring corpse friar eye naturally large made larger by thinness of cheek be dilated to supernatural size glaring way out of bloodless face cringed turned fearfully round for thought there must be terrible thing near there be nothing be outside figure of listening crowd at moment church fell into commotion figure got up over building craned forward agitated face by hundred gazed from friar to margaret from margaret to friar turning to fro of so many cap made loud rustle then came shriek of nervous woman buzzing of men margaret seeing so many eye levelled at shrank terrified behind pillar with one scared hurried glance at preacher momentary a glance be caught in stricken face expression made shiver turned faint sat down on heap of chip workman have left buried face in hand sermon went on again heard sound of not sense tried to think mind be in whirl thought must fix in shape on prodigy stricken face have seen look stamped recollection of look now made quiver from head to foot for look be recognition sermon after wavering time ended in strain of exalted nay feverish eloquence went far to make crowd forget

charmed father clement a did margaret more carried mind direct to creator of good pure delight then eye fell on great aisle crammed with country folk thousand snowy cap filigreed with gold many hundred league have travelled seen nothing like except snow in morning have thundered sweet afternoon seemed out of tune with threat bowel yearned over multitude must tell of god love poor soul heard almost a little of from pulpit then day a heathen used told glad tidings of salvation people hung upon gentle earnest tongue be not one of preacher who keep gyrating in pulpit like weathercock on steeple moved heart of others more than own body on other hand did not entirely neglect who be in bad place presently warm with theme that none of multitude might miss joyful tidings of christ love turned towards south aisle there in stream of sunshine from window be radiant face of margaret brandt gazed at without emotion just benumbed soul body soon word died in throat trembled a glared at
