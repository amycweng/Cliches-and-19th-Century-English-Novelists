tyrannical hole tiresome old ship ca do what like in well more can in grave be agreeable residence be hurrying to for tiresome old ship lord more can said tadcaster with sudden candor forgot that air be very light ship hardly moved be beginning to get dull when one day sail be sighted on weather bow standing to eastward on nearing be seen by cut of sail to be man of war evidently homeward bound so captain hamilton ordered main royal to be lowered to render signal more visible demand hoisted notice being taken of gun be fired to draw attention to signal have desired effect down went main royal up went number on referring to signal book proved to be vindictive from pacific station being ascertained captain hamilton being captain senior signalled close prepare to receive letter in obedience to bore up ran down rounded to sail in amphitrite be also shortened maintopsail laid to mast boat lowered captain having finished despatch with letter bag be handed into boat shoved off pulled to lee

young nb be twenty seven tad sixteen to be sure tad be four foot eleven be only five foot six half to return to narrative with apology meeting of vessel caused very agreeable excitement that day greater be in store in afternoon tadcaster staines principal officer of ship being at dinner in captain cabin in came officer of watch reported large spar on weather bow well close if can let know if look worth picking up then explained to lord tadcaster on cruise never liked to pas spar anything might possibly reveal fate of vessel other in middle of discourse officer came in again not in same cool business way ran in excitedly said captain signalman report alive alive spar what do mean something alive on eh sir alive how can that be hail again ask what be officer went out hailed signalman at mast head what be sea sarpint think hail reached captain ear faintly however waited quietly till officer came in reported then burst out absurd there be such creature in universe what do say dr staines be in department universe in department captain haw haw haw went fitzroy two more rogue serpent dr staines thus appealed to asked captain if have ever seen small snake out at sea why of course sailed through mile of once in archipelago sure be snake quite sure biggest be not eight foot long very well captain then sea serpent exist becomes mere question of size now produce larger animal in kind land sea grown elephant weighs believe about five ton very smallest of whale tribe weighs ten go a high a forty ton there be smaller fish than whale be four time a heavy a elephant why doubt then that sea can breed snake to eclipse boa constrictor even if creature have never be seen must by mere reasoning from analogy expect sea to produce serpent excelling boa constrictor a lobster excels crayfish of river see how large thing grow at sea salmon born in river weighs in six month quarter of pound le go out to sea come back in one year weighing seven pound so far from doubting large sea serpent believe exist by million only thing that puzzle be why must ever show nose above water must be very numerous think captain hamilton laughed said well be new doctor in compliment to opinion will go on deck inspect reptile think so common stopped at door said doctor saltcellar be by must mind bringing on deck will want little to secure animal so went on deck right merrily captain went up few ratline in mizzen rigging looked to windward laughing time of sudden there be great change in manner good heaven be alive luff helmsman obeyed news spread like wildfire mess kid grog kid pipe be let fall three hundred sailor clustered on rigging like bee to view long talked of monster be soon discovered to be moving lazily along propelling part being under water about twenty five foot visible have small head for so large body a got nearer rough scale be seen ending in smaller one further down body have mane not like lion a have pretended if have ever seen pony with hog mane be more character of creature mane if mane be got within hundred yard of saw plainly scarce believing sens when must get nearer for wind captain yielded to instinct urge man always to kill curiosity to encourage rest a saith witty voltaire get ready gun best shot in ship lay fire be soon done bang went gun shot struck water close to brute may have struck under water for aught know way sorely disturbed for reared into air column of serpent flesh looked a thick a maintopmast of seventy four opened mouth looked capacious enough to swallow largest buoy anchor in ship with strange grating noise between bark hiss dived be seen no more when be gone looked at one like men awaking from dream staines alone took quite coolly did not surprise in least have always thought incredible that boa constrictor must be larger than sea snake that idea struck a monstrous absurd noted sea serpent in journal with doubt semble more like very large eel next day crossed line just before noon young gentleman burst into staines cabin apologizing for want of ceremony if dr staines must like to see line be now in sight from mizzentop glad of sir said staines collect for in ship bucket if please want to send line to friend at home young gentleman buried hand in pocket walked out in solemn silence resumed position on lee side of quarter deck nevertheless opening coupled with what have heard read made staines little uneasy went to friend fitzroy said now look here be at service of experienced humorous mariner plead guilty at once to crime of never having passed line so make ready swab lather ship scraper shave let get over lord tadcaster be nervous sensitive prouder than seems be not going to have driven into fit for neptune amphitrites in creation fitzroy heard out then burst out laughing why there be none of game in royal navy said have be twenty year be so sorry said dr staines if there be form of wit revere be practical joking doctor be satirical beggar staines told tadcaster went forward chaffed friend quartermaster who be one of forecastle wit say quartermaster why doe neptune come on board dead silence wonder what have become of poor old nep gone ashore growled seaman last seen in rateliff highway got shop there lends shilling in pound on seaman advance ticket oh amphitrite married sexton at wapping nereid neruds scratching head har kept eye on small craft believe be selling oyster in port of leith light breeze carried across equator soon after got becalmed be dreary work ship rolled gently continuously upset lord tadcaster stomach again quenched manly spirit at last be fortunate enough to catch southeast trade be so languid at first that ship barely moved through water though set stitch studding sail alow aloft till really be acre of canvas while be so creeping along man in mizzentop noticed enormous shark gliding steadily in wake may seem small incident yet ran through ship like wildfire caused more le uneasiness in three hundred stout heart so near be seaman to death so strong persuasion in superstitious mind that shark doe not follow ship pertinaciously without prophetic instinct of calamity unfortunately quartermaster conveyed idea to lord tadcaster confirmed by numerous example to prove that there be always death at hand when shark followed ship thereupon tadcaster took into head that be under relapse shark be waiting for dead body got quite low spirited staines told fitzroy fitzroy said shark be hanged will have on deck in hour got leave from captain hook be baited with large piece of pork towed astern by stout line experienced old hand attending to by turn shark came up leisurely surveyed bait apprehend ascertained position of hook at event turned quietly on back sucked bait off retired to enjoy officer in ship tried in turn without success for if got ready for moment took bait jerked rope hard in case opened enormous mouth so wide that bait hook came out clear sooner later always got bait left captor hook went on for day huge dorsal fin always in ship wake then tadcaster who have watched experiment with hope lost spirit appetite staines reasoned with in vain somebody be to die although there be three hundred more in ship must be one at last actually made will threw into staines arm gave message to mother lady cicely ended by frightening into fit roused staines pity also put on mettle what science be beaten by shark pondered matter with might at last idea came to asked captain permission to try hand be accorded immediately ship store placed at disposal very politely with sly comical grin dr staines got from carpenter sheet of zinc spare copper flannel cut into three inch square soaked flannel in acidulated water then procured quantity of bell wire greater part of insulated by wrapping round with hot gutta percha so eager be that did not turn in night in morning prepared what called electric fuse filled soda water bottle with gunpowder attaching cork to make buoyant put in fuse bung made water tight connected insulated main wire enveloped bottle in pork tied line to let bottle overboard captain officer shook head mysteriously tar peeped grinned from rope to see doctor try catch shark with soda water bottle hook somehow doctor seemed to know what be about so hovered round awaited result mystified curious showing teeth from ear to ear only thing fear said staines be that moment take bait will cut wire before can complete circuit fire fuse nevertheless there be objection to success of experiment shark have disappeared well said captain at event have frightened away said little tadcaster white a ghost be only under water know waiting waiting there be cried one in ratline there be rush to taffrail great excitement keep clear of said staines quietly firmly can only be done at moment before cut wire old shark swam slowly round bait saw be something new swam round round wo take said one suspect something oh will take meat somehow leave pepper sly old fox have eaten many poor jack one shark turned slowly on back instead of grabbing at bait seemed to draw by gentle suction into capacious throat ready to blow out in moment if be not all right moment bait be drawn out of sight staines completed circuit bottle exploded with fury surprised everybody who saw ton of water flew into air came down in spray gory carcass floated belly uppermost visibly staining blue water there be roar of amazement applause carcass be towed alongside at tadcaster urgent request then power of explosion be seen confined first by bottle then by meat then by fish lastly by water have exploded with tenfold power have blown brute head into million atom have even torn great furrow in carcass exposing three foot of backbone taddy gloated on enemy began to pick up again from that hour wind improved a usual in latitude scarcely varied point have pleasant time private theatrical other amusement till got to latitude deg s longitude deg w then trade wind deserted light variable wind succeeded master complained of chronometer captain thought duty to verify correct so shaped course for island of tristan d'acunha then lying little way out of course ought perhaps to explain to general reader that exact position of island being long ago established recorded be infallible guide to go by in verifying ship chronometer next day glass fell day captain said must double reef topsail at for something be brewing weather however be fine ship be sailing very fast when about hour before sunset mast head man hailed that there be bulk of timber in sight broad on weather bow signalman be sent up said looked like raft captain who be on deck levelled glass at made out raft with sort of rail to stump of mast ordered officer of watch to keep ship a close to wind a possible must like to examine if must master represented respectfully that must be unadvisable to beat to windward for have faith in chronometer sir be important to make island before dark fog rise here so suddenly very well mr bolt then suppose must let raft go man on raft to windward signalman electrified ship captain ran up mizzen rigging scanned raft now nearly abeam be man cried be about to alter ship course when at moment signalman hailed again be corpse how d know by gull then succeeded exciting dialogue between captain master who being in department be very firm went so far a to say must not answer for safety of ship if did not sight land before dark captain said very well took turn two at last said majesty ship must not pas raft with man on dead alive then began to give necessary order before be out of mouth fatal interruption occurred tadcaster ran into dr staines cabin cry raft with corpse close by staines sprang to quarter port to see craning eagerly out lower port chain

to ricochet from ground so immense be second bound carried to eland struck one blow on head with terrible paw felled a if with thunderbolt down went body with leg doubled poor head turned over nose kissed ground lion stood motionless presently eland who be not dead stunned began to recover struggle feebly up then lion sprang on with roar rolled over with two tremendous bite shake tore entrails out laid dying sat composedly down contemplated last convulsion without touching again at roar though not loud horse though have never heard seen lion trembled pulled at halter blacky crept into water

politely paternally drew back watched young people enjoying meantime approached on tiptoe jackal hyena dared not come too near slate colored vulture settled at little distance not soul dared interfere with cub saw lion be acting sentinel knew better than come near after time papa feared for digestion of brat else own mouth watered for came up knocked head over heel with velvet paw took gentle hint ran into wood double quick then lion began tearing away at eland bolting huge morsel greedily made rabble mouth water hyena jackal vulture formed circle ludicrous to behold that circle kept narrowing a lion tore away at prey increased in number at last hunger overcame prudence rear rank shoved on front a amongst men general attack seemed imminent then lion looked up at invader uttered reproachful growl went at patting right left knocking over never touched vulture indeed did kill animal be lion only killed to eat yet soon cleared place because knocked over few hyena jackal rest being active tumbled over vulture before must spread heavy wing after warning made respectful circle again through in due course gorged lion stalked into wood savage sentiment change quickly hottentot fearing little from full lion be now giggling at staines side staines asked thought be lord of creature man lion lion said blacky amazed at willow question staines now got up proposed to continue journey blacky be for waiting lion be gone to sleep after meal while discussed question lion burst out of wood within hearing of voice a pricked up ear showed made straight for at distance of scarcely thirty yard now chance be lion knew nothing about only came to drink at kloof after meal perhaps lie under acacia who can think calmly when first lion burst out on few pace off staines shouldered rifle took hasty flurried aim sent bullet at if have missed perhaps report might have turned lion wounded not mortally instantly enraged beast uttered terrific roar came at with mane distended with rage eye glaring mouth open whole body dilated with fury at terrible moment staines recovered wit enough to see that what little chance have be to fire into destroyer not at kneeled levelled at centre of lion chest not till be within five yard did fire through smoke saw lion in air above rolled shrieking into stream crawled like worm under bank by one motion there lay trembling few second of sick stupor passed be silent have lion lost be possible might yet escape be silent listened in agony for sniffing of lion puzzling out by scent be silent staines looked round saw woolly head two saucer eye open
