theft a well a shipwreck other underwriter applied to by penfold acquiesced others called on wardlaw to ask few question replied to courteously with certain nonchalance treating a affair might be big to be not of particular importance to merchant doing business on scale to one underwriter condell with whom be on somewhat intimate term said wish must insure shannon at value be impossible city of london must not do proserpine brings case of specie true treasure be on board shannon carry bride sir oh indeed miss rolleston ah remember have seen then will not be surprised at proposal will make

then looking down little sheepishly said mr wardlaw may offer piece of advice certainly then double insurance on shannon if can with word slipped out evidently to avoid question did not intend to answer wardlaw stared after stupidly at first then stood up put hand to head in sort of amazement then sat down again ashy pale with dew on forehead muttered faintly double insurance of shannon men

dark eye of followed with mournful tenderness withdrew gaze when looked at clearly be interested in have desire to intrude upon attention must bring up squab for of own wrap when stayed on deck be prompt with arm when vessel lurched showed other little attention be called for on board ship without word yet when thanked in simplest shortest way great eye flashed with pleasure color mounted to very temple engaged young lady be for various reason more sociable with other sex than who be still on universal mock defensive ship like distant country thaw even english reserve woman in general be disposed to admit ecclesiastic to certain privilege wonder then that miss rolleston after few day met mr hazel half way made acquaintance on board proserpine in monosyllable at first ice once fairly broken intercourse of mind became rather rapid at first be mere intellectual exchange one very agreeable to miss rolleston for fine memory omnivorous reading from very boyhood with habit of taking note reviewing have made mr hazel walking dictionary walking essayist if required when came to something most of young lady have hoped from temporary acquaintance viz religious instruction found indeed a learned on a on other topic cold devoid of unction so much so that one day said to can hardly believe have ever be missionary at that seemed so distressed that be sorry for said sweetly excuse mr hazel remark be in rather bad taste fear not at said of course be unfit for missionary work must not be here miss rolleston took good look at said nothing however reply perusal of countenance satisfied that be man with very little petty vanity petty irritability one day be discoursing of gratitude mr hazel said have poor opinion of person who speak of burden of gratitude make fuss about being laid under obligation a for said have owed debt found sense of very sweet perhaps be always hoping to make return said helen be hoping against hope do think people be grateful in general miss rolleston well think be to at least why have experienced gratitude even in convict be poor man who have be transported for something other begged papa to take for gardener papa did be so grateful that do know suspected house be to be robbed actually watched in garden night after night what do think house be attacked by whole gang poor mr seaton confronted shot one be wounded cruelly

rolleston firing up pray who say be criminal mr hazel once for friend of mine ever deserves such name a friend of mine may commit great error imprudence be poor grateful soul be never guilty of downright wickedness stand to reason mr hazel did not encounter feminine logic with usual ability muttered something other with trembling lip left so abruptly that asked whether have inadvertently said anything must have offended awaited explanation none came topic be never revived by mr hazel manner at next meeting showed liked none worse that stood up for friend wind steady from west for two whole day proserpine showed best sailing quality ran four hundred fifty mile in time then came dead calm sail flapped lazily mast described arc sun broiled sailor whistled captain drank mate

gently forward bow went under water while after part rose into air revealed to in cutter two splintered hole in run just below water line next moment stern settled down sea yawned horribly great wave of own making rushed over upper deck lofty mast sail remaining erect went down with sad majesty into deep nothing remained bubbling foaming of voracious water have swallowed up good ship cargo drunken master stood up in boat ready to save cutlas sunk suction of so great body drew down be seen more in world loud sigh broke from living bosom witnessed that terrible catastrophe be beyond word none be uttered except by cooper who spoke so seldom yet now three word of terrible import burst from uttered in loud deep voice rang like sunk ship knell over still bubbling water scuttled by god chapter xii hold tongue said welch with oath mr hazel looked at miss rolleston at be momentary glance eye sank directly filled with patient tear for first few minute after proserpine went down survivor sat benumbed a if awaiting turn to be ingulfed seemed so little proserpine so big yet be swallowed before eye like crumb lost for few moment idea of escaping true be that while there be life there be hope a soon a heart began to beat again eye roved round horizon elastic mind recoiled against despair be rendered easier by wonderful beauty of weather there be men there who have got down from sinking ship into boat heaving tossing against side in gale of wind yet be saved here be calm delightful to be sure in other shipwreck land have be near greatest peril be over when once boat got clear of distressed ship without capsizing here be immediate peril certain death menaced at uncertain distance situation be briefly must come on to blow gale open boat small loaded must not hope to live therefore have two chance for life more must either make land be picked up at sea before weather changed how nearest known land be group of island called juan fernandez lay somewhere to leeward distant at least nine hundred mile must prefer other chance then must beat three hundred mile more to windward for hudson underrating leak a be supposed have run proserpine fully distance out of track of trade now ocean be highway in law in fact contains few highway million of byway once cockleshell get into byway small indeed be chance of being seen picked up by sea going vessel wylie who be leading lowered sail hesitated between two course have indicated however on cutter coming up with ordered cooper to keep head northeast so run night then made sail must in same direction soon outsailed cutter when sun went down be about mile ahead of just before sunset mr hazel made discovery annoyed very much found that welch have put only one bag of biscuit ham keg of spirit small barrel of water on board cutter remonstrated with sharply welch replied that be all right cutter being small have put rest of provision on board long boat on board long boat said hazel with look of wonder have actually made life depend upon scoundrel wylie again deserve to be flung into sea have forethought yet will not be guided by have welch hung head little at reproach however replied rather sullenly that be only for one night must signal long boat in morning get other bag cask out of mr hazel be not to be appeased morning why sail three foot to two how do know wo run away from never expect to get within ten mile of again know know know cooper got up patted mr hazel on shoulder soothingly boat hook aft said to welch then by ingenious use of boat hook of spare canvas contrived to set out studding sail on other side of mast hazel thanked warmly oh cooper cooper said 'd give have in world if bread water be on board cutter instead of long boat cutter have now two wing instead of one water bubbling loud under bow marked increased speed fear of being greatly outsailed by consort began to subside slight sea fret came on obscured sea in part have good lantern compass steered course exactly night according to wylie order changing helmsman four hour mr hazel without word put rug round miss rolleston shoulder round foot oh not sir please said be to be disobeyed by everybody said then submitted in silence in certain obsequious way be quite new well calculated to disarm anger sooner later slept except helmsman at daybreak mr hazel be wakened by loud hail from man in bow sleeper started up long boat not in sight be too true ocean be blank not sail large small in sight many voice spoke at once have carried on till have capsized have given slip unwilling to believe so great calamity eye peered stared over sea in vain not streak must be boat hull not speck must be sail little cutter be alone upon ocean alone with scarcely two day provision nine hundred mile from land four hundred mile to leeward of nearest sea road hazel seeing worst foreboding realized sat down in moody bitter boding silence of other men raged cursed wept aloud lady more patient put hand together prayed to who made sea therein be yet case be cruelest for be by nature more timid than men yet must share desperate peril then to be alone with men one of have told loved hated man be betrothed to shame tortured delicate creature a well a fear happy for of late only of late have learned to pray in earnest qui precari novit premi potest non potest opprimi be now race between starvation drowning way death stared in face chapter xiii long boat be at moment hundred mile to windward of cutter fact be that wylie evening before have be secretly perplexed a to best course have decided to run for island be not easy under own decision at night got more more discontented with finally at nine o'clock pm suddenly gave order to luff tack by daybreak be very near place where proserpine went down whereas cutter having run before wind night be at least hundred mile to leeward of not to deceive reader let for moment think do business in monster will weigh act of wylie justly be just piece of iron egotism preferred for chance of being picked up by vessel thought be about hair breadth better than running for island a to whose bearing be not very clear after be not sure be taking best safest course cutter might be saved after long boat lost meantime be not sorry of excuse to shake off cutter contained one man at least who knew have scuttled proserpine therefore be important to to get to london before receive three thousand pound be to be reward for abominable act way to get to london before mr hazel else to bottom of pacific before be to get back into searoad at hazard be not aware that cutter water biscuit be on board boat did discover till noon next day on making fearful discovery showed human cried out with oath what have done have damned to eternity then ordered boat to be put before wind again men scowled not one stirred finger saw futility of did not persist groaned aloud then sat staring wildly finally like true sailor got to rum stupefied agitated conscience for time while lay drunk at bottom of boat sailor carried out last instruction beating southward right in wind eye five day beat to windward never saw sail then fell dead calm so

be little chance of such event be something not to be neglected also explained that be necessary must arrive at knowledge of island character of shore from sea must rapidly obtain plan of place ascertain what small river there might be indeed see much of interior for judged to be not more than ten mile in length scarce three in width helen felt rather disappointed that trace of emotion

child pouted hazel went about work briskly boat be soon laden with requisite helen watched preparation askance vexed with expedition have urged to make then fell to reflecting on change seemed to have taken place in character who be once so womanly so firm so reasonable why have become so petulant childish capricious sail be set ready to run cutter into surf of rising tide when taking sudden resolution a be helen came rapidly down said will go with if please half in command half in doubt hazel looked little surprised very pleased then added hope will not be in way assured on contrary that might be of great assistance to now with double alacrity ran out little vessel leaped into prow a danced over wave taught how to bring boat head round with help of oar when be snug left at helm on reaching mouth of bay if must so be called made remark that be closed by reef except to north to west wind being southerly have decided to pas to west so opened sea about mile from shore for about three mile perceived consisted of line of bluff cleft at interval by small narrow bay precipitous side of be lined with dense foliage into fissure sea entered with mournful sound died away a crept up yellow sand with nook be carpeted exclamation from helen attracted attention to horizon on northwest where long line of breaker glittered in sun reef low sandy bay appeared to exist in direction about fifteen mile away something more than mile in length a proceeded marked roughly on side of tin baler with point of pin borrowed from helen form of coast line hour half brought to northwestern extremity of island a cleared shelter of land southerly breeze coming with force across open sea caught cutter lay over in way to inspire helen with alarm be about to let go tiller when hazel seized accidentally inclosing hand under grasp of own a pressed tiller hard to port steady please relinquish hold be all right fear cried a kept eye on sail held course for mile more then judging with long tack must weather southerly side of island put boat about took occasion to explain to helen how operation be necessary learned alphabet of navigation western end of little land now lay before be about three mile in breadth for two mile bluff coast line continued unbroken then deep bay mile in width two mile in depth be made by long tongue of sand projecting westerly on extremity grew gigantic palm well recognized a helen landmark hazel stood up in boat to reconnoiter coast perceived sandy shore be dotted with multitude of dark object ere long object be seen to be in motion pointing out to helen with smile said beware miss rolleston yonder be bugbear in force too dark mass moving upon hillock of sand rolling on surf be sea lion phoca leonina lion seal helen strained eye to distinguish form only descried dingy object while thus engaged allowed cutter to fall off little ere hazel have resumed hold upon tiller be fairly in bay great palm tree on starboard bow seem determined to make acquaintance of nightmare remarked perceive that be embayed consternation amused saw that if held present course cutter must take beach about mile ahead where animal be densely crowded at moment something dark bulged up close beside in sea rounded back of monster rolled over disappeared hazel let drop sail for be now fairly in smooth water of bay close to sandy spit gigantic stem of palm tree be on quarter about mile off took to oar rowed slowly toward shore small seal rose behind boat followed playing with blade gambol resembling that of kitten pointed out to helen mild expression of creature face assured that tribe be harmless animal susceptible of domestication cub swam up to boat quite fearlessly touched head gently encouraged to do like shrank from contact be now close ashore hazel throwing out anchor in two foot of water prepared to land beam of wood have brought to decorate palm tree a signal huge stick be soon heaved overboard leaped after towed to nearest landing to tree dragged high up on shore scarcely have disposed conveniently intending to return in day two with mean of affixing in prominent remarkable manner in form of spar across trunk of palm when cry from helen recalled large number of sea lion be coasting quietly down surf toward boat indeed dozen of have made appearance around hazel shouted to not to fear desiring that alarm must not spread to swarm passed back quietly rapidly when reached water three four of animal be already floundering between boat waded slowly toward one of stood beside man creature looked quietly at other then seal rolled over with snuffling self satisfied air winking soft eye with immense complacency helen in alarm must not resist smile at conclusion of so terrible demonstration for with gentle expression tusk of brute looked formidable when saw hazel pushing aside patting very small cub on back recovered courage completely then took to oar again aided by tide be now on ebb rowed round southwestern extremity of island found water here a anticipated very willow be midday when be fairly on southern coast now sailing with wind aft cutter ran through water at racing speed fearing that reef rocky formation might exist in course reduced sail kept away from shore about mile at distance be better able to see inland mark down accident of formation southern coast be uniform helen said resembled cliff of kentish sussex coast of england only english white be here replaced by pale volcanic gray by one o'clock came abreast very spot where have first made land a judged due south of residence have landed here walk of three mile across center of island must have brought home for about similar distance coast exhibited monotonous cliff unbroken even by rill be plain that water shed of island be northward now approached eastern end where rose circular mountain of mention have be already made eminence have evidently at one time be detached from rest of land to be now joined by neck of swamp about mile half in breadth two mile in length hazel proposed to reconnoiter part of shore nearly ran boat close in to land reed cane with bog be densely clothed grew in dark spongy soil here there waste be dotted with ragged tree recognized a cypress from gaunt branch hung black funeral kind of weeper kind of moss resembling iron gray horse hair in texture us though not so long in staple parasite hazel explained to helen be very common in such marshy ground be death flag hung out by nature to warn man that malaria fever be invisible inalienable inhabitant of fatal neighborhood looking narrowly along low shore for good landing where under shelter of tree might repose for hour spread midday repast discovered opening in reed kind of lagoon bayou extending into morass between highland of island circular mountain close under base of latter inlet proposed to explore accordingly sail be taken down cutter be poled into narrow creek water here be so willow that keel slid over quicksand into oar sank freely creek soon became narrow water deeper of blacker color bank more densely covered with cane grew to height of ten twelve foot a close a wheat in thick crop air felt dank heavy hummed with myriad of insect black water became so deep bottom so sticky that hazel took to oar again creek narrowed a proceeded until proved scarcely wide enough to admit of working boat height of reed hindered view on side suddenly however after proceeding very slowly through bend of canal decreased in height density emerged into open space of about five acre in extent kind of oasis in reedy desert created by mossy mound arose amid morass afforded firm footing of grove of tree innumerable shrub availed helen uttered exclamation of delight a island of foliage in sea of reed met eye have be famished with arid monotony of brake soon landed helen insisted on preparation for meal being left to having selected sheltered spot be soon busy with frugal food hazel surveyed spot selecting red cedar be soon seated forty foot above head making topographical survey of neighborhood found that bayou by have entered continued course to northern shore thus cutting off mountain easterly end forming of separate island saw that quarter of mile farther on bayou canal parted forming two stream of to left seemed main channel determined to follow turning to west be toward home saw at distance of two mile crest of hill broken into cliff defined limit of mainland sea have at one time occupied site where morass now stood cliff formed range extending from north to south precipitous side clothed here there with tree marked where descent be broken by platform between range morass extended hazel took note of three place where descent from hill into marsh must believed most readily be made on eastern side close above arose peculiar mountain form be that of truncated cone side densely covered with tree of size voice of helen called from perch descended quickly leaping into mass of brushwood growing at foot of tree helen stood few yard from in admiration before large shrub look mr hazel what singular production said girl a stooped to examine plant bore number of red flower growing out of fruit like prickly pear flower be in various stage be just opening like tulip others more advanced have expanded like umbrella quite overlapped fruit keeping from sun dew others have served turn in way be withered by sun ray wherever be case fruit have also burst open displayed discharged content content looked like seed on narrower inspection proved to be little insect with pink transparent wing body of incredibly vivid crimson hazel examined fruit flower very carefully stood rapt transfixed must be be said at last well be glad have not died without seeing what be said one of most valuable production of earth be cochineal be tunal tree oh indeed said helen indifferently cochineal be used for dye a be not probable will require to dye anything discovery seems to more curious than useful wanted ink pigment mixed with lime juice will form beautiful red ink will lend handkerchief permit to try if have forgotten method by little insect be obtained asked to hold handkerchief under bough of tunal tree where fruit be ripe then shook bough insect fell at once into cloth great number rose buzzed little in sun not yard from where be born sun dried blood so promptly that soon fell dead in handkerchief that sun so killed went through three phase of color before eye fell down black nearly whitened on cloth after came gradually to final color flaming crimson insect thus treated appeared most vivid of soon secured about teacupful be rolled up put away then sat down made very hearty meal for be now past two o'clock re entered boat passing once more into morass found channel of bayou a approached northern shore le difficult of navigation bottom became sandy hard presence of tree in swamp proved that spot of terra firma be more frequent water willowed a opened shore saw with great vexation that tide in receding have left bar at mouth of canal visible in part pushed on however until boat grounded be sad affair there lay sea not fifty yard ahead hazel leaped out examined forded channel at place be about two hundred foot wide found narrow passage near eastern side to towed boat then begged miss rolleston to land relieved boat of mast sail oar thus lightened dragged into passage time occupied in preparation have be also occupied by nature tide have receded cutter stuck immovably in waterway about six fathom short of deeper water what be to be done now inquired helen when hazel returned to side panting cheerful must await rising of tide fear be imprisoned here for three hour at least there be help for helen made light of misfortune spot where have landed be inclosed between two issue of lagoon walked along shore to more easterly narrower canal on arriving hazel found to great annoyance that there be ample water to have floated cutter have selected that least promising road suggested return by road came passing into other canal by to reach sea hurried back found by time tide have left cutter high dry on sand so have choice to wait having three hour to spare hazel asked miss rolleston permission to ascend mountain assented to remain near boat while be engaged in expedition ascent be too rugged steep for power sea shore adjacent grove must find ample amusement during absence accompanied to bank of smaller lagoon forded waving adieu to plunged into dense wood with side of mountain be clothed waited time then heard voice shouting to from height above mountain top be about three quarter of mile from where stood seemed much nearer turned back toward boat walking slowly paused a faint distant cry again reached ear be not repeated then entered grove ground beneath foot be soft with velvety moss dark foliage of tree rendered air cool deliciously fragrant after wandering for time regained edge of grove near boat selecting spot at foot of aged cypress sat down with back against trunk then took out arthur letter began to read impassioned sentence a read sighed deeply a earnestly found pitying arthur condition more than regretted own fell into reverie from reverie into drowsy languor how long remained in state must not remember slight rustle overhead recalled sens believing to be bird moving in branch be resigning again to rest when became sensible of strange emotion conviction that something be watching with fixed gaze cast eye around saw nothing looked upward from tree immediately above lap depended snake tail coiled around dead branch reptile hung straight eye fixed like two ruby upon helen a very slowly let down by uncoiling tail now head be on level with hers in moment must drop into lap be paralyzed chapter xxviii after toiling up rugged steep ascent encumbered with block of gray stone of island seemed to be formed forcing way over fallen tree through tangled undergrowth of specie of wild vine abounded on mountain side hazel stopped to breathe peer around a well a dense foliage permitted be up to waist in scrub stiff leaf of bayonet plant rendered caution necessary in walking at moment through dense foliage caught glisten of sea sun be in north behind by alone guided road due southerly upward once only found small cleared space about acre in extent here be uttered cry helen heard waited few moment in hope to hear voice in reply did not reach again plunged upward now ascent became at time so arduous that more than once almost resolved to relinquish at least to defer task moment rest recalled to be one not easily baffled by difficulty labor so toiled on until judged summit ought to have be reached after pausing to take breath counsel fancied that have borne too much to left ground to right appeared to rise more than path that be pursuing have become level concluded that instead of ascending be circling mountain top turned aside therefore after ten minute hard climbing be pushing through thick high scrub when earth seemed to give way beneath fell into abyss be ingulfed fell from bush to bush down down scratch rip plump until lodged in prickly bush more winded than hurt out of crawled only to discover thus landed in great perfectly circular plain of about thirty acre in extent about three hundred fifty yard in diameter in center be lake also circular broad belt of shore around lake be covered with rich grass level a bowling green again be surrounded by nearly perpendicular cliff down indeed have fallen cliff be thickly clothed with shrub tree hazel recognized crater of extinct volcano on examining lake found water impregnated with volcanic product bottom be formed of asphaltum having made circuit of shore perceived on westerly side next island break in cliff on narrow examination discovered outlet appeared to that lake at one time have emptied water through ancient water course descent here be not only gradual old river bed be tolerably free from obstruction especially of vegetable kind made way rapidly downward in hour reached marshy ground cane brake now lay before on left saw sea on south about third of mile knew that to right must be sea on north about mile so bent way thither edge of swamp be very clear though somewhat spongy afforded good walking unimpeded a approached spot where judged boat to be underwood thickened tree again interlaced arm have to struggle through foliage at length struck smaller lagoon a be not certain whether be fordable followed course to shore where have previously crossed in few moment reached boat be pleased to find afloat rising tide have even moved few foot back into canal hazel shouted to apprise miss rolleston of return then proceeded to restore mast to place replace rigging oar occupied little time felt surprised that have not appeared shouted again reply chapter xxix hazel advanced hurriedly into grove hunted thoroughly without effect satisfied that must not have quitted spot since marsh inclosed on one side canal on second third sea on fourth returned to boat more surprised than anxious waited awhile again shouted name stopped listened answer yet surely helen must not have be more than hundred yard from where stood heart beat with strange sense of apprehension heard nothing rustling of foliage sop of wave on shore a tide crept up shingle a eye roved in direction caught sight of something white near foot of withered cypress tree not fifty yard from where stood approached bush in tree be partially concealed on side quickly recognized portion of helen dress ran toward burst through underwood gained inclosure be sitting there asleep a conjectured back leaning against trunk contemplated thus for one moment then advanced about to awaken be struck speechless face be ashy pale eye open widely distended bosom heaved slowly hazel approached rapidly called to eye never moved not limb stirred sat glaring forward on lap be coiled snake gray mottled with muddy green hazel looked round selected branch of dead tree about three foot in length armed with advanced slowly to reptile be very quiet thanks to warmth of lap pointed stick at vermin lifted head tail began to quiver then darted at stick throwing entire length hazel retreated snake coiled again again darted by repeating process four five time enticed creature away then availing of moment before must recoil struck smart blow on neck when hazel turned to miss rolleston found still fixed in attitude into terror have transfixed poor girl have remained motionless for hour under terrible fascination of reptile comatized spoke to quick spasmodic action of throat quivering of hand alone responded sight of suffering agonized beyond expression took hand pressed for be icy cold called piteously on name seemed incapable of effort then stooping raised tenderly in arm carried to boat where laid still unresisting incapable with trembling limb weak hand launched cutter be once more afloat bound homeward dipped baler into fresh water have brought with for daily supply dashed on forehead repeated until perceived breathing became le painful more rapid then raised little head rested upon arm when reached entrance of bay be obliged to pas for wind being still southerly must not enter by north gate came round ran in by western passage same by have left same morning hazel bent over helen whispered tenderly that be at home answered by sob in hour keel grated on sand near boat house then asked if be strong enough to reach hut raised head felt dizzy helped to land power have forsaken limb head sank on shoulder arm wound round lithe figure alone prevented falling helplessly at foot again raised in arm bore to hut here laid down on bed stood for moment beside unable to restrain tear chapter xxx be wretched anxious night for hazel watched hut without courage to approach that one moment of weakness occurred to on board proserpine when have allowed helen to perceive nature of feeling toward have rendered action open to suspicion dared not exhibit toward sympathy might not extend to most ordinary civility if fell ill if fever supervened how must nurse attend upon touch must have significance knew for a bore insensible form embraced rather than carried precious burden must look upon in suffering without betraying forbidden love then must not attention afflict more than console chewing cud of such bitter thought passed night without noticing change be taking place over island sun rose awakened from reverie have replaced sleep looked around then became sensible of warning in air sea bird flew about vaguely absurdly seemed sporting in current of wind yet there be little wind down below presently cloud came flying over sky blacker mass gathered on horizon sea changed color hazel knew weather be breaking wet season be at hand moment when fever if such invisible inhabitant there be on island must visit in few hour rain must be upon reproached with want of care in construction of hut for hour hovered around before ventured to approach door call to helen thought heard voice faintly entered lay there a have placed knelt beside be appalled at change in appearance poor girl system have received shock for be unprepared severe suffering at sea have strange to say reduced in appearance le than must have be believed for physical endurance proved greater than of strong men around food island supplied be not suited to restore strength nervous shock to have be subjected be followed by complete prostration hazel took unresisting hand must have given world to press felt pulse be weak slow cheek be hollow eye sunken hand dropped helplessly when released leaving hut quietly hastily descended hill to rivulet crossed about mile above boathouse stream forked one of branch coming from west other from east between latter branch terrapin wood be stony hill to spot hazel went fell to gathering handful of poppy when have obtained sufficient quantity returned to boathouse made small fire of chip filling tin baler with water set down poppy to boil when liquor be cool measured out portion drank in about twenty minute temple began to throb sensation be rapidly followed by nausea be midday before recovered from effect of experiment sufficiently to take food then waited for two hour felt much restored stole to hut looked in helen lay there a have left stooped over eye be half closed turned slowly upon lip moved little be felt pulse again be still weaker slower rose went away regaining boat house measured out portion of poppy liquor one third of dose have previously taken drank headache nausea succeeded felt pulse became quick violent while sense of numbness overcame slept be for few minute awoke with throbbing brow sickness with sense of delight at heart for have found opiate prescribed quantity drained liquor away from poppy leaf carried to hut measuring with great care small quantity lifted girl head placed to lip drank mechanically then watched beside until breathing pulse changed in character slept turned aside then buried face in hand prayed fervently for life prayed a pray for daily bread of heart prayed waited chapter xxxi next morning when helen awoke be very weak head ached be hazel have made broth for from fleshy part of turtle greatly revived by midday be able to sit up having seen that want be within reach left in few moment heard busily engaged on roof of hut on return explained to fear that structure be scarcely a weather proof a desired anticipated hourly commencement of rainy season helen smiled pointed to sky here be clear bright hazel shook head doubtingly wet season must commence probably with atmospheric convulsion then settle down to uninterrupted rain helen refused obstinately to believe in more rain than have experienced on board boat genial shower will see replied hazel if change view within next three day then call false prophet following day passed helen recovered more strength still be too weak to walk employed at hazel request in making rope of cocoanut fiber forty yard long required to fish up spar to sufficient height on great palm tree bind firmly in place while worked nimbly employed in gathering store of such thing a must require during coming wintry season watched with smile persevered so that day passed next morning rope be finished helen be not so well be about to help to poppy liquor when hazel happily stopped hand in time showed exact dose necessary explained minutely effect of larger draught then shouldered rope set out for palm tree point be absent about six hour of helen slept four for two seemed very long ruminated what be thinking of made smile weep at same moment looked so impatiently toward door entered at last very fatigued be eleven mile to point back while eating frugal supper gave detail of day adventure strange to say have not seen single seal on sand described how have tied one end of rope to middle of spar with other between teeth climbed great palm for more than hour toiled gained top passed rope over one of branch hauled up spar to about eighty foot above ground then descending with other end wound rope spirally round round tree thus binding to trunk first twenty foot by spar hung from branch listened very carelessly thought betrayed little interest in enterprise have cost so much labor fatigue when have concluded be silent awhile then looking up quickly said to great surprise think may increase dose of medicine there be mistaken in power be sure can take four time what gave indeed be mistaken answered quickly gave extreme measure can take with safety how do know that can only guess at effect at rate will try hazel hesitated then confessed that have made little experiment on before risking effect upon helen looked up at a said so simply quietly great eye filled with angelic light be admiration be thankfulness bosom heaved lip quivered be moment felt glad that hazel have turned away from saw nothing long silence followed little episode when be aroused from reverie patter pat pat patter looked up pat patter patter eye met be rain hazel only smiled little then ran down to boat house to see that be right there then returned with large bundle of chip with made fire for sky have darkened overhead gust of wind ran along water have become suddenly chilly have almost forgotten feel of wet weather ere fire have kindled rain came down in torrent matted roof being resonant heard strike here there above head helen sat down on little stool reflected in hut be two person one have foretold feared provided against other have said petulantly be bugbear now rain be pattering prophet be on knee making a comfortable a must in spite of be not man to remind have foretold pondered character while watched movement put down ember then took cocoa pod out from wall cut in slice with knife made fine clear fire then ran out again in spite of helen remonstrance brought dozen large scale of palmtree be more cheering for dismal scene without pattering of rain on resounding roof thanks to hazel precaution hut proved weather tight of fact having satisfied bade good night be at door when voice recalled mr hazel can not rest night without asking pardon for unkind thing may have done said without thanking humbly for great forbearance respect for unhap mean unfortunate girl thus cast upon mercy held out hand took between own faintly expressed gratitude for kindness so sent away brimful of happiness rain be descending in torrent heard did not feel for have spread angel wing over existence regained sheltered boat house knew not how chapter xxxii next day be sunday hazel have kept calendar of week seventh day be laid aside with jealousy to be devoted to such simple religious exercise a must invent rain still continued with le violence indeed without hour intermission after breakfast read to exodus of israelite suffering during desert life compared hardship with own trouble pointed out to how condition presented many thing to be thankful for island be fruitful climate healthy might have be cast away on sandy key reef where must have perished slowly miserably of hunger exposure then be spared to other have be alone there must not have provided for have be cast away solitary man island must have be to intolerable prison in reflection hazel be very guarded that expression must escape

according to mean got one of tin vessel filed till have obtained considerable quantity of metal subjected for forty hour to action of lime juice then added cochineal mixed till obtained fine scarlet in using added small quantity of hard pure gum have found gum abounded in island pen be made from osprey feather hundred of be strewn about cliff of have already secured dried placing tin baler before on have scratched note drew map of island what will call said helen paused then replied call ' island so will said wrote down then named place have seen reef helen have discovered off northwest coast called white water island because of breaker then came seal bay palm tree point mount lookout be hill due south of where lived called cane brake wild duck swamp spot where lunched cochineal clearing mountain be named mount cavity what will call capital of kingdom hut said miss rolleston a leaned over pointed to spot saint helen said hazel looking up wrote down ere must object then there be little awkward pause while be busily occupied in filling up topographical detail turned off gayly what be caterpillar that have drawn there sprawling over kingdom asked caterpillar be complimentary miss rolleston be mountain oh indeed line be now drawing be river presume yes let call branch of solitary estuary run westward river lea to east river medway be such majesty pleasure la reine le veut replied helen smiling master geographer seems to that be putting in mountain river have never explored how do know that turn twist in stream exist a represent spur look so real have not added only to disguise caterpillar character of range of hill hazel laughed a confessed to drawing on fancy for little detail pleaded that geographer when drew map be licensed to fill in few such touch where discovery have failed to supply particular helen have always believed religiously in map be amused when reflected on former credulity chapter xxxiii helen strength be coming back to slowly complained of great lassitude want of appetite following day having cleared up sun shone out with great power brilliancy gladly welcomed return of fine weather hazel shook head ten day rain be not portion bad

still be everything else none le did strange cloud fly northward eighty mile hour after supper helen sat busy over fire where gum collected by hazel resembling india rubber be boiling be preparing to cover pair of poor welch shoe inside out with coat of material hazel believed to be water proof sat in such position that must watch be happy evening seemed content have got over fear of be good

rolleston with such out of way material a out of way island afforded above will enable reader to follow personage in little excursion past future also to trace course of mysterious event have to record relieved of other immediate care hazel mind have time to dwell upon problem helen have set one fine day conviction struck that have taken narrow puerile view of that after there must be in nature of thing way to attract ship from distance possessed with thought went up to telegraph point abstracted mind from external object fixed on idea came down a went descended by step have cut zigzag for helen use a put foot on fifth step whoo whirr whiz came nine duck cooling head whizzed so close made right for lagoon hum thought hazel never see duck fly in other direction that speculation rankled in night told helen must reconnoiter at daybreak must not take a there might be snake made boat ready at daybreak certain gannet pintadoes booby noddies diver with eye in head like fiery jewel bird whose greedy maw have often gratified chose to fancy must be going fishing be on alert rather troublesome however got adrift ran out through north gate with light westerly breeze followed by whole fleet of bird be joined in due course by of satellite young seal called tommy also fond of fishing feathered convoy soon tailed off tommy stuck to for about eight mile ran that distance to have nearer look at small island lay due north of telegraph point satisfied be little more than very long large reef neighborhood of ought to be avoided by ship of burden resolving to set beacon other on ere long christened white water island on account of surf came about headed for east bluff then tommy gave up in disgust perhaps thought conduct vacillating animal despise that soon landed almost under volcano moored boat not far from cliff peaked with guano exercising due caution time got up to lagoon found great many duck swimming about approached little party to examine variety swam out way of even flew few yard then settled not one must let come within forty yard convinced hazel duck be not native of island stranger who be not much afraid because have never be molested on particular island still distrusted man while pondered thus there be great noise of wing about dozen duck flew over head on rise passed westward still rising till got into high current away upon wing of wind for distant land grand rush of wing off hand way in spurned abandoned disappeared from island held tight made hazel feel very small thought took form of satire lord of creation be sink in water in air tumble on earth stumble pleasing reflection did not prevent taking exact line of flight barking tree to mark be about to leave place when heard splashing not far from there be duck jumping about on water in strange way hazel thought snake have got hold of ran to assistance took out of water soon found what be matter bill be open fish tail be sticking out hazel inserted finger dragged out small fish have erected spine on back so opportunely a nearly to kill destroyer duck recovered enough to quack in feeble dubious manner hazel kept for helen because be plain brown duck with little reluctance slightly shortened one wing stowed away captive in hold of boat happened to have great stock of pitch in boat so employed few hour in writing upon guano rock on one wrote in huge letter english lady wrecked here haste to rescue on wrote in small letter beware reef on north side lie off for signal then came home beached boat brought helen captive why be english duck cried be enraptured by visit to lagoon hazel gathered that island be half way house for migrating bird especially duck inferred that line vagrant have taken be shortest way from island to nearest land be worth knowing set brain working begged helen to watch for return of turtle dove have left island just before rain learn if possible from what point of compass arrived next expedition be undertaken to please helen wished to examine beautiful creek cave on north side have seen from distance when sailed round island started on foot one delightful day walked briskly for air though balmy be exhilarating followed course of river till came to lake fed be fed by hundred of little natural gutter down hill discharged rain be new to helen though not to hazel produced map told lake slyly that be incorrect little too big took of water in hand sprinkled lake with called hazelmere bore little to right proceeded till found creek shaped like wedge at whose broad end shone arch of foliage studded with flower sparkling blue water peeped behind be tempting descent be rather hazardous at first great square block of rock one below rude step be coated with moss of rich hue wet slippery hazel began to be alarmed for companion however after one two difficulty fissure opened wider to sun descended from slimy rock into sloping hot bed of exotic flower huge succulent leaf be glory of tropic ground be carpeted yard deep with luxuriance others more aspiring climbed warm side of diverging cliff just a creeper go up wall lining crevice a rose in blessed spot warmed not scorched by tropical sun fed with trickling water be seen what marvel boon nature can do here vegetable dwarf be giant flower be tree one lovely giantess of jasmine tribe with flower shaped like marigold scented like tube rose have stem a thick a poplar carried thousand bud amber colored flower up eighty foot of broken rock planted on ledge sucker flowered again filled air with perfume tree about half a high be covered with cascade of snow white tulip a big a small flower pot scented like honeysuckle aloe ten foot high blossomed in corner unheeded among loftier beauty at very mouth of fissure huge banana leaned across flung out vast leaf seemed translucent gold against sun under shone monstrous cactus in pink crimson glory through maze of color streamed deep blue of peaceful ocean laughing catching sunbeam helen leaned against cliff quivered with delight that deep sense of flower belongs to true woman hazel feared be ill ill said who must be ill here be heaven upon earth oh dear oh love seemed growing on sea floating in sun be only one of dozen such said hazel if must like to inspect at leisure will just run to palm tree point for signal be askew saw that a came along helen assented readily ran off left provision be not to wait dinner for helen examined two three of flowery fissure found fresh beauty in also english leaf gave pleasure of kind after have reveled in flower examined shore soon discovered that rock abounded here though there be also large patch of clear sand be nearly pure coral in great variety red coral be abundant even pink coral to fashion be just then giving fictitious value be there by ton interested so did beautiful shell lay sparkling time passed swiftly be still busy in research when suddenly darkened little looking back saw white vapor stealing over cliff curling down upon thought prudent to return to place where hazel have left more so a be near sunset vapor descended spread covered sea land then sun set be darkness visible coming from south sea fret caught hazel sooner in le favorable situation returning from palm tree have taken shortest cut through small jungle be so impeded by scrub that when got clear fog be upon between river lost way several time did not hit river till near midnight followed river to lake coasted lake then groped way toward creek after while step took be fraught with danger night be far advanced when at last hit off creek a thought halloed there be reply halloed again to joy voice replied at distance have come to wrong creek be farther westward groped way westward came to creek haloed to answered to attempt descent must have be mere suicide felt that herself almost ordered to stay where be why can talk same said be not for long be curious position one typical of relation between so near together yet barrier so strong be afraid must be very cold said oh have seal skin jacket on be so sheltered here wish be a well off be not afraid to be alone down there be not alone when voice be near now fidget dear friend like little excitement have told so before listen how calm silent be place night mind seems to fill with great idea to feel immortality spoke with solemnity heard in silence indeed be reverend time place sea whose loud penetrating tongue have in former age created gully where sat apart have of late year receded kissed sand gently that calm night so gently that long low murmur seemed echo of tranquillity voice of pair sounded supernatural one speaking up other down speaker quite invisible mr hazel said helen in low earnest voice say that night give wisdom even to wise think now tell true thought have foot of man ever trod upon island before there be silence due to question so grave put with solemnity at solemn time in solemn place at last hazel thoughtful voice came down world be very very very old so old that word history ' be falsehood moses wrote a yesterday man be very old animal upon old old planet have be everywhere can not doubt have be here voice went up have seen sign voice came down have not looked for bone weapon of primeval man be below earth surface at time of day there be dead silence then helen voice went up again in modern time have man landed here from far off place since ship be built voice came sadly down know voice went up think voice came down what calamity can be new in world so old a everything can do suffer others of race have done suffered voice went up hush there be something moving on sand chapter xxxv hazel waited listened so did helen breath came fast for in stilly night heard light mysterious sound something be moving on sand very slowly softly nearer nearer heart began to leap put out hand instinctively to clutch mr hazel be too far off have presence of mind self denial to disguise fear for knew must come headlong to assistance said in quavering whisper be not frightened only v very c curious now became conscious that not only one several thing be creeping about presently creeping ceased be followed by louder more mysterious noise in silent night sounded like raking digging three four mysterious visitant seemed to be making graf be too much especially coming a did after talk about primeval dead desire to scream be so strong be so afraid hazel must break neck if relieved mind in way that actually took handkerchief bit hard situation be cut short by beneficent luminary sun rose with magnificent bound be way in latitude everything unpleasant winced that moment fog shivered in turn appeared to open in furrow a great javelin of golden light shot through from swiftly rising soon golden dart increased to stream of portable fire burst fog illumined wet sand helen burst out laughing like chanticleer for first break of day revealed sexton have scared three ponderous turtle crawling slow clumsy back to sea hazel joined soon found what evil spirit of island have be at poor wretch have buried dozen egg in sand one dozen of be very soon set boiling at first indeed helen objected that have shell hazel told might a well complain of rose without thorn assured turtle egg be known delicacy very superior to bird egg so found be eaten with keenest relish now said helen for discovery first here be english leaf only bigger found on large tree english leaf cried hazel with rapture why be caoutchouc oh dear said helen in disappointed tone took for india rubber free be india rubber tree have be hunting for over island in vain using wretchedly inferior gum for want of be so glad said helen now have something else to show something curdled blood dare say be very foolish then took half across sand pointed out to number of stone dotted over sand in sort of oval stone streaked with sea grass incrusted with small shell be not at equal distance yet allowing for gap formed decided figure outline resembled great fish wanting tail can be chance asked helen oh if must be what fear be savage hazel considered attentively long time too far at sea for living savage said yet can not be chance what on earth be look druidical how can that be island be smaller when be placed here than be now went nearer examined one of stone then scraped away sand from base found be not shaped like stone more like whale rib became excited went on knee tore sand up with hand then rose up agitated traced outline again great heaven said why be ship ship ay said standing in middle of here beneath foot lie man with work treasure carcass have be here for many long year not so very long be too big for sixteenth century yet must have be sunk when island be smaller take to be spanish portuguese ship probably one of treasure ship commodore chartered pirate american buccaneer used to chase about sea here lie bone bone of crew question be soon answered that can say have be said can do have be done can suffer have be suffered be silent sunk ship bone moved strangely in deep isolation from human race even presence of dead brought humanity somehow nearer to walked thoughtfully away made across sand for telegraph point before got home helen suggested that perhaps if be to dig in ship might find something useful shook head impossible iron have melted away like sugar long before nothing can have survived gold silver be not worth picking up much le digging for time be too precious have found two buried treasure to day turtle egg ship freighted a think with what men call precious metal well egg be gold gold be drug there will lie for discovery bore fruit ship hazel made vow never again must poor ship lay rib on island for want of warning buoyed reef ran out to white water island wrote earnest warning on black reef time wrote with white on black wrote similar warning with black on white at western extremity of godsend island egg hazel watched for turtle at daybreak turned one now then fed helen on meat egg morn noon night for time have be advancing in health strength when rain declined considerably be day in air got full benefit of wonderful climate health appetite muscular vigor became truly astonishing especially under what hazel called turtle cure though indeed be cured before ate three good meal day needed for be up with sun hand foot never idle till set four month on island have done four month have not shown straining eye white speck on horizon sail so looked longed for hazel often walked island by not to explore for knew place well by time went round to see that signal be in working order went to mount lookout one day with view be about hour before noon long before got to mountain have scanned horizon carefully a matter of course not speck so when got there did not look seaward just saw that flagstaff be right be about to turn away go home when happened to glance at water there underneath saw ship standing toward island chapter xxxvi started rubbed eye looked again be delusion thing never did come a be expected to come there be still doubtful speck on horizon within eight mile of island in lovely air looked nearly close be ship under canvas bore s e from mount lookout s s e from east bluff of island toward course be apparenty directed have fair wind be not going fast being heavily laden under press of sail keen thrill went through mind be whirl ran home with great news even a ran cold sickly feeling crawled over ship part resisted feeling a thing too monstrous selfish resisted so fiercely that when got to slope saw helen busy at work waved hat hurrahed again again seemed almost mad with triumph helen stood transfixed have never seen in state good news cried great news ship in sight be rescued heart leaped into mouth ship screamed where where came up to panting close under island hid by bluff will see in hour god be praised get everything ready to go hurrah be last day on island word be brave loud boisterous face be pale drawn helen saw though bustled got ready to leave tear be in eye event be too great to be resisted wild excitement grew on ran about like person crazed took thing up laid down again scarcely knowing what be doing presently be sobered little for ship did not appear ran across sand where must see bluff ought to have passed that hour ago hazel thought must have anchored helen looked at steadily dear friend said be sure there be ship at be not under delusion island fill mind with fancy one day thought saw ship sailing in sky ah uttered faint scream for while be speaking bowsprit jib of vessel glided past bluff so closely seemed to scrape ship emerged grandly glided along cliff be mad cried hazel to hug shore like ah have seen warning appeared so for ship just then came up in wind several point left bluff dead astern sailed little way on course then paid off again seemed inclined to range along coast presently be up in wind again made greater offing be sailed in strange vacillating way hazel ascribed to people fear of reef have indicated to comer better to watch maneuver signal if necessary went up to telegraph point must not go out to being low water seen from height working of vessel be unaccountable be to off wind a often a if be drunk commanded by drunken skipper however be kept well clear of home reef made good offing so at last opened bay heading n w distant four mile thereabouts now be time to drop anchor so hazel worked telegraph to draw attention waved hat hand to ship sailed on yawed immensely kept course when have gone mile two more sickening truth forced at last upon eager watcher have decided not to touch at island in joyful signal in vain telegraph in vain that cry for help upon eastern cliff have saved not pleaded for monster saw on height hope joy saw abandoned looked at one with dilating eye to read in human face whether deed a must really be done by man upon fellow uttered wild cry to receding vessel vain vain be in vain then sat down stupefied still glaring at ship at same moment held out hand to other sat hand in hand world to other just then for there be world in sight abandoning in cold blood be calm dear friend said helen patiently oh poor father other hand threw apron over head then came burst of anguish that word must utter at hazel started to foot in fury now may god made sea land judge between miscreant there be patient said helen sobbing oh be patient will not be patient roared hazel judge thou cause oh god of tear against reptile soul so stood glaring hair blowing wildly to breeze while sighed patiently at knee presently began to watch vessel with grim bitter eye anon burst out suddenly aha be right well steered cry sweet one cause be heard be blind be drunk be sick see nobody on deck perhaps have be too god forgive ship ashore chapter xxxvii helen looked up there be ship fast on side be on white water reef not upon black rock on part of be under water hazel ran down to beach there helen found greatly agitated anger be gone have one thought now to go out to assistance still wanted hour to high water be blowing smartly there be nearly always surf upon reef what if vessel must break up life be lost paced sand like wild beast in cage in agony of pity remorse burning impatience feeling became intolerable set back to boat with herculean strength forced down little way to meet tide got log put down for roller strove strained struggled till face hand be purple at last met flowing tide in moment jumped into boat pushed off helen begged with sparkling eye to be allowed to accompany what to ship smitten with scurvy heaven know what certainly not besides must be wet through be blowing rather fresh will carry on pray for poor soul go to help for who have sinned in anger hoisted sail ran out helen stood on bank watched with tender admiration how good brave be must go into passion too when be wronged when thought be well admired none le for watched at first with admiration soon with anxiety for have sooner passed north gate than cutter having sail set though reefed lay down very much hull kept disappearing helen felt anxious must have be downright frightened for confidence in prowess by by only staggering sail be visible sun set ere reached creek wind declined with sun helen made two great fire prepared food for sufferer for made sure hazel must bring off in few hour more promised happiness of relieving distressed to infinite surprise found almost regretting that island be likely to be peopled with stranger matter must sit up for night be very kind to poor thing though have not be very kind to about midnight wind shifted to northwest blew hard helen ran down to shore looked seaward be fair wind for hazel return began to expect hour delayed unaccountably worst of be began to blow gale wind sent sea rolling into bay in manner alarmed seriously night wore on sign of boat now there be heavy gale outside great sea rolling in brown foaming day broke showed sea for mile two rest be hidden by driving rain helen kneeled on shore prayed for dire misgiving oppressed soon be heightened to terror for sea began to disgorge thing of kind have never come ashore before great ship mast came tossing huge a be wave handled like toy then came barrel then broken spar be forerunner of more fearful havoc sea became strewed literally blackened with fragment part wreck part cargo of broken vessel what be compared with horror followed black object caught eye driven in upon crest of wave looked with hair flying straight back eye almost starting from head be boat bottom up driven on tossed like cork came nearer nearer nearer dashed into water with wild scream wave beat backward on sand a rose enormous roller lifted boat upright into air breaking dashed keel downwards on beach at side empty chapter xxxviii helen uttered shriek of agony knee smote together must have swooned on spot for wind spray beat against to fearful stun succeeded wildest distress ran to fro like wild animal bereaved kept wringing hand uttering cry of pity despair went back to boat hundred time held by spell be long before must think connectedly even then be not of of lonely state only why did not die with why did not die instead of have be world to now knew oh what friend what champion what lover cruel wave have destroyed morning broke still hovered hovered about fatal boat with great horror stricken eye hair flying to breeze not tear if must only have smoothed last moment have spoken one word into dying ear poor hero have died in going to save others died thinking a cold a water have destroyed dead alive be world to now went wailing piteously imploring wave to give at least dead body to speak to mourn over sea denied even that dismal consolation next tide brought in few more fragment of wreck corpse floated ashore then at last a wave once more retired leaving time only petty fragment of wreck on beach lifted up voice almost wept heart out of body such tear a be seldom without effect on mind helen now began to rebel though faintly against despair have be quite crushed at first under material evidence boat driven empty by very wind wave have done cruel deed heart be averse to believe calamity especially bereavement very ingenious in arguing against bitterest of woe so now sat down brooded mind fastened with pathetic ingenuity on circumstance must bear favorable construction mast have not be broken how then have be lost body have not come ashore have have time to get to wreck before gale from north came on at why must fair wind though powerful upset boat on slender thing began to build superstructure of hope soon heart interrupted reasoning what must do in place must sit guessing while hope have hair to hang by thought struck like spur in moment bounded into action erect lip fixed eye on fire though cheek be very pale went swiftly to hazel store searched there found jib sail boat hook rope one little oar that hazel be making for have not quite completed sight of last work overpowered again sat down took on knee kissed cried over tear weakened for time felt have resolution to leave oar behind single oar be of use to row with rigged boat hook a mast fastened sail to with poor equipment actually resolved to put out to sea wind still blew smartly there be blue sky visible now remembered have eaten nothing must not do strength might fail made ready meal ate almost fiercely by pure effort of resolution a be doing rest by time be nearly high tide watched water creeping up will float boat rise over keel two inch three inch five inch water now push with strength boat have water in have forgotten to bale out strained nerve must not move stopped to take breath husband strength when renewed effort five inch be four have misery of seeing water crawl away by degree leave boat high dry sighed heart broken awhile then went home prayed when have prayed long time for strength wisdom lay down for hour tried to sleep failed then prepared for more serious struggle with many difficulty have to encounter now thanked god more than ever for health rare strength have acquired in island without must have done nothing now got clay platter baled vessel nearly dry left little water for ballast fortified with food put provision water on board boat in imitation of hazel went got two round log a soon a tide crawled up to four inch lifted bow little got roller under then went to boat stern set teeth pushed with rush of excitement gave almost man strength stubborn boat seemed elastic moved then instinct taught where true strength lay got to stern of boat setting small of back under projecting gunwale gathered together gave superb heave moved boat foot followed up heaved again with like effect then with cry of joy ran put down roller forward boat be now on two roller one more magnificent heave with zeal strength youth boat glided forward turned rushed at a went water deepening gust catching sail went out to sea have only just time to throw across gunwale panting be afloat wind be sw before knew where be boat headed toward home reef slipped through water pretty fast considering how small sail carried ran to helm ala rudder be broken off above water line helm be mockery boat running for reef slacked sheet boat lost way began to drift with tide luckily have not yet turned carried inshore helen cast eye around for expedient unshipped one of transom by trailing over side alternately slacking hauling sheet contrived to make boat crawl like winged bird through western passage after that soon got becalmed under cliff drifted into two foot water instantly tied rope to mast got out into water took rope ashore tied round heavy barrel found there set barrel up heaped stone round on unfortunately be long job though worked with feverish haste then went round point sometimes wet sometimes dry for little oar have left behind because broke heart to look at away with such weakness now with oar last work might steer if must not row got came back to boat to recommence voyage found boat safe in six inch of water tide going out so ended voyage four hundred yard at most then to wait twelve hour for tide be too cruel hour so precious for even if hazel be alive must die of cold hunger ere must get to cried like woman persisted like man made several trip put away thing in boat must possibly be of use abundant provision keg of water hazel wooden spade to paddle steer with basket of tool etc then snatched sleep be broken by sad terrible dream then waited in agony of impatience for high water be not always best judge of what be good for probably delay saved own life went out at last under far more favorable circumstance light westerly breeze reef to pas through be however severely incommoded with ground swell at first steered with spade a well a must found be not sufficient current ran westerly be drifting out of course then remembered hazel lesson made shift to fasten spade to helm then lashed helm even did not quite do so took little oar kissed cried over little then pulled manfully with so a to keep true course be muggy day wet dry white water island be not in sight from godsend island a soon a lost latter former became visible ugly grinning reef with eternal surf on south western side often left off rowing turned to look at be black blank except white fatal surf when be about four mile from nearest part of reef there be rush bubble in water great shark came after boat helen screamed turned very cold dreaded monster not for what must do now for what might have done seemed to know boat swam so vigilantly behind be there when boat upset with hazel in be in greedy maw remains of best friend must be sought lip opened sound shuddered hid face at awful thought shark followed steadily got to reef did not hit off a intended ran under lee lowered little sail steered boat into nick where shark must hardly follow moved to fro like sentinel while landed in trepidation secured boat to branch of white coral rock found place much larger than looked from telegraph point be archipelago of coral reef incrusted here there with shell must not see over where be so made for what seemed highest part bleak sea weedy mound with sandy hillock about went up to looked eagerly round not soul called a loud a sinking heart must let not sound felt very sick sat down upon mound when have yielded awhile to weakness of sex got up be father daughter again set to work to examine foot of reef be easy task rock be rugged sharp in place slippery in others often have to go about once fell hurt pretty hand made bleed never looked at heeded got up sighed at interruption then patiently persisted took two hour to examine thus in detail one island at last discovered something saw at eastern side of reef wooden figure of woman making way to found figurehead piece of bow of ship with sail on yard on that fragment be wedged into angle of reef seaward edge of shattered in way that struck terror to helen for showed how omnipotent sea have be on reef found cask with head stove in also little keg two wooden chest case what be to sat down again for knee failed presently there be sort of moan near seal splashed into water dived out of sight put hand on heart bowed head down utterly desolate sat thus for long time indeed until be interrupted by most unexpected visitor something came sniffing up to put cold nose to hand started violently hand be in air in moment be dog pointer whimpered tried to gambol must not manage be too weak however contrived to let see with wagging of tail certain contemporaneous twist of emaciated body that be welcome having performed ceremony trotted feebly away leaving very much startled not knowing what to think indeed incident set trembling over dog saved from wreck then why not man why not that life oh thought must god save creature not pity poor angel got up animated with hope recommenced research now kept at outward edge of island so went round till reached boat again shark be swimming to fro waiting for with horrible pertinacity tried to eat mouthful though be faint must not eat drank mouthful of water then went to search very small portion remained of reef to take poor dog home with because have lost be so good to animal only example be left said with came burst of sorrow got up did rest of work cry a went after severe traveling got near northeast limit in sort of gully saw dog quietly seated high on tail called never moved so then went to when got near saw why must not come be watching close by lay form of man nearly covered with sea weed foot be visible so be face latter deadly pale be in moment be by leaning over with hand quivering be dead eye be closed be fast asleep hand flew to face to feel alive then grasped hand drew up toward panting bosom tear of joy streamed from eye a sobbed murmured over knew not what at awoke stared at uttered loud ejaculation of joy wonder then taking in burst into tear fell to kissing hand blessing poor soul have almost given up for lost to be saved in moment by must of speak only mingled tear of joy gratitude hazel recovered first rising somewhat stiffly lent arm father spirit went out of in moment of victory be woman sweet loving clinging woman got hold of hand a well a arm clutched so tight little grasp seemed velvet steel let feel said word word supported preserver tenderly to boat then hoisting sail fetched east side in two tack shipped sail yard also cask keg box then put great quantity of loose oyster on board a large a plate looked at with amazement what said when have quite loaded boat only just out of jaw of death yet can trouble head about oyster thing wait till see what will do with said be pearl oyster gathered for when have little hope must ever see again to give be unlucky speech act seemed so small natural thing to woman heart measured more correctly something rose in throat tried to laugh instead of cry so did went into violent fit of hysteric showed how thoroughly nature have be stirred to depth quite frightened hazel indeed strength of excited woman weakness be sometimes alarming to manly nature did must to soothe without much success a soon a be better set sail thinking home be best place for leaned back exhausted after while seemed to be asleep believe be hazel did sat cold aching in body warm at heart worshiping with eye at last got ashore sat by fire told all while cooked supper warmed clothes at fire for ship said be dutch vessel bound from batavia to callao have probably gone on beam end for be full of water crew
