bachelor description of man age simplicity reconciled to when told plan order of campaign mr rolfe have given approved very earnestly fastened in particular on something that mr rolfe have dwelt lightly on dear a sight of be to sweet a sound of loved voice be to ear heart must rather not see again until hope be realized than jeopardize that lady bassett sighed for seemed rather morbid sir charles went on so think of own health first avoid agitation be tormented with fear lest that monster must take advantage of absence to molest if doe leave huntercombe yes leave go to london go even for sake health happiness depend on can not be much affected by anything that happens here betone wall prison make iron bar cage lady bassett promised said must not keep away from must often write to gave rolfe formula told letter must pas that praised asylum sir charles made wry face lady bassett wrist went round neck in moment oh charles dear for sake hold little little candle to devil mr rolfe say must oblige in be not so noble a then will be very good obedient in what heart be set upon at last sir charles consented then made haste told other everything have happened be late in afternoon before parted lady bassett controlled tear at parting a well a must mr coyne have slyly hid emerged when came down to carriage shook warmly by hand bowed at door incessantly with face in pucker till cavalcade dashed away chapter xxv lady bassett timed next visit so that found dr suaby at home received kindly showed master told sir charles be mixed case in fall fit morbid desire for offspring have played part hoped speedy cure said counted on assistance there be doubt what meant for one thing said to rather slyly coyne tell have be good enough to supply with hint a to treatment sedative be opposed to idiosyncrasy lady bassett blushed high said something about dr willis oh be quite right dr willis only be not so very conversant with idiosyncrasy why have let smoke twenty cigar day of life brain be accessible by other road than stomach well have got down to four cigar in month will have down to two effect of exercise simple food absence of powerful excitement will see do part said gayly will do ours be most interesting patient in house born to adorn society though by concurrence of unhappy circumstance be separated from for while spent whole afternoon with sir charles dined together at doctor private table with one two patient who be touched showed sign of on occasion for good doctor really acted like oil on troubled water sir charles lady bassett corresponded so kept heart up after rolfe hint correspondence be rather guarded if letter be read in asylum curious must learn that sir charles be far more anxious about wife condition than own that two patient person be only waiting certain near event to attack richard bassett with accumulated fury that smoldering fire did not smoke by letter burned deep in sore heavy enduring anglo saxon heart lady bassett wrote to mr rolfe thanking again for advice telling how worked have very short reply from gentleman about six week after visit surprised little by writing of own accord asking for formal introduction to sir charles bassett begging to back request that sir charles must devote leisure hour two to correspondence with not said on private affair on matter of general interest want few of experience observation in place have le scruple in asking that take out of will be salutary lady bassett sent required introduction in such term sir charles at once consented to oblige wife by obliging mr rolfe dear sir in compliance with wish lady bassett send few desultory remark on what see here st line wit to madness nearly be allied thin partition do bond divide ' be in opinion exaggerated untrue taking people here a guide insane in general appear to be people with very little brain enormous egotism next observation be that woman have far le imagination than men can not even realize own favorite delusion for instance here be two young lady virgin mary queen of england how do play part sit aloof from rest with nose in air gauge imagination go down on one knee address a saint queen can not say word in accordance yet be cunning enough to see can not reply in character so will not utter syllable to adorer be like shop boy who go to masquerade a burleigh walsingham when ask who be queen be favorite just now blush look offended pas sulkily on same class of male lunatic can speak in character observation have made doubt whether philosopher be not mistaken in saying that woman generally have more imagination than men suspect have infinitely le believe great love of novel have be set down to imagination arises mainly from want of writer of novel supply that defect for by pictorial style by infinity of minute detail petty aid to realizing imaginative reader can do for on reading bare narrative of sterling fact incident find monotony in madness so many have inspiration see phantom be victim of vast conspiracy principality power combined against fly food be poisoned wine be drugged etc etc think be form of morbid egotism be at bottom of insanity so be antipathy for other keep apart because madman be self talk be self thus egotism clash antipathy arises yet be not think pure antipathy though so regarded mere form of boundless egotism if in visiting asylum see two three different patient buttonhole fourth pour grievance into listening ear may safely suspect of sanity on whole think doctor one of attendant jones keeper have more solid eccentricity variety about than most of patient extract from letter written about fortnight later insane person have way of couching nonsense in language sound rational have false air of logical connection period seem stolen from sensible
