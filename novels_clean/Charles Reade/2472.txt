growing on for minute past for why be passage opened to night have never seen opened before why be jacintha lying sentinel at foot of stair be not all now that be in room men became conscious of sound besides lady voice very peculiar sound also came from behind screen heard showed by puzzled look cast at one that must make out what on earth be consisted of succession of little rustle followed by little thump on floor what be curious too rustle thump rustle thump fell exactly into time of music so clearly rustle thump be being played to tune tune sung to rustle thump last touch of mystery inflamed edouard impatience beyond bearing pointed eagerly merrily to corner of screen raynal obeyed stepped very slowly cautiously towards rustle thump rustle thump rustle thump with rhythm of harmonious voice edouard got head foot into room without taking eye off raynal rustle thump rustle thump rustle thump raynal be now at screen quietly put head round hand upon edouard be bursting with expectation result what be see why doe not speak to seems transfixed rustle thump rustle thump accompanied now for few note by one voice only rose suddenly there burst shriek from josephine so loud so

there be large round bastion about three time height of wall masonry be new very embrasure be not yet cut young blood be for assaulting equivocal fortification at end of day march brought french advanced guard in sight of place old general must not hear of soldier life must not be flung away assaulting place must be reduced in twenty one day with mathematical certainty for at epoch siege be looked on a process with certain result only problem be in how many day must place be taken even used to settle to day two on paper by arithmetic so many foot of wall so many gun on one side so many gun so many men such such soil to cut trench in on other result two figure varying from fourteen to forty two figure represented duration of siege for siege arithmetic right in general have often be terribly disturbed by one little incident occurs from time to time viz genius inside indeed be one of sin of genius go put out calculation have stood brunt of year archimedes todleben be doubt clever men in way good citizen yet one characteristic of delicate men mind lacked veneration showed sad disrespect for wisdom of ancient deranged calculation so much learning patient thought have hallowed
