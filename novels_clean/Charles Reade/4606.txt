bowed rapidly to three gentleman in turn waited in silence command then mr williams drew up in chair wore solemn dignified appearance that becomes judge trying prisoner with difference that manner be not harsh intentionally offensive just such a to reveal vast superiority irresistible weight in solemn tone with touch of pity began thus be sorry to say mr eden grave charge be laid against in prison give uneasiness on account sir replied mr eden politely be perhaps false yet come from one who have mean of knowing from governor mr hawes ah then be sure to be false will see four sunday ago preached sermon two ay one be against cruelty be other handled theft mr hawes conceives to have be singled out exposed by sermon why so there be more than thirty cruel men in jail besides then sermon be not aimed at put mr williams with pinning air be be not be aimed at class of parishioner to belongs large class including turnkey one between twenty thirty of greater criminal among prisoner mr hawes mr williams bit lip gentleman classification show animus then turning to mr eden said with half incredulous sneer how come that mr hawes took sermon to mr eden smiled how doe happen that two prisoner took to two men sent for after sermon be wife beater found in great agitation one terrified other softened to tear of penitence did not apply word to mr truth be when searching sermon be preached sinner take to be glad mr hawes fitted cap on be glad prisoner fitted cap on be sorry mr hawes be irritated instead of reformed be glad two le hardened sinner be reformed instead of irritated must

ignorant inexperienced layman to usurp episcopal function in diocese episcopal function mr eden mr eden smiled doe not even see that have be trying to usurp sacred function of highest order be of piece profound ignorance of law civil ecclesiastical characterizes act in jail good soul just ask for what purpose doe bishop exist why be one priest raised above other priest consecrated bishop to enable church to govern servant laugh ought rather to rebuke what have attempted be something worse than childish arrogance be warned touch not sacred vessel so rashly be profanation flashing eye deepening voice old awful ecclesiastical superiority suddenly thundering upon quite cowed two smaller magistrate williams whose pomposity priest have so rudely shaken gasped for breath with rage magisterial arrogance be not prepared for ecclesiastical arrogance blow be stunning gentleman wish to consult be pleased to retire for minute sir discussion took place in chaplain absence williams be for dismissing on spot others who be cooler must not hear of have made false move said saw mistake made most of never mind will catch on other ground during discussion mr eden have not be idle went into robinson empty cell coolly placed there inkstand pen quire in place of hawes have removed then glancing at watch ran hastily out of jail opposite gate found four men waiting be there by appointment giles said to one think gentleman will come down by next train go to station hire jenkyns fly with gray horse let one have who be not coming on to jail two stay by printing press loom till further order jackson keep in way too servant will bring dinner at two o'clock then ran back to justice be waiting for mr williams began with cutting coldness did not wish to go to length of laying complaint against before bishop if really prefer to friendly remonstrance prefer right thing to wrong thing be prompt calm rejoinder complaint will be made mr eden bowed eye twinkled pictured to pompous personage writing to bishop of to tell that objected to mr eden preaching not that have ever heard that in attacking great human vice have hit jailer next think can deal with mr hawes complains that constantly interfere between prisoner undermine authority support in legal act do oppose illegal one whole aim be to subvert discipline of jail on contrary assure be only officer of jail who maintains discipline a by law established be to understand that give mr lie will phrase contradiction according to own taste sir do think be likeliest to be believed mr hawes by gentleman mr eden by rest of nation here mr palmer put in word think ought to pay le respect to one man bare assertion than to be case for proof well palmer replied woodcock how can jail go on with two at dagger drawn can not said mr eden ah can see that house divided against suggested mr eden well then said mr woodcock let try give more friendly tone to discussion why not weapon must bear polishing yes have high reputation mr eden for learning christian feeling in fact general consideration in be held have made more lenient in case than must have be with man in office there be wrong ca mean make return for feeling know feel value of peace unity do then be man to restore to place will try governor can not pull together one must go clearly well then stigma will rest on will be allowed to offer voluntary resignation excuse propose to arrive at peace unity by route see other if turn mr hawes out will come to same thing will not mr hawes mr hawes ca turn out sir sneered williams think can have confidence respect will have protection still will turn out with god help be defiance mr eden can not really think capable of defying three justice of peace said mr eden in solemn tone eye twinkling defiance said mr palmer innocently well palmer opposition to mr hawes be opposition to be so bitter that leaf alternative must propose to bench to remove from office mr eden bowed meantime put in mr williams will probably suspend very day by authority mr eden bowed will not detain longer sir said williams rather insolently will stay to say one word to gentleman who have conducted with courtesy toward sir for own sake enter on contest with be unequal one boy have just be murdered in prison be about to drag murderer into light why hang upon skirt compel to expose to public horror a abettor there be yet time to disown fell practice of hell looked at watch there be hour waste in act superior will undo see here be prison rule child must understand child must see that what call 'the

proceeding in month of january compare two separate honorable name from contact of caitiff whose crime will gibbet in nation eye with unless seize chance withdraw countenance from three injustice rose by one impulse make preparation to leave jail said mr woodcock hour be quite enough under circumstance said williams palmer stood aghast mind be not fast enough to keep up mr eden bowed retired be scarcely out of room when justice drew up order for suspension from office mr hawes be next sent for have found chaplain described discipline be impossible with man here be order for suspension hawes eye sparkled will enter into book meantime be to see executed hawes went out presently returned wo go gentleman what do mean by wo go said williams told order said worship be exceeding authority wo go

shoot bolt what doe mean inquired mr palmer mean sir that wo get out except by kicking out hawes have be irritating wounded vanity in order to get up to mark then turn out by force said williams other two be wiser must not do that can keep out if once cross door will manage for gentleman said mr hawes do mr hawes went out primed fry with message to mr eden that gentleman have ridden over from oxford to see be at house mr eden be in room busy collecting arranging several paper have just tied up in little portfolio when heard fry voice at door when worthy delivered message lip curled with scorn said very well will disappoint sly booby thought next moment looking out of window saw fly with gray horse coming along road at last cried instantly unbolted door issued forth with little portfolio under arm have scarce taken ten step when turnkey popped out from corner stood sentinel over room door barring return mr eden smiled passed on along corridor descended from first floor to basement here found hawes affecting business not skillfully enough to hide that be watching mr eden out in yard leading to great door found injustice aha thought waiting to see out raised hat politely

may be believe distinguished at sea in storm in west indie mr williams put in warmly went out to vessel in distress in hurricane at jamaica be off mauritius observed mr eden with gleam of satisfaction well said mr lacy saved other life at risk of own matter where pray mr eden doe reading experience lead to believe that brave man be ever cruel one yes there be proverb that cruel be always coward cant seven out of twelve be coward five brave agree with presumption be on mr hawes side only fact on mine mr lacy smiled superciliously to fact let go then received note from home office morning in compliance with note have prepared case yes will begin by giving idea what nature of evidence will be page two of print twenty of manuscript three four living witness one dead body hum seems in earnest gentleman how long do require to state case can be done to day mr lacy looked at watch half peevishly hour be reply only hour ay hour neat what do mean by neat minute not to be counted be wasted in idle interruption in argument drawn from vague probability where direct evidence lie under sens for instance that because have be twenty five year servant of christ with good repute therefore be not to be credited must bring false accusation that because mr hawes be brave twenty year ago in one set of circumstance therefore can not be cruel now in set of circumstance mr lacy colored little took pinch of snuff then coolly drew out of pocket long paper sealed have idea what be mr eden caught sight of direction be to probably dismissal from post be hawes quivered with exultation have authority to present with if justify charge have made against brother officer good said mr eden be intelligent be just first gleam of have come into dark hole since have known augur

want book log book of prison get mr hawes if please mr hawes went out mr williams be prison rule by act of parliament showed paper be sir examine closely mr lacy contain whole discipline of prison a by law established keep before be with will have to compare jailer act now how many time be jailer empowered to punish given prisoner once on second offense prisoner see be referred for punishment to visiting justice if therefore jailer have taken upon to punish same prisoner twice have broken law at event have gone beyond letter of particular set of rule rule be drawn up by lawyer be based on law of land jailer in eye of law be merely head turnkey set to guard prisoner for hundred of year have lawful right to punish prisoner at right be first bestowed on with clear limitation by act passed in george fourth reign must show because act be jailer sole authority for punishing prisoner at here be passage sir will be kind enough to read out hum 'the keeper of prison will have power to hear complaint touching of following offense disobedience of prison rule assault by one prisoner on where dangerous wound be given profane cursing swearing indecent behavior at chapel idleness negligence in work said keeper may punish such offense by ordering offender to close confinement in refractory solitary cell by keeping such offender upon bread water only for term not exceeding three day observe put in mr eden can only punish once then not select punishment according to own fancy be restricted to separate confinement bread water three day mr lacy continued case criminal prisoner will be guilty of repeated offense against rule of prison of greater offense than jailer be by act empowered to punish said jailer will forthwith report same to visiting justice who can punish for one
