have positively asked to do attention being thus unexpectedly called to subject felt desirous to talk to little on own account mr coventry went straight to cutler arm went slowly powerful contest be now going on within jealousy rage urged onward honor gratitude held back then came self deceiving heart suggested that miss carden have be first to break promise have let jael dence into little secret that be being undermined by cunning deceit strict notion of honor must be out of place in such combat lastly felt duty to save miss carden from degrading connection consideration taken together proved

cruelty cruelty lay in head rather than in heart out of trade question man though vain arrogant be of genial rather kindly nature even in trade question being more intelligent than fellow be sometimes infested with gleam of humanity bigotry be at moment disturbed by visitation of kind be perplexed said often hesitate on trade question men have done be always low lived blackguard who must have destroyed if have not disabled now little be decent young chap struck at root of trade so long a wrought openly on sly nobody knowing might be a well to shut eye bit informant be not in trade other three took more personal view of matter little be outwitting resisting saw nothing for to stop by hook by crook while sat debating case in whisper with head so close might have covered with tea tray clear musical voice be heard to speak to barmaid by direction in walked into council chamber mr henry little visit greatly surprised messrs parkin jobson potter made stare look at one uneasily did not surprise grotait so much came about in simplest way that morning at about eleven o'clock dr amboyne have called on mr little have asked henry rather stiffly whether be quite forgetting life labor capital now young man must not feel that for time past have used good doctor ill have neglected almost forgotten benevolent hobby so doctor gentle reproach went to heart said give day two sir will show how ashamed be of selfish behavior true to pledge collected note together prepared report to be illustrated with drawing then went to cheetham more a matter of form than thing to see if condemned grindstone have be changed to infinite surprise found have not bayne told reason henry be angry went direct to grotait about a soon a saw jobson parkin potter started started oh said did expect to find so much good company why here be whole quorum will retire sir if wish not at order be to convert to life labor capital grotait pricked up ear directly if succeed devil will be next to come round doubt well mr grotait simmons be on same grindstone condemned for matter of four shilling find that in trade master provides stone grinder hang race in one sense be time lost well simmons decline new stone unless cheetham will pay by time for hanging racing cheetham refuse so between that idiot work on faulty stone will use influence with grinder well mr little now between ourselves think rather hard that poor workman must have to hang race master grindstone for nothing why share loss between stone cost master three pound hanging cost workman only four five shilling where be grievance hanging racing stone shortens grinder life fill lung with grit be workman to give life labor for forenoon be capital to contribute nothing be that view of life labor capital young man henry be staggered moment be smart said rule of trade be rule till be altered by consent of party made now right wrong be rule of trade here that small grinder find own stone pay for power saw grinder be better off for have not to find stone power only drawback be that must hang race new stone cost master sixty shilling cheetham be smarting under rule ca expect to go against rule save shilling doe grinder think might a well ask what grindstone think well what doe grinder say then say 'd rather run stone out than lose forenoon well sir be business may be man business to hang be bystander to hinder mistake mean that grinder be only man who know whether stone be safe well grinder doe not pretend stone be safe all say be safe not will run out so now question be will pay four shilling from box for blockhead loss of time in hanging racing new stone four secretary opened eye with surprise at grotait merely said have authority to do that fund of union be set apart for specified purpose very likely said henry getting warm when there be life to be taken union can find money irregularly so why grudge when there be life to be saved perhaps ten time cheaper than pay for blood young man said grotait severely did come here to insult with worn out slander came to see whether secretary who can find pound to assassinate men blow up woman child with gunpowder can find shilling to secure life of one of own member risk time mount horsing well sir application be without precedent must decline beg to do a courteously a application have be made uncourteously oh be easy to be polite when have got heart be first ever brought that charge against ought to be ashamed of said potter warmly heart mr grotait be known for good husband tender father truest friend in others echoed sentiment warmly sincerely for a strange a may appear to who have not studied human nature at first hand word of eulogy be strictly true thank gentleman said grotait must make allowance mr little be smarting under gross dastardly outrage also under fair defeat think opponent must be monster now must like to show contrary let simmons take care of have given good advice much to credit now have nothing to say to on own account not word said henry steadily suppose must suggest way by must carry on trade in hillsborough offend nobody must decline to hear even be at war on that have done worst will do best to make

legislature might do might issue commission to examine hillsborough trade when accurately informed might put practical restraint on murder suicide be going on at present few of suggestion have thrown

blame at have better not till be quite sure be one way of losing high spirited girl tell wo mother well dear when asked leave to come to station see off seemed put out did forbid did not like somehow ah knew beforehand that coventry must be there gently gently might think possible yet not know more likely be on account of father have never told that love daughter be rather mercenary perhaps be too

hour of parting oh how wise be what insight have got word be balm there be with for ever so long be here alone not quite alone love counselor be by side may perhaps show how to turn to advantage write to day then postman will be powerful rival to mr coventry perhaps more powerful one than mr coventry to acting on advice henry wrote day to grace carden be not so constant in reply did write to now then letter breathed gentle affection that allayed jealousy made period of separation happiest six week have ever known a for grace about three o'clock used to look out for postman be uneasy restless

occurred between young little first becoming master return of cardens from london little a master acted up to philanthropic theory have put forth when workman wet grinder in employ submitted to improved plate paved drained floor cozy fire without murmur word of thanks by degree even found out be more comfortable than other person in condition congratulated upon dry grinder consented of to profit by improved fan others must not take trouble to put fan in gear must rather go on inhaling metal dust stone grit henry reasoned in vain remonstrated with little success then discharged couple retired with mien of martyr successor be admitted on written agreement left option fan triumphed file cutter be more troublesome clung to death disease like limpet to established rock must not try other bed than bare lead must not wash at tap little have provided must smuggle in dinner eat with poisoned hand little reasoned remonstrated with such very trifling success at last have to put down iron heel gave file cutter printed card with warning to leave on one side reason on other in twenty four hour received polite remonstrance from secretary of file cutter union replied that men must remain if must sign agreement to forego certain suicidal practice to pay fine in case of disobedience said fine to be deducted from earnings then secretary suggested conference at cutler arm little assented there be hot argument father of file cutter objected to tyranny innovation little maintained that innovation be nearly always improvement world being silly be manifestly improvement in case under consideration said also be merely doing what union ought to do protecting life of union men who be too childish wrong headed to protect prefer short life merry one mr little said father of file cutter life of disease be not merry one slow poisoning be not pleasant way of living miserable way of dying none healthy be happy many croesus must give fortune for poor man stomach yet want cutler to be sick men day not gain shilling by man alive be not trying to lower wage ay be going way to do how do make out trade be full already if force men to live to threescore ten will overcrowd so will come to starvation wage little be staggered at thunderbolt of logic digested matter in silence for moment then remembered something have fallen from dr amboyne turned to grotait what do say to sir must grind death scythe for at list price to thin labor market grotait hesitated for once in heart went with file cutter understanding encumbered starvation said be a miserable death a poisoning why make large question out of small one with rushing into generality really think might let mr little settle matter with individual workman have got little factory little crochet chooses to lengthen life of six file cutter say to bey money be own will give so much of in return for so much work so much washing other novelty question be doe pay cover new labor of washing etc a well a old mr grotait pay highest price be going in case think union be not bound to recognize discussion mr little have other reason to lay before good friend here hope to convince now there be little party of going to dine to morrow at beavage hotel ' up by new reservoir give pleasure of company will by time perhaps may have smoothed little matter for little thanked accepted invitation left pair of secretary together when be gone grotait represented that public opinion must go with little on question outrage have sustained must be ripped up by hillsborough liberal two topic combined in ugly way for what to thwart good hearted young fellow in philanthropical crotchet after did honor must never be imitated by other master in hillsborough so for once machiavel sided with henry not from purest motif yet mind not without certain mixture of right feeling humanity on sunday henry dined with party at savage hotel said dinner rather surprised henry meat be simple of good quality wine be brought out by grotait be excellent that old saw who retailed ale spirit to customer must serve nothing le to guest than champagne burgundy if cheer be generous host be admirable showed at head of genial board quality coupled with fanaticism have made doge of hillsborough trade be primed on subject must interest guest knew something about nearly everything else kept ball always going did not monologuize except when be appealed to a judge then did with mellow grace that man can learn without nature aid there be society however distinguished in grotait must not have be accepted a polished admirable converser add to that have art be never quite common be now becoming rare of making guest feel friend for time at event young little sat amazed drank in word with delight must not realize that genial philosopher be person who have launched band of ruffian at yet in secret heart must not doubt so looked listened with marvelous mixture of feeling on one must easily write page of analysis very curious equally tedious dined at three at five got up a agreed beforehand went to inspect reservoir in course of construction more compendious work of art be never projected contractor have taken for basis mountain gorge with stream flowing through down toward hillsborough have to do be to throw embankment across lower end of gorge turn to mighty basin open to receive stream drainage from four thousand acre of hill from lake sixty foot wear be to deal out water supply to mill owner below surplus to people of hillsborough distant about eight mile on easy decline now a reservoir must be full at starting must then be eighty foot deep in center mile long quarter of mile broad on average embankment of uncommon strength be required to restrain so great mass of water be what hillsborough worthy be curious about strolled out to work then tea be to come out after weather being warm soft close to work found foreman of engineer smoking pipe interrogated showed rising wall five hundred foot wide at base told be to be ninety foot high narrowing gradually to summit twelve foot broad a whole embankment be to be twelve hundred foot long at top gave idea of bulk of material to be used material be clay shale mill stone sandstone of looser texture engineer knew grotait brought drawing of mighty cone to be erected why will be mountain said little not far from sir yet will never see work why have army of navvy on last autumn laid foundation sixty foot deep first course be bonded in to foundation bonded together a see be down to solid rock water can get to undermine puddle wall be sixteen foot wide at starting diminishes to four foot at top so no water can creep in through jacket what be aperture inquired grotait oh be waste pipe pas through embankment obliquely to wear dam can be opened shut by valve run off ten thousand cubic foot of water minute wo that prove hole in armor why pipe must be in twenty joint at least say fifty five will be nearer mark suppose one two of fifty five joint must leak will have everlasting solvent in heart of pile ca get at know to mend of course not be double a thick a ever be used before have be severely tested before laying down besides see of have got great coat on eighteen inch of puddle way ah said grotait better be astonishing what big embankment will sometimes burst if leaky pipe run through think be water altogether water seems to make air inside prof a bad for a wind in man stomach governor said engineer let bee swarm in bonnet ousely reservoir will last a long a hill there doubt lad since thou have hand in making laugh dry rejoinder caused be interrupted by waitress bringing out tea hillsborough worthy felt bound to chaff being yorkshire too gave a good a brought trifle to spare tea be followed by brandy water pipe came out in such rapid succession that when grotait drove little two others home utterance be thick speech sententious little found bayne waiting for with news that have left mr cheetham how be that oh fell between two stool tried to smooth matter between cheetham hand cheetham want manager to side with through thick thin men want one to side with have sacked men be glad be going come of loving peace when world hate be glad of for now be foreman know what be worth if fool be in earnest little why not hear have be dining with grotait always make liquor fly wait till tomorrow talk over with mr little here be afraid be not right sort for servant too fond of 'the balmy ' averse to whole hog poor fellow be quite discouraged very man want to soothe at odd time rile so with suicidal folly now look here old fellow if come to will give good hiding oh well sooner than must break peace mr little 'd rather be with at two guinea week than with other master at three when have got honest fellow to look after interest young little gave more way than ever to natural bent for invention be often locked up for twelve hour at stretch in room called studio indeed such be ardor that sometimes left home after dinner came back to work then fitful fire of forge might be seen blow of hammer heard long after midnight dr amboyne encouraged in be indeed only person admitted to said studio there democritus of hillsborough often sat smoked cigar watched progress toward perfection of projected invention great small one day doctor called asked bayne whether henry be in studio bayne said thought have seen in saw grinder hull that struck for be not often lordship condescends to go there now let see what 'his lordship ' be at approached stealthily looking through window saw inventor standing with arm folded eye bent on grinder at work man be pressing down six foot saw on grindstone with might little be looking on with face compounded of pity contempt lofty contemplation be game now sir whispered bayne always in cloud else above penny for thought sir henry started a men do who be roused from deep contemplation however soon recovered with sort of rude wit of own held out hand for penny amboyne fumbled in pocket gave stamp little seized delivered a follows thought gentleman be general particular be making reflection how contented people be to go bungling on doing thing wrong way when right way be obvious particular observation be that long saw be ground in way offends grammar of mechanic here be piece of steel six foot long not so wide a grindstone what can be plainer than such strip ought to be ground lengthwise then whole saw must receive grindstone in few second instead of on go year after year grinding obliquely with violent exertion that horrifies fellow like who go in for economy of labor have done life look at fellow working what waste of muscle now if will come to studio think can show how long saw will be ground in day of civilization eye have be turned inward during reverie dullish somewhat fish like now sparkled like hot coal led way eagerly pray humor sir said bayne compassionately followed up horrid stair entered studio marvelous place be forge on one side carpenter bench turning lathe on other floor so crowded with model casting profusion of new idea in material form housewife call litter that artist have be obliged to cut three little ramified path foot wide so meander about room a struggle wasp over spilt glue gave doctor one chair wriggled down path after pencil paper jumped with like cat with mouse on to carpenter bench be soon absorbed in drawing when have drawn bit tore up paper said let think request be unusual said dr amboyne however if will let smoke will let think reply from inventor whose eye be already turned inward fish like again dr amboyne bayne smoked peaceably awhile presently inventor uttered kind of shout eureka said doctor calmly emitted curly cloud little dashed at paper soon produced drawing represented two grindstone set apparently to grind other large one below small one above there large stone will revolve rapidly say from north to south small one from south to north be idea have just struck completes invention be to be worked not by one grinder two stand south pass saw northward between two grindstone to b stone must be hung so a just to allow passage of saw b draw out revers pass back to two journey of saw will grind whole length of for breath of two three inch in forty second now do see what meant by grammar of mechanic be false grammar of duffer grinding long thing sideways instead of lengthways struck mind first now see what one get to at last if one start from grammar by machine two men can easily grind a many big saw a twenty men must grind on single stone instead of heavy coarse labor dirt splashing two men will do work a quietly a easily a two printer one feeding machine with paper mate drawing out printed sheet at other end by jove said dr amboyne believe be great idea what do say mr bayne well sir servant must always say mind servant be hanged said little that for friend who doe not speak mind well then gentleman be most simple beautiful contrivance ever saw there be only one thing to be done with patent hide lock up in own breast try forget life wo be worth week purchase if set up machine in hillsborough hillsborough be not world can take to free country america russia there be fortune in stop suppose be to patent at home abroad then work in united state canada must force invention upon country by degree yes then if sell english patent insure purchaser life may turn few thousand keep whole skin little assured bayne have intention of running head against saw grinder union be very comfortable a be value life more than used to do think know why said dr amboyne do patent invention patent henry promised must soon forgot promise having tasted blood so to speak be soon deep in far more intricate puzzle viz how to grind large circular saw by machinery problem steel railway clip be to displace present system of fastening down rail absorbed so that became abstracted in very street did not see friend when passed one day when be deeply engaged in studio bayne tapped at door asked to speak to well what be said inventor rather peevishly oh nothing said bayne with bitter air of mock resignation only cloud on peaceful horizon be letter from mary anne sir four of saw be behindhand with contribution being deaf to remonstrance be obliged to apply to to use influence mary anne well said henry mary anne be in right confound dishonesty take immense advantage saw grinder union give yet wo pay weekly contribution without union ca exist go find out who be blow up what disturb balmy bother balmy ca be worried with such trifle be inventing mr little must not best way be for just to stop quietly peaceably out of pay send to grotait little after moment reflection said have legal right to do besides be not business to work saw

thing lay beneath surface of snowy bride cake flower white veil weak jocoseness stared bowed sunk into place like man in dream bridemaids became magnetically conscious that incongruous element have entered so tittered at what doe sweet silly seventeen not titter knife fork clattered champagne popped dr amboyne be more perplexed miserable than have ever be have never encountered more hopeless situation presently lally came touched bridegroom apologized left room moment lally then told to be on guard for fat doctor knew something have come tearing up in fly have be dreadfully put out when

horse coventry have hardly settled down in chair before cast keen furtive glance at dr amboyne face then saw directly that doctor mind be working that be secretly profoundly agitated after thought what must man know if have known thing must have kept to still judged prudent to propitiate dr amboyne so when time came for usual folly of drinking health leaned over to in sweetest possible voice asked if must do both honor to propose bride health at unexpected call from mr coventry dr amboyne stared in bridegroom face stared at so that other people began to stare recovering little rose mechanically surprised body who knew instead of easy gayety natural to proper to occasion delivered few faltering word of affection for bride then suddenly stopped after pause said younger man must foretell bright career deserves be unfit know what hour may bring forth with sunk into chair uneasy grin then gloom fell on bright company at strange word looked at one uncomfortably situation be unexpectedly relieved young curate rose said accept honor dr amboyne be generous enough to transfer to younger gentleman of party accept with pride starting from exordium pronounced with easy volubility charming panegyric on bride congratulated friend then congratulated on being instrument to unite in holy wedlock with gentleman worthy of affection then assuming for one moment pastor pronounced blessing on pair sat down casting glance round out of pair of singularly restless eye loud applause followed left in doubt a to favorable effect have produced coventry in particular looked most expressively grateful bridegroom health followed coventry returned thanks in speech so neat well delivered that grace felt proud of performance then carriage four came round coventry gave grace imploring glance on acted at once being anxious to escape from so much publicity made courtesy retired to put on traveling dress then dr amboyne cursed own indecision still must not make up mind except to tell raby make judge what course be best gayety never very boisterous began to flag altogether when suddenly noise be heard outside one two young people who darted unceremoniously to window
