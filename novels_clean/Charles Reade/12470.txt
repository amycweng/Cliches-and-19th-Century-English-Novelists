among hope good quality be singular fidelity to employer be also man who never broke word so when bartley showed that true parentage of grace hope now called mary bartley must never be disguised unless memory of be interrupted puzzled before grew older a well a world must be made to believe bartley be father assented be two year before ventured to come near own daughter demanded to see at distance unseen be arranged provided with powerful binocular of kind be now used at sea instead of unwieldy old telescope little girl be paraded by nurse who be in secret played about in sight of strange spy be plump be rosy be full of life spirit joy filled father heart then came bitter pang to think that have faded out of joyous life by by must see longer for mist came from heart to eye bowed head went back to business prosperity solitude experiment be repeated at time moreover bartley have tact never to write to on business without telling something about girl clever saying pretty way quickness at learning from teacher so on when be eight year old foreign agent be required in bartley business hope agreed to start agency keep going till more ordinary person must be intrusted to work refused to leave england without seeing daughter with own eye hearing voice however still faithful to pledge prepared disguise actually grew mustache beard for tender motive only changed whole style of dress wore crimson neck tie dark green glove with plaid suit combination abhorred a painter respected reader abominate for surely be such perverse combination made french dressmaker lift hand to heaven say quelle immoralite so then bartley took little girl for walk met mr hope in appointed spot not far from own house poor hope saw coming heart beat high ah said bartley feigning surprise why be mr hope how do do hope be little girl mary dear be old friend of mine give hand girl looked in hope face gave hand did not recognize fine girl for year be said bartley healthy strong quick at lesson what be better still be good girl very good girl papa said child blushing hid face behind bartley elbow one eye with watched effect of eulogy upon strange gentleman be father must wish said hope tenderly instantly girl started from position stood wrapt in thought beautiful eye wore strange look of dreamy intelligence men must see be searching past for voice bartley drew back that girl might not see held up finger hope gave slight nod of acquiescence spoke more bartley invited to take early dinner talk business before left saw child more than once indeed bartley paraded accomplishment played piano to hope rode little shetland pony for hope danced minuet with singular grace for so young girl conversed with governess in french something very like worked little sewing machine to please strange gentleman be asked to do did with winning smile without particle of false modesty real egotism be at bottom of false modesty anybody who knew william hope intimately might almost recognize daughter in versatile little mind with faculty of learning so many dissimilar thing hope left for continent with proud heart joyful heart sore heart be lovely be healthy be happy be accomplished be no longer not even in name love be being gained by stranger there be barrier of iron a well a english channel between william hope own mary bartley must weary reader be to detail small event bearing on part of story took place during next five year might be summed up thus that william hope got peep at daughter now then making series of subtle experiment by varying voice a much a possible confused nullified memory of voice to appearance in due course however father daughter be brought into natural contact by last thing seemed likely to do viz by bartley avarice bartley legitimate business at home abroad must now run alone so invited hope to england to guide in what loved better than steady business viz speculation truth be bartley must execute have few original idea hope have plenty sound one though not common one hope directed purchase of convertible security on principle select good one avoid time bargain introduce distinct element of risk buy largely at panic not founded on permanent reason out of proportion example great district bank broke share of great district railway went down thirty per cent hope bade employer pupil observe that be rank delusion dividend of railway be not lowered one per cent by failure of bank must be shareholder of bank have share in railway be compelled to force on market hence fall in share said hope depreciated share be now in hand of men who can hold will too until return from ridiculous to normal value be from to invest shilling have got will bartley invested l cleared twenty per cent in three month example there be terrible accident on railway part of line broken up vast repair needed share fell twenty per cent out of proportion said hope sum for repair will not deduct from dividend one tenth of annual sum represented by fall in three month fear of such disaster will not keep single man woman child bullock pig coal truck off line put pot on bartley put pot on made fifteen per cent hope said to bartley when english speculator sends money abroad at go wild altogether rush at obscure transaction lends to peru guatemala tierra del fuego shaky place know nothing about insular maniac overlook continent of europe instead of studying seeking what country there be safe others risky now why overlook prussia be country much better governed than england especially a regard great public enterprise monopoly for instance director of prussian railway can not swindle shareholder by false account passing off loan for dividend against fraud of director english shareholder have only sham security be invited to leave home come two hundred mile to director home vote in person doe do why must in prussia government protects shareholder inspects account severely so much for superior system of country now take map here be hamburg great port of continent berlin great continental centre there be one railway only between two what english railway can compare with share be at must go to in time unless prussian government allows railway be not likely if so will have two year to back out be best permanent investment of class that offer on face of globe bartley invested timidly held for year share went up over before sold let mind live in island if body doe be favorite saying of william hope recommend impartially to briton bornese on one of hope visit bartley complained have nothing to do can sit here speculate want to be in something think will take farm just to occupy amuse will not amuse unless make money by suggested hope nobody can do nowadays farm pay ploughing sowing pay brain money pay found together what on farm why not sir have only to go with time observe condition of produce grain too cheap for farmer because continent can export grain with little loss fruit dear meat dear because cattle can not be driven sailed without risk of life loss of weight agricultural labor rising in winter unproductive because to farm mean to plough sow reap mow lose money meet condition breed cattle sheep horse make farm feeding ground give fifty acre to fruit have little factory on land for winter use so utilize farm hand village woman who be cheaper laborer than town brat think will make little money in form of money besides what make in gratuitous egg poultry fruit horse to ride cart thing for house item seldom figure in farmer book a money stricter accountant know be will do said bartley if will be neighbor work with watch share market at home abroad hope acquiesced joyfully to be near daughter found farm in sussex with hill for sheep short grass for colt plenty of water enough arable land artificial grass for purpose grand sunny slope for fruit tree fruit bush strawberry with last alone paid rent then said hope farm laborer drink ocean of beer now look at retail price of beer eighty per cent over cost yet deleterious tell against labor a employer of labor main expense of farm want beer to be slightly nourishing very inspiriting not somniferous so set up malt house brew house supplied own hand with genuine liquor on truck system at moderate remunerative price grain helped to feed pig hope principle be sell produce in primitive form if change form make two profit do grow barley malt infuse sell liquor for two small profit one on grain one on infusion do grow grass turn into flesh sell for two small profit one on herb one on animal really when backed by money result seemed to justify principle hope lived by not far from child often when went abroad loving eye watched movement through binocular might be described a opera glass ten inch long with small field telescopic power grace hope whom will now call mary bartley since everybody father who generally avoided name called so be well grown girl of thirteen healthy happy beautiful accomplished be

narrative creeping through sorry flag rush with one lily in ten page to become bore be driven on to salient fact must trust little to reader intelligence to ponder on singular situation of mary bartley two father one morning mary bartley governess walked to neighboring town enjoyed sacred delight of shopping came back by short cut made necessary to cross certain brook rivulet called lyn be

pony furiously to stream then beast planted foot together with impulse thus given hope threw over pony head into water have arm round child in moment lashed out with other hand across stream be so powerful now a neared lasher that made far more way onward to destruction than did across stream still did near bank little lasher roared nearer nearer stream pulled to with iron force be close to now then willow bough gave one chance hope grasped pulled with iron strength from bough got to branch finally clutched stem of tree just a foot be lifted up by rushing water life hung upon willow tree
