aubert instead of taking more direct road ran along foot of pyrenees to languedoc chose one winding over height afforded more extensive view greater variety of romantic scenery turned little out of way to take leave of m barreaux whom found botanizing in wood near chteau who when be told purpose of st auberts visit expressed degree of concern such a friend have thought be scarcely possible for to feel on similar occasion parted with mutual regret if anything must have tempted from retirement said m barreaux must have be pleasure of accompanying on little tour often offer compliment may therefore believe when say that will look for return with impatience traveller proceeded on journey a ascended height st aubert often looked back upon chteau in plain below tender image crowded to mind melancholy imagination suggested that must return more though checked wandering thought still continued to look till haziness of distance blended home with general landscape st aubert seemed to drag at remove lengthening chain emily continued sunk in musing silence for league from melancholy reverie emily first awoke young fancy struck with grandeur of object around gradually yielded to delightful impression road now descended into glen confined by stupendous wall of rock grey barren except where shrub fringed summit patch of meagre vegetation tinted recess in wild goat be frequently browsing now way led to lofty cliff from whence landscape be seen extending in magnificence emily must not restrain transport a looked over pine forest of mountain upon vast plain enriched with wood town blushing vine plantation of almond palm olive stretched along till various colour melted in distance into one harmonious hue seemed to unite earth with heaven through whole of glorious scene majestic garonne wandered descending from source among pyrenees winding blue wave towards bay of biscay ruggedness of unfrequented road often obliged wanderer to alight from little carriage thought amply repaid for inconvenience by grandeur of scene while muleteer led animal slowly over broken ground traveller have leisure to linger amid solitude to indulge sublime reflection soften while elevate heart fill with certainty of present god still enjoyment of st aubert be touched with pensive melancholy give to object mellower tint breathes sacred charm over around have provided against

with comfortable cottage for mind also have provided by work on botany written by m barreaux by several of latin italian poet while emilys pencil enabled to preserve of combination of form charmed at step loneliness of road where only now then peasant be seen driving mule mountaineer child at play among rock heightened effect of scenery st aubert be so much struck with that determined if must hear of road to penetrate further among mountain bending way rather more to south to emerge into rousillon coast mediterranean along part of country to languedoc soon after mid day reached summit of one of cliff bright with verdure of palm tree adorn like gem tremendous wall of rock overlooked greater part of gascony part of languedoc here be shade fresh water of spring that gliding among turf under

mule be unharnessed to browse on savoury herb enriched summit be time before st aubert emily must withdraw attention from surrounding object so a to partake of little repast seated in shade of palm st aubert pointed out to observation course of river situation of great town boundary of province science rather than eye enabled to describe notwithstanding occupation when have talked awhile suddenly became silent thoughtful tear often swelled to eye emily observed sympathy of own heart told cause scene before bore resemblance though be on much grander scale to favourite one of late madame st aubert within view of fishing house observed thought how delighted must have be with present landscape while knew that eye must never never more open upon world st aubert remembered last time of visiting that spot in company with also mournfully presaging thought have then arisen in mind be now even thus soon realised recollection subdued abruptly rose from seat walked away to where eye must observe grief when returned countenance have recovered usual serenity took emilys hand pressed affectionately without speaking soon after called to muleteer who sat at little distance concerning road among mountain towards rousillon michael said there be several that way did not know how far extended even whether be passable st aubert who did not intend to travel after sunset asked what village must reach about time muleteer calculated that must easily reach mateau be in present road that if took road sloped more to south towards rousillon there be hamlet thought must gain before evening shut in st aubert after hesitation determined to take latter course michael having finished meal harnessed mule again set forward soon stopped st aubert saw doing homage to cross stood on rock impending over way having concluded devotion smacked whip in air in spite of rough road pain of poor mule have be lately lamenting rattled in full gallop along edge of precipice made eye dizzy to look down emily be terrified almost to fainting st aubert apprehending still greater danger from suddenly stopping driver be compelled to sit quietly trust fate to strength discretion of mule who seemed to posse greater portion of latter quality than master for carried traveller safely into valley there stopped upon brink of rivulet watered leaving splendour of extensive prospect now entered narrow valley screened by rock on rock piled a if by magic spell here scorchd by lightning there with ivy green scene of barrenness be here there interrupted by spreading branch of larch cedar threw gloom over cliff athwart torrent rolled in vale living creature appeared except lizard scrambling among rock often hanging upon point so dangerous that fancy shrunk from view of be such scene a salvator must have chosen have then existed for canvas st aubert impressed by romantic character of place almost expected to see bandit start from behind projecting rock kept hand upon arm with always travelled a advanced valley opened savage feature gradually softened towards evening be among heathy mountain stretched in far perspective along solitary sheep bell be heard voice of shepherd calling wandering flock to nightly fold cabin partly shadowed by cork tree ilex st aubert observed to flourish in higher region of air than other tree except fir be human habitation yet appeared along bottom of valley most vivid verdure be spread in little hollow recess of mountain under shade of oak chestnut herd of cattle be grazing group of too be often seen reposing on bank of rivulet laving side in cool stream sipping wave sun be now setting upon valley last light gleamed upon water heightened rich yellow purple tint of heath broom overspread mountain st aubert enquired of michael distance to hamlet have mentioned man must not with certainty tell emily began to fear that have mistaken road here be human being to assist direct have left shepherd cabin far behind scene became so obscured in twilight that eye must not follow distant perspective of valley in search of cottage hamlet glow of horizon still marked west be of little use to traveller michael seemed endeavouring to keep up courage by singing music however be not of kind to disperse melancholy sung in sort of chant one of most dismal ditty present auditor have ever heard st aubert at length discovered to be vesper hymn to favourite saint travelled on sunk in thoughtful melancholy with twilight solitude impress mind michael have now ended ditty nothing be heard drowsy murmur of breeze among wood light flutter a blew freshly into carriage be at length roused by sound of fire arm st aubert called to muleteer to stop listened noise be not repeated presently heard rustling among brake st aubert drew forth pistol ordered michael to proceed a fast a possible who have not long obeyed before horn sounded that made mountain ring looked again from window then saw young man spring from bush into road followed by couple of dog stranger be in hunter dress gun be slung across shoulder hunter horn hung from belt in hand be small pike a held added to manly grace of figure assisted agility of step after moment hesitation st aubert again stopped carriage waited till came up that might enquire concerning hamlet be in search of stranger informed that be only league distant that be going thither must readily show way st aubert thanked for offer pleased with chevalier like air open countenance asked to take seat in carriage stranger with acknowledgment declined adding that must keep pace with mule fear will be wretchedly accommodated said inhabitant of mountain be simple people who be not only without luxury of life almost destitute of what in other place be held to be necessary perceive be not one of inhabitant sir said st aubert sir be only wanderer here carriage drove on increasing dusk made traveller very thankful that have guide frequent glen too that now opened among mountain must likewise have added to perplexity emily a looked up one of saw something at great distance like bright cloud in air what light be yonder sir said st aubert looked perceived that be snowy summit of mountain so much higher than around that still reflected sun ray while below lay in deep shade at village light be seen to twinkle through dusk soon after cottage be discovered in valley rather be seen by reflection in stream on whose margin stood still gleamed with evening light stranger now came up st aubert on further enquiry found not only that there be inn in place not sort of house of public reception stranger however offered to walk on enquire for cottage to accommodate for further civility st aubert returned thanks said that a village be so near must alight walk with emily followed slowly in carriage on way st aubert asked companion what success have have in chase not much sir replied do aim at be pleased with country mean to saunter away few week among scene dog take with more for companionship than for game dress too give ostensible business procures that respect from people must perhaps be refused to lonely stranger who have visible motive for coming among admire taste said st aubert if be younger man must like to pas few week in way exceedingly too be wanderer plan pursuit be exactly like yoursi go in search of health a much a of amusement st aubert sighed paused then seeming to recollect resumed if can hear of tolerable road that will afford decent accommodation be intention to pas into rousillon along sea shore to languedoc sir seem to be acquainted with country can perhaps give information on subject stranger said that what information must give be entirely at service then mentioned road rather more to east led to town whence must be easy to proceed into rousillon now arrived at village commenced search for cottage must afford night lodging in several entered ignorance poverty mirth seemed equally to prevail owner eyed st aubert with mixture of curiosity timidity nothing like bed must be found have ceased to enquire for one when emily joined who observed languor of father countenance lamented that have taken road so ill provided with comfort necessary for invalid other cottage examined seemed somewhat le savage than former consisting of two room if such must be called first of occupied by mule pig second by family generally consisted of six eight child with parent who slept on bed of skin dried beech leaf spread upon mud floor here light be admitted smoke discharged through aperture in roof here scent of spirit for travelling smuggler who haunted pyrenees have made rude people familiar with use of liquor be generally perceptible enough emily turned from such scene looked at father with anxious tenderness young stranger seemed to observe for drawing st aubert aside made offer of own bed be decent one said when compared with what have just seen yet such a in other circumstance must be ashamed to offer st aubert acknowledged how much felt obliged by kindness refused to accept till young stranger must take denial give pain of knowing sir said that invalid like lie on hard skin while sleep in bed besides sir refusal wound pride must believe think offer unworthy acceptance let show way have doubt landlady can accommodate young lady also st aubert at length consented that if must be done must accept kindness though felt rather surprised that stranger have proved so deficient in gallantry a to administer to repose of infirm man rather than to of very lovely young woman for have not once offered room for emily thought not of herself animated smile gave told how much felt obliged for preference of father on way stranger whose name be valancourt stepped on first to speak to hostess came out to welcome st aubert into cottage much superior to have seen good woman seemed very willing to accommodate stranger who be soon compelled to accept only two bed in place egg milk be only food cottage afforded against scarcity of provision st aubert have provided requested valancourt to stay partake with of le homely fare invitation be readily accepted passed hour in intelligent conversation st aubert be much pleased with manly frankness simplicity keen susceptibility to grandeur of nature new acquaintance discovered indeed have often be heard to say that without certain simplicity of heart taste must not exist in strong degree conversation be interrupted by violent uproar without in voice of muleteer be heard above other sound valancourt started from seat went to enquire occasion dispute continued so long afterwards st aubert went found michael quarrelling with hostess because have refused to let mule lie in little room where three of son be to pas night place be wretched enough there be other for people to sleep in with somewhat more of delicacy than be usual among inhabitant of wild tract of country persisted in refusing to let animal have same bed chamber with child be tender point with muleteer honour be wounded when mule be treated with disrespect must have received blow perhaps with more meekness declared that beast be a honest beast a good beast a in whole province that have right to be well treated wherever went be a harmless a lamb said if people dont affront never knew behave amiss above once twice in life then have good reason for doing so once indeed kicked at boy leg lay asleep in stable broke told be out there by st anthony believe understood for never did so again concluded eloquent harangue with protesting that must share with go where must dispute be at length settled by valancourt who drew hostess aside desired must let muleteer beast have place in question to while son must have bed of skin designed for for that must wrap in cloak sleep on bench by cottage door thought duty to oppose felt to be inclination to disappoint muleteer valancourt however be positive tedious affair be at length settled be late when st aubert emily retired to room valancourt to station at door at mild season preferred to close cabin bed of skin st aubert be somewhat surprised to find in room volume of homer horace petrarch name of valancourt written in told to whom belonged chapter iv in truth be strange wayward wight fond of gentle dreadful scene in darkness in storm found delight le than when on ocean wave serene southern sun diffusd dazzling sheen even sad vicissitude amusd soul if sigh must sometimes intervene down cheek tear of pity roll sigh tear so sweet wishd not to control minstrel st aubert awoke at early hour refreshed by sleep desirous to set forward invited stranger to breakfast with talking again of road valancourt said that month past have travelled a far a beaujeu be town of consequence on way to rousillon recommended to st aubert to take route latter determined to do so road from hamlet said valancourt to beaujeu part at distance of about league half from hence if will give leave will direct muleteer so far must wander somewhere company must make pleasanter ramble than other must take st aubert thankfully accepted offer set out together young stranger on foot for refused invitation of st aubert to take seat in little carriage road wound along foot of mountain through pastoral valley bright with verdure varied with grove of dwarf oak beech sycamore under whose branch herd of cattle reposed mountain ash too weeping birch often threw pendant foliage over steep above where scanty soil scarcely concealed root where light branch waved to breeze fluttered from mountain traveller be frequently met at early hour for sun have not yet risen upon valley by shepherd driving immense flock from fold to feed upon hill st aubert have set out thus early not only that might enjoy first appearance of sunrise that might inhale first pure breath of morning above thing be refreshing to spirit of invalid in region be particularly so where abundance of wild flower aromatic herb breathed forth essence on air dawn softened scenery with peculiar grey tint now dispersed emily watched progress of day first trembling on top of highest cliff then touching with splendid light while side vale below be still wrapt in dewy mist meanwhile sullen grey of eastern cloud began to blush then to redden then to glow with thousand colour till golden light darted over air touched lower point of mountain brow glanced in long sloping beam upon valley stream nature seemed to have awakened from death into life spirit of st aubert be renovated heart be full wept thought ascended to great creator emily wished to trip along turf so green bright with dew to taste full delight of liberty izard seemed to enjoy a bounded along brow of cliff while valancourt often stopped to speak with traveller with social feeling to point out to peculiar object of admiration st aubert be pleased with here be real ingenuousness ardour of youth said to young man have never be at paris be sorry when came to spot where road parted heart took more affectionate leave of than be usual after so short acquaintance valancourt talked long by side of carriage seemed more than once to be going still lingered appeared to search anxiously for topic of conversation to account for delay at length took leave a went st aubert observed look with earnest pensive eye at emily who bowed to with countenance full of timid sweetness while carriage drove on st aubert for reason soon after looked from window saw valancourt standing upon bank of road resting on pike with folded arm following carriage with eye waved hand valancourt seeming to awake from reverie returned salute started away aspect of country now began to change traveller soon found among mountain covered from base nearly to summit with forest of gloomy pine except where rock of granite shot up from vale lost snowy top in cloud rivulet have hitherto accompanied now expanded into river flowing deeply silently along reflected a in mirror blackness of impending shade sometimes cliff be seen lifting bold head above wood vapour floated mid way down mountain sometimes face of perpendicular marble rose from water edge over larch threw gigantic arm here scathed with lightning there floating in luxuriant foliage continued to travel over rough unfrequented road seeing now then at distance solitary shepherd with dog stalking along valley hearing only dashing of torrent wood concealed from eye long sullen murmur of breeze a swept over pine note of eagle vulture be seen towering round beetling cliff often a carriage moved slowly over uneven ground st aubert alighted amused with examining curious plant grew on bank of road with region abound while emily wrapt in high enthusiasm wandered away under shade listening in deep silence to lonely murmur of wood village hamlet be seen for many league goat herd hunter cabin perched among cliff of rock be only human habitation appeared traveller again took dinner in open air on pleasant spot in valley under spreading shade of cedar then set forward towards beaujeu road now began to descend leaving pine forest behind wound among rocky precipice evening twilight again fell over scene traveller be ignorant how far might yet be from beaujeu st aubert however conjectured that distance must not be very great comforted with prospect of travelling on more frequented road after reaching that town where designed to pas night mingled wood rock heathy mountain be now seen obscurely through dusk soon even imperfect image faded in darkness michael proceeded with caution for must scarcely distinguish road mule however seemed to have more sagacity step be sure on turning angle of mountain light appeared at distance illumined rock horizon to great extent be evidently large fire whether accidental otherwise there be mean of knowing st aubert thought be probably kindled by of numerous bandit infested pyrenees became watchful anxious to know whether road passed near fire have arm with on emergency might afford protection though certainly very unequal one against band of robber so desperate too a usually be who haunted wild region while many reflection rose upon mind heard voice shouting from road behind ordering muleteer to stop st aubert bade proceed a fast a possible michael mule be obstinate for did not quit old pace horse foot be now heard man rode up to carriage still ordering driver to stop st aubert who must no longer doubt purpose be with difficulty able to prepare pistol for defence when hand be upon door of chaise man staggered on horse report of pistol be followed by groan st auberts horror may be imagined when in next instant thought heard faint voice of valancourt now bade muleteer stop pronouncing name of valancourt be answered in voice that longer suffered to doubt st aubert who instantly alighted went to assistance found still sitting on horse bleeding profusely appearing to be in great pain though endeavoured to soften terror of st aubert by assurance that be not materially hurt wound being only in arm st aubert with muleteer assisted to dismount sat down on bank of road where st aubert tried to bind up arm hand trembled so excessively that must not accomplish michael being now gone in pursuit of horse on being disengaged from rider have galloped off called emily to assistance receiving answer went to carriage found sunk on seat in fainting fit between distress of circumstance that of leaving valancourt bleeding scarcely knew what did endeavoured however to raise called to michael to fetch water from rivulet flowed by road michael be gone beyond reach of voice valancourt who heard call also repeated name of emily instantly understood subject of distress almost forgetting own condition hastened to relief be reviving when reached carriage then understanding that anxiety for have occasioned indisposition assured in voice trembled not from anguish that wound be of consequence while said st aubert turned round perceiving that be still bleeding subject of alarm changed again hastily formed handkerchief into bandage stopped effusion of blood st aubert dreading consequence of wound enquired repeatedly how far be from beaujeu when learning that be at two league distance distress increased since knew not how valancourt in present state must bear motion of carriage perceived that be already faint from loss of blood when mentioned subject of anxiety valancourt entreated that must not suffer to be thus alarmed on account for that have doubt must be able to support very well then talked of accident a slight one muleteer being now returned with valancourts horse assisted into chaise a emily be now revived moved slowly on towards beaujeu st aubert when have recovered from terror occasioned by accident expressed surprise on seeing valancourt who explained unexpected appearance by saying sir renewed taste for society when have left hamlet did indeed appear solitude determined therefore since object be merely amusement to change scene took road because knew led through more romantic tract of mountain than spot have left besides added hesitating for instant will own why must not that have hope of overtaking have made very unexpected return for compliment said st aubert who lamented again rashness have produced accident explained cause of late alarm valancourt seemed anxious only to remove from mind of companion unpleasant feeling relative to for purpose still struggled against sense of pain tried to converse with gaiety emily meanwhile be silent except when valancourt particularly addressed there be at time tremulous tone in voice that spoke much be now so near fire have long flamed at distance on blackness of night that gleamed upon road must distinguish figure moving about blaze way winding still nearer perceived in valley one of numerous band of gipsy at period particularly haunted wild of pyrenees lived partly by plundering traveller emily looked with degree of terror on savage countenance of people shown by fire heightened romantic effect of scenery a threw red dusky gleam upon rock on foliage of tree leaving heavy mass of shade region of obscurity eye feared to penetrate be preparing supper large pot stood by fire over several figure be busy blaze discovered rude kind of tent round many child dog be playing whole formed picture highly grotesque traveller saw plainly danger valancourt be silent laid hand on one of st auberts pistol st aubert drew forth michael be ordered to proceed a fast a possible passed place however without being attacked rover being probably unprepared for opportunity too busy about supper to feel much interest at moment in anything besides after league half more passed in darkness traveller arrived at beaujeu drove up to only inn place afforded though superior to have seen since entered mountain be bad enough surgeon of town be immediately sent for if surgeon must be called who prescribed for horse a well a for men shaved face at least a dexterously a set bone after examining valancourts arm perceiving that bullet have passed through flesh without touching bone dressed left with solemn prescription of quiet patient be not inclined to obey delight of ease have now succeeded to pain for ease may be allowed to assume positive quality when contrasted with anguish spirit thus reanimated wished to partake of conversation of st aubert emily who released from so many apprehension be uncommonly cheerful late a be however st aubert be obliged to go out with landlord to buy meat for supper emily who during interval have be absent a long a must upon excuse of looking to accommodation found rather better than expected be compelled to return converse with valancourt alone talked of character of scene have passed of natural history of country of poetry of st aubert subject on emily always spoke listened to with peculiar pleasure traveller passed agreeable evening st aubert be fatigued with journey a valancourt seemed again sensible of pain separated soon after supper in morning st aubert found that valancourt have passed restless night that be feverish wound very painful surgeon when dressed advised to remain quietly at beaujeu advice be too reasonable to be rejected st aubert however have favourable opinion of practitioner be anxious to commit valancourt into more skilful hand learning upon enquiry that there be town within several league seemed more likely to afford better advice altered plan of journey determined to await recovery of valancourt who with somewhat more ceremony than sincerity made many objection to delay by order of surgeon valancourt did not go out of house that day st aubert emily surveyed with delight environs of town situated at foot of pyrenean alp that rose in abrupt precipice others swelling with wood of cedar fir cypress stretched nearly to highest summit cheerful green of beech mountain ash be sometimes seen like gleam of light amidst dark verdure of forest sometimes torrent poured sparkling flood high among wood valancourts indisposition detained traveller at beaujeu several day during interval st aubert have observed disposition talent with philosophic inquiry so natural to saw frank generous nature full of ardour highly susceptible of be grand beautiful impetuous wild somewhat romantic valancourt have known little of world perception be clear feeling just indignation of unworthy admiration of generous action be expressed in term of equal vehemence st aubert sometimes smiled at warmth seldom checked often repeated to young man have never be at paris sigh sometimes followed silent ejaculation determined not to leave valancourt till must be perfectly recovered a be now well enough to travel though not able to manage horse st aubert invited to accompany for few day in carriage more readily did since have discovered that valancourt be of family of same name in gascony with whose respectability be well acquainted latter accepted offer with great pleasure again set forward among romantic wild about rousillon travelled leisurely stopping wherever scene uncommonly grand appeared frequently alighting to walk to eminence whither mule must not go from prospect opened in greater magnificence often sauntering over hillock covered with lavender wild thyme juniper tamarisc under shade of wood between bole caught long mountain vista sublime beyond anything that emily have ever imagined st aubert sometimes amused with botanizing while valancourt emily strolled on pointing out to notice object particularly charmed reciting beautiful passage from such of latin italian poet a have heard admire in pause of conversation when thought not observed frequently fixed eye pensively on countenance expressed with so much animation taste energy of mind when spoke again there be peculiar tenderness in tone of voice defeated attempt to conceal sentiment by degree silent pause became more frequent till emily only betrayed anxiety to interrupt who have be hitherto reserved must now talk again again of wood valley mountain to avoid danger of sympathy silence from beaujeu road have constantly ascended conducting traveller into higher region of air where immense glacier exhibited frozen horror eternal snow whitened summit of mountain often paused to contemplate stupendous scene seated on wild cliff where only ilex larch must flourish looked over dark forest of fir precipice where human foot have never wandered into glenso deep that thunder of torrent be seen to foam along bottom be scarcely heard to murmur over crag rose others of stupendous height fantastic shape shooting into cone others impending far over base in huge mass of granite along whose broken ridge be often lodged weight of snow that trembling even to vibration of sound threatened to bear destruction in course to vale around on side far a eye must penetrate be seen only form of grandeurthe long perspective of mountain top tinged with ethereal blue white with snow valley of ice forest of gloomy fir serenity clearness of air in high region be particularly delightful to traveller seemed to inspire with finer spirit diffused indescribable complacency over mind have word to express sublime emotion felt solemn expression characterised feeling of st aubert tear often came to eye frequently walked away from companion valancourt now then spoke to point to emilys notice feature of scene thinness of atmosphere through object came so distinctly to eye surprised deluded who must scarcely believe that object appeared so near be in reality so distant deep silence of solitude be broken only at interval by scream of vulture seen cowering round cliff below by cry of eagle sailing high in air except when traveller listened to hollow thunder sometimes muttered at foot while above deep blue of heaven be unobscured by lightest cloud half way down mountain long billow of vapour be frequently seen rolling now wholly excluding country below now opening partially revealing feature emily delighted to observe grandeur of cloud a changed in shape tint to watch various effect on lower world whose feature partly veiled be continually assuming new form of sublimity after traversing region for many league began to descend towards rousillon feature of beauty then mingled with scene yet traveller did not look back without regret to sublime object have quitted though eye fatigued with extension of power be glad to repose on verdure of wood pasture now hung on margin of river below to view again humble cottage shaded by cedar playful group of mountaineer child flowery nook that appeared among hill a descended saw at distance on right one of grand pass of pyrenees into spain gleaming with battlement tower to splendour of setting ray yellow top of wood colouring steep below while far above aspired snowy point of mountain still reflecting rosy hue st aubert began to look out for little town have be directed to by people of beaujeu where meant to pas night habitation yet appeared of distance valancourt must not assist to judge for have never be so far along chain of alp before there be however road to guide there must be little doubt that be right one for since have left beaujeu there have be variety of track to perplex mislead sun now gave last light st aubert bade muleteer proceed with possible dispatch found indeed lassitude of illness return upon after day of uncommon fatigue of body mind longed for repose anxiety be not soothed by observing numerous train consisting of men horse loaded mule winding down steep of opposite mountain appearing disappearing at interval among wood so that number must not be judged of something bright like arm glanced in setting ray military dress be distinguishable upon men who be in van on others scattered among troop followed a wound into vale rear of party emerged from wood exhibited band of soldier st auberts apprehension now subsided have doubt that train before consisted of smuggler who in conveying prohibited good over pyrenees have be encountered conquered by party of troop traveller have lingered so long among sublimer scene of mountain that found entirely mistaken in calculation that must reach montigny at sunset a wound along valley saw on rude alpine bridge united two lofty crag of glen group of mountaineer child amusing with dropping pebble into torrent below watching stone plunge into water threw up white spray high in air a received returned sullen sound echo of mountain prolonged under bridge be seen perspective of valley with cataract descending among rock cottage on cliff overshadowed with pine appeared that must not be far from small town st aubert bade muleteer stop then called to child to enquire if be near montigny distance roaring of water must not suffer voice to be heard crag adjoining bridge be of such tremendous height steepness that to have climbed must have be scarcely practicable to person unacquainted with ascent st aubert therefore did not waste more moment in delay continued to travel long after twilight have obscured road be so broken that now thinking safer to walk than to ride alighted moon be rising light be yet too feeble to assist while stepped carefully on heard vesper bell of convent twilight must not permit to distinguish anything like building sound seemed to come from wood that overhung acclivity to right valancourt proposed to go in search of convent if will not accommodate with night lodging said may certainly inform how far be from montigny direct towards be bounding forward without waiting st auberts reply when latter stopped be very weary said st aubert wish for nothing so much a for immediate rest will go to convent good look must defeat purpose when see mine emilys exhausted countenance will scarcely deny repose a said took emilys arm within telling michael to wait awhile in road with carriage began to ascend towards wood guided by bell of convent step be

to proceed to next post languor of illness of fatigue returned upon st aubert required immediate repose evening be now far advanced from necessity there be appeal ordered michael to proceed rich plain of languedoc exhibited glory of vintage with gaiety of french festival no longer awakened st aubert to pleasure whose condition formed mournful contrast to hilarity youthful beauty surrounded a languid eye moved over scene considered that must soon perhaps be closed for ever on world distant sublime mountain said secretly a gazed on chain of pyrenees stretched towards west luxuriant plain blue vault cheerful light of day will be shut from eye song of peasant cheering voice of manwill no longer sound for intelligent eye of emily seemed to read what passed in mind of father fixed on face with expression of such tender pity a recalled thought from desultory object of regret remembered only that must leave daughter without protection reflection changed regret to agony sighed deeply remained silent while seemed to understand sigh for pressed hand affectionately then turned to window to conceal tear sun now threw last yellow gleam on wave of mediterranean gloom of twilight spread fast over scene till only melancholy ray appeared on western horizon marking point where sun have set amid vapour of autumnal evening cool breeze now came from shore emily let down glass air be refreshing to health be a chilling to sickness st aubert desired that window might be drawn up increasing illness made now more anxious than ever to finish day journey stopped muleteer to enquire how

cracking whip in air set off continued on full gallop till st aubert almost fainting called to to stop emily looked anxiously from window saw peasant walking at little distance on road for whom waited till came up when be asked if there be house in neighbourhood accommodated traveller replied that knew of none there be chteau indeed among wood on right added believe receives nobody can not show way for be almost stranger here st aubert be going to ask further question concerning chteau man abruptly passed on after consideration ordered michael to proceed slowly to wood moment now deepened

call said michael mean that white piece of building that see at distance there among tree yes be turret why who be that be going thither said man with surprise st aubert on hearing odd question observing peculiar tone in be delivered looked out from carriage be traveller said who be in search of house of accommodation for night be there hereabout none monsieur unless have mind to try luck yonder replied peasant pointing to wood must not advise to go there to whom doe chteau belong scarcely know monsieur be uninhabited thenno not uninhabited steward housekeeper be there believe on hearing st aubert determined to proceed to chteau risk refusal of being accommodated for night therefore desired countryman must show michael way bade expect reward for trouble man be for moment silent then said that be going on other business that road must not be missed if went up avenue to right to pointed st aubert be going to speak peasant wished good night walked on carriage now moved towards avenue be guarded by gate michael having dismounted to open entered between row of ancient oak chesnut whose intermingled branch formed lofty arch above there be something so gloomy desolate in appearance of avenue lonely silence emily almost shuddered a passed along recollecting manner in peasant have mentioned chteau gave mysterious meaning to word such a have not suspected when uttered apprehension however tried to check considering that be probably effect of melancholy imagination father situation consideration of own circumstance have made sensible to impression passed slowly on for be now almost in darkness together with unevenness of ground frequent root of old tree shot up above soil made necessary to proceed with caution on sudden michael stopped carriage a st aubert looked from window to enquire cause perceived figure at distance moving up avenue dusk must not permit to distinguish what be bade michael go on seems wild place said michael there be house hereabout dont honour think have better turn back go little farther if see house then will return to road replied st aubert michael proceeded with reluctance extreme slowness of pace made st aubert look again from window to hasten when again saw same figure be somewhat startled probably gloominess of spot made more liable to alarm than usual however might be now stopped michael bade call to person in avenue please honour may be robber said michael doe not please replied st aubert who must not forbear smiling at simplicity of phrase will therefore return to road for see probability of meeting here with what seek michael turned about immediately be retracing way with alacrity when voice be heard from among tree on left be not voice of command distress deep hollow tone seemed to be scarcely human man whipped mule till went a fast a possible regardless of darkness broken ground neck of whole party once stopped till reached gate opened from avenue into high road where went into more moderate pace be very ill said st aubert taking daughter hand be worse then sir said emily extremely alarmed by manner be worse here be assistance good god what be to be done leaned head on shoulder while endeavoured to support with arm michael be again ordered to stop when rattling of wheel have ceased music be heard on air be to emily voice of hope oh be near human habitation said help may soon be have listened anxiously sound be distant seemed to come from remote part of wood bordered road a looked towards spot whence issued perceived in faint moonlight something like chteau be difficult however to reach st aubert be now too ill to bear motion of carriage michael must not quit mule emily who still supported father feared to leave also feared to venture alone to such distance knew not whither to whom something however be necessary to determine upon immediately st aubert therefore told michael to proceed slowly have not gone far when fainted carriage be again stopped lay quite senselessmy dear dear father cried emily in great agony who began to fear that be dying speak if be only one word to let hear sound of voice voice spoke in reply in agony of terror bade michael bring water from rivulet flowed along road having received in man hat with trembling hand sprinkled over father face a moon ray now fell upon seemed to bear impression of death emotion of selfish fear now gave way to stronger influence committing st aubert to care of michael who refused to go far from mule stepped from carriage in search of chteau have seen at distance be still moonlight night music yet sounded on air directed step from high road up shadowy lane led to wood mind be for time so entirely occupied by anxiety terror for father that felt none for herself till deepening gloom of overhanging foliage now wholly excluded moonlight wildness of place recalled to sense of adventurous situation music have ceased have guide chance for moment paused in terrified perplexity till sense of father condition again overcoming consideration for proceeded lane terminated in wood looked round in vain for house human being a vainly listened for sound to guide hurried on however not knowing whither avoiding recess of wood endeavouring to keep along margin till rude kind of avenue opened upon moonlight spot arrested attention wildness of avenue brought to recollection one leading to turreted chteau be inclined to believe that be part of same domain probably led to same point while hesitated whether to follow not sound of many voice in loud merriment burst upon ear seemed not laugh of cheerfulness of riot stood appalled while paused heard distant voice calling from way have come not doubting be that of michael first impulse be to hasten back second thought changed purpose believed that nothing le than last extremity must have prevailed with michael to quit mule fearing that father be now dying rushed forward with feeble hope of obtaining assistance from people in wood heart beat with fearful expectation a drew near spot whence voice issued often startled when step disturbed fallen leaf sound led towards moonlight glade have before noticed at little distance from stopped saw between bole of tree small circular level of green turf surrounded by wood on appeared group of figure on drawing nearer distinguished by dress to be peasant perceived several cottage scattered round edge of wood waved loftily over spot while gazed endeavoured to overcome apprehension withheld step several peasant girl came out of cottage music instantly struck up dance began be joyous music of vintagethe same have before heard upon air heart occupied with terror for father must not feel contrast gay scene offered to own distress stepped hastily forward towards group of elder

moved slowly on michael following peasant up lane emily have just quitted till came to moonlight glade st auberts spirit be so far restored by courtesy of host near prospect of repose that looked with sweet complacency upon moonlight scene surrounded by shadowy wood through here there opening admitted streaming splendour discovering cottage sparkling rivulet listened with painful emotion to merry note of guitar tamborine though tear came to eye when saw debonnaire dance of peasant be not merely tear of mournful regret with emily be otherwise immediate terror for father have now subsided into gentle melancholy note of joy by awakening comparison served to heighten dance ceased on approach of carriage be phenomenon in sequestered wood peasantry flocked round with eager curiosity on learning that brought sick stranger several girl ran across turf returned with wine basket of grape presented to traveller with kind contention pressing for preference at carriage stopped at neat cottage venerable conductor having assisted st aubert to alight led emily to small inner room illuminated only by moonbeam open casement admitted st aubert rejoicing in rest seated in arm chair sens be refreshed by cool balmy air lightly waved embowering honeysuckle wafted sweet breath into apartment host who be called la voisin quitted room soon returned with fruit cream pastoral luxury cottage

trembling arm to assist to door of chamber when be once more in bed desired that emily who be then weeping in own room might be called a came waved hand for other person to quit apartment when be alone held out hand to fixed eye upon countenance with expression so full of tenderness grief that fortitude forsook burst into agony of tear st aubert seemed struggling to acquire firmness be still unable to speak must only press hand check tear stood trembling in eye at length commanded voice dear child said trying to smile through anguish dear emilyand paused again raised eye to heaven a if in prayer then in firmer tone with look in tenderness of father be dignified by pious solemnity of saint said dear child must soften painful truth have to tell find quite unequal to art ala must at moment conceal from that must be most cruel to deceive can not be long before must part let talk of that thought prayer may prepare to bear voice faltered while emily still weeping pressed hand close to heart swelled with convulsive sigh must not look up let not waste moment said st aubert recovering have much to say there be circumstance of solemn consequence have to mention solemn promise to

must have come called forth tear now shed rather child rejoice be saved from such suffering that be permitted to die with mind unimpaired sensible of comfort of faith resignation st aubert paused fatigued with speaking emily again endeavoured to assume air of composure in replying to what have said tried to sooth with belief that have not spoken in vain when have reposed while resumed conversation let return said to subject be very near heart said have solemn promise to receive from let receive now before explain chief circumstance concern there be others of peace requires that must rest in ignorance promise then that will perform exactly what will enjoin emily awed by earnest solemnity of manner dried tear have begun again to flow in spite of effort to suppress looking

grief st aubert affected beyond resistance of fortitude have at first summoned wept with after moment composed dear child said be comforted when be gone will not be forsakeni leave only in more immediate care of providence have never yet forsaken afflict with excess of grief rather teach by example to bear own stopped again emily more endeavoured to restrain emotion found le possible to do so st aubert who now spoke with pain resumed subject closet dearwhen return home go to beneath board have described will find packet of written paper attend to now for promise have given particularly relates to what will direct paper must burnand solemnly command without examining emilys surprise for moment overcame grief ventured to ask why must be st aubert replied that if have be right for to explain reason late promise must have be unnecessarily exacted be sufficient for love to have deep sense of importance of observing in instance st aubert proceeded under board will also find about two hundred louis dors wrapped in silk purse indeed be to secure money might be in chteau that secret place be contrived at time when province be over run by troop of men who took advantage of tumult became plunderer have yet promise to receive from isthat will never whatever may be future circumstance sell chteau st aubert even enjoined whenever might marry to make article in contract that chteau must always be hers then gave more minute account of present circumstance than have yet done adding two hundred louis with what money will now find in purse be ready money have to leave have told how be circumstanced with m motteville at paris ah child leave poorbut not destitute added after long pause emily must make reply to anything now said knelt at bedside with face upon quilt weeping over hand held there after conversation mind of st aubert appeared to be much more at ease exhausted by effort of speaking sunk into kind of doze emily continued to watch weep beside till gentle tap at chamber door roused be la voisin come to say that confessor from neighbouring convent be below ready to attend st aubert emily must not suffer father to be disturbed desired that priest might not leave cottage when st aubert awoke from doze sens be confused be moment before recovered sufficiently to know that be emily who sat beside then moved lip stretched forth hand to a received sunk back in chair overcome by impression of death on countenance in few minute recovered voice emily then asked if wished to see confessor replied that did when holy father appeared withdrew remained alone together above hour when emily be called in found st aubert more agitated than when have left gazed with slight degree of resentment at friar a cause of who however looked mildly mournfully at turned away st aubert in tremulous voice said wished to join in prayer with asked if la voisin must do so too old man daughter came wept knelt with emily round bed while holy father read in solemn voice service for dying st aubert lay with serene countenance seemed to join fervently in devotion while tear often stole from beneath closed eyelid emilys sob more than once interrupted service when be concluded extreme unction have be administered friar withdrew st aubert then made sign for la voisin to come nearer gave hand be for moment silent at length said in trembling voice good friend acquaintance have be short long enough to give opportunity of showing much kind attention can not doubt that will extend kindness to daughter when be gone will have need of entrust to care during few day will remain here need say moreyou know feeling of father for have child mine must be indeed severe if have le confidence in paused la voisin assured tear bore testimony to sincerity that must do must to soften affliction that if st aubert wished must even attend into gascony offer so pleasing to st aubert that have scarcely word to acknowledge sense of old man kindness to tell that accepted scene followed between st aubert emily affected la voisin so much that quitted chamber be again left alone with father whose spirit seemed fainting fast sens voice yet failed at interval employed much of last awful moment in advising daughter a to future conduct perhaps never have thought more justly expressed more clearly than did now above dear emily said indulge in pride of fine feeling romantic error of amiable mind who really posse sensibility ought early to be taught that be dangerous quality be continually extracting excess of misery delight from surrounding circumstance since in passage through world painful circumstance occur more frequently than pleasing one since sense of evil be fear more acute than sense of good become victim of feeling unless can in degree command know will say for be young emily know will say that be contented sometimes to suffer rather than to give up refined sense of happiness at others when mind have be long harassed by vicissitude will be content to rest will then recover from delusion will perceive that phantom of happiness be exchanged for substance for happiness arises in state of peace not of tumult be of temperate uniform nature can no more exist in heart be continually alive to minute circumstance than in one be dead to feeling see dear that though must guard against danger of sensibility be not advocate for apathy at age must have said be vice more hateful than error of sensibility say so still call vice because lead to positive evil in however doe more than ill governed sensibility by rule might also be called vice evil of former be of more general consequence have exhausted said st aubert feebly have wearied emily on subject so important to future comfort be anxious to be perfectly understood emily assured that advice be most precious to that must never forget cease from endeavouring to profit by st aubert smiled affectionately sorrowfully upon repeat said must not teach to become insensible if must must only warn of evil of susceptibility point out how may avoid beware love conjure of self delusion have be fatal to peace of so many person beware of priding on gracefulness of sensibility if yield to vanity happiness be lost for ever always remember how much more valuable be strength of fortitude than grace of sensibility however confound fortitude with apathy apathy can not know virtue remember too that one act of beneficence one act of real usefulness be worth abstract sentiment in world sentiment be disgrace instead of ornament unless lead to good action miser who think respectable merely because posse wealth thus mistake mean of doing good for actual accomplishment of be not more blameable than man of sentiment without active virtue may have observed person who delight so much in sort of sensibility to sentiment excludes that to call of practical virtue that turn from distressed because suffering be painful to be contemplated endeavour to relieve how despicable be that humanity can be contented to pity where might assuage st aubert time after spoke of madame cheron sister let inform of circumstance nearly affect welfare added have know have little intercourse for year a be now only female relation have thought proper to consign to care a will see in will till be of age to recommend to protection afterwards be not exactly person to whom must have committed emily have alternative believe to be upon wholea good kind of woman need not recommend to prudence love to endeavour to conciliate kindness will do for sake who have often wished to do so for yours emily assured that whatever requested must religiously perform to utmost of ability ala added in voice interrupted by sigh will soon be remains for will be almost only consolation to fulfil wish st aubert looked up silently in face a if must have spoken spirit sunk while eye became heavy dull felt that look at heart dear father exclaimed then checking pressed hand closer hid face with handkerchief tear be concealed st aubert heard convulsive sob spirit returned o child said faintly let consolation be yours die in peace for know be about to return to bosom of father who will still be father when be gone always trust in love will support in moment a support emily must only listen weep extreme composure of manner faith hope expressed somewhat soothed anguish yet whenever looked upon emaciated countenance saw line of death beginning to prevail over itsaw sunk eye still bent on heavy lid pressing to close there be pang in heart such a defied expression though required filial virtue like hers to forbear attempt desired once more to bless where be dear said a stretched forth hand emily have turned to window that might not perceive anguish now understood that sight have failed when have given blessing seemed to be last effort of expiring life sunk back on pillow kissed forehead damp of death have settled there forgetting fortitude for moment tear mingled with st aubert lifted up eye spirit of father returned to quickly vanished spoke more st aubert lingered till about three oclock in afternoon thus gradually sinking into death expired without struggle sigh emily be led from chamber by la voisin daughter who did what must to comfort old man sat wept with agnes be more erroneously officious chapter viii oer whose doom thy virtue grieve aerial form will sit at eve bend pensive head collins monk who have before appeared returned in evening to offer consolation to emily brought kind message from lady abbess inviting to convent emily though did not accept offer returned answer expressive of gratitude holy conversation of friar whose mild benevolence of manner bore resemblance to of st aubert soothed violence of grief lifted heart to being who extending through place eternity look on event of little world a on shadow of moment beholds equally in same instant soul have passed gate of death that still lingers in body in sight of god said emily dear father now exists a truly a yesterday existed to be to only that be dead to god to yet life good monk left more tranquil than have be since st aubert died before retired to little cabin for night trusted so far a to visit corpse silent without weeping stood by side feature placid serene told nature of last sensation have lingered in now deserted frame for moment turned away in horror of stillness in death have fixed that countenance never till now seen otherwise than animated then gazed on with mixture of doubt awful astonishment reason must scarcely overcome involuntary unaccountable expectation of seeing beloved countenance still susceptible continued to gaze wildly took up cold hand spoke still gazed then burst into transport of grief la voisin hearing sob came into room to lead away heard nothing only begged that must leave again alone indulged tear when gloom of evening obscured chamber almost veiled from eye object of distress still hung over body till spirit at length be exhausted became tranquil la voisin again knocked at door entreated that must come to common apartment before went kissed lip of st aubert a be wont to do when bade good night again kissed heart felt a if must break few tear of agony started to eye looked up to heaven then at st aubert left room retired to lonely cabin melancholy thought still hovered round body of deceased parent when sunk into kind of slumber image of waking mind still haunted fancy thought saw father approaching with benign countenance then smiling mournfully pointing upwards lip moved instead of word heard sweet music borne on distant air presently saw feature glow with mild rapture of superior being strain seemed to swell louder awoke vision be gone music yet came to ear in strain such a angel might breathe doubted listened raised in bed again listened be music not illusion of imagination after solemn steady harmony paused then rose again in mournful sweetness then died in cadence seemed to bear away listening soul to heaven instantly remembered music of preceding night with strange circumstance related by la voisin affecting conversation have led to concerning state of departed spirit st aubert have said on subject now pressed upon heart overwhelmed what change in few hour who then must only conjecture be now made acquainted with truth be become one of departed a listened be chilled with superstitious awe tear stopped rose went to window without be obscured in shade emily turning eye from massy darkness of wood whose waving outline appeared on horizon saw on left effulgent planet old man have pointed out setting over wood remembered what have said concerning music now coming at interval on air unclosed casement to listen to strain soon gradually sunk to greater distance tried to discover whence came obscurity prevented from distinguishing object on green platform below sound became fainter fainter till softened into silence listened returned more soon after observed planet trembling between fringed top of wood in next moment sink behind chilled with melancholy awe retired once more to bed at length forgot for while sorrow in sleep on following morning be visited by sister of convent who came with kind office second invitation from lady abbess emily though must not forsake cottage while remains of father be in consented however painful such visit must be in present state of spirit to pay respect to abbess in evening about hour before sunset la voisin showed way through wood to convent stood in small bay of mediterranean crowned by woody amphitheatre emily have be le unhappy must have admired extensive sea view appeared from green slope in front of edifice rich shore hung with wood pasture extended on hand thought be now occupied by one sad idea feature of nature be to colourless without form bell for vesper struck a passed ancient gate of convent seemed funereal note for st aubert little incident affect mind enervated by sorrow emily struggled against sickening faintness came over be led into presence of abbess who received with air of maternal tenderness air of such gentle solicitude consideration a touched with instantaneous gratitude eye be filled with tear word must have spoken faltered on lip abbess led to seat sat down beside still holding hand regarding in silence a emily dried tear attempted to speak be composed daughter said abbess in soothing voice speak yet know must say spirit must be soothed be going to prayerswill attend evening service be comfortable child to look up in affliction to father who see pity who chastens in mercy emilys tear flowed again thousand sweet emotion mingled with abbess suffered to weep without interruption watched over with look of benignity might have characterised countenance of guardian angel emily when became tranquil be encouraged to speak without reserve to mention motive that made unwilling to quit cottage abbess did not oppose even by hint praised filial piety of conduct added hope that must pas few day at convent before returned to la valle must allow little time to recover from first shock daughter before encounter second will not affect to conceal from how much know heart must suffer on returning to scene of former happiness here will have quiet sympathy religion can give to restore spirit come added observing tear swell in emilys eye will go to chapel emily followed to parlour where nun be assembled to whom abbess committed saying be daughter for whom have much esteem be sister to passed on in train to chapel where solemn devotion with service be performed elevated mind brought to comfort of faith resignation twilight came on before abbess kindness must suffer emily to depart when left convent with heart much lighter than have entered be reconducted by la voisin through wood pensive gloom of be in unison with temper of mind pursued little wild path in musing silence till guide suddenly stopped looked round then struck out of path into high grass saying have mistaken road now walked on quickly emily proceeding with difficulty over obscured uneven ground be left at distance till voice arrested who seemed unwilling to stop still hurried on if be in doubt about way said emily have not better enquire at chteau yonder between tree replied la voisin there be occasion when reach that brook maamselle see light upon water there beyond wood when reach that brook will be at

alone maamselle in replied heard too have so often heard at same hour be scarcely surprised doubtless believe music to have connection with chteau said emily suddenly be therefore superstitious may be so maamselle there be other circumstance belonging to chteau remember sadly too heavy sigh followed emilys delicacy restrained curiosity word revived enquired further on reaching cottage violence of grief returned seemed a if have escaped heavy pressure only while be removed from object of passed immediately to chamber where remains of father be laid yielded to anguish of hopeless grief la voisin at length persuaded to leave room returned to own where exhausted by suffering of day soon fell into deep sleep awoke considerably refreshed when dreadful hour arrived in remains of st aubert be to be taken from for ever went alone to chamber to look upon countenance yet once again la voisin who have waited patiently below stair till despair must subside with respect due to grief forbore to interrupt indulgence of till surprise at length of stay then apprehension overcame delicacy went to lead from chamber having tapped gently at door without receiving answer listened attentively be still sigh sob of anguish be heard yet more alarmed by silence opened door found emily lying senseless across foot of bed near stood coffin call procured assistance be carried to room where proper application at length restored during state of insensibility la voisin have given direction for coffin to be closed succeeded in persuading emily to forbear revisiting chamber indeed felt unequal to

convent of st clair in mentioning north chancel near ancient tomb of villerois have pointed out exact spot where wished to be laid superior have granted place for interment thither therefore sad procession now moved be met at gate by venerable priest followed by train of friar person who heard solemn chant of anthem peal of organ struck up when body entered church saw also feeble step assumed tranquillity of emily gave involuntary tear shed none walked face partly shaded by thin black veil between two person who supported preceded by abbess followed by nun whose plaintive voice mellowed swelling harmony of dirge when procession came to grave music ceased emily drew veil entirely over face in momentary pause between anthem rest of service sob be distinctly audible holy father began service emily again commanded feeling till coffin be let down heard earth rattle on lid then a shuddered groan burst from heart leaned for support on person who stood next to in few moment recovered when heard affecting sublime word body be buried in peace soul return to gave anguish softened into tear abbess led from church into own parlour there administered consolation religion gentle sympathy

died here remains must repose beside of st aubert in meanwhile sent letter to madame cheron to old housekeeper informing of sad event have taken place of own situation from aunt received answer abounding more in common place condolement than in trait of real sorrow assured that servant must be sent to conduct to la valle for own time be so much occupied by company that have leisure to undertake so long journey however emily might prefer la valle to thoulouse must not be insensible to indecorous unkind conduct of aunt in suffering to return thither where have no longer relation to console protect conduct be more culpable since st aubert have appointed madame cheron guardian of orphan daughter madame cherons servant made attendance of good la voisin unnecessary emily who felt sensibly obligation to for kind attention to late father a well a to herself be glad to spare long what at time of life must have be troublesome journey during stay at convent peace sanctity reigned within tranquil beauty of scenery without delicate attention of abbess nun be circumstance so soothing to mind that almost tempted to leave world where have lost dearest friend devote to cloister in

have availed of permission with honoured meof bidding farewell whom have happiness of meeting only yesterday emily smiled faintly anxious to say something asked if have be long in gascony few day only replied valancourt while blush passed over cheek engaged in long ramble after have misfortune of parting with friend who have made wandering among pyrenees so delightful tear came to emilys eye a valancourt said observed anxious to draw off attention from remembrance have occasioned a well a shocked at own thoughtlessness began to speak on other subject expressing admiration of chteau prospect emily who felt somewhat embarrassed how to support conversation be glad of such opportunity to continue on indifferent topic walked down to terrace where valancourt be charmed with river scenery view over opposite shore of guienne a leaned on wall of terrace watching rapid current of garonne be few week ago said at source of noble river have not then happiness of knowing must have regretted

thoulouse turning again to north west assumes milder character a fertilizes pasture of gascony guienne in progress to bay of biscay emily valancourt talked of scene have passed among pyrenean alp a spoke of there be often tremulous tenderness in voice sometimes expatiated on with fire of genius sometimes must appear scarcely conscious of topic though continued to speak subject recalled forcibly to emily idea of father whose image appeared in landscape valancourt particularized whose remark dwelt upon memory whose enthusiasm still glowed in heart silence at length reminded valancourt how nearly conversation approached to occasion of grief changed subject though for one scarcely le affecting to emily when admired grandeur of plane tree spread wide branch over terrace under whose shade now sat remembered how often have sat thus with st aubert heard express same admiration be favourite tree with dear father said used to love to sit under foliage with family about in fine evening of summer valancourt understood feeling be silent have raised eye from ground must have seen tear in rose leaned on wall of terrace from in few moment returned to seat then rose again appeared to be greatly agitated while emily found spirit so much depressed that several of attempt to renew conversation be ineffectual valancourt again sat down be still silent trembled at length said with hesitating voice lovely scenei be going to leaveto leave youperhaps for ever moment may never return can not resolve to neglect though scarcely dare to avail myself of let however without offending delicacy of sorrow venture to declare admiration must always feel of goodnesso that at future period might be permitted to call love emilys emotion must not suffer to reply valancourt who now ventured to look up observing countenance change expected to see faint made involuntary effort to support recalled emily to sense of situation to exertion of spirit valancourt did not appear to notice indisposition when spoke again voice told tenderest love will not presume added to intrude subject longer upon attention at time may perhaps be permitted to mention that parting moment must lose much of bitterness if might be allowed to hope declaration have made must not exclude from presence in future emily made effort to overcome confusion of thought to speak feared to trust preference heart acknowledged towards valancourt to give encouragement for hope on so short acquaintance for though in narrow period have observed much be admirable in taste disposition though observation have be sanctioned by opinion of father be not sufficient testimony of general worth to determine upon subject so infinitely important to future happiness a now solicited attention yet though thought of dismissing valancourt be so very painful to that must scarcely endure to pause upon consciousness of made fear partiality of judgment hesitate still more to encourage suit for own heart too tenderly pleaded family of valancourt if not circumstance have be known to father known to be unexceptionable of circumstance valancourt hinted a far a delicacy must permit when said have at present little else to offer heart adored have solicited only for distant hope must not resolve to forbid though scarcely dared to permit at length acquired courage to say that must think honoured by good opinion of person whom father have esteemed be then thought worthy of esteem said valancourt in voice trembling with anxiety then checking added pardon question scarcely know what say if might dare to hope that think not unworthy such honour might be permitted sometimes to enquire after health must now leave with comparative tranquillity emily after moment silence said will be ingenuous with for know will understand allow for situation will consider a proof of mymy esteem that be so though live here in what be father house live here alone have ala no longer parenta parent whose presence might sanction visit be unnecessary for to point out impropriety of receiving will affect to be insensible of replied valancourt adding mournfullybut what be to console for candour distress must now leave subject if might carry with hope of being time permitted to renew of being allowed to make known to family emily be again confused again hesitated what to reply felt most acutely difficultythe forlornness of situation did not allow single relative friend to whom must turn for even look might support guide in present embarrassing circumstance madame cheron who be only relative ought to have be friend be either occupied by own amusement so resentful of reluctance niece have shown to quit la valle that seemed totally to have abandoned ah see said valancourt after long pause during emily have begun left unfinished two three sentence see have nothing to hope fear be too just think unworthy of esteem that fatal journey considered a happiest period of lifethose delightful day be to embitter future one how often have looked back to with hope fearyet never till moment must prevail with to regret enchanting influence voice faltered abruptly quitted seat walked on terrace there be expression of despair on countenance that affected emily pleading of heart overcame in degree extreme timidity when resumed seat said in accent betrayed tenderness do injustice when say think unworthy of esteem will acknowledge that have long possessed andand valancourt waited impatiently for conclusion of sentence word died on lip eye however reflected emotion of heart valancourt passed in instant from impatience of despair to of joy tenderness o emily exclaimed own emilyteach to sustain moment let seal a most sacred of life pressed hand to lip be cold trembling raising eye saw paleness of countenance tear came to relief valancourt watched in anxious silence over in few moment recovered smiling faintly through tear said can excuse weakness spirit have not yet believe recovered from shock lately received can not excuse said valancourt will forbear to renew subject may have contributed to agitate now that can leave with sweet certainty of possessing esteem then forgetting resolution again spoke of know not said many anxious hour have passed near lately when believed if indeed honoured with thought far away have wandered near chteau in still hour of night when eye must observe be delightful to know be so near there be something particularly soothing in thought watched round habitation while slept ground be not entirely new to once ventured within fence spent one of happiest yet most melancholy hour of life in walking under what believed to be window emily enquired how long valancourt have be in neighbourhood several day replied be design to avail myself of permission m st aubert have given scarcely know how to account for though anxiously wished to do resolution always failed when moment approached constantly deferred visit lodged in village at distance wandered with dog among scene of charming country wishing continually to meet yet not daring to visit having thus continued to converse without perceiving flight of time valancourt at length seemed to recollect must go said mournfully be with hope of seeing again of being permitted to pay respect to family let hear hope confirmed by voice family will be happy to see friend of dear father said emily valancourt kissed hand still lingered unable to depart while emily sat silently with eye bent on ground valancourt a gazed on considered that must soon be impossible for to recall even to memory exact resemblance of beautiful countenance then beheld at moment hasty footstep approached from behind plane tree turning eye emily saw madame cheron felt blush steal upon cheek frame trembled with emotion of mind instantly rose to meet visitor so niece said madame cheron casting look of surprise enquiry on valancourt so niece how do do need not ask look tell have already recovered loss look do injustice then madame loss know can never be recovered wellwell will not argue with see have exactly father disposition let tell must have be much happier for poor man if have be different one look of dignified displeasure with emily regarded madame cheron while spoke must have touched almost other heart made other reply introduced valancourt who must scarcely stifle resentment felt whose bow madame cheron returned with slight curtsy look of supercilious examination after few moment took leave of emily in manner hastily expressed pain at own departure at leaving to society of madame cheron who be that young man said aunt in accent equally implied inquisitiveness censure idle admirer of yours suppose believed niece have greater sense of propriety than to have received visit of young man in present unfriended situation let tell world will observe thing will talk aye very freely too emily extremely shocked at coarse speech attempted to interrupt madame cheron must proceed with self importance of person to whom power be new be very necessary must be under eye of person more able to guide than indeed have not much leisure for task however since poor father made last request must overlook conducti must even take under care let tell niece that unless will determine to be very conformable to direction will not trouble longer about emily made attempt to interrupt madame cheron second time grief pride of conscious innocence kept silent till aunt said be now come to take with to thoulouse be sorry to find that poor father died after in such indifferent circumstance however will take home with ah poor man be always more generous than provident must not have left daughter dependent on relation have done so hope madam said emily calmly did pecuniary misfortune arise from noble generosity always distinguished affair of m de motteville may trust yet be settled without deeply injuring creditor in meantime must be very happy to remain at la valle doubt must replied madame cheron with smile of irony will doubt consent to since see how necessary tranquillity retirement be to restore spirit did not think capable of so much duplicity niece when pleaded excuse for remaining here foolishly believed to be just one expected to have found with so agreeable companion a m la val forget name emily must no longer endure cruel indignity be just one madam said now indeed feel more than ever value of retirement then solicited if purport of visit be only to add insult to sorrow of brother child must well have spared see have undertaken very troublesome task said madame cheron

approve must be very painful to to disobey sister of such parent if believe task will really be so troublesome must lament that be yours well niece fine speaking signifies little be willing in consideration of poor brother to overlook impropriety of late conduct to try what future will be emily interrupted to beg must explain what be impropriety alluded to what impropriety why of receiving visit of lover unknown to family replied madame cheron not considering impropriety of have be guilty in exposing niece to possibility of conduct so erroneous faint blush passed over emilys countenance pride anxiety struggled in breast till recollected that appearance did in degree justify aunt suspicion must not resolve to humble so far a to enter into defence of conduct have be so innocent undesigning on part mentioned manner of valancourts introduction to father circumstance of receiving pistol shot of afterwards travelling together with accidental way in have met on preceding evening owned have declared partiality for that have asked permission to address family who be young adventurer pray said madame cheron be pretension must explain madam replied emily of family father be not

than admiredbut there be accounting for taste be always so much influenced by people countenance now for part have notion of be ridiculous enthusiasm what have man face to do with character can man of good character help having disagreeable facewhich last sentence madame cheron delivered with decisive air of person who congratulates on having made grand discovery belief question to be unanswerably settled emily desirous of concluding conversation enquired if aunt must accept refreshment madame cheron accompanied to chteau without desisting from topic discussed with so much complacency to herself severity to niece be sorry to perceive niece said in allusion to somewhat that emily have said concerning physiognomy that have great many of father prejudice among sudden predilection for people from look can perceive that imagine to be violently in love with young adventurer after acquaintance of only few day there be something too so charmingly romantic in manner of meeting emily checked tear trembled in eye while said when conduct will deserve severity madam will do well to exercise till then justice if not tenderness must surely restrain have never willingly offended now have lost parent be only person to whom can look for kindness let not lament more than ever loss of such parent last word be almost stifled by emotion burst into tear remembering delicacy tenderness of st aubert happy happy day have passed in scene contrasting with coarse unfeeling behaviour of madame cheron from future hour of mortification must submit to in presencea degree of grief seized that

large party be expected to dinner on account madame cheron repeated lesson of preceding night concerning conduct in company emily wished that might have courage enough to practise aunt then proceeded to examine simplicity of dress adding that expected to see attired with gaiety taste after condescended to show emily splendour of chteau to point out particular beauty elegance thought distinguished of numerous suite of apartment then withdrew to toilet throne of homage emily to chamber to unpack book to try to charm mind by reading till hour of dressing when company arrived emily entered saloon

nothing to learn attracted notice from amused disgusted others for moment be then forgotten day passed without material occurrence emily though amused by character have seen be glad when must retire to recollection have acquired with character of duty fortnight passed in round of dissipation company emily who attended madame cheron in visit be sometimes entertained oftener wearied be struck by apparent talent knowledge displayed in various conversation listened to be long before discovered that talent be for most part of imposture knowledge nothing more than be necessary to assist what deceived most be air of constant gaiety good spirit displayed by visitor supposed to arise from content a constant from benevolence a ready at length from over acting of le accomplished than others must perceive that though contentment benevolence be only sure source of cheerfulness immoderate feverish animation usually exhibited in large party result partly from insensibility to care benevolence must sometimes derive from suffering of others partly from desire to display appearance of prosperity know will command submission attention to emilys pleasantest hour be passed in pavilion of terrace to retired when must steal from observation with book to overcome lute to indulge melancholy there a sat with eye fixed on far distant pyrenees thought on valancourt beloved scene of gascony must play sweet melancholy song of native provincethe popular song have listened to from childhood one evening having excused from accompanying aunt abroad thus withdrew to pavilion with book lute be mild beautiful evening of sultry day window fronted west opened upon glory of setting sun ray illuminated with strong splendour cliff of pyrenees touched snowy top with roseate hue remained long after sun have sunk below horizon shade of twilight have stolen over landscape emily touched lute with fine melancholy expression came from heart pensive hour scene evening light on garonne flowed at great distance whose wave a passed towards la valle often viewed with sighthese united circumstance disposed mind to tenderness thought be with valancourt of whom have heard nothing since arrival at thoulouse now that be removed from in uncertainty perceived interest held in heart before saw valancourt have never met mind taste so accordant with own though madame cheron told much of art of dissimulation that elegance propriety of thought so much admired in lover be assumed for purpose of pleasing must scarcely doubt truth possibility however faint a be be sufficient to harass mind with anxiety found that few condition be more painful than of uncertainty a to merit of beloved object uncertainty must not have suffered have confidence in own opinion be greater be awakened from musing by sound of horse foot along road wound under window of pavilion gentleman passed on horseback whose resemblance to valancourt in air figure for twilight did not permit view of feature immediately struck retired hastily from lattice fearing to be seen yet wishing to observe further while stranger passed on without looking up when returned to lattice saw faintly through twilight winding under high tree led to thoulouse little incident so much disturbed spirit that temple scenery be no longer interesting to after walking while on terrace returned to chteau madame cheron whether have seen rival admired have lost at play have witnessed entertainment more splendid than own be returned from visit with temper more than usually discomposed emily be glad when hour arrived in must retire to solitude of own apartment on following morning be summoned to madame cheron whose countenance be inflamed with resentment a emily advanced held out letter to do know hand said in severe tone with look be intended to search heart while emily examined letter attentively assured that did not provoke said aunt do know confess truth immediately insist upon confessing truth instantly emily be silent turned to leave room madame called back o be guilty then said do know hand if be before in doubt of madam replied emily calmly why did accuse of having told falsehood madame cheron did not blush niece did moment after when heard name of valancourt be not however with consciousness of deserving reproof for if ever have seen hand writing present character did not bring to recollection be useless to deny said madame cheron see in countenance that be stranger to letter dare say have received many such from impertinent young man without knowledge in own house emily shocked at indelicacy of accusation still more than by vulgarity of former instantly forgot pride have imposed silence endeavoured to vindicate from aspersion madame cheron be not to be convinced can not suppose resumed that young man must have taken liberty of writing to if have not encouraged to do so must now will allow to remind madam said emily timidly of particular of conversation have at la valle then told truly have only not forbade monsieur valancourt from addressing family will not be interrupted said madame cheron interrupting niece be going to sayiihave forgot what be going to say how happened that did not forbid emily be silent how happened that encouraged to trouble with lettera young man that nobody knowsan utter stranger in placea young adventurer doubt who be looking out for good fortune however on point have mistaken aim family be known to father said emily modestly without appearing to be sensible of last sentence o be recommendation at replied aunt with usual readiness upon topic took such strange fancy to people be always judging person by countenance be continually deceived yet be now madam that judged guilty by countenance said emily with design of reproving madame cheron to be induced by disrespectful mention of father called here resumed aunt colouring to tell will not be disturbed in own house by letter visit from young men who may take fancy to flatter m de valantinei think call have impertinence to beg will permit to pay respect to will send proper answer for emily repeat once for allif be not contented to conform to direction to way of live will give up task of overlooking conducti will no longer trouble with education will send to board in convent dear madam said emily bursting into tear overcome by rude suspicion aunt have expressed how have deserved reproof must say more so very fearful be of acting with degree of impropriety in affair at present moment madame cheron might perhaps have prevailed with to bind by promise to renounce valancourt for ever mind weakened by terror must no longer suffer to view a have formerly done feared error of own judgment not that of madame cheron feared also that in former conversation with at la valle have not conducted with sufficient reserve knew that did not deserve coarse suspicion aunt have thrown out thousand scruple rose to torment such a must never have disturbed peace of madame cheron thus rendered anxious to avoid opportunity of erring willing to submit to restriction that aunt must think proper expressed obedience to madame cheron did not give much confidence seemed to consider a consequence of fear artifice well then said promise that will neither see young man write to without consent dear madam replied emily can suppose must do either unknown to dont know what to suppose there be knowing how young woman will act be difficult to place confidence in for have seldom sense enough to wish for respect of world ala madam said emily be anxious for own respect father taught value of that said if deserved own esteem that world must follow of course brother be good kind of man replied madame cheron did not know world be sure have always felt proper respect for myself yet stopped might have added that world have not always shown respect to without impeaching judgment well resumed madame cheron have not given promise though demand emily readily gave being then suffered to withdraw walked in garden tried to compose spirit at length arrived at favourite pavilion at end of terrace where seating at one of embowered window opened upon balcony stillness seclusion of scene allowed to recollect thought to arrange so a to form clearer judgment of former conduct endeavoured to review with exactness particular of conversation with valancourt at la valle have satisfaction to observe nothing must alarm delicate pride thus to be confirmed in self esteem be so necessary to peace mind then became tranquil saw valancourt amiable intelligent a have formerly appeared madame cheron one other remembrance of lover however brought with many very painful emotion for by mean reconciled to thought of resigning madame cheron having already shown how highly disapproved of attachment foresaw much suffering from opposition of interest yet with be mingled degree of delight in spite of reason partook of hope determined however that consideration must induce to permit clandestine correspondence to observe in conversation with valancourt must ever meet again same nicety of reserve have hitherto marked conduct a repeated wordsshould ever meet again shrunk a if be circumstance have never before occurred to tear came to eye hastily dried for heard footstep approaching then door of pavilion open on turning sawvalancourt emotion of mingled pleasure surprise apprehension pressed so suddenly upon heart a almost to overcome spirit colour left cheek then returned brighter than before be for moment unable to speak to rise from chair countenance be mirror in saw own emotion reflected roused to self command joy have animated feature when entered pavilion be suddenly repressed a approaching perceived agitation in tremulous voice enquired after health recovered from first surprise answered with tempered smile variety of opposite emotion still assailed heart struggled to subdue mild dignity of manner be difficult to tell predominatedthe joy of seeing valancourt terror of aunt displeasure when must hear of meeting after short embarrassed conversation led into garden enquired if have seen madame cheron said have not yet seen for told be engaged a soon a learned that be in garden came hither paused moment in great agitation then added may venture to tell purport of visit without incurring displeasure to hope that will not accuse of precipitation in now availing of permission once gave of addressing family emily who knew not what to reply be spared from further perplexity be sensible only of fear when on raising eye saw madame cheron turn into avenue a consciousness of innocence returned fear be so far dissipated a to permit to appear tranquil instead of avoiding aunt advanced with valancourt to meet look of haughty impatient displeasure with madame cheron regarded made emily shrink who understood from single glance that meeting be believed to have be more than accidental having mentioned valancourts name became again too much agitated to remain with returned into chteau where awaited long in state of trembling anxiety conclusion of conference knew not how to account for valancourts visit to aunt before have received permission solicited since be ignorant of circumstance must have rendered request useless even if madame cheron have be inclined to grant valancourt in agitation of spirit have forgotten to date letter so that be impossible for madame cheron to return answer when recollected circumstance be perhaps not so sorry for omission a glad of excuse allowed for waiting on before must send refusal madame cheron have long conversation with valancourt when returned to chteau countenance expressed ill humour not degree of severity emily have apprehended have dismissed young man at last said hope house will never again be disturbed with similar visit assures that interview be not preconcerted dear madam said emily in extreme emotion surely did not ask question most certainly did must not suppose must be so imprudent a to neglect good god exclaimed emily what opinion must form of since madam must express suspicion of such ill conduct be of very little consequence what opinion may form of replied aunt for have put end to affair believe will not form worse opinion of for prudent conduct let see be not to be trifled with have more delicacy than to permit clandestine correspondence to be carried on in house emily have frequently heard madame cheron use word delicacy be now more than usually perplexed to understand how meant to apply in instance in whole conduct appeared to merit very reverse of term be very inconsiderate of brother resumed madame cheron to leave trouble of overlooking conduct to wish be well settled in life if find be to be further troubled with such visitor a m valancourt will place in convent at onceso remember alternative young man have impertinence to own to mehe owns that fortune be very small that be chiefly dependent on elder brother on profession have chosen must have concealed circumstance at least if expected to succeed with have presumption to suppose must marry niece to person such a describes emily dried tear when heard of candid confession of valancourt though circumstance discovered be afflicting to hope artless conduct gave degree of pleasure overcame other emotion be compelled even thus early in life to observe good sense noble integrity be not always sufficient to cope with folly narrow cunning heart be pure enough to allow even at trying moment to look with more pride on defeat of former than with mortification on conquest of latter madame cheron pursued triumph have also thought proper to tell that will receive dismission from person favour however have absolutely refused will learn that be quite sufficient that disapprove take opportunity of repeatingthat if concert mean of interview unknown to will leave house immediately how little do know madam that must think injunction necessary said emily trying to suppress emotion how little of dear parent who educated madame cheron now went to dress for engagement have made for evening emily who must gladly have be excused from attending aunt did not ask to remain at home lest request must be attributed to improper motive when retired to own room little fortitude have supported in presence of relation forsook remembered only that valancourt whose character appeared more amiable from circumstance unfolded be banished from presence perhaps for ever passed time in weeping according to aunt direction ought to have employed in dressing important duty be however quickly dispatched though when joined madame cheron at table eye betrayed that have be in tear drew upon severe reproof effort to appear cheerful did not entirely fail when joined company at house of madame clairval elderly widow lady who have lately come to reside at thoulouse on estate of late husband have lived many year at paris in splendid style have naturally gay temper since residence at thoulouse have given of most magnificent entertainment have be seen in neighbourhood excited not only envy trifling ambition of madame cheron who since must not rival splendour of festivity be desirous of being ranked in number of most intimate friend for purpose paid most obsequious attention made point of being disengaged whenever received invitation from madame clairval of whom talked wherever went derived much self consequence from impressing belief on general acquaintance that be on most familiar footing entertainment of evening consisted of ball supper be fancy ball company danced in group in garden be very extensive high luxuriant tree under group assembled be illuminated with profusion of lamp disposed with taste fancy gay various dress of company of whom be seated on turf conversing at ease observing cotillons taking refreshment sometimes touching sportively guitar gallant manner of gentleman exquisitely capricious air of lady light fantastic step of dance musician with lute hautboy tabor seated at foot of elm sylvan scenery of wood around be circumstance unitedly formed characteristic striking picture of french festivity emily surveyed gaiety of scene with melancholy kind of pleasure emotion may be imagined when a stood with aunt looking at one of group perceived valancourt saw dancing with young beautiful lady saw conversing with with mixture of attention familiarity such a have seldom observed in manner turned hastily from scene attempted to draw away madame cheron who be conversing with signor cavigni perceived valancourt be willing to be interrupted faintness suddenly came over emily unable to support sat down on turf bank beneath tree where several other person be seated one of observing extreme paleness of countenance enquired if be ill begged must allow to fetch glass of water for politeness thanked did not accept apprehension lest valancourt must observe emotion made anxious to overcome succeeded so far a to recompose countenance madame cheron be still conversing with cavigni count bauvillers who have addressed emily made observation upon scene to answered almost unconsciously for mind be still occupied with idea of valancourt to whom be with extreme uneasiness that remained so near remark however count made upon dance obliged to turn eye towards at moment valancourts met hers colour faded again felt that be relapsing into faintness instantly averted look not before have observed altered countenance of valancourt on perceiving must have left spot immediately have not be conscious that conduct must have shown more obviously interest held in heart having tried to attend to count conversation to join in at length recovered spirit when made observation on valancourts partner fear of showing that be interested in remark must have betrayed to have not count while spoke looked towards person of whom be speaking lady said dancing with young chevalier who appears to be accomplished in everything in dancing be ranked among beauty of thoulouse be handsome fortune will be very large hope will make better choice in partner for life than have done in partner for dance for observe have just put set into great confusion doe nothing commit blunder be surprised that with air figure have not taken more care to accomplish in dancing emily whose heart trembled at word be now uttered endeavoured to turn conversation from valancourt by enquiring name of lady with whom danced before count must reply dance concluded emily perceiving that valancourt be coming towards rose joined madame cheron here be chevalier valancourt madam said in whisper pray let go aunt immediately moved on not before valancourt have reached who bowed lowly to madame cheron with earnest dejected look to emily with whom notwithstanding effort air of more than common reserve prevailed presence of madame cheron prevented valancourt from remaining passed on with countenance whose melancholy reproached for having increased emily be called from musing fit into have fallen by count bauvillers who be known to aunt have pardon to beg maamselle said for rudeness will readily believe be quite unintentional did not know that chevalier be acquaintance when so freely criticised dancing emily blushed smiled madame cheron spared difficulty of replying if mean person who have just passed said can assure be acquaintance of mine maamselle st auberts know nothing of o be chevalier valancourt said cavigni carelessly looking back know then said madame cheron be not acquainted with replied cavigni dont know then reason have to call impertinenthe have have presumption to admire niece if man deserves title of impertinent who admires maamselle st aubert replied cavigni fear there be great many impertinents be willing to acknowledge one of number o signor said madame cheron with affected smile perceive have learnt art of complimenting since came into france be cruel to compliment child since mistake flattery for truth cavigni turned away face for moment then said with studied air whom then be to compliment madam for must be absurd to compliment woman of refined understanding be above all praise a finished sentence gave emily sly look smile have lurked in eye stole forth perfectly understood blushed for madame cheron who replied be perfectly right signor woman of understanding can endure compliment have heard signor montoni say rejoined cavigni that never knew one woman who deserved well exclaimed madame cheron with short laugh smile of unutterable complacency who must be o replied cavigni be impossible to mistake for certainly there be not more than one woman in world who have merit to deserve compliment wit to refuse most woman reverse case entirely looked again at emily who blushed deeper than before for aunt turned from with displeasure well signor said madame cheron protest be frenchman never heard foreigner say anything half so gallant a true madam said count who have be time silent with low bow gallantry of compliment have be utterly lost for ingenuity discovered application madame cheron did not perceive meaning of too satirical sentence therefore escaped pain emily felt on account o here come signor montoni said aunt protest will tell fine thing have be saying to signor however passed at moment into walk pray who be have so much engaged friend evening asked madame cheron with air of chagrin have not seen once have very particular engagement with marquis la rivire replied cavigni have detained perceive till moment must have done honour of paying respect to madam sooner a commissioned to say know not how isyour conversation be so fascinatingthat can charm even memory think must certainly have delivered friend apology before apology sir must have be more satisfactory from said madame cheron whose vanity be more mortified by montonis neglect than flattered by cavignis compliment manner at moment cavignis late conversation now awakened suspicion in emilys mind notwithstanding that recollection served to confirm appeared preposterous thought perceived that montoni be paying serious address to aunt that not only accepted be jealously watchful of appearance of neglect on partthat madame cheron at year must elect second husband be ridiculous though vanity made not impossible montoni with discernment figure pretension must make choice of madame cheronappeared most wonderful thought however did not dwell long on subject nearer interest pressed upon valancourt rejected of aunt valancourt dancing with gay beautiful partner alternately tormented mind a passed along garden looked timidly forward half fearing half hoping that might appear in crowd disappointment felt on not seeing told that have hoped more than have feared montoni soon after joined party muttered over short speech about regret for having be so long detained elsewhere when knew must have pleasure of seeing madame cheron here receiving apology with air of pettish girl addressed entirely to cavigni who looked archly at montoni a if must have said will not triumph over too much will have goodness to bear honour meekly look sharp signor will certainly run away with prize supper be served in different pavilion in garden a well a in one large saloon of chteau with more of taste than of splendour even of plenty madame cheron party supped with madame clairval in saloon emily with difficulty disguised emotion when saw valancourt placed at same table with there madame cheron having surveyed with high displeasure said to person who sat next to pray who be that young man be chevalier valancourt be answer yes be not ignorant of name who be chevalier valancourt thus intrudes at table attention of person to whom spoke be called off before received second reply table at sat be very long valancourt being seated with partner near bottom emily near top distance between may account for not immediately perceiving avoided looking to end of table whenever eye happened to glance towards observed conversing with beautiful companion observation did not contribute to restore peace more than account heard of fortune accomplishment of same lady madame cheron to whom remark be sometimes addressed because supported topic for trivial conversation seemed indefatigable in attempt to depreciate valancourt towards whom felt petty resentment of narrow pride admire lady said must condemn choice of partner oh chevalier valancourt be one of most accomplished young men have replied lady to whom remark be addressed be whispered that mademoiselle demery large fortune be to be impossible exclaimed madame cheron reddening with vexation be impossible that can be so destitute of taste have so little air of person of condition that if did not see at table of madame clairval must never have suspected to be one have besides particular reason for believing report to be erroneous can not doubt

to true state of present circumstance future expectancy with more prudence than humanity have absolutely abruptly rejected suit wished niece to marry ambitiously not because desired to see in possession of happiness rank wealth be usually believed to bestow because desired to partake importance alliance must give when therefore discovered that valancourt be nephew of person of so much consequence a madame clairval became anxious for connection since prospect afforded of future fortune distinction for emily promised exaltation coveted for calculation concerning fortune in alliance be guided rather by wish than by hint of valancourt strong appearance of probability when rested expectation on wealth of madame clairval seemed totally to have forgotten that latter have daughter valancourt however have not forgotten circumstance consideration of have made so modest in expectation from madame clairval that have not even named relationship in first conversation with madame cheron might be future fortune of emily present distinction connection must afford for herself be certain since splendour of madame clairvals establishment be such a to excite general envy partial

astonished wholly unable to account for sudden conclusion valancourt have not solicited for be ignorant of what have passed between elder lady have not dared to hope such good fortune decisively objected to madame cheron however quite a jealous of contradiction now a have be formerly contended for speedy marriage with a much vehemence a have formerly opposed have most remote possibility of leading to emilys scruple disappeared when again saw valancourt who be now informed of happiness designed for came to claim promise of from while preparation be making for nuptials montoni became

montoni now took possession of chteau command of inhabitant with ease of man who have long considered to be own friend cavigni who have be extremely serviceable in having paid madame cheron attention

magnificent entertainment to very numerous company among whom be valancourt at madame clairval excused from attending there be concert ball supper valancourt be of course emilys partner though when gave look to decoration of apartment must not remember that be designed for other festivity than now contributed to celebrate endeavoured to check concern by considering that little while only must elapse before must be given to original destination during evening madame montoni danced laughed talked incessantly while montoni silent reserved somewhat haughty seemed weary of parade of frivolous company have drawn together be first last entertainment given in celebration of nuptials montoni though severity of temper gloominess of pride prevented from enjoying such festivity be extremely willing to promote be seldom that must meet in company man of more address still seldomer one of more understanding than balance of advantage in such party in connection might arise from must therefore be on side knowing a did selfish purpose for be generally frequented have objection to measure talent of dissimulation with of other competitor for distinction plunder wife who when own interest be immediately concerned have sometimes more discernment than vanity acquired consciousness of inferiority to other woman in personal attraction uniting with jealousy natural to discovery counteracted readiness for mingling with party thoulouse must afford till have a supposed affection of husband to lose have motive for discovering unwelcome truth have never obtruded upon now that influenced policy opposed husband inclination for company with more eagerness because believed to be really a well received in female society of place a during address to have affected to be few week only have elapsed since marriage when madame montoni informed emily that signor intended to return to italy a soon a necessary preparation must be made for so long journey will go to venice said where signor have fine mansion from thence to estate in tuscany why do look so grave childyou who be so fond of romantic country fine view will doubtless be delighted with journey be then to be of party madam said emily with extreme surprise emotion most certainly replied aunt how must imagine must leave behind see be thinking of chevalier be not yet believe informed of journey very soon will be so signor montoni be gone to acquaint madame clairval of journey to say that proposed connection between family must from time be thought of more unfeeling manner in madame montoni thus informed niece that must be separated perhaps for ever from man with whom be on point of being united for life added to dismay must otherwise have suffered at such intelligence when must speak asked cause of sudden change in madame sentiment towards valancourt only reply must obtain be that signor have forbade connection considering to be greatly inferior to what emily might reasonably expect now leave affair entirely to signor added madame montoni must say that m valancourt never be favourite with be overpersuaded must not have given consent to connection be weak enoughi be so foolish sometimesto suffer other people uneasiness to affect so better judgment yielded to affliction signor have very properly pointed out folly of will not have to reprove second time be determined that will submit to who know how to guide better than yourselfi be determined that will be conformable emily must have be astonished at assertion of eloquent speech have not mind be so overwhelmed by sudden shock have received that scarcely heard word of what be latterly addressed to be weakness of madame montoni might have avoided to accuse with of compassion tenderness to feeling of others especially to of emily be same ambition lately prevailed upon to solicit alliance with madame clairvals family induced to withdraw from now that marriage with montoni have exalted self consequence with view for niece emily be at time too much affected to employ remonstrance entreaty on topic when at length attempted latter emotion overcame speech retired to apartment to think if in present state of mind to think be possible upon sudden overwhelming subject be very long before spirit be sufficiently composed to permit reflection when came be dark even terrible saw that montoni sought to aggrandise in disposal of occurred that friend cavigni be person for whom be interested prospect of going to italy be still rendered darker when considered tumultuous situation of country then torn by civil commotion where petty state be at war with neighbour even castle liable to attack of invader considered person to whose immediate guidance must be committed vast distance be to separate from valancourt at recollection of other image vanished from mind thought be again obscured by grief in perturbed state passed hour when be summoned to dinner entreated permission to remain in own apartment madame montoni be alone request be refused emily aunt said little during repast one occupied by grief other engrossed by disappointment unexpected absence of montoni occasioned for not only be vanity piqued by neglect jealousy alarmed by what considered a mysterious engagement when cloth be drawn be alone emily renewed mention of valancourt aunt neither softened to pity awakened to remorse became enraged that will must be opposed authority of montoni questioned though be done by emily with usual gentleness who after long torturing conversation retired in tear a crossed hall person entered by great door whom a eye hastily glanced that way imagined to be montoni be passing on with quicker step when heard well known voice of valancourt emily o emily cried in tone faltering with impatience while turned a advanced be alarmed at expression of countenance eager desperation of air in tear emily must speak with said have much to say conduct to where may converse trembleyou be ill let lead to seat observed open door of apartment hastily took hand to lead thither attempted to withdraw said with languid smile be better already if wish to see aunt be in dining parlour must speak with emily replied valancourt good god be already come to be indeed so willing to resign be improper placei be overheard let entreat attention if only for few minuteswhen have seen aunt said emily be wretched enough when came hither exclaimed valancourt increase misery by coldnessthis cruel refusal despondency with spoke affected almost to tear persisted in refusing to hear till have conversed with madame montoni where be husband where then be montoni said valancourt in altered tone be to whom must speak emily terrified for consequence of indignation flashed in eye tremblingly assured that montoni be not at home entreated must endeavour to moderate resentment at tremulous accent of voice eye softened instantly from wildness into tenderness be ill emily said will destroy forgive that dared to doubt affection emily no longer opposed a led into adjoining parlour manner in have named montoni have so much alarmed for own safety that be now only anxious to prevent consequence of just resentment listened to entreaty with attention replied to only with look of despondency tenderness concealing a much a possible sentiment felt towards montoni that might soothe apprehension distressed saw veil have spread over resentment assumed tranquillity only alarming more urged at length impolicy of forcing interview with montoni of taking measure might render separation irremediable valancourt yielded to remonstrance affecting entreaty drew from promise however montoni might persist in design of disuniting must not seek to redress wrong by violence for sake said emily let consideration of what must suffer deter from mode of revenge for sake emily replied valancourt eye filling with tear of tenderness grief while gazed upon yesyesi will subdue though have given solemn promise to do expect can tamely submit to authority of montoni if must must be unworthy of yet o emily how long may condemn to live without youhow long may be before return to france emily endeavoured to sooth with assurance of unalterable affection by representing that in little more than year must be own mistress a far a related to aunt from whose guardianship age must then release assurance gave little consolation to valancourt who considered that must then be in italy in power of whose dominion over must not cease with right affected to be consoled by emily comforted by promise have obtained by apparent composure be about to leave when aunt entered room threw glance of sharp reproof upon niece who immediately withdrew of haughty displeasure upon valancourt be not conduct must have expected from sir said did not expect to see in house after have be informed that visit be no longer agreeable much le that must seek clandestine interview with niece that must grant one valancourt perceiving necessary to vindicate emily from such design explained that purpose of own visit have be to request interview with montoni then entered upon subject of with tempered spirit sex rather than respectability of madame montoni demanded expostulation be answered with severe rebuke lamented again that prudence have ever yielded to what termed compassion added that be so sensible of folly of former consent to prevent possibility of repetition have committed affair entirely to conduct of signor montoni feeling eloquence of valancourt however at length made sensible in measure of unworthy conduct became susceptible to shame not remorse hated valancourt who awakened to painful sensation in proportion a grew dissatisfied with abhorrence of increased be also more inveterate because tempered word manner be such a without accusing compelled to accuse left hope that odious portrait be caricature of prejudice afforded excuse for expressing violent resentment with contemplated at length anger rose to such height valancourt be compelled to leave house abruptly lest must forfeit own esteem by intemperate reply be then convinced that from madame montoni have nothing to hope for what of pity justice must be expected from person who must feel pain of guilt without humility of repentance to montoni looked with equal despondency since be nearly evident that plan of separation originated with be not probable that must relinquish own view to entreaty remonstrance must have foreseen have be prepared to resist yet remembering promise to emily more solicitous concerning love than jealous of consequence valancourt be careful to hing might unnecessarily irritate montoni wrote to therefore not to demand interview to solicit one having done endeavoured to wait with calmness reply madame clairval be passive in affair when gave approbation to valancourts marriage be in belief that emily must be heiress of madame montonis fortune though upon nuptials of latter when perceived fallacy of expectation conscience have withheld from adopting measure to prevent union benevolence be not sufficiently active to impel towards step might now promote be on contrary secretly pleased that valancourt be released from engagement considered to be a inferior in point of fortune to merit a alliance be thought by montoni to be humiliating to beauty of emily though pride be wounded by rejection of member of family disdained to show resentment otherwise than by silence montoni in reply to valancourt said that a interview must neither remove objection of one overcome wish of other must serve only to produce useless altercation between therefore thought proper to refuse in consideration of policy suggested by emily of promise to valancourt restrained impulse urged to house of montoni to demand what have be denied to entreaty only repeated solicitation to see seconding with argument situation must suggest thus several day passed in remonstrance on one side inflexible denial on other for whether be fear shame hatred result from made montoni shun man have injured be peremptory in refusal be neither softened to pity by agony valancourts letter portrayed awakened to repentance of own injustice by strong remonstrance employed at length valancourts letter be returned unopened then in first moment of passionate despair forgot promise to emily except solemn one bound to avoid violence hastened to montonis chteau determined to see by other mean might be necessary montoni be denied valancourt when afterwards enquired for madame maamselle st aubert be absolutely refused admittance by servant not choosing to submit to contest with at length departed returning home in state of mind approaching to frenzy wrote to emily of what have passed expressed without restraint agony of heart entreated that since must not otherwise hope to see immediately must allow interview unknown to montoni soon after have dispatched passion becoming more temperate be sensible of error have committed in having given emily new subject of distress in strong mention of own suffering must have given world have be to recover letter emily however be spared pain must have received from by suspicious policy of madame montoni who have ordered that letter addressed to niece must be delivered to who after having perused indulged expression of resentment valancourts mention of montoni provoked have consigned to flame montoni meanwhile day more impatient to leave france gave repeated order for dispatch to servant employed in preparation for journey to person with whom be transacting particular business preserved steady silence to letter in valancourt despairing of greater good having subdued passion have transgressed against policy solicited only indulgence of being allowed to bid emily farewell when valancourt learned that be really to set out in very few day that be designed must see more forgetting consideration of prudence dared in second letter to emily to propose clandestine marriage also be transmitted to madame montoni last day of emilys stay at thoulouse arrived without affording valancourt even line to sooth suffering hope that must be allowed parting interview during period of torturing suspense to valancourt emily be sunk into kind of stupor with sudden irremediable misfortune sometimes overwhelms mind loving with tenderest affection having long be accustomed to consider a friend companion of future day have idea of happiness be not connected with what then must have be suffering when thus suddenly be to be separated perhaps for ever certainly to be thrown into distant part of world where must scarcely hear of others existence in obedience to will of stranger for such a montoni of person who have lately be anxious to hasten nuptials be in vain that endeavoured to subdue grief resign to event must not avoid silence of valancourt afflicted more than surprised since attributed to just occasion when day preceding that on be to quit thoulouse arrived have heard mention of being permitted to take leave of grief overcame consideration have made reluctant to speak of enquired of madame montoni whether consolation have be refused aunt informed that have adding that after provocation have received from valancourt in last interview persecution signor have suffered from letter entreaty must avail to procure if chevalier expected favour from said must have conducted in very different manner must have waited patiently till knew whether be disposed to grant not have come reproved because did not think proper to bestow niece upon then have persisted in troubling signor because did not think proper to enter into dispute about so childish affair behaviour throughout have be extremely presumptuous impertinent desire may never hear name repeated that will get better of foolish sorrow whim look like other people not appear with dismal countenance a if be ready to cry for though say nothing can not conceal grief from penetration can see be ready to cry at moment though be reproving for aye even now in spite of command emily having turned away to hide tear quitted room to indulge day be passed in intensity of anguish such a have perhaps never known before when withdrew to chamber for night remained in chair where have placed on entering room absorbed in grief till long after member of family except herself be retired to rest must not divest herself of belief that have parted with valancourt to meet more belief did not arise merely from foreseen circumstance for though length of journey be about to commence uncertainty a to period of return together with prohibition have received seemed to justify yielded also to impression mistook for presentiment that be going from valancourt for ever how dreadful to imagination too be distance must separate themthe alp tremendous barrier must rise whole country extend between region where must exist to live in adjoining province to live even in same country though without seeing be comparative happiness to conviction of dreadful length of distance mind be at length so much agitated by consideration of state belief that have seen valancourt for last time that suddenly became very faint looking round chamber for something might revive observed casement have just strength to throw one open near seated air recalled spirit still moonlight fell upon elm of long avenue fronting window somewhat soothed determined to try whether exercise open air must not relieve intense pain bound temple in chteau be still passing down great staircase into hall from whence passage led immediately to garden softly unheard a thought unlocked door entered avenue emily passed on with step now hurried now faltering a deceived by shadow among tree fancied saw person move in distant perspective feared that be spy of madame montoni desire however to revisit pavilion where have passed so many happy hour with valancourt have admired with extensive prospect over languedoc native gascony overcame apprehension of being observed moved on towards terrace running along upper garden commanded whole of lower one communicated with by flight of marble step terminated avenue having reached step paused moment to look round for distance from chteau now increased fear stillness obscurity of hour have awakened perceiving nothing must justify ascended to terrace where moonlight showed long broad walk with pavilion at extremity while ray silvered foliage of high tree shrub bordered on right tufted summit of rose to level with balustrade on left from garden below distance from chteau again alarming paused to listen night be so calm that sound must have escaped heard only plaintive sweetness of nightingale with light shiver of leaf pursued way towards pavilion having reached obscurity did not prevent emotion that fuller view of well known scene must have excited lattice be thrown back showed beyond embowered arch moonlight landscape shadowy soft grove plain extending gradually indistinctly to eye distant mountain catching stronger gleam nearer river reflecting moon trembling to ray emily a approached lattice be sensible of feature of scene only a served to bring valancourt more immediately to fancy ah said with heavy sigh a threw into chair by window how often have sat together in spotoften have looked upon landscape never never more will view togethernevernever more perhaps will look upon other tear be suddenly stopped by terrora voice spoke near in pavilion shriekedit spoke again distinguished well known tone of valancourt be indeed valancourt who supported in arm for moment emotion must not suffer either to speak emily said valancourt at length a pressed hand in emily be again silent accent in have pronounced name

only chance remained to thank heaven have at length succeededi be not condemned to absolute despair emily said something scarcely knew what expressive of unalterable affection endeavoured to calm agitation of mind valancourt must for time only utter incoherent expression of emotion when be somewhat more composed said came hither soon after sunset have be watching in garden in pavilion ever since for though have now given up hope of seeing must not resolve to tear from place so near to must probably have lingered about chteau till morning dawned o how heavily moment have passed yet with what various emotion have be marked a sometimes thought heard footstep fancied be approaching then againperceived only dead dreary silence when opened door of pavilion darkness prevented distinguishing with certainty whether be lovemy heart beat so strongly with hope fear must not speak instant heard plaintive accent of voice doubt vanished not fear till spoke of then losing apprehension of alarming in excess of emotion must no longer be silent o emily be moment in joy grief struggle so powerfully for pre eminence that heart can scarcely support contest emilys heart acknowledged truth of assertion joy felt on thus meeting valancourt at very moment when be lamenting that must probably meet more soon melted into grief a reflection stole over thought imagination prompted vision of future struggled to recover calm dignity of mind be necessary to support through last interview valancourt found utterly impossible to attain for transport of joy changed abruptly into of suffering expressed in most impassioned language horror of separation despair of ever meeting again emily wept silently a listened to then trying to command own distress to sooth suggested circumstance must lead to hope energy of fear led instantly to detect friendly fallacy endeavoured to impose on also to conjure up illusion too powerful for reason be going from said to distant country o how distantto new society new friend new admirer with people too who will try to make forget to promote new connection how can know not know that will never return for menever can be mine voice be stifled by sigh believe then said emily that pang suffer proceed from trivial temporary interest believe suffer interrupted valancourt suffer for o emilyhow sweethow bitter be word what

from object of interest thus be that always feel revived a by new conviction when word tell be dear to wanting relapse into doubt too often into despondency then seeming to recollect exclaimed what wretch be thus to torture in moment too who ought to support comfort reflection overcame valancourt with tenderness relapsing into despondency again felt only for lamented again cruel separation in voice word so impassioned that emily must no longer struggle to repress own grief to sooth valancourt between emotion of love pity lost power almost wish of repressing agitation in interval of convulsive sob at one moment kissed away tear then told cruelly that possibly might never again weep for then tried to speak more calmly only exclaimed o emilymy heart will breaki cannotcannot leave

memory will be silenti can not can not leave why must confide happiness of whole life to will of people who have right to interrupt except in giving to have power to promote o emily venture to trust own heart venture to be mine for ever voice trembled be silent emily continued to weep be silent also when valancourt proceeded to propose immediate marriage at early hour on following morning must quit madame montonis house be conducted by to church of augustine where friar must await to unite silence with listened to proposal dictated by love despair enforced at moment when seemed scarcely possible for to oppose itwhen heart be softened by sorrow of separation might be eternal reason obscured by illusion of love terror encouraged to hope that must not be rejected speak emily said valancourt eagerly let hear voice let hear confirm fate spoke not cheek be cold sens seemed to fail did not faint to valancourts terrified imagination appeared to be dying called upon name rose to go to chteau for assistance then recollecting situation feared to go to leave for moment after few minute drew deep sigh began to revive conflict have suffered between love duty at present owed to father sister repugnance to clandestine marriage fear of emerging on world with embarrassment such a might ultimately involve object of affection in misery repentanceall various interest be too powerful for mind already enervated by sorrow reason have suffered transient suspension duty good sense however hard conflict at length triumphed over affection mournful presentiment above dreaded to involve valancourt in obscurity vain regret saw thought saw must be too certain consequence of marriage in present circumstance acted perhaps with somewhat more than female fortitude when resolved to endure present rather than provoke distant misfortune with candour proved how truly esteemed loved endeared to if possible more than ever told valancourt reason for rejecting proposal influenced concerning future welfare instantly refuted rather contradicted awakened tender consideration for frenzy of passion despair have concealed before love have lately prompted to propose clandestine immediate marriage now induced to renounce triumph be almost too much for heart for emilys sake endeavoured to stifle grief swelling anguish must not be restrained o emily said must leave youi must leave know be for ever convulsive sob again interrupted word wept together in silence till emily recollecting danger of being discovered impropriety of prolonging interview might subject to censure summoned fortitude to utter last farewell stay said valancourt conjure stay for have much to tell agitation of mind have hitherto suffered to speak only on subject occupied iti have forborne to mention doubt of much importance partly lest must appear a if told with ungenerous view of alarming into compliance with late proposal emily much agitated did not leave valancourt led from pavilion a walked upon terrace proceeded a follows montoni have heard strange hint concerning be certain be of madame quesnels family that fortune be what appears to be have reason to doubt replied emily in voice of alarm of first indeed can not doubt have certain mean of judging of latter entreat will tell have heard that certainly will be very imperfect unsatisfactory information gathered by accident from italian who be speaking to person of montoni be talking of marriage italian said that if be person meant be not likely to make madame cheron happy proceeded to speak of in general term of dislike then gave particular hint concerning character excited curiosity ventured to ask few question be reserved in reply after hesitating for time owned that have understood abroad that montoni be man of desperate fortune character said something of castle of montonis situated among apennines of strange circumstance might be mentioned a to former mode of life pressed to inform further believe strong interest felt be visible in manner alarmed for entreaty must prevail with to give explanation of circumstance have alluded to to mention anything further concerning montoni observed to that if montoni be possessed of castle in apennines appeared from such circumstance that be of family also seemed to contradict report that be man of entirely broken fortune shook head looked a if must have said great deal made reply hope of learning something more satisfactory more positive detained in company considerable time renewed subject repeatedly italian wrapped up in reserve saidthat what have mentioned have caught only from floating report that report frequently arose from personal malice be very little to be depended upon forbore to press subject farther since be obvious that be alarmed for consequence of what have already said be compelled to remain in uncertainty on point where suspense be almost intolerable think emily what must suffer to see depart for foreign country committed to power of man of such doubtful character a be montoni will not alarm unnecessarilyit be possible a italian said at first that be not montoni alluded to yet emily consider well before resolve to commit

montoni be more especially reserved be not reserve of respect so much a of pride discontent of emily took little notice with cavigni conversation be commonly on political military topic such a convulsed state of country rendered at time particularly interesting emily observed that at mention of daring exploit montonis eye lost sullenness seemed instantaneously to gleam with fire yet still retained somewhat of lurking cunning sometimes thought that fire partook more of glare of malice than brightness of valour though latter must well have harmonised with high chivalric air of figure in cavigni with gay gallant manner be inferior on entering milanese gentleman exchanged french hat for italian cap of scarlet cloth embroidered emily be somewhat surprised to observe montoni added to military plume while cavigni retained only feather be usually worn with such cap at length concluded that montoni assumed ensign of soldier for convenience a mean of passing with more safety through

raising spear then letting down again suddenly while of officer who be riding at distance from troop came up to carriage saluted montoni a old acquaintance captain soon after arriving band halted

plume towering on cap armorial coat persian sash ancient spanish cloak utaldo telling montoni that army be going to encamp for night near village at only few mile distance invited to turn back partake of festivity assuring lady also that must be pleasantly accommodated montoni excused adding that be design to reach verona that evening after conversation concerning state of country towards that city

indeed appear to extend from venice along whole line of enchanting shore river be gay with boat passing to city exhibiting fantastic diversity of masquerade in dress of people within towards evening group of dancer frequently be seen beneath tree cavigni meanwhile informed her of name of nobleman to whom several villa passed belonged adding light sketch of character such a served to amuse rather than to inform exhibiting own wit instead of delineation of truth emily be sometimes diverted by conversation gaiety did not entertain madame montoni a have formerly done be frequently grave montoni retained usual reserve nothing must exceed emilys admiration on first view of venice with islet palace tower rising out of sea whose clear surface reflected tremulous picture in colour sun sinking in

house with surprise remembered report of being man of broken fortune with astonishment ah said to herself if valancourt must see mansion what peace must give must then be convinced that report be groundless madame montoni seemed to assume air of princess montoni be restless discontented did not even observe civility of bidding welcome to home soon after arrival ordered gondola with cavigni went out to mingle in scene of evening madame then became serious thoughtful emily who be charmed with everything saw endeavoured to enliven reflection have not with madame montoni subdued caprice ill

returning to shore proposal orsino eagerly seconded count other gentleman a warmly opposed montoni still meditated how might excuse from longer attendance upon count for to only thought excuse

bright moonlight discovered city with terrace tower stranger must almost have credited fabled wonder of neptune court believed that tumult arose from beneath wave landed at st mark where gaiety of colonnade beauty of night made madame montoni willingly submit to count solicitation to join promenade afterwards to take supper with rest of party at casino if anything must have dissipated emilys uneasiness must have be grandeur gaiety novelty of surrounding scene adorned with palladio palace busy with party of masquerader at length withdrew to casino be fitted up with infinite taste where splendid banquet be prepared here emilys reserve made count perceive that be necessary for interest to win favour of madame montoni from condescension have already shown to appeared to be achievement of great difficulty transferred therefore part of attention from emily to aunt who felt too much flattered by distinction even to disguise emotion before party broke up have entirely engaged esteem of madame montoni whenever addressed ungracious countenance relaxed into smile to whatever proposed assented invited with rest of party to take coffee in box at opera on following evening emily heard invitation accepted with strong anxiety concerning mean of excusing from attending madame montoni thither be very late before gondola be ordered emilys surprise be extreme when on quitting casino beheld broad sun rising out of adriatic while st mark place be yet crowded with company sleep have long weighed heavily on eye now fresh sea breeze revived must have quitted scene with regret have not count be present performing duty have imposed upon of escorting home there heard that montoni be not yet returned wife retiring in displeasure to apartment at length released emily from fatigue of further attendance montoni came home late in morning in very ill humour having lost considerably at play before withdrew to rest have private conference with cavigni whose manner on following day seemed to tell that subject of have not be pleasing to in evening madame montoni who during day have observed sullen silence towards husband received visit from venetian lady with whose sweet manner emily be particularly charmed have air of ease kindness towards stranger a if have be familiar friend for year conversation be by turn tender sentimental gay madame though have taste for such conversation whose coarseness selfishness sometimes exhibited ludicrous contrast to excessive refinement must not remain wholly insensible to captivation of manner in pause of conversation lady who be called signora herminia took up lute began to play sing with a much easy gaiety a if have be alone voice be uncommonly rich in tone various in expression yet appeared to be entirely unconscious of power meant nothing le than to display sung from gaiety of heart a sat with veil half thrown back holding gracefully lute under spreading foliage flower of plant rose from basket interlaced one of lattice of saloon emily retiring little from company sketched figure with miniature scenery around drew very interesting picture though must not perhaps have borne criticism have spirit taste enough to awaken fancy heart when have finished presented to beautiful original who be delighted with offering a well a sentiment conveyed assured emily with smile of captivating sweetness that must preserve a pledge of friendship in evening cavigni joined lady montoni have other engagement embarked in gondola for st mark where same gay company seemed to flutter a on preceding night cool breeze glassy sea gentle sound of wave sweeter murmur of distant music lofty portico arcade happy group sauntered beneath with feature circumstance of scene united to charm emily no longer teased by officious attention of count morano a looked upon moonlight sea undulating along wall of st mark lingering for moment over wall caught sweet melancholy song of gondolier a sat in boat below waiting for master softened mind returned to memory of home of friend of be dear in native country after walking time sat down at door of casino while cavigni be accommodating with coffee ice be joined by count morano sought emily with look of impatient delight who remembering attention have shown on preceding evening be compelled a before to shrink from assiduity into timid reserve except when conversed with signora herminia other lady of party be near midnight before withdrew to opera where emily be not so charmed that when remembered scene have just quitted felt how infinitely inferior splendour of art be to sublimity of nature heart be not now affected tear of admiration did not start to eye a when viewed vast expanse of ocean grandeur of heaven listened to rolling water to faint music at interval mingled with roar remembering scene before faded into insignificance of evening passed on without particular incident wished conclusion that might escape from attention of count a opposite quality frequently attract other in thought thus emily when looked on count morano remembered valancourt sigh sometimes followed recollection several week passed in course of customary visit during nothing remarkable occurred emily be amused by manner scene surrounded so different from of france where count morano too frequently for comfort contrived to introduce manner figure accomplishment be generally admired emily must perhaps have admired also have heart be disengaged from valancourt have count forborne to persecute with officious attention during observed trait in character prejudiced against might otherwise be good in soon after arrival at venice montoni received packet from m quesnel in latter mentioned death of wife uncle at villa on brenta that in consequence of event must hasten to take possession of estate of other effect bequeathed to uncle be brother of madame quesnels late mother montoni be related to by father side though must have have claim expectation concerning possession must scarcely conceal envy m quesnels letter excited emily have observed with concern since left france montoni have not even affected kindness towards aunt that after treating at first with neglect now met with uniform ill humour reserve have never supposed that aunt foible must have escaped discernment of montoni that mind figure be of kind to deserve attention surprise therefore at match have be extreme since have made choice did not suspect that must so openly have discovered contempt of montoni who have be allured by seeming wealth of madame cheron be now severely disappointed by comparative poverty highly exasperated by deceit have employed to conceal till concealment be no longer necessary have be deceived in affair wherein meant to be deceiver out witted by superior cunning of woman whose understanding despised to whom have sacrificed pride liberty without saving from ruin have impended over head madame montoni have contrived to have greatest part of what really did posse settled upon what remained though be totally inadequate to husband expectation to necessity have converted into money brought with to venice that might little longer delude society make last effort to regain fortune have lost hint have be thrown out to valancourt concerning montonis character condition be too true be now left to time occasion to unfold circumstance of what have of what have not be hinted to time occasion commit madame montoni be not of nature to bear injury with meekness to resent with dignity exasperated pride displayed in violence acrimony of little at least of ill regulated mind must not acknowledge even to herself that have in degree provoked contempt by duplicity weakly persisted in believing that alone be to be pitied montoni alone to be censured for a mind have naturally little perception of moral obligation seldom understood force when happened to be violated towards vanity have already be severely shocked by discovery of montonis contempt remained to be farther reproved by discovery of circumstance mansion at venice though furniture discovered part of truth to unprejudiced person told nothing to who be blinded by resolution to believe wished madame montoni still thought little le than princess possessing palace at venice castle among apennines to castle di udolpho indeed montoni sometimes talked of going for few week to examine into condition to receive rent for appeared that have not be there for two year that during period have be inhabited only by old servant whom called steward emily listened to mention of journey with pleasure for not only expected from new idea release from persevering assiduity of count morano in country too must have leisure to think of valancourt to indulge melancholy image recollection of scene of la valle always blessed with memory of parent awakened ideal scene be dearer more soothing to heart than splendour of gay assembly be kind of talisman expelled poison of temporary evil supported hope of happy day appeared like beautiful landscape lighted up by gleam of sunshine seen through perspective of dark rugged rock count morano did not long confine to silent assiduity declared passion to emily made proposal to montoni who encouraged though emily rejected with montoni for friend abundance of vanity to delude did not despair of success emily be astonished highly disgusted at perseverance after have explained sentiment with frankness must not allow to misunderstand now passed greater part of time at montonis dining there almost daily attending madame emily wherever went notwithstanding uniform reserve of emily whose aunt seemed a anxious a montoni to promote marriage must never dispense with attendance at assembly where count proposed to be present montoni now said nothing of intended journey of emily waited impatiently to hear be seldom at home when count signor orsino be there for between cavigni coolness seemed to subsist though latter remained in house with orsino montoni be frequently closeted for hour together might be business upon consulted appeared to be of consequence since montoni often sacrificed to favourite passion for play remained at home whole night there be somewhat of privacy too in manner of orsinos visit have never before occurred excited not only surprise degree of alarm in emilys mind who have unwillingly discovered much of character when have most endeavoured to disguise after visit montoni be often more thoughtful than usual sometimes deep working of mind entirely abstracted from surrounding object threw gloom over visage rendered terrible at others eye seemed almost to flash fire energy of soul appeared to be roused for great enterprise emily observed written character of thought with deep interest not without degree of awe when considered that be entirely in power forbore even to hint fear observation to madame montoni who discerned nothing in husband at time usual sternness second letter from m quesnel announced arrival of lady at villa miarenti stated several circumstance of good fortune respecting affair have brought into italy concluded with earnest request to see montoni wife niece at new estate emily received about same period much more interesting letter soothed for while anxiety of heart valancourt hoping might be still at venice have trusted letter to ordinary post told of health of unceasing anxious affection have lingered at thoulouse for time after departure that might indulge melancholy pleasure of wandering through scene where have be accustomed to behold have thence gone to brother chteau be in neighbourhood of la valle having mentioned added if duty of attending regiment did not require departure know not when must have resolution enough to quit neighbourhood of place be endeared by remembrance of vicinity to la valle have alone detained thus long at estuvire frequently ride thither early in morning may wander at leisure through day among scene be once home where have be accustomed to see to hear converse have renewed acquaintance with good old theresa who rejoiced to see that might talk of need not say how much circumstance attached to how eagerly listened to upon favourite subject will guess motive that first induced to make known to theresa be indeed other than of gaining admittance into chteau garden emily have so lately inhabited here then wander meet image under shade chiefly love to sit beneath spreading branch of favourite plane where once emily sat together where first ventured to tell that loved emily remembrance of moment overcomes mei sit lost in reveriei endeavour to see dimly through tear in heaven of peace innocence such a then appeared to to hear again accent of voice then thrilled heart with tenderness hope lean on wall of terrace where together watched rapid current of garonne below while described wild scenery about source thought only of o emily be moment passed for everwill never more return in part of letter wrote thus see letter be dated on many different day if look back to first will perceive began to write soon after departure from france to write be indeed only employment that withdrew from own melancholy rendered absence supportable rather seemed to destroy absence for when be conversing with on paper telling sentiment affection of heart almost appeared to be present employment have be from time to time chief consolation have deferred sending off packet merely for comfort of prolonging though be certain that what have written be written to purpose till received whenever mind have be more than usually depressed have come to pour forth sorrow to have always found consolation when little occurrence have interested heart given gleam of joy to spirit have hastened to communicate to have received reflected satisfaction thus letter be kind of picture of life of thought for last month thus though have be deeply interesting to while wrote dare hope will for same reason be not indifferent to yet to other reader must seem to abound only in frivolity thus be always when attempt to describe finer movement of heart for be too fine to be discerned can only be experienced be therefore passed over by indifferent observer while interested one feel that description be imperfect unnecessary except a may prove sincerity of writer sooth own suffering will pardon egotismfor be lover have just heard of circumstance entirely destroys fairy paradise of ideal delight will reconcile to necessity of returning to regiment for must no longer wander beneath beloved shade where have be accustomed to meet in thoughtla valle be let have reason to believe be without knowledge from what theresa told morning therefore mention circumstance shed tear while related that be going to leave service of dear mistress chteau where have lived so many happy year added without even letter from mademoiselle to soften news be mon quesnels doings dare say doe not even know what be going forward theresa added that have received letter from informing chteau be let that a service must no longer be required must quit place on day week when new tenant must arrive theresa have be surprised by visit from m quesnel time before receipt of letter who be accompanied by stranger viewed premise with much curiosity towards conclusion of letter be dated week after sentence valancourt add have received summons from regiment join without regret since be shut out from scene be so interesting to heart rode to la valle morning heard that new tenant be arrived that theresa be gone must not treat subject thus familiarly if did not believe to be uninformed of disposal of house for satisfaction have endeavoured to learn something of character fortune of tenant without success be gentleman say be can hear place a wandered round boundary appeared more melancholy to imagination than have ever seen wished earnestly to have got admittance might have taken leave of favourite plane tree thought of once more beneath shade forbore to tempt curiosity of stranger fishing house in wood however be still open to thither went passed hour can not even look back upon without emotion o emily surely be not separated for eversurely will live for other letter brought many tear to emilys eye tear of tenderness satisfaction on learning that valancourt be well that time absence have in degree effaced image from heart there be passage in letter particularly affected such a describing visit to la valle sentiment of delicate affection that scene have awakened be considerable time before mind be sufficiently abstracted from valancourt to feel force of intelligence concerning la valle that mon quesnel must let without even consulting on measure surprised shocked particularly a proved absolute authority thought entitled to exercise in affair be true have proposed before left france that chteau must be let during absence to economical prudence of have nothing to object committing what have be father villa to power caprice of stranger depriving herself of sure home must unhappy circumstance make look back to home a asylum be consideration made even then strongly oppose measure father too in last hour have received from solemn promise never to dispose of la valle considered a in degree violated if suffered place to be let be now evident with how little respect m quesnel have regarded objection how insignificant considered obstacle to pecuniary advantage appeared also that have not even condescended to inform montoni of step have taken since motive be evident for montonis concealing circumstance from if have be made known to displeased surprised chief subject of uneasiness werethe temporary disposal of la valle dismission of father old faithful servantpoor theresa said emily thou hadst not saved much in thy servitude for thou wast always tender towards poor believdst thou shouldst die in family where thy best year have be spent poor theresanow thou art turned out in thy old age to seek thy bread emily wept bitterly a thought passed over mind determined to consider what must be done for theresa to talk very explicitly to m quesnel on subject much feared that cold heart must feel only for determined also to enquire whether have made mention of affair in letter to montoni who soon gave opportunity sought by desiring that must attend in study have little doubt that interview be intended for purpose of communicating to part of m quesnels letter concerning transaction at la valle obeyed immediately montoni be alone have just be writing to mon quesnel said when emily appeared in reply to letter received from few day ago wished to talk to upon subject occupied part of also wished to speak with on topic sir said emily be subject of interest to undoubtedly rejoined montoni think must see in light do indeed will not bear other trust will agree with that objection founded on sentiment a call ought to yield to circumstance of solid advantage granting sir replied emily modestly of humanity ought surely to be attended to fear be now too late to deliberate upon plan must regret that be longer in power to reject be too late said montoni since be so be pleased to observe that submit to reason necessity without indulging useless complaint applaud conduct exceedingly more perhaps since discovers strength of mind seldom observable in sex when be older will look back with gratitude to friend who assisted in rescuing from romantic illusion of sentiment will perceive that be only snare of childhood must be vanquished moment escape from nursery have not closed letter may add few line to inform uncle of acquiescence will soon see for be intention to take with madame montoni in few day to miarenti can then talk over affair emily wrote on opposite page of paper a follows be now useless sir for to remonstrate upon circumstance of signor montoni informs that have written must have wished at least that affair have be concluded with le precipitation might have taught to subdue prejudice a signor call still linger in heart a be submit in point of prudence nothing certainly can be objected though submit have yet much to say on other point of subject when will have honour of seeing in meantime entreat will take care of theresa for sake of sir affectionate niece emily st aubert montoni smiled satirically at what emily have written did not object to withdrew to own apartment where sat down to begin letter to valancourt in related particular of journey arrival at venice described of most striking scene in passage over alp emotion on first view of italy manner character of people around few circumstance of montonis conduct avoided even naming count morano much more declaration have made since well knew how tremblingly alive to fear be real love how jealously watchful of circumstance may affect interest scrupulously avoided to give valancourt even slightest reason for believing have rival on following day count morano dined again at montonis be in uncommon flow of spirit emily thought there be somewhat of exultation in manner of addressing have never observed before endeavoured to repress by more than usual reserve cold civility of air now seemed rather to encourage than to depress appeared watchful of opportunity of speaking with alone more than once solicited emily always replied that must hear nothing from must be unwilling to repeat before whole company in evening madame montoni party went out upon sea a count led emily to zendaletto carried hand to lip thanked for condescension have shown emily in extreme surprise displeasure hastily withdrew hand concluded that have spoken ironically on reaching step of terrace observing by livery that be count zendaletto waited below while rest of party having arranged in gondola be moving on determined not to permit separate conversation wishing good evening returned to portico count followed to expostulate entreat montoni who then came out rendered solicitation unnecessary for without condescending to speak took hand led to zendaletto emily be not silent entreated montoni in low voice to consider impropriety of circumstance that must spare mortification of submitting to however be inflexible caprice be intolerable said will not be indulged there be impropriety in case at moment emilys dislike of count morano rose to abhorrence that must with undaunted assurance thus pursue notwithstanding have expressed on subject of address think a be evident did that opinion of be of consequence so long a pretension be sanctioned by montoni added indignation to disgust have felt towards be somewhat relieved by observing that montoni be to be of party who seated on one side of while morano placed on other there be pause for moment a gondolieri prepared oar emily trembled from apprehension of discourse might follow silence at length collected courage to break in hope of preventing fine speech from morano reproof from montoni to trivial remark made latter returned short disobliging reply morano immediately followed with general observation contrived to end with particular compliment though emily passed without even notice of smile be not discouraged have be impatient said addressing emily to express gratitude to thank for goodness must also thank signor montoni who have allowed opportunity of doing so emily regarded count with look of mingled astonishment displeasure why continued must wish to diminish delight of moment by air of cruel reservewhy seek to throw again into perplexity of doubt by teaching eye to contradict kindness of late declaration can not doubt sincerity ardour of passion be therefore unnecessary charming emily surely unnecessary longer to attempt disguise of sentiment if ever have disguised sir said emily with recollected spirit must certainly be unnecessary longer to do so have hoped sir that must have spared farther necessity of alluding to since grant hear declare for last time that perseverance have deprived even of esteem be inclined to believe merited astonishing exclaimed montoni be beyond even expectation though have hitherto done justice to caprice of sex will observe mademoiselle emily that be lover though count morano be will not be made amusement of capricious moment here be offer of alliance must do honour to family yours will recollect be not noble long resisted remonstrance honour be now engaged will not be trifled withyou will adhere to declaration have made agent to convey to count must certainly mistake sir said emily answer on subject have be uniform be unworthy of to accuse of caprice if have condescended to be agent be honour did not solicit have constantly assured count morano also sir that never can accept honour offer now repeat declaration count looked with air of surprise enquiry at montoni whose countenance also be marked with surprise be surprise mingled with indignation here be confidence a well a caprice said latter will deny own word madam question be unworthy of answer sir said emily blushing will recollect be sorry that have asked speak to point rejoined montoni in voice of increasing vehemence will deny own word will deny that acknowledged only few hour ago that be too late to recede from engagement that accepted count hand will deny for word of mine ever imported astonishing will deny what wrote to mon quesnel uncle if do own hand will bear testimony against have now to say continued montoni observing silence confusion of emily now perceive sir that be under very great error have be equally mistaken more duplicity entreat be open candid if be possible have always be so sir can claim merit in such conduct for have have nothing to conceal how be signor cried morano with trembling emotion suspend judgment count replied wile of female heart be unsearchable now madame explanation excuse sir if withhold explanation till appear willing to give confidence assertion a present can only subject to insult explanation entreat said morano well well rejoined montoni give confidence let hear explanation let lead to then by asking question a many a please said montoni contemptuously what then be subject of letter to mon quesnel same be subject of note to certainly did well to stipulate for confidence before demanded that question must beg will be more explicit sir what be subject what must be noble offer of count morano said montoni then sir entirely misunderstood other replied emily entirely misunderstood other too suppose rejoined montoni in conversation preceded writing of note must do justice to own that be very ingenious at same art of misunderstanding emily tried to restrain tear came to eye to answer with becoming firmness allow sir to explain fully to be wholly silent explanation may now be dispensed with be anticipated if count morano still think one necessary will give honest one have changed intention since last conversation if can have patience humility enough to wait till tomorrow will probably find changed again a have patience humility expect from lover warn of effect of displeasure montoni be too precipitate said count who have listened to conversation in extreme agitation impatiencesignora entreat own explanation of affair signor montoni have said justly replied emily that explanation may now be dispensed with after have passed can not suffer to give one be sufficient for for sir that repeat late declaration let hope be last time will be necessary for to repeat iti never can accept honour of alliance charming emily exclaimed count in impassioned tone let not resentment make unjust let not suffer for offence of montonirevoke offence interrupted montonicount language be ridiculous submission be childishspeak a becomes man not a slave of pretty tyrant distract signor suffer to plead own cause have already proved insufficient to conversation on subject sir said emily be worse than useless since can bring only pain to of if must oblige pursue farther be impossible madam can thus easily resign object of passion be delight torment of lifei must still lovestill pursue with unremitting ardourwhen will be convinced of strength constancy of passion heart must soften into pity repentance be generous sir be manly can deserve obtain esteem solicit thus to continue persecution from have present mean of escaping gleam of moonlight fell upon moranos countenance revealed strong emotion of soul glancing on montoni discovered dark resentment contrasted feature by heaven be too much suddenly exclaimed count signor montoni treat ill be from that will look for explanation from sir will have muttered montoni if discernment be indeed so far obscured by passion a to make explanation necessary for madam must learn that man of honour be not to be trifled with though may perhaps with impunity treat boy like puppet sarcasm roused pride of morano resentment have felt at indifference of emily being lost in indignation of insolence of montoni determined to mortify by defending also said replying to montonis last word also will not pas unnoticed bid learn sir that have stronger enemy than woman to contend with will protect signora st aubert from threatened resentment have misled must revenge disappointed view upon innocent misled retorted montoni with quickness be conductmy wordthen pausing while seemed endeavouring to restrain resentment flashed in eye in next moment added in subdued voice count morano be language sort of conduct to be not accustomed be conduct of passionate boyas such pas over in contempt in contempt signor respect owe rejoined montoni requires must converse more largely with upon point of subject in dispute return with to venice will condescend to convince of error condescend sir will not condescend to be so conversed with montoni smiled contemptuously emily now terrified for consequence of what saw heard must no longer be silent explained whole subject upon have mistaken montoni in morning declaring that understood to have consulted solely concerning disposal of la valle concluding with entreating that must write immediately to m quesnel rectify mistake montoni be affected to be still incredulous count morano be still entangled in perplexity while be speaking however attention of auditor have be diverted from immediate occasion of resentment passion consequently became le montoni desired count must order servant to row back to venice that might have private conversation with morano somewhat soothed by softened voice manner eager to examine into full extent of difficulty complied emily comforted by prospect of release employed present moment in endeavouring with conciliating care to prevent fatal mischief between person who so lately have persecuted insulted spirit revived when heard once more voice of song laughter resounding from grand canal at length entered again between stately piazza zendaletto stopped at montonis mansion count hastily led into hall where montoni took arm said something in low voice on morano kissed hand held notwithstanding emilys effort to disengage wishing good evening with accent look must not misunderstand returned to zendaletto with montoni emily in own apartment considered with intense anxiety unjust tyrannical conduct of montoni dauntless perseverance of morano own desolate situation removed from friend country looked in vain to valancourt confined by profession to distant kingdom a protector gave comfort to know that there be at least one person in world who must sympathise in affliction whose wish must fly eagerly to release yet determined not to give unavailing pain by relating reason have to regret having rejected better judgment concerning montoni reason however must not induce to lament delicacy disinterested affection have made reject proposal for clandestine marriage approaching interview with uncle regarded with degree of hope for determined to represent to distress of situation to entreat that must allow to return to france with madame quesnel then suddenly remembering that beloved la valle only home be no longer at command tear flowed anew feared that have little pity to expect from man who like m quesnel must dispose of without deigning to consult with must dismiss aged faithful servant destitute of support asylum though be certain that have no longer home in france few very few friend there determined to return if possible that might be released from power of montoni whose particularly oppressive conduct towards general character a to others be justly terrible to imagination have wish to reside with uncle m quesnel since behaviour to late father to herself have be uniformly such a to convince that in flying to must only obtain exchange of oppressor have slightest intention of consenting to proposal of valancourt for immediate marriage though must give lawful generous protector for chief reason have formerly influenced conduct still existed against while others seemed to justify step must not be done away interest fame be at time too dear to to suffer to consent to union at early period of life must probably defeat one sure proper asylum however must still be open to in france knew that must board in convent where have formerly experienced so much kindness have affecting solemn claim upon heart since contained remains of late father here must remain in safety tranquillity till term for la valle might be let must expire till arrangement of m mottevilles affair enabled so far to estimate remains of fortune a to judge whether must be prudent for to reside there concerning montonis conduct with respect to letter to m quesnel have many doubt however might be at first mistaken on subject much suspected that wilfully persevered in error a mean of intimidating into compliance with wish of uniting to count morano whether be be not fact be extremely anxious to explain affair to m quesnel looked forward with mixture of impatience hope fear to approaching visit on following day madame montoni being alone with emily introduced mention of count morano by expressing surprise that have not joined party on water preceding evening at abrupt departure to venice emily then related what have passed expressed concern for mutual mistake have occurred between montoni solicited aunt kind office in urging to give decisive denial to count further address soon perceived that madame montoni have not be ignorant of late conversation when introduced present have encouragement to expect from said aunt in notion have already given opinion on subject think signor montoni right in enforcing by mean consent if young person will be blind to interest obstinately oppose why greatest blessing can have be friend who will oppose folly pray what pretension of kind do think have to match a be now offered not madam replied emily therefore at least suffer to be happy in humility nay niece can not be denied that have pride enough poor brother father have share of pride too though let add fortune did not justify emily somewhat embarrassed by indignation malevolent allusion to

many happy evening when with st aubert have observed shade of twilight steal over scene a beautiful a from garden of la valle tear fell to memory of father spirit be softened into melancholy by influence of hour by low murmur of wave passing under vessel stillness of air trembled only at interval with distant musicwhy else must at moment have looked on attachment to valancourt with presage

retraced by looked upon count morano with horror a in degree cause of apart from conviction if such may be called arises from proof knew not how to account for seized mindthat must never see valancourt again though knew that moranos solicitation montonis command have lawful power to enforce obedience regarded with superstitious dread that must finally prevail lost in melancholy reverie shedding frequent tear emily be at length roused by montoni followed to cabin where refreshment be spread aunt be seated alone countenance of madame montoni be inflamed with resentment appeared to be consequence of conversation have held with husband who regarded with kind of sullen disdain preserved for time haughty silence montoni then spoke to emily of mon quesnel will not hope persist in disclaiming knowledge of subject of letter to have hoped sir that be no longer necessary for to disclaim said emily have hoped from silence that be convinced of error have hoped impossibility then replied montoni might a reasonably have expected to find sincerity uniformity of conduct in one of sex a to convict of error in affair emily blushed be silent now perceived too clearly that have hoped impossibility for where mistake have be committed conviction must follow be evident that montonis conduct have not be consequence of mistake of design anxious to escape from conversation be afflicting humiliating to soon returned to deck resumed station near stern without apprehension of cold for vapour rose from water air be dry tranquil here at least benevolence of nature allowed quiet montoni have denied elsewhere be now past midnight star shed kind of twilight served to show dark outline of shore on hand grey surface of river till moon rose from behind high palm grove shed mellow lustre over scene vessel glided smoothly on amid stillness of hour emily heard now then solitary voice of barge men on bank a spoke to horse while from remote part of vessel with melancholy song sailor soothd beneath trembling moon midnight wave emily meanwhile anticipated reception by mon madame quesnel considered what must say on subject of la valle then to withhold mind from more anxious topic tried to amuse by discriminating faint drawn feature of landscape reposing in moonlight while fancy thus wandered saw at distance building peeping between moonlight tree a barge approached heard voice speaking soon distinguished lofty portico of villa overshadowed by grove of pine sycamore recollected to be same have formerly be pointed out to a belonging to madame quesnels relative barge stopped at flight of marble step led up bank to lawn light appeared between pillar beyond portico montoni sent forward servant then disembarked with family found mon madame quesnel with few friend seated on sofa in portico enjoying cool breeze of night eating fruit ice while of servant at little distance on river bank be performing simple serenade emily be now accustomed to way of living in warm country be not surprised to find mon madame quesnel in portico two hour after midnight usual salutation being over company seated in portico refreshment be brought from adjoining hall where banquet be spread servant attended when bustle of meeting have subsided emily have recovered from little flutter into have thrown spirit be struck with singular beauty of hall so perfectly accommodated to luxury of season be of white marble roof rising into open cupola be supported by column of same material two opposite side of apartment terminating in open portico admitted to hall full view of garden of river scenery in centre fountain continually refreshed air seemed to heighten fragrance breathed from surrounding orangery while dashing water gave agreeable soothing sound etruscan lamp suspended from pillar diffused brilliant light over interior part of hall leaving remoter portico to softer lustre of moon mon quesnel talked apart to montoni of own affair in usual strain of self importance boasted of new acquisition then affected to pity disappointment montoni have lately sustained meanwhile latter whose pride at least enabled to despise such vanity a whose discernment at once detected under assumed pity frivolous malignity of quesnels mind listened to in contemptuous silence till named niece then left portico walked away into garden emily however still attended to madame quesnel who spoke of france for even name of native country be dear to found pleasure in looking at person who have lately be in that country too be inhabited by valancourt listened to mention of with faint hope that also must be named madame quesnel who when be in france have talked with rapture of italy now that be in italy talked with equal praise of france endeavoured to excite wonder envy of auditor by account of place have not be happy enough to see in description not only imposed upon upon for never thought present pleasure equal to one be passed thus delicious climate fragrant orangery luxury surrounded slept unnoticed while fancy wandered over distant scene of northern country emily listened in vain for name of valancourt madame montoni spoke in turn of delight of venice of pleasure expected from visiting fine castle of montoni on apennine latter mention at least be merely retaliating boast for emily well knew that aunt have taste for solitary grandeur particularly for such a castle of udolpho promised thus party continued to converse a far a civility must permit to torture other by mutual boast while reclined on sofa in portico be environed with delight from nature art by honest mind must have be tempered to benevolence happy imagination must have be soothed into enchantment dawn soon after trembled in eastern horizon light tint of morning gradually expanding showed beautifully declining form of italian mountain gleaming landscape stretched at foot then sunbeam shooting up from behind hill spread over scene fine saffron tinge seems to impart repose to touch landscape no longer gleamed glowing colour be revealed except remoter feature be still softened united in mist of distance whose sweet effect be heightened to emily by dark verdure of pine cypress over arched foreground of river market people passing with boat to venice now formed moving picture on brenta most of have little painted awning to shelter owner from sunbeam together with pile of fruit flower displayed beneath tasteful simplicity of peasant girl who watched rural treasure rendered gay striking object swift movement of boat down current quick glance of oar in water now then passing chorus of peasant who reclined under sail of little bark tone of rustic instrument played by girl a sat near sylvan cargo heightened animation festivity of scene when montoni m quesnel have joined lady party left portico for garden where charming scenery soon withdrew emilys thought from painful subject majestic form rich verdure of cypress have never seen so perfect before grove of cedar lemon orange spiry cluster of pine poplar luxuriant chesnut oriental plane threw pomp of shade over garden while bower of flowering myrtle other spicy shrub mingled fragrance with of flower whose vivid various colouring glowed with increased effect beneath contrasted umbrage of grove air also be continually refreshed by rivulet with more taste than fashion have be suffered to wander among green recess emily often lingered behind party to contemplate distant landscape closed vista that gleamed beneath dark foliage of foregroundthe spiral summit of mountain touched with purple tint broken steep above shelving gradually to base open valley marked by formal line of art tall grove of cypress pine poplar sometimes embellished by ruined villa whose broken column appeared between branch of pine seemed to droop over fall from other part of garden character of view be entirely changed fine solitary beauty of landscape shifted for crowded feature varied colouring of inhabitation sun be now gaining fast upon sky party quitted garden retired to repose chapter iv poor misfortune feel lash of vice thomson emily seized first opportunity of conversing alone with mon quesnel concerning la valle answer to enquiry be concise delivered with air of man who be conscious of possessing absolute power impatient of hearing questioned declared that disposal of place be necessary measure that might consider indebted to prudence for even small income remained for however added when venetian count have forgot name marries present disagreeable state of dependence will cease a relation to rejoice in circumstance be so fortunate for may add so unexpected by friend for moment emily be chilled into silence by speech when attempted to undeceive concerning purport of note have inclosed in montonis letter appeared to have private reason for disbelieving assertion for considerable time persevered in accusing of capricious conduct being at length however convinced that really disliked morano have positively rejected suit resentment be extravagant expressed in term equally pointed inhuman for secretly flattered by prospect of connection with nobleman whose title have affected to forget be incapable of feeling pity for suffering of niece might stand in way of ambition emily saw at once in manner difficulty awaited though oppression must have power to make renounce valancourt for morano fortitude now trembled at encounter with violent passion of uncle opposed turbulence indignation only by mild dignity of superior mind gentle firmness of conduct served to exasperate still more resentment since compelled to feel own inferiority when left declared that if persisted in folly montoni must abandon to contempt of world calmness have assumed in presence failed emily when alone wept bitterly called frequently upon name of departed father whose advice to from death bed then remembered ala said do indeed perceive how much more valuable be strength of fortitude than grace of sensibility will also endeavour to fulfil promise then made will not indulge in unavailing lamentation will try to endure with firmness oppression can not elude somewhat soothed by consciousness of performing part of st auberts last request of endeavouring to pursue conduct must have approved overcame tear when company met at dinner have recovered usual serenity of countenance in cool of evening lady took fresco along bank of brenta in madame quesnels carriage state of emilys mind be in melancholy contrast with gay group assembled beneath shade that overhung enchanting stream be dancing under tree others reclining on grass taking ice coffee calmly enjoying effect of beautiful evening on luxuriant landscape emily when looked at snow capped apennines ascending in distance thought of montonis castle suffered terror lest must convey thither for purpose of enforcing obedience thought vanished when considered that be a much in power at venice a must be elsewhere be moonlight before party returned to villa where supper be spread in airy hall have so much enchanted emilys fancy on preceding night lady seated in portico till mon quesnel montoni other gentleman must join at table emily endeavoured to resign to tranquillity of hour presently barge stopped at step led into garden soon after distinguished voice of montoni quesnel then that of morano who in next moment appeared compliment received in silence cold air seemed at first to discompose soon recovered usual gaiety of manner though officious kindness of m madame quesnel emily perceived disgusted degree of attention have scarcely believed must be shown by m quesnel for have never before seen otherwise than in presence of inferior equal when must retire to own apartment mind almost involuntarily dwelt on most probable mean of prevailing with count to withdraw suit to liberal mind none appeared more probable than of acknowledging to prior attachment throwing upon generosity for release when however on following day renewed address shrunk from adoption of plan have formed there be something so repugnant to just pride in laying open secret of heart to man a morano in suing to for compassion that impatiently rejected design wondered that must have paused upon for moment rejection of suit repeated in most decisive term must select mingling with severe censure of conduct though count appeared mortified by persevered in most ardent profession of admiration till be interrupted emily released by presence of madame quesnel during stay at pleasant villa emily be thus rendered miserable by assiduity of morano together with cruelly exerted authority of m quesnel montoni who with aunt seemed now more resolutely determined upon marriage than have even appeared to be at venice m quesnel finding that argument menace be ineffectual in enforcing immediate conclusion to at length relinquished endeavour trusted to power of montoni to course of event at venice emily indeed looked to venice with hope for there must be relieved in measure from persecution of morano who must no longer be inhabitant of same house with from of montoni whose engagement must not permit to be continually at home amidst pressure of own misfortune did not forget of poor theresa for whom pleaded with courageous tenderness to quesnel who promised in slight general term that must not be forgotten in long conversation with m quesnel arranged plan to be pursued respecting emily m quesnel proposed to be at venice a soon a must be informed that nuptials be concluded be new to emily to part with person with whom be connected without feeling of regret moment however in took leave of m madame quesnel be perhaps only satisfactory one have known in presence morano returned in montonis barge emily a watched gradual approach to magic city saw at side only person who occasioned to view with le than perfect delight arrived there about midnight when emily be released from presence of count who with montoni went to casino be suffered to retire to own apartment on following day montoni in short conversation held with emily informed that must no longer be trifled with that since marriage with count must be so highly advantageous to folly only must object to folly of such extent a be incapable of conviction must be celebrated without further delay if be necessary without consent emily who have hitherto tried remonstrance have now recourse to supplication for distress prevented from foreseeing that with man of montonis disposition supplication must be equally useless afterwards enquired by what right exerted unlimited authority over question better judgment must have withheld in calmer moment from making since must avail nothing must afford montoni opportunity of triumphing over defenceless condition by what right cried montoni with malicious smile by right of will if can elude will not inquire by what right do so now remind for last time that be stranger in foreign country that be interest to make friend know mean if compel to become enemyi will venture to tell that punishment will exceed expectation may know be not to be trifled with emily continued for time after montoni have left in state of despair rather stupefaction consciousness of misery be remained in mind in situation madame montoni found at sound of whose voice emily looked up aunt somewhat softened by expression of despair that fixed countenance spoke in manner more kind than have ever yet done emilys heart be touched shed tear after weeping for time recovered sufficient composure to speak on subject of distress to endeavour to interest madame montoni in behalf though compassion of aunt have be surprised ambition be not to be overcome present object be to be aunt of countess emilys effort therefore be a unsuccessful a have be with montoni withdrew to apartment to think weep alone how often did remember parting scene with valancourt wish that italian have mentioned montonis character with le reserve when mind however have recovered from first shock of behaviour considered that must be impossible for to compel alliance with morano if persisted in refusing to repeat part of marriage ceremony persevered in resolution to await montonis threatened vengeance rather than give herself for life to man whom must have despised for present conduct have never even loved valancourt yet trembled at revenge thus resolved to brave affair however soon after occurred somewhat called off montonis attention from emily mysterious visit of orsino be renewed with more frequency since return of former to venice there be others also besides orsino admitted to midnight council among cavigni verezzi montoni became more reserved austere in manner than ever emily if own interest have not made regardless of might have perceived that something extraordinary be working in mind one night on council be not held orsino came in great agitation of spirit dispatched confidential servant to montoni who be at casino desiring that must return home immediately charging servant not to mention name montoni obeyed summons on meeting orsino be informed of circumstance occasioned visit visible alarm with part of be already acquainted venetian nobleman who have on late occasion provoked hatred of orsino have be way laid poniarded by hired assassin a murdered person be of first connection senate have taken up affair one of assassin be now apprehended who have confessed that orsino be employer in atrocious deed latter informed of danger have now come to montoni to consult on measure necessary to favour escape knew that at time officer of police be upon watch for over city to leave at present therefore be impracticable montoni consented to secrete for few day till vigilance of justice must relax then to assist in quitting venice knew danger incurred by permitting orsino to remain in house such be nature of obligation to man that did not think prudent to refuse asylum such be person whom montoni have admitted to confidence for whom felt a much friendship a be compatible with character while orsino remained concealed in house montoni be unwilling to attract public observation by nuptials of count morano obstacle be in few day overcome by departure of criminal visitor then informed emily that marriage be to be celebrated on following morning to repeated assurance that must not take place replied only by malignant smile telling that count priest must be at house early in morning advised further to dare resentment by opposition to will to own interest be now going out for evening said remember that will give hand to count morano in morning emily having ever since late threat expected that trial must at length arrive to crisis be le shocked by declaration that otherwise must have be endeavoured to support by belief that marriage must not be valid so long a refused before priest to repeat part of ceremony yet a moment of trial approached long harassed spirit shrunk almost equally from encounter of vengeance from hand of count morano be not even perfectly certain of consequence of steady refusal at altar trembled more than ever at power of montoni seemed unlimited a will for saw that must not scruple to transgress law if by so doing must accomplish project while mind be thus suffering in state little short of distraction be informed that morano asked permission to see servant have scarcely departed with excuse before repented that have sent one in next moment reverting to former design determining to try whether expostulation entreaty must not succeed where refusal just disdain have failed recalled servant sending different message prepared to go down to count dignity assumed composure with met kind of pensive resignation softened countenance be circumstance not likely to induce to relinquish serving a did to heighten passion have already intoxicated judgment listened to said with appearance of complacency of wish to oblige resolution remained invariably same endeavoured to win admiration by insinuating art so well knew how to practise being at length assured that have nothing to hope from justice repeated in solemn impressive manner absolute rejection of suit quitted with assurance that refusal must be effectually maintained against circumstance must be imagined for subduing just pride have restrained tear in presence now flowed from fulness of heart often called upon name of late father often dwelt with unutterable anguish on idea of valancourt did not go down to supper remained alone in apartment sometimes yielding to influence of grief terror at others endeavouring to fortify mind against to prepare to meet with composed courage scene of following morning when stratagem of morano violence of montoni must be united against evening be far advanced when madame montoni came to chamber with bridal ornament count have sent to emily have day purposely avoided niece perhaps because usual insensibility failed feared to trust with view of emilys distress possibly though conscience be seldom audible now reproached with conduct to brother orphan child whose happiness have be entrusted to care by dying father emily must not look at present made last though almost hopeless effort to interest compassion of madame montoni who if did feel degree of pity remorse successfully concealed reproached niece with folly in being miserable concerning marriage ought only to make happy be sure said if be unmarried count have proposed to must have be flattered by distinction if must have be so be sure niece who have fortune ought to feel highly honoured show proper gratitude humility towards count for condescension be often surprised must own to observe how humbly deports to notwithstanding haughty air give wonder have patience to humour so if be know must often be ready to reprehend make know little better must not have flattered can tell for be absurd flattery make fancy of so much consequence that think nobody can deserve often tell count so for have patience to hear pay such extravagant compliment believe word of patience madam can not suffer more cruelly on such occasion than own said emily o be mere affectation rejoined aunt know that flattery delight make so vain that think may have whole world at foot be very much mistaken can assure niece will not meet with many such suitor a count other person must have turned upon heel left to repent at leisure long ago o that count have resembled other person then said emily with heavy sigh be happy for that doe not rejoined madame montoni what be now saying be from pure kindness be endeavouring to convince of good fortune to persuade to submit to necessity with good grace be nothing to know whether like marriage not for must be what say therefore be from pure kindness wish to see happy be own fault if be not so must ask now seriously calmly what kind of match can expect since count can not content ambition have ambition madam replied emily only wish be to remain in present station o be speaking quite from purpose said aunt see be still thinking of mon valancourt pray get rid of fantastic notion about love ridiculous pride be something like reasonable creature however be nothing to purposefor marriage with count take place tomorrow know whether approve not count will be trifled with longer emily made attempt to reply to curious speech felt must be mean knew must be useless madame montoni laid count present upon table on emily be leaning then desiring must be ready early in morning bade good night good night madam said emily with deep sigh a door closed upon aunt be left once more to own sad reflection for time sat so lost in thought a to be wholly unconscious where be at length raising head looking round room gloom profound stillness awed fixed eye on door through aunt have disappeared listened anxiously for sound might relieve deep dejection of spirit be past midnight family except servant who sat up for montoni have retired to bed mind long harassed by distress now yielded to imaginary terror trembled to look into obscurity of spacious chamber feared knew not what state of mind continued so long that must have called up annette aunt woman have fear permitted to rise from chair to cross apartment melancholy illusion at length began to disperse retired to bed not to sleep for be scarcely possible to try at least to quiet disturbed fancy to collect strength of spirit sufficient to bear through scene of approaching morning chapter v dark power with shuddring meek submitted thought be mine to read vision old thy awakning bard have told lest meet blasted view hold strange tale devoutly true collins ode to fear emily be recalled from kind of slumber into have at length sunk by quick knocking at chamber door started up in terror for montoni count morano instantly came to mind having listened in silence for time recognising voice of annette rose opened door what brings hither so early said emily trembling excessively be unable to support sat down on bed dear maamselle said annette look so pale be quite frightened to see here be fine bustle below stair servant running to fro none of fast enough here be bustle indeed of sudden nobody know for what who be below besides said emily annette trifle with not for world maamselle must not trifle for world one can not help making one remark there be signor in such bustle a never saw before have sent to tell maam to get ready immediately good god support cried emily almost fainting count morano be below then maamselle be not below know of replied annette only excellenza sent to desire must get ready directly to leave venice for that gondola must be at step of canal in few minute must hurry back to lady who be just at wit end know not way to turn for haste explain annette explain meaning of before go said emily so overcome with surprise timid hope that have scarcely breath to speak nay maamselle be more than can do only know that signor be just come home in very ill humour that have have called out of bed tell be to leave venice immediately be count morano to go with signor said emily whither be going know maam for certain heard ludovico say something about going after get to terra firma to signor castle among mountain that talked of apennines said emily eagerly o then have little to hope be very place maam cheer up take so much to heart think what little time have to get ready in how impatient signor be holy st mark hear oar on canal now come nearer now be dashing at step below be gondola sure enough annette hastened from room emily prepared for unexpected flight a fast a trembling hand must permit not perceiving that change in situation must possibly be for worse have scarcely thrown book clothes into travelling trunk when receiving second summons went down to aunt dressing room where found montoni impatiently reproving wife for delay went out soon after to give further order to people emily then enquired occasion of hasty journey aunt appeared to be a ignorant a herself to undertake journey with more reluctance family at length embarked count morano cavigni be of party somewhat revived by observing emily when gondolieri dashed oar in water put off from step of portico felt like criminal who receives short reprieve heart beat yet lighter when emerged from canal into ocean lighter still when skimmed past wall of st mark without having stopped to take up count morano dawn now began to tint horizon to break upon shore of adriatic emily did not venture to ask question of montoni who sat for time in gloomy silence then rolled up in cloak a if to sleep while madame montoni did same emily who must not sleep undrew one of little curtain of gondola looked out upon sea rising dawn now enlightened mountain top of friuli lower side distant wave rolled at foot be still in deep shadow emily sunk in tranquil melancholy watched strengthening light spreading upon ocean showing successively venice islet shore of italy along boat with pointed latin sail began to move gondolieri be frequently hailed at early hour by market people a glided by towards venice lagune soon displayed gay scene of innumerable little bark passing from terra firma with provision emily gave last look to splendid city mind be then occupied by considering probable event awaited in scene to be removing with conjecture concerning motive of sudden journey appeared upon calmer consideration that montoni be removing to secluded castle because must there with more probability of success attempt to terrify into obedience must gloomy sequestered scene fail of effect forced marriage with count must there be solemnized with secrecy be necessary to honour of montoni little spirit reprieve have recalled now began to fail when emily reached shore mind have sunk into former depression montoni did not embark on brenta pursued way in carriage across country towards apennine during journey manner to emily be so particularly severe that alone must have confirmed late conjecture have such confirmation be necessary sens be now dead to beautiful country through travelled sometimes be compelled to smile at navet of annette in remark on what saw sometimes to sigh a scene of peculiar beauty recalled valancourt to thought who be indeed seldom absent from of whom must never hope to hear in solitude to be hastening at traveller began to ascend among apennines immense pine forest at period overhung mountain between road wound excluded view of cliff aspiring above except now then opening through dark wood allowed eye momentary glimpse of country below gloom of shade solitary silence except when breeze swept over summit tremendous precipice of mountain came partially to eye assisted to raise solemnity of emilys feeling into awe saw only image of gloomy grandeur of dreadful sublimity around other image equally gloomy equally terrible gleamed on imagination be going scarcely knew under dominion of person from whose arbitrary disposition have already suffered so much to marry perhaps man who possessed affection esteem to endure beyond hope of succour punishment revenge that italian revenge might dictatethe more considered what might be motive of journey more became convinced that be for purpose of concluding nuptials with count morano with secrecy resolute resistance have made necessary to honour if not to safety of montoni from deep solitude into be emerging from gloomy castle of have heard mysterious hint sick heart recoiled in despair experienced that though mind be already occupied by peculiar distress be still alive to influence of new local circumstance why else did shudder at idea of desolate castle a traveller still ascended among pine forest steep rose over steep mountain seemed to multiply a went what be summit of one eminence proved to be only base of at length reached little plain where driver stopped to rest mule whence scene of such extent magnificence opened below a drew even from madame montoni note of admiration emily lost for moment sorrow in immensity of nature beyond amphitheatre of mountain stretched below whose top appeared a numerous almost a wave of sea whose foot be concealed by forestsextended campagna of italy where city river wood glow of cultivation be mingled in gay confusion adriatic bounded horizon into po brenta after winding through whole extent of landscape poured fruitful wave emily gazed long on splendour of world be quitting of whole magnificence seemed thus given to sight only to increase regret on leaving for valancourt alone be in world to alone heart turned for alone fell bitter tear from sublime scene traveller continued to ascend among pine till entered narrow pas of mountain shut out feature of distant country in stead exhibited only tremendous crag impending over road where vestige of humanity even of vegetation appeared except here there trunk scathed branch of oak hung nearly headlong from rock into strong root have fastened pas led into heart of apennine at length opened to day scene of mountain stretched in long perspective a wild a traveller have yet passed still vast pine forest hung upon base crowned ridgy precipice rose perpendicularly from vale while above rolling mist caught sunbeam touched cliff with magical colouring of light shade scene seemed perpetually changing feature to assume new form a winding road brought to eye in different attitude while shifting vapour now partially concealing minuter beauty now illuminating with splendid tint assisted illusion of sight though deep valley between mountain be for most part clothed with pine sometimes abrupt opening presented perspective of only barren rock with cataract flashing from summit among broken cliff till water reaching bottom foamed along with unceasing fury sometimes pastoral scene exhibited green delight in narrow vale smiling amid surrounding horror there herd flock of goat sheep browsing under shade of hanging wood shepherd little cabin reared on margin of clear stream presented sweet picture of repose wild romantic a be scene character have far le of sublime have of alp guard entrance of italy emily be often elevated seldom felt emotion of indescribable awe have so continually experienced in passage over alp towards close of day road wound into deep valley mountain whose shaggy steep appeared to be inaccessible almost surrounded to east vista opened that exhibited apennines in darkest horror long perspective of retiring summit rising over other ridge clothed with pine exhibited stronger image of grandeur than emily have yet seen sun have just sunk below top of mountain be descending whose long shadow stretched athwart valley sloping ray shooting through opening of cliff touched with yellow gleam summit of forest that hung upon opposite steep streamed in full splendour upon tower battlement of castle spread extensive rampart along brow of precipice above splendour of illumined object be heightened by contrasted shade involved valley below there said montoni speaking for first time in several hour be udolpho emily gazed with melancholy awe upon castle understood to be montonis for though be now lighted up by setting sun gothic greatness of feature mouldering wall of dark grey stone rendered gloomy sublime object a gazed light died away on wall leaving melancholy purple tint spread deeper deeper a thin vapour crept up mountain while battlement above be still tipped with splendour from too ray soon faded whole edifice be invested with solemn duskiness of evening silent lonely sublime seemed to stand sovereign of scene to frown defiance on who dared to invade solitary reign a twilight deepened feature became more awful in obscurity emily continued to gaze till clustering tower be alone seen rising over top of wood beneath whose thick shade carriage soon after began to ascend extent darkness of tall wood awakened terrific image in mind almost expected to see bandit start up from under tree at length carriage emerged upon heathy rock soon after reached castle gate where deep tone of portal bell be struck upon to give notice of arrival increased fearful emotion have assailed emily while waited till servant within must come to open gate anxiously surveyed edifice gloom overspread allowed to distinguish little more than part of outline with massy wall of rampart to know that be vast ancient dreary from part saw judged of heavy strength extent of whole gateway before leading into court be of gigantic size be defended by two round tower crowned by overhanging turret embattled where instead of banner now waved long grass wild plant have taken root among mouldering stone seemed to sigh a breeze rolled past over desolation around tower be united by curtain pierced embattled also below appeared pointed arch of huge portcullis

openedit be caterina come to tell annette that lady wanted emily though now perceived who be must not immediately overcome terror while annette half laughing half cry scolded caterina heartily for thus alarming be also terrified lest what have told have be overheardemily whose mind be deeply impressed by chief circumstance of annettes relation be unwilling to be left alone in present state of spirit to avoid offending madame montoni betraying own weakness struggled to overcome illusion of fear dismissed annette for night when be alone thought recurred to strange history of signora laurentini then to own strange situation in wild solitary mountain of foreign country in castle power of man to whom only few preceding month be entire stranger who have already exercised usurped authority over whose character now regarded with degree of terror apparently justified by fear of others knew that have invention equal to conception talent to execution of project greatly feared have heart too void of feeling to oppose perpetration of interest might suggest have long observed unhappiness of madame montoni have often be witness to stern contemptuous behaviour received from husband to circumstance conspired to give just cause for alarm be now added thousand nameless terror exist only in active imagination set reason examination equally at defiance emily remembered that valancourt have told on eve of departure from languedoc respecting montoni that have said to dissuade from venturing on journey fear have often since appeared to propheticnow seemed confirmed heart a gave back image of valancourt mourned in vain regret reason soon came with consolation though feeble at first acquired vigour from reflection considered that might be suffering have withheld from involving in misfortune that future sorrow must be be at least free from self reproach melancholy be assisted by hollow sighings of wind along corridor round castle cheerful blaze of wood have long be extinguished sat with eye fixed on dying ember till loud gust swept through corridor shook door casement alarmed for violence have moved chair have placed a fastening door leading to private staircase stood half open curiosity fear be again awakened took lamp to top of step stood hesitating whether to go down again profound stillness gloom of place awed determining to enquire further when daylight might assist search closed door placed against stronger guard now retired to bed leaving lamp burning on table gloomy light instead of dispelling fear assisted for by uncertain ray almost fancied saw shape flit past curtain glide into remote obscurity of chamberthe castle clock struck one before closed eye to sleep chapter vi think be weakness of mine eye shape monstrous apparition come upon julius csar daylight dispelled from emilys mind gloom of superstition not of apprehension count morano be first image occurred to waking thought then came train of anticipated evil must neither conquer avoid rose to relieve mind from busy idea tormented compelled to notice external object from casement looked out upon wild grandeur of scene closed nearly on side by alpine steep whose top peeping over other faded from eye in misty hue while promontory below be dark with wood swept down to base stretched along narrow valley rich pomp of wood be particularly delightful to emily viewed with astonishment fortification of castle spreading along vast extent of rock now partly in decay grandeur of rampart below tower battlement various feature of fabric above from sight wandered over cliff wood into valley along foamed broad rapid stream seen falling among crag of opposite mountain now flashing in sunbeam now shadowed by over arching pine till be entirely concealed by thick foliage again burst from beneath darkness in one broad sheet of foam fell thundering into vale nearer towards west opened mountain vista emily have viewed with such sublime emotion on approach to castle thin dusky vapour rose from valley overspread feature with sweet obscurity a ascended caught sunbeam kindled into crimson tint touched with exquisite beauty wood cliff over passed to summit of mountain then a veil drew up be delightful to watch gleaming object that progressively disclosed in valleythe green turfdark woodslittle rocky recessesa few peasant hutsthe foaming streama herd of cattle various image of pastoral beauty then pine forest brightened then broad breast of mountain till at mist settled round summit touching with ruddy glow feature of vista now appeared distinctly broad deep shadow fell from lower cliff gave strong effect to streaming splendour above while mountain gradually sinking in perspective appeared to shelve into adriatic sea for such emily imagined to be gleam of bluish light terminated view thus endeavoured to amuse fancy be not unsuccessful breezy freshness of morning too revived raised thought in prayer felt always most disposed to do when viewing sublimity of nature mind recovered strength when turned from casement eye glanced upon door have so carefully guarded on preceding night now determined to examine whither led on advancing to remove chair perceived that be already moved little way surprise can not be easily imagined when in next minute perceived that door be fastenedshe felt a if have seen apparition door of corridor be locked a have left door must be secured only on outside must have be bolted during night became seriously uneasy at thought of sleeping again in chamber thus liable to intrusion so remote too a be from family determined to mention circumstance to madame montoni to request change after perplexity found way into great hall to room have left on preceding night where breakfast be spread aunt be alone for montoni have be walking over environs of castle examining condition of fortification talking for time with carlo emily observed that aunt have be weeping heart softened towards with affection showed in manner rather than in word while carefully avoided appearance of having noticed that be unhappy seized opportunity of montonis absence to mention circumstance of door to request that might be allowed apartment to enquire again concerning occasion of sudden journey on first subject aunt referred to montoni positively refusing to interfere in affair on last professed utter ignorance emily then with wish of making aunt more reconciled to situation praised grandeur of castle surrounding scenery endeavoured to soften unpleasing circumstance attending though misfortune have somewhat conquered asperity of madame montonis temper by increasing care for have taught to feel in degree for others capricious love of rule nature have planted habit have nourished in heart be not subdued must not now deny gratification of tyrannising over innocent helpless emily by attempting to ridicule taste must not feel satirical discourse be however interrupted by entrance of montoni countenance immediately assumed mingled expression of fear resentment while seated at breakfast table a if unconscious of there being person in room emily a observed in silence saw that countenance be darker sterner than usual o must know said to herself what pass in mind must know thought be known there must no longer be condemned to torturing suspense breakfast passed in silence till emily ventured to request that apartment might be allotted to related circumstance made wish have time to attend to idle whim said montoni that chamber be prepared for must rest contented with be not probable that person must take trouble of going to remote staircase for purpose of fastening door if be not fastened when entered chamber wind perhaps shook door made bolt slide know not why must undertake to account for so trifling occurrence explanation be by mean satisfactory to emily who have observed that bolt be rusted consequently must not be thus easily moved forbore to say so repeated request if will not release from slavery of fear said montoni sternly at least forbear to torment others by mention of conquer such whim endeavour to strengthen mind existence be more contemptible than be embittered by fear a said eye glanced upon madame montoni who coloured highly be still silent emily wounded disappointed thought fear be in instance too reasonable to deserve ridicule perceiving that however might oppress must endure tried to withdraw attention from subject carlo soon after entered with fruit excellenza be tired after long ramble said a set fruit upon table have more to see after breakfast there be place in vaulted passage leading to montoni frowned upon waved hand for to leave room carlo stopped looked down then added a advanced to breakfast table took up basket of fruit made bold excellenza to bring cherry here for honoured lady young mistress will ladyship taste madam said carlo presenting basket be very fine one though gathered from old tree catch south sun be a big a plum ladyship very well old carlo said madame montoni be obliged to young signora too may like of rejoined carlo turning with basket to emily will do good to see eat thank carlo said emily taking cherry smiling kindly come come said montoni impatiently enough of leave room be in waiting will want presently carlo obeyed montoni soon after went out to examine further into state of castle while emily remained with aunt patiently enduring ill humour endeavouring with much sweetness to soothe affliction instead of resenting effect when madame montoni retired to dressing room

by gateway through have passed on preceding evening grandeur of broad rampart changing scenery overlooked excited high admiration for extent of terrace allowed feature of country to be seen in such various point of view that appeared to form new landscape often paused to examine gothic magnificence of udolpho proud irregularity lofty tower battlement high arched casement slender watch tower perched upon corner of turret then must lean on wall of terrace shuddering measure with eye precipice below dark summit of wood arrested wherever turned appeared mountain top forest of pine narrow glen opening among apennines retiring from sight into inaccessible region while thus leaned montoni followed by two men appeared ascending winding path cut in rock below stopped upon cliff pointing to rampart turned to follower talked with much eagerness of gesticulationemily perceived that one of men be carlo other be in dress of peasant alone seemed to be receiving direction of montoni withdrew

enquired where orsino have concealed guest who except cavigni be ignorant that montoni have assisted to escape from venice replied that have fled in night with such precipitation secrecy that most

montoni considering that indiscretion of aunt might prove fatal to compelled to endure present inferior evil rather than to tempt future heavier one strange kind of presentiment frequently on day

in front military uniform became distinguishable commander riding first seeming by gesture to direct march of followed at length approached very near to castle such spectacle in solitary region surprised alarmed madame montoni hastened towards peasant who be employed in raising bastion before south rampart where rock be le abrupt than elsewhere men must give satisfactory answer to enquiry

niece did not approve for dreaded frown knew message must provoke obeyed in silence a drew near apartment in sat with guest heard in earnest loud dispute paused moment trembling at displeasure sudden interruption must occasion in next voice sunk together then ventured to open door while montoni turned hastily looked at without speaking delivered message tell madam montoni be engaged said emily then thought proper to mention subject of alarm montoni companion rose instantly went to window not affording view of troop at length proceeded to rampart where cavigni conjectured to be legion of condottieri on march towards modena one part of cavalcade now extended along valley wound among mountain towards north while troop still lingered on woody precipice where first have appeared so that great length of procession seemed to include whole army while montoni family watched progress heard sound of trumpet clash of cymbal in vale then others answering from height emily listened with emotion to shrill blast woke echo of mountain montoni explained signal with appeared to be well acquainted meant nothing hostile uniform of troop kind of arm bore confirmed to conjecture of cavigni have satisfaction to see pas by without even stopping to gaze upon castle did not however leave rampart till base of mountain have shut from view last murmur of trumpet floated away on wind cavigni verezzi be inspirited by spectacle seemed to have roused fire of temper montoni turned into castle in thoughtful silence emilys mind have not yet sufficiently recovered from late shock to endure loneliness of chamber remained upon rampart for madame montoni have not invited to dressing room whither have gone evidently in low spirit emily from late experience have lost wish to explore gloomy mysterious recess of castle rampart therefore be almost only retreat here lingered till grey haze of evening be again spread over scene cavalier supped by madame montoni remained in apartment whither emily went before retired to own found aunt weeping in much agitation tenderness of emily be naturally so soothing that seldom failed to give comfort to drooping heart madame montonis be torn softest accent of emilys voice be lost upon with usual delicacy did not appear to observe aunt distress gave involuntary gentleness to manner air of solicitude to countenance madame montoni be vexed to perceive who seemed to feel pity of niece to be insult to pride dismissed a soon a properly must emily did not venture to mention again reluctance felt to gloomy chamber requested that annette might be permitted to remain with till retired to rest request be somewhat reluctantly granted annette however be now with servant emily withdrew alone with light hasty step passed through long gallery while feeble glimmer of lamp carried only showed gloom around passing air threatened to extinguish lonely silence reigned in part of castle awed now then indeed heard faint peal of laughter rise from remote part of edifice where servant be assembled be soon lost kind of breathless stillness remained a passed suite of room have visited in morning eye glanced fearfully on door almost fancied heard murmuring sound within paused not moment to enquire having reached own apartment where blazing wood on hearth dissipated gloom sat down with book to enliven attention till annette must come fire must be kindled continued to read till light be nearly expired annette did not appear solitude obscurity of chamber again affected spirit more because of nearness to scene of horror that have witnessed in morning gloomy fantastic image came to mind looked fearfully towards door of staircase then examining whether be still fastened found that be so unable to conquer uneasiness felt at prospect of sleeping again in remote insecure apartment person seemed to have entered during preceding night impatience to see annette whom have bidden to enquire concerning circumstance became extremely painful wished also to question a to object have excited so much horror in own mind annette on preceding evening have appeared to be in part acquainted with though word be very remote from truth appeared plainly to emily that girl have be purposely misled by false report above be surprised that door of chamber contained must be left unguarded such instance of negligence almost surpassed belief light be now expiring faint flash threw upon wall called up terror of fancy rose to find way to habitable part of castle before be quite extinguished a opened chamber door heard remote voice soon after saw light issue upon further end of corridor annette servant approached be glad be come said emily what have detained so long pray light fire immediately lady wanted maamselle replied annette in confusion will go get wood said caterina be business left room instantly while annette must have followed being called back began to talk very loud laugh seemed afraid to trust pause of silence caterina soon returned with wood then when cheerful blaze once more animated room servant have withdrawn emily asked annette whether have made enquiry bade yes maamselle said annette not soul know anything about

in having for auditor for perceive believe dear maamselle will show very cannon can see from window well said emily that doe not prove that apparition guard what not if show very cannon dear maam will believe nothing nothing probably upon subject what see said emilywell maam will see if will only step way to casementemily must not forbear laughing annette looked surprised perceiving extreme aptitude to credit marvellous emily forbore to mention subject have intended lest must overcome with idle terror began to speak on lively topicthe regatta of venice aye maamselle rowing match said annette fine moonlight night be be worth seeing in venice to be sure moon be brighter than ever saw then to hear such sweet music too a ludovico have often often sung under lattice by west portico maamselle be ludovico that told about picture wanted so to look at last night what picture said emily wishing annette to explain o terrible picture with black veil over never saw then said emily who ino maamselle never did morning continued annette lowering voice looking round room morning a be broad daylight do know maam took strange fancy to see a have heard such odd hint about got a far a door must have opened if have not be locked emily endeavouring to conceal emotion circumstance occasioned enquired at what hour went to chamber found that be soon after have be there also asked further question answer convinced that annette probably informer be ignorant of terrible truth though in annettes account something very like truth now then mingled with falsehood emily now began to fear that visit to chamber have be observed since door have be closed so immediately after departure dreaded lest must draw upon vengeance of montoni anxiety also be excited to know whence for what purpose delusive report have be imposed upon annette have originated since montoni must only have wished for silence secrecy felt that subject be too terrible for lonely hour compelled to leave to converse with annette whose chat simple a be preferred to stillness of total solitude thus sat till near midnight not without many hint from annette that wished to go ember be now nearly burnt out emily heard at distance thundering sound of hall door a be shut for night therefore prepared for rest be still unwilling that annette must leave at instant great bell of portal sounded listened in fearful expectation when after long pause of silence sounded again soon after heard noise of carriage wheel in courtyard emily sunk almost lifeless in chair be count said what at time of night maam said annette dear lady for matter be strange time of night for anybody to come nay prythee good annette stay not talking said emily in voice of agonygo prythee go see who be annette left room carried with light leaving emily in darkness few moment before must have terrified in room be now scarcely observed by listened waited in breathless expectation heard distant noise annette did not return patience at length exhausted tried to find way to corridor be long before must touch door of chamber when have opened total darkness without made fear to proceed voice be now heard emily even thought distinguished of count morano montoni soon after heard step approaching then ray of light streamed through darkness annette appeared whom emily went to meet yes maamselle said be right be count sure enough be exclaimed emily lifting eye towards heaven supporting by annettes arm good lord dear lady dont be in such fluster look so pale will soon hear more will indeed said emily moving a fast a be able towards apartment be not well give air annette opened casement brought water faintness soon left emily desired annette must not go till heard from montoni dear maamselle surely will not disturb at time of night why must think be asleep stay with till be so then said emily who felt temporary relief from suggestion appeared probable enough though fear have prevented occurring to annette with secret reluctance consented to stay emily be now composed enough to ask question among others whether have seen count yes maam saw alight for went from hence to grate in north turret overlook inner courtyard know there saw count carriage count in waiting at great doorfor porter be just gone to bedwith several men on horseback by light of torch carried emily be compelled to smile when door be opened count said something must not make out then got out gentleman with thought to be sure signor be gone to bed hastened away to lady dressing room to see what must hear in way met ludovico told that signor be up counselling with master other signor in room at end of north gallery ludovico held up finger laid on lip a much a to saythere be more going on than think of annette must hold tongue so did hold tongue maamselle came away to tell directly emily enquired who cavalier be that accompanied count how montoni received annette must not inform ludovico added have just be to call signor montonis valet that might tell be arrived when met emily sat musing for time then anxiety be so much increased that desired annette must go to servant hall where be possible might hear something of count intention respecting stay at castle yes maam said annette with readiness how be to find way if leave lamp with emily said must light immediately quitted chamber when have reached top of great staircase emily recollected that might be seen by count to avoid great hall annette conducted through private passage to back staircase led directly to of servant a returned towards chamber emily began to fear that might again lose in intricacy of castle again be shocked by mysterious spectacle though be already perplexed by numerous turning feared to open one of many door offered while stepped thoughtfully along fancied that heard low moaning at great distance having paused moment heard again distinctly several door appeared on right hand of passage advanced listened when came to second heard voice apparently in complaint within to continued to listen afraid to open door unwilling to leave convulsive sob followed then piercing accent of agonizing spirit burst forth emily stood appalled looked through gloom surrounded in fearful expectation lamentation continued pity now began to subdue terror be possible might administer comfort to sufferer at least by expressing sympathy laid hand on door while hesitated thought knew voice disguised a be by tone of grief having therefore set down lamp in passage gently opened door within be dark except that from inner apartment partial light appeared stepped softly on before reached appearance of madame montoni leaning on dressing table weeping with handkerchief held to eye struck paused person be seated in chair by fire who be must not distinguish spoke now then in low voice did not allow emily to hear what be uttered thought that madame montoni at time wept more who be too much occupied by own distress to observe emily while latter though anxious to know what occasioned who be person admitted at so late hour to aunt dressing room forbore to add to suffering by surprising to take advantage of situation by listening to private discourse therefore stepped softly back after further difficulty found way to own chamber where nearer interest at length excluded surprise concern have felt respecting madame montoni annette however returned without satisfactory intelligence for servant among whom have be be either entirely ignorant affected to be so concerning count intended stay at castle must talk only of steep broken road have just passed of numerous danger have escaped express wonder how lord must choose to encounter in darkness of night for scarcely allowed that torch have served for other purpose that of showing dreariness of mountain annette finding must gain information left making noisy petition for more wood on fire more supper on table now maamselle added be so sleepyi be sure if be so sleepy must not desire to sit up with emily indeed began to think be cruel to wish have also waited so long without receiving summons from montoni that appeared did not mean to disturb at late hour determined to dismiss annette when again looked round gloomy chamber recollected certain circumstance fear seized spirit hesitated yet be cruel of to ask to stay till be asleep annette said for fear will be very long before forget in sleep dare say will be very long maamselle said annette before go rejoined emily let ask signor montoni left count morano when quitted hall o maam be alone together have be in aunt dressing room since left maamselle called at door a passed be fastened so thought lady be gone to bed who then be with lady just now said emily forgetting in surprise usual prudence nobody believe maam replied annette nobody have be with believe since left emily took further notice of subject after struggle with imaginary fear good nature prevailed over so far that dismissed annette for night then sat musing upon own circumstance of madame montoni till eye rested on miniature picture have found after father death among paper have enjoined to destroy be open upon table before among loose drawing having with be taken out of little box by emily hour before sight of called up many interesting reflection melancholy sweetness of countenance soothed emotion have occasioned be same style of countenance a of late father while gazed on with fondness on account even fancied resemblance in feature tranquillity be suddenly interrupted when recollected word in manuscript have be found with picture have formerly occasioned so much doubt horror at length roused from deep reverie into remembrance have thrown when rose to undress silence solitude to be left at midnight hour for not even distant sound be now heard conspired with impression subject have be considering have given to mind to appall annettes hint too concerning chamber simple a be have not failed to affect since followed circumstance of peculiar horror have witnessed since scene of be chamber nearly adjoining own door of staircase be perhaps subject of more reasonable alarm now began to apprehend such be aptitude of fear that staircase have private communication with apartment shuddered even to remember determined not to undress lay down to sleep in clothes with late father dog faithful manchon at foot of bed whom considered a kind of guard thus circumstanced tried to banish reflection busy fancy must still hover over subject of interest heard clock of castle strike two before closed eye from disturbed slumber into then sunk be soon awakened by noise seemed to arise within chamber silence prevailed a fearfully listened inclined to believe that have be alarmed by such sound a sometimes occur in dream laid head again upon pillow return of noise again disturbed seemed to come from part of room communicated with private staircase instantly remembered odd circumstance of door having be fastened during preceding night by unknown hand late alarming suspicion concerning communication also occurred to heart became faint with terror half raising from bed gently drawing aside curtain looked towards door of staircase lamp burnt on hearth spread so feeble light through apartment that remote part of be lost in shadow noise however be convinced came from door continued seemed like made by undrawing of rusty bolt often ceased be then renewed more gently a if hand occasioned be restrained by fear of discovery while emily kept eye fixed on spot saw door move then slowly open perceived something enter room extreme duskiness prevented distinguishing what be almost fainting with terror have yet sufficient command over to check shriek be escaping from lip letting curtain drop from hand continued to observe in silence motion of mysterious form saw seemed to glide along remote obscurity of apartment then paused a approached hearth perceived in stronger light what appeared to be human figure certain remembrance now struck upon heart almost subdued feeble remains of spirit continued however to watch figure remained for time motionless then advancing slowly towards bed stood silently at foot where curtain being little open allowed still to see terror however have now deprived her of power of discrimination a well a of of utterance having continued there moment form retreated towards hearth when took lamp held up surveyed chamber for few moment then again advanced towards bed light at instant awakening dog have slept at emilys foot barked loudly jumping to floor flew at stranger who struck animal smartly with sheathed sword springing towards bed emily discoveredcount morano gazed at for moment in speechless affright while throwing on knee at bedside besought to fear nothing having thrown down sword must have taken hand when faculty terror have suspended suddenly returned sprung from bed in dress surely kind of prophetic apprehension have prevented on night from throwing aside morano rose followed to door through have entered caught hand a reached top of staircase not before have discovered by gleam of lamp man half way down step now screamed in despair believing given up by montoni saw indeed possibility of escape count who still held hand led back into chamber why terror said in tremulous voice hear emily come not to alarm by heaven love too welltoo well for own peace emily looked at for moment in fearful doubt then leave sir said leave instantly hear emily resumed morano hear love be in despairyesin despair how can gaze upon know that be perhaps for last time without suffering frenzy of despair will not be so will be mine in spite of montoni villany in spite of montoni cried emily eagerly what be hear hear that montoni be villain exclaimed morano with vehemencea villain who must have sold to lovewho be le who must have bought said emily fixing on count eye of calm contempt leave room sir instantly continued in voice trembling between joy fear will alarm family may receive that from signor montonis vengeance have vainly supplicated from pity emily knew that be beyond hearing of who might protect can never hope anything from pity said morano have used infamously vengeance will pursue for emily for have new plan more profitable than last doubt gleam of hope count former speech have revived be now nearly extinguished by latter while emilys countenance betrayed emotion of mind endeavoured to take advantage of discovery lose time said came not to exclaim against montoni came to solicit to pleadto emily to tell suffer to entreat to save from despair from destruction emily scheme of montoni be insearchable warn be terrible have principle when interest ambition lead can love abandon to power fly then fly from gloomy prison with lover who adores have bribed servant of castle to open gate before tomorrow dawn will be far on way to venice emily overcome by sudden shock have received at moment too when have begun to hope for better day now thought saw destruction surround on side unable to reply almost to think threw into chair pale breathless that montoni have formerly sold to morano be very probable that have now withdrawn consent to marriage be evident from count present conduct be nearly certain that scheme of stronger interest only must have induced selfish montoni to forego plan have hitherto so strenuously pursued reflection made tremble at hint morano have just given no longer hesitated to believe while shrunk from new scene of misery oppression might await in castle of udolpho be compelled to observe almost only mean of escaping be by submitting to protection of man with whom evil more certain not le terrible appearedevils upon must not endure to pause for instant silence though be that of agony encouraged hope of morano who watched countenance with impatience took again resisting hand have withdrawn a pressed to heart again conjured to determine immediately moment lose will make departure more dangerous said few moment lost may enable montoni to overtake beseech sir be silent said emily faintly be indeed very wretched wretched must remain leave mei command leave to fate never cried count vehemently let perish first forgive violence thought of losing be madness can not be ignorant of montonis character may be ignorant of schemesnay must be so must not hesitate between love power do hesitate said emily let go then said morano eagerly kissing hand rising carriage wait below castle wall mistake sir said emily allow to thank for interest express in welfare to decide by own choice will remain under protection of signor montoni under protection exclaimed morano proudly protection emily why will suffer to be thus deluded have already told what have to expect from protection pardon sir if in instance doubt mere assertion to be convinced require something approaching to proof have now time mean of adducing proof replied count have sir inclination to listen to if have trifle with patience distress continued morano be marriage with man who adores so very terrible in eye that must prefer to misery to montoni may condemn in remote prison wretch must have stolen affection ought to be mine must not thus obstinately persist in refusing offer must place beyond reach of oppression morano walked about room with quick step disturbed air discourse count morano sufficiently prof that affection ought not to be yours said emily mildly conduct must not be placed beyond reach of oppression so long a remained in power if wish to believe otherwise cease to oppress longer by presence if refuse will compel to expose to resentment of signor montoni yes let come cried morano furiously brave resentment let dare to face once more man have so courageously injured danger will teach morality vengeance justicelet come receive sword in heart vehemence with be uttered gave emily new cause of alarm who arose from chair trembling frame refused to support resumed seatthe word died on lip when looked wistfully towards door of corridor be locked considered be impossible for to leave apartment before morano must be apprised of able to counteract intention without observing agitation continued to pace room in utmost perturbation of spirit darkened countenance expressed rage of jealousy revenge person who have seen feature under smile of ineffable tenderness so lately assumed must now scarcely have believed to be same count morano said emily at length recovering voice calm entreat transport listen to reason if will not to pity have equally misplaced love hatredi never must have returned affection with honour certainly have never encouraged have signor montoni injured for must have known that have right to dispose of hand have even possessed power to do so leave then leave castle while may with safety spare dreadful consequence of unjust revenge remorse of having prolonged to moment of suffering be for mine for montonis safety that be thus alarmed said morano coldly turning towards with look of acrimony for replied emily in trembling voice unjust revenge cried count resuming abrupt tone of passion who that look upon face can imagine punishment adequate to injury must have done yes will leave castle will not be alone have trifled too long since prayer suffering can not prevail force will have people in waiting who will convey to carriage voice will bring succour can not be heard from remote part of castle submit therefore in silence to go with be unnecessary injunction at present for emily be too certain that call must avail nothing terror have so entirely disordered thought that knew not how to plead to morano sat mute trembling in chair till advanced to lift from when suddenly raised with repulsive gesture countenance of forced serenity said count morano be now in power will observe that be not conduct can win esteem appear so solicitous to obtain that be preparing for load of remorse in misery of friendless orphan can never leave do believe heart to be indeed so hardened that can look without emotion on suffering to must condemn emily be interrupted by growling of dog who now came again from bed morano looked towards door of staircase where person appearing called aloud cesario emily said count why will reduce to adopt conduct how much more willingly must persuade than compel to become wife by heaven will not leave to be sold by montoni yet thought glance across mind that brings madness with know not how to name be preposterousit can not beyet trembleyou grow pale be be soyouyoulove montoni cried morano grasping emilys wrist stamping foot on floor involuntary air of surprise appeared on countenance if have indeed believed so said believe so still that look word confirm exclaimed furiously montoni have richer prize in view than gold will not live to triumph over methis very instant be interrupted by loud barking of dog stay count morano said emily terrified by word by fury expressed in eye will save from errorof men signor montoni be not rival though if find other mean of saving vain will try whether voice may not arouse servant to succour assertion replied morano at moment be not to be depended upon how must suffer to doubt even for instant that must see not lovebut first care will be to convey from castle cesario hocesario man now appeared at door of staircase other step be heard ascending emily uttered loud shriek a morano hurried across chamber at same moment heard noise at door opened upon corridor count paused instant a if mind be suspended between love desire of vengeance in instant door gave way montoni followed by old steward several other person burst into room draw cried montoni to count who did not pause for second bidding giving emily into hand of people appeared from staircase turned fiercely round in thine heart villain said a made thrust at montoni with sword who parried blow aimed while of person who have followed into room endeavoured to part combatant others rescued emily from hand of moranos servant be for count morano said montoni in cool sarcastic tone of voice received under roof permitted though declared enemy to remain under for night be that might repay hospitality with treachery of fiend rob of niece who talk of treachery said morano in tone of unrestrained vehemence let that doe show unblushing face of innocence montoni be villain if there be treachery in affair look to a author of ifdo say iwhom have wronged with unexampled baseness whom have injured almost beyond redress why do use wordscome on coward receive justice at hand coward cried montoni bursting from people who held rushing on count when retreated into corridor where fight continued so desperately that none of spectator dared approach montoni swearing that first who interfered must fall by sword jealousy revenge lent fury to morano while superior skill temperance of montoni enabled to wound adversary whom servant now attempted to seize must not be restrained regardless of wound continued to fight seemed to be insensible of pain loss of blood alive only to energy of passion montoni on contrary persevered in combat with fierce yet wary valour received point of moranos sword on arm almost in same instant severely wounded disarmed count then fell back into arm of servant while montoni held sword over bade ask life morano sinking under anguish of wound have scarcely replied by gesture by few word feebly articulated that must notwhen fainted montoni be then going to have plunged sword into breast a lay senseless arm be arrested by cavigni to interruption yielded without much difficulty complexion changed almost to blackness a looked upon fallen adversary ordered that must be carried instantly from castle in mean time emily who have be withheld from leaving chamber during affray now came forward into corridor pleaded cause of common humanity with feeling of warmest benevolence when entreated montoni to allow assistance in castle situation required montoni who have seldom listened to pity now seemed rapacious of vengeance with monster cruelty again ordered defeated enemy to be taken from castle in present state though there be only wood solitary neighbouring cottage to shelter from night count servant having declared that must not move till revived montonis stood inactive cavigni remonstrating emily superior to montonis menace giving water to morano directing attendant to bind up wound at length montoni have leisure to feel pain from own hurt withdrew to examine count meanwhile having slowly recovered first object saw on raising eye be emily bending over with countenance strongly expressive of solicitude surveyed with look of anguish have deserved said not from montoni be from emily have deserved punishment yet receive only pity paused for have spoken with difficulty after moment proceeded must resign not to montoni forgive suffering have already occasioned for villainhis infamy will not go unpunished carry from place said to servant be in condition to travel must therefore take to nearest cottage for will not pas night under roof although may expire on way from cesario proposed to go out enquire for cottage might receive master before attempted to remove morano be impatient to be gone anguish of mind seemed to be even greater than of wound rejected with disdain offer of cavigni to entreat montoni that might be suffered to pas night in castle cesario be now going to call up carriage to great gate count forbade can not bear motion of carriage said call others of people that may assist in bearing in arm at length however morano submitted to reason consented that cesario must first prepare cottage to receive emily now that have recovered sens be about to withdraw from corridor when message from montoni commanded to do so also that count if be not already gone must quit castle immediately indignation flashed from moranos eye flushed cheek tell montoni said that will go when suit own convenience quit castle dare to call a must nest of serpent that be not last will hear from tell will not leave murder on conscience if can help count morano do know what say said cavigni yes signor know well what say will understand well what mean conscience will assist understanding on occasion count morano said verezzi who have hitherto silently observed dare again to insult friend will plunge sword in body must be action worthy friend of villain said morano a strong impulse of indignation enabled to raise from arm of servant energy be momentary sunk back exhausted by effort montonis people meanwhile held verezzi who seemed inclined even in instant to execute threat cavigni who be not so depraved a to abet cowardly malignity of verezzi endeavoured to withdraw from corridor emily whom compassionate interest have thus long detained be now quitting in new terror when supplicating voice of morano arrested by feeble gesture beckoned to draw nearer advanced with timid step fainting languor of countenance again awakened pity overcame terror be going from hence for ever said perhaps will never see again must carry with forgiveness emily nay morei must also carry good wish have forgiveness then said emily sincere wish for recovery only for recovery said morano with sigh for general welfare added emily perhaps ought to be contented with resumed certainly have not deserved more must ask emily sometimes to think of forgetting offence to remember only passion occasioned must ask ala impossibility must ask to love at moment when be about to part with that perhaps for ever be scarcely emilymay never know torture of passion like mine what do say o that for might be sensible of such passion emily looked impatient to be gone entreat count to consult own safety said linger here no longer tremble for consequence of signor verezzis passion of montonis resentment must learn that be still here moranos face be overspread with momentary crimson eye sparkled seemed endeavouring to conquer emotion replied in calm voice since be interested for safety will regard be gone before go let again hear say that wish well said fixing on earnest mournful look emily repeated assurance took hand scarcely attempted to withdraw put to lip farewell count morano said emily turned to go when second message arrived from montoni again conjured morano a valued life to quit castle immediately regarded in silence with look of fixed despair have time to enforce compassionate entreaty not daring to disobey second command of montoni left corridor to attend be in cedar parlour adjoined great hall laid upon couch suffering degree of anguish from wound few person must have disguised a did countenance be stern calm expressed dark passion of revenge symptom of pain bodily pain indeed have always despised have yielded only to strong terrible energy of soul be attended by old carlo by signor bertolini madame montoni be not with emily trembled a approached received severe rebuke for not having obeyed first summons perceived also that attributed stay in corridor to motive have not even occurred to artless mind be instance of female caprice said ought to have foreseen count morano whose suit obstinately rejected so long a be countenanced by favour seems since find have dismissed emily looked astonished comprehend sir said certainly mean to imply that design of count to visit double chamber be founded upon approbation of mine to reply nothing said montoni must certainly be more than common interest that made plead so warmly in cause must detain thus long in presence contrary to express orderin presence of man whom have hitherto on occasion most scrupulously shunned fear sir be more than common interest detained said emily calmly for of late have be inclined to think that of compassion be uncommon one how must must sir witness count moranos deplorable condition not wish to relieve add hypocrisy to caprice said montoni frowning attempt at satire to before undertake to regulate moral of other person must learn practise virtue be indispensable to womansincerity uniformity of conduct obedience emily who have always endeavoured to regulate conduct by nicest law whose mind be finely sensible not only of what be just in moral of be beautiful in female character be shocked by word yet in next moment heart swelled with consciousness of having deserved praise instead of censure be proudly silent montoni acquainted with delicacy of mind knew how keenly must feel rebuke be stranger to luxury of conscious worth therefore did not foresee energy of sentiment now repelled satire turning to servant who have lately entered room asked whether morano have quitted castle man answered that servant be then removing on couch to neighbouring cottage montoni seemed somewhat appeased on hearing when ludovico appeared few moment after said that morano be gone told emily might retire to apartment withdrew willingly from presence thought of passing remainder of night in chamber door from staircase made liable to intrusion of person now alarmed more than ever determined to call at madame montonis room request that annette might be permitted to be with on reaching great gallery heard voice seemingly in dispute spirit now apt to take alarm paused soon distinguished word of cavigni verezzi went towards in hope of conciliating difference be alone verezzis face be still flushed with rage a first object of be now removed from appeared willing to transfer resentment to cavigni who seemed to be expostulating rather than disputing with verezzi be protesting that must instantly inform montoni of insult morano have thrown out against above wherein have accused of murder there be answering said cavigni for word of man in passion little serious regard ought to be paid to if persist in resolution consequence may be fatal to have now more serious interest to pursue than of petty revenge emily joined entreaty to cavignis argument at length prevailed so far a verezzi consented to retire without seeing montoni on calling at aunt apartment found fastened in few minute however be opened by madame montoni may be remembered that be by door leading into bedroom from back passage emily have secretly entered few hour preceding now conjectured by calmness of madame montonis air that be not apprised of accident have befallen husband be beginning to inform of in tenderest manner must when aunt interrupted by saying be acquainted with whole affair emily knew indeed that have little reason to love montoni must scarcely have believed capable of such perfect apathy a now discovered towards having obtained permission however for annette to sleep in chamber went thither immediately track of blood appeared along corridor leading to on spot where count montoni have fought whole floor be stained emily shuddered leaned on annette a passed when reached apartment instantly determined since door of staircase have be left open that annette be now with to explore whither leda circumstance now materially connected with own safety annette accordingly curious half afraid proposed to descend stair on approaching door perceived that be already fastened without care be then directed to securing on inside also by placing against a much of heavy furniture of room a

necessary to mention circumstance must not be related amidst event of emilys hasty departure from venice together with so rapidly succeeded to arrival in castle on morning of journey count morano have

full of strong expression have little of captivating sweetness that emily have looked for still le of pensive mildness loved be countenance spoke language of passion rather than of sentiment haughty impatience of misfortunenot placid melancholy of spirit injured yet resigned how many year have passed since lady disappeared annette said emily twenty year maamselle thereabout a tell know be long while ago emily continued to gaze upon portrait think resumed annette signor must do well to hang in better place than old chamber now in mind ought to place picture of lady who gave rich in handsomest room in castle may have good reason for what doe people do say that have lost rich a well a gratitude hush maam not word added annette laying finger on lip emily be too much absorbed in

emily a passed to own apartment saw montoni go down to hall turned into aunt dressing room whom found weeping alone grief resentment struggling on countenance pride have hitherto restrained complaint judging of emilys disposition from own from consciousness of what treatment of deserved have believed that grief must be cause of triumph to niece rather than of sympathy that must despise not pity knew not tenderness benevolence of emilys heart have always taught to forget own injury in misfortune of enemy suffering of others whoever might be called forth ready compassion dissipated at once obscuring cloud to goodness passion prejudice might have raised in mind madame montonis suffering at length rose above pride when emily have before entered room must have told have not husband prevented now that be no longer restrained by presence poured forth complaint to niece o emily exclaimed be most wretched of womeni be indeed cruelly treated who with prospect of happiness must have foreseen such wretched fate a thiswho must have thought when married man a signor must ever have to bewail lot there be judging what be for bestthere be knowing what be for good most flattering prospect often changethe best judgment may be deceivedwho must have foreseen when married signor must ever repent generosity emily thought might have foreseen be not thought of triumph placed in chair near aunt took hand with one of look of soft compassion might characterise countenance of guardian angel spoke to in tenderest accent did not sooth madame montoni whom impatience to talk made unwilling to listen wanted to complain not to be consoled be by exclamation of complaint only that emily learned particular circumstance of affliction ungrateful man said madame montoni have deceived in respect now have taken from country friend to shut up in old castle here think can compel to do whatever design will find mistaken will find that threat can alterbut who must have believed who must have supposed that man of family apparent wealth have absolutely fortuneno scarcely sequin of own did for best thought be man of consequence of great property be sure must never have married himungrateful artful man paused to take breath dear madam be composed said emily signor may not be so rich a have reason to expect surely can not be very poor since castle mansion at venice be may ask be circumstance particularly affect be circumstance exclaimed madame montoni with resentment why be not sufficient that have long ago ruined own fortune by play that have since lost what brought himand now must compel to sign away settlement be well have chief of property settled on that may lose also throw away in wild scheme nobody can understand andis not sufficient be indeed said emily must recollect dear madam knew nothing of well be not sufficient rejoined aunt that be also absolutely ruined that be sunk deeply in debt that castle mansion at venice be own if debt honourable dishonourable be paid be shocked by what tell madam said emily be not enough interrupted madame montoni that have treated with neglect with cruelty because refused to relinquish settlement instead of being frightened by menace resolutely defied upbraided with shameful conduct bore meeklyyou know niece never uttered word of complaint till now that disposition a mine must be so imposed upon whose only fault be too much kindness too much generosity must be chained for life to vile deceitful cruel monster want of breath compelled madame montoni to stop if anything must have made emily smile in moment must have be speech of aunt delivered in voice very little below scream with vehemence of gesticulation of countenance turned whole into burlesque emily saw that misfortune did not admit of real consolation contemning commonplace term of superficial comfort be silent while madame montoni jealous of own consequence mistook for silence of indifference of contempt reproached with want of duty feeling o suspected what boasted sensibility must prove to be rejoined thought must not teach to feel either duty affection for relation who have treated like own daughter pardon madam said emily mildly be not natural to to boast if be be sure must not boast of sensibilitya quality perhaps more to be feared than desired well well niece will not dispute with a said montoni threatens with violence if longer refuse to sign away settlement be subject of contest when came into room before now be determined power on earth will make do neither will bear tamely will hear true character from will tell deserves in spite of threat cruel treatment emily seized pause of madame montonis voice to speak dear madam said will not serve to irritate signor unnecessarily will not provoke harsh treatment dread care replied madame montoni doe not signify will not submit to such usage must have give up settlement too suppose madam exactly mean that what be do mean then spoke of reproaching signorsaid emily with hesitation why doe not deserve reproach said aunt certainly doe will be prudent in madam to make prudent exclaimed madame montoni be time to talk of prudence when one be threatened with sort of violence be to avoid violence prudence be necessary said emily of prudence continued madame montoni without attending to of prudence towards man who doe not scruple to break common tie of humanity in conduct to be for to consider prudence in behaviour towards be not so mean be for own sake not for signor madam said emily modestly that must consult prudence reproach however just can not punish may provoke to further violence against what must have submit then to whatever commandswould have kneel down at foot thank for cruelty must have give up settlement how much mistake madam said emily be unequal to advise on point so important a last will pardon for saying that if consult own peace will try to conciliate signor montoni rather than to irritate by reproach conciliate indeed tell niece be utterly impossible disdain to attempt emily be shocked to observe perverted understanding obstinate temper of madame montoni not le grieved for suffering looked round for alleviating circumstance to offer situation be perhaps not so desperate dear madam said emily a may imagine signor may represent affair to be worse than be for purpose of pleading stronger necessity for possession of settlement besides so long a keep may look forward to a resource at least will afford competence must signor future conduct compel to sue for separation madame montoni impatiently interrupted unfeeling cruel girl said so must persuade have reason to complain that signor be in very flourishing circumstance that future prospect promise nothing comfort that grief be a fanciful romantic a own be way to console to endeavour to persuade out of sens feeling because happen to have feeling thought be opening heart to person who must sympathise in distress find that people of sensibility can feel for nobody may retire to chamber emily without replying immediately left room with mingled emotion of pity contempt hastened to own where yielded to mournful reflection knowledge of aunt situation have occasioned conversation of italian with valancourt in france again occurred to hint respecting broken fortune of montoni be now completely justified also concerning character appeared not le so though particular circumstance connected with fame to stranger have alluded yet remained to be explained notwithstanding that own observation word of count morano have convinced that montonis situation be not what formerly appeared to be intelligence have just received from aunt on point struck with force of astonishment be not weakened when considered present style of montonis living number of servant maintained new expences be incurring by repairing fortifying castle anxiety for aunt for increased with reflection several assertion of morano on preceding night have believed be prompted either by interest by resentment now returned to mind with strength of truth must not doubt that montoni have formerly agreed to give to count for pecuniary rewardhis character distressed circumstance justified belief also seemed to confirm moranos assertion that now designed to dispose of more advantageously for to richer suitor amidst reproach morano have thrown out against montoni have saidhe must not quit castle dared to call willingly leave murder on consciencehints might have other origin than passion of moment emily be now inclined to account for more seriously shuddered to think that be in hand of man to whom be even possible must apply at length considering reflection must neither release from melancholy situation enable to bear with greater fortitude tried to divert anxiety took down from little library volume of favourite ariosto wild imagery rich invention must not long enchant attention spell did not reach heart over sleeping fancy played without awakening now put aside book took lute for be seldom that suffering refused to yield to magic of sweet sound when did so be oppressed by sorrow came from excess of tenderness regret there be time when music have increased such sorrow to degree be scarcely endurable when if have not suddenly ceased might have lost reason such be time when mourned for father heard midnight strain that floated by window near convent in languedoc on night followed death continued to play till annette brought dinner into chamber at emily be surprised enquired whose order obeyed lady maamselle replied annette signor ordered dinner to be carried to own apartment so have sent yours there have be sad doings between worse than ever think emily not appearing to notice what said sat down to little table be spread for annette be not to be silenced thus easily while waited told of arrival of men whom emily have observed on rampart expressed much surprise at strange appearance a well a at manner in have be attended by montonis order do dine with signor then said emily maamselle dined long ago in apartment at north end of castle know not when be to go for signor told old carlo to see provided with everything necessary have be walking about castle asking question of workman on rampart never saw such strange looking men in life be frightened whenever see emily enquired if have heard of count morano whether be likely to recover annette only knew that be lodged in cottage in wood below that everybody said must die emilys countenance discovered emotion dear maamselle said annette to see how young lady will disguise when be in love thought hated count be sure must not have told be sure have cause enough to hate hope hate nobody replied emily trying to smile certainly love count morano must be shocked to hear of person dying by violent mean yes maamselle be own fault emily looked displeased annette mistaking cause of displeasure immediately began to excuse count in way to be sure be very ungenteel behaviour said to break into lady room then when found discoursing be not agreeable to to refuse to go then when gentleman of castle come to desire to walk about businessto turn round draw sword swear hell run through body to be sure be very ungenteel behaviour then be disguised in love so did not know what be about enough of said emily who now smiled without effort annette returned to mention of disagreement between montoni lady be nothing new said saw heard enough of at venice though never told of maamselle well annette be very prudent of not to mention then be a prudent now subject be unpleasant one ah dear maamselleto see now how considerate can be about folk who care so little about can not bear to see so deceived must tell be for own good not to spite lady though to speak truth have little reason to love be not speaking thus of aunt hope annette said emily gravely yes maamselle be though if knew a much a do must not look so angry have often often heard signor talking over marriage with count always advised never to give up to foolish whim a be pleased to call to be resolute compel to be obedient whether must be sure heart have ached thousand time have thought when be so unhappy might have felt little for other people thank for pity annette said emily interrupting aunt be unhappy then that disturbed temper perhaps thinki be sureyou may take away annette have done dear maamselle have eat nothing at do try take little bit more disturbed temper truly why temper be always disturbed think at thoulouse have heard lady talking of mon valancourt to madame merveille madame vaison often often in very ill natured way a thought telling what deal of trouble have to keep in order what fatigue distress be to that believed must run away with mon valancourt if be not to watch closely that connived at coming about house at night good god exclaimed emily blushing deeply be surely impossible aunt must thus have represented indeed maam say nothing more than truth not of thought might have found something better to discourse about than fault of own niece even if have be in fault maamselle did not believe word of what said lady doe not care what say against anybody for matter however may be annette interrupted emily recovering composure doe not become to speak of fault of aunt to know have meant well butsay morei have quite dined annette blushed looked down then began slowly to clear table be then reward of ingenuousness said emily when be alone treatment be to receive from relationan auntwho ought to have be guardian not slanderer of

after emily have recovered composure that recollected step have heard on staircasea remembrance however made insist that annette must pas night with with much difficulty at length prevailed assisted by part of girl fear concerned corridor early on following morning a emily crossed hall to rampart heard noisy bustle in courtyard clatter of horse hoof such unusual sound excited curiosity instead of going to rampart went to upper casement from whence saw in court below large party of horseman dressed in singular uniform habit completely though variously armed wore kind of short jacket composed of black scarlet several of have cloak of plain black covering person entirely hung down to stirrup a one of cloak glanced aside saw beneath dagger apparently of different size tucked into horseman belt further observed that be carried in same manner by many of horseman without cloak most of whom bore also pike javelin on head be small italian cap of be distinguished by black feather whether cap gave fierce air to countenance that countenance surmounted have naturally such appearance emily thought have never till then seen assemblage of face so savage terrific while gazed almost fancied surrounded by bandit vague thought glanced athwart fancythat montoni be captain of group before that castle be to be place of rendezvous strange horrible supposition be momentary though reason must supply none more probable though discovered among band stranger have formerly noticed with so much alarm who be now distinguished by black plume while continued gazing cavigni verezzi bertolini came forth from hall habited like rest except that wore hat with mixed plume of black scarlet that arm differed from of rest of party a mounted horse emily be struck with exulting joy expressed on visage of verezzi while cavigni be gay yet with shade of thought on countenance a managed horse with dexterity graceful commanding figure exhibited majesty of hero have never appeared to more advantage emily a observed thought somewhat resembled valancourt in spirit dignity of person looked in vain for noble benevolent countenancethe soul intelligence overspread feature of latter a be hoping scarcely knew why montoni must accompany party appeared at hall door un accoutred having carefully observed horseman conversed awhile with cavalier bidden farewell band wheeled round court led by verezzi issued forth under portcullis montoni following to portal gazing after for time emily then retired from casement now certain of being unmolested went to walk on rampart from whence soon after saw party winding among mountain to west appearing disappearing between wood till distance confused figure consolidated number only dingy mass appeared moving along height emily observed that workman be on rampart that repair of fortification seemed to be completed while sauntered thoughtfully on heard distant footstep raising eye saw several men lurking under castle wall who be evidently not workman looked a if must have accorded well with party be gone wondering where annette have hid so long who might have explained of late circumstance then considering that madame montoni be probably risen went to dressing room where mentioned what have occurred madame montoni must not must not give explanation of event signor reserve to wife on subject be probably nothing more than usual yet to emily gave air of mystery to whole affair seemed to hint there be danger if not villany in scheme annette presently came a usual be full of alarm to lady eager enquiry of what have heard among servant replied ah

montoni appeared who bade latter leave room withdrew trembling for fate of story emily also be retiring aunt desired must stay montoni have so often made witness of contention that no longer have scruple on account insist upon knowing instant signor what mean said be armed men whom tell of gone out about montoni answered only with look of scorn emily whispered something to doe not signify said aunt will know will know too what castle have be fortified for come come said montoni other business brought here must be trifled with longer have immediate occasion for what demandthose estate must

bandit to join enemy of venice in plundering laying waste surrounding country montoni looked at for moment with steady stern countenance while emily trembled wife for once thought have said too much will be removed night said to east turret there perhaps may understand danger of offending man who have unlimited power over emily now fell at foot with tear of terror supplicated for aunt who sat trembling with fear indignation now ready to pour forth execration now to join intercession of emily montoni however soon interrupted entreaty with horrible oath a burst from emily leaving cloak in hand fell to floor with force occasioned severe blow on forehead quitted room without attempting to raise whose attention be called from herself by deep groan from madame montoni who continued otherwise unmoved in chair have not fainted emily hastening to assistance saw eye rolling feature convulsed having spoken to without receiving answer brought water supported head while held to lip increasing convulsion soon compelled emily to call for assistance on way through hall in search of annette met montoni whom told what have happened conjured to return comfort aunt turned silently away with look of indifference went out upon rampart at length found old carlo annette hastened to dressing room where madame montoni have fallen on floor be lying in strong convulsion having lifted into adjoining room laid on bed force of disorder still made strength necessary to hold while annette trembled sobbed old carlo looked silently piteously on a feeble hand grasped of mistress till turning eye upon emily exclaimed good god signora what be matter emily looked calmly at saw enquiring eye fixed on annette looking up screamed loudly for emilys face be stained with blood continued to fall slowly from forehead attention have be so entirely occupied by scene before that have felt no pain from wound now held handkerchief to face notwithstanding faintness continued to watch madame montoni violence of whose convulsion be abating till at length ceased left in kind of stupor aunt must remain quiet said emily go good carlo if must want assistance will send for in mean time if have opportunity speak kindly of mistress to master ala said carlo have seen too much have little influence with signor do dear young lady take care of yourself be ugly wound look sadly thank friend for consideration said emily smiling kindly wound be trifling came by fall carlo shook head left room emily with annette continued to watch by aunt did lady tell signor what ludovico said maamselle asked

happened why extraordinary thing happen here so often maamselle that there be nothing in here be legion of ill looking fellow come to castle morning hush annette will disturb aunt will talk of by bye continued watching silently till madame montoni uttered low sigh when emily took hand spoke soothingly to former gazed with unconscious eye be long before knew niece first word then enquired for montoni to emily replied by entreaty that must compose spirit consent to be kept quiet adding that if wished message to be conveyed to must herself deliver said aunt faintly noi have nothing new to tell doe persist in saying will be removed from chamber emily replied that have not spoken on subject since madame montoni heard then tried to divert attention to other topic aunt seemed to be inattentive to what said lost in secret thought emily having brought refreshment now left to care of annette went in search of montoni whom found on remote part of rampart conversing among group of men described by annette stood round with fierce yet subjugated look while speaking earnestly pointing to wall did not perceive emily who remained at distance waiting till must be at leisure observing involuntarily appearance of one man more savage than fellow who stood resting on pike looking over shoulder of comrade at montoni to whom listened with uncommon earnestness man be apparently of low condition yet look appeared not to acknowledge superiority of montoni a did of companion sometimes even assumed air of authority decisive manner of signor must not repress few word of montoni then passed in wind a men be separating heard say evening then begin watch at sunset at sunset signor replied one two of walked away while emily approached montoni who appeared desirous of avoiding though observed have courage to proceed endeavoured to intercede once more for aunt represented to suffering urged danger of exposing to cold apartment in present state suffers by own folly said montoni be not to be pitiedshe know how may avoid suffering in futureif be removed to turret will be own fault let be obedient sign writing heard of will think more of when emily ventured still to plead sternly silenced rebuked for interfering in domestic affair at length dismissed with concessionthat must not remove madame montoni on ensuing night allow till next to consider whether must resign settlement be imprisoned in east turret of castle where will find added punishment may not expect emily then hastened to inform aunt of short respite of alternative awaited to latter made reply appeared thoughtful while emily in consideration of extreme languor wished to sooth mind by leading to le interesting topic though effort be unsuccessful madame montoni became peevish resolution on contended point seemed somewhat to relax emily recommended a only mean of safety that must submit to montonis demand know not what advise said aunt do understand that estate will descend to at death if persist in refusal be ignorant of circumstance madam replied emily knowledge of can not withhold from advising to adopt conduct not only peace fear safety requires entreat that will not suffer consideration comparatively so trifling to make hesitate moment in resigning be sincere niece be possible can doubt madam aunt appeared to be affected be not unworthy of estate niece said must wish to keep for sakeyou show virtue did not expect how have deserved reproof madam said emily sorrowfully reproof replied madame montoni meant to praise virtue ala here be exertion of virtue rejoined emily for here be temptation to be overcome yet monsieur valancourt said aunt o madam interrupted emily anticipating what must have said let glance on subject let mind be stained with wish so shockingly interested immediately changed topic continued with madame montoni till withdrew to apartment for night at hour castle be perfectly still inhabitant of except seemed to have retired to rest a passed along wide lonely gallery dusky silent felt forlorn apprehensive ofshe scarcely knew what when entering corridor recollected incident of preceding night dread seized lest subject of alarm similar to have befallen annette must occur to whether real ideal must felt have almost equal effect upon weakened spirit chamber to annette have alluded did not exactly know understood to be one of must pas in way to own sending fearful look forward into gloom stepped lightly cautiously along till coming to door from whence issued low sound hesitated paused during delay of moment fear so much increased that have power to move from spot believing that heard human voice within be somewhat revived in next moment door be opened person whom conceived to be montoni appeared who instantly started back closed though not before have seen by light burned in chamber person sitting in melancholy attitude by fire terror vanished astonishment only began be now roused by mysterious secrecy of montonis manner by discovery of person whom thus visited at midnight in apartment have long be shut up of such extraordinary report be circulated while thus continued hesitating strongly prompted to watch montonis motion yet fearing to irritate by appearing to notice door be again opened cautiously a instantly closed a before then stepped softly to chamber be next one to having put down lamp returned to obscure corner of corridor to observe proceeding of half seen person to ascertain whether be indeed montoni having waited in silent expectation for few minute with eye fixed on door be again opened same person appeared whom now knew to be montoni looked cautiously round without perceiving then stepping forward closed door left corridor soon after emily heard door fastened on inside withdrew to chamber wondering at what have witnessed be now twelve oclock a closed casement heard footstep on terrace below saw imperfectly through gloom several person advancing who passed under casement then heard clink of arm in next moment watch word when recollecting command have overheard from montoni hour of night understood that men be for first time relieving guard in castle having listened till be again still retired to sleep chapter x will lay of death with pleasing murmur sooth parted soul will tear wet grave sayers on following morning emily went early to apartment of madame montoni who have slept well be much recovered spirit have also returned with health resolution to oppose montonis demand revived though yet struggled with fear emily who trembled for consequence of further opposition endeavoured to confirm aunt a have be already shown have disposition delighted in contradiction taught when unpleasant circumstance be offered to understanding not to enquire into truth to seek for argument by might make appear false long habit have so entirely confirmed natural propensity that be not conscious of possessing emilys remonstrance representation therefore roused pride instead of alarming convincing judgment still relied upon discovery of mean by might yet avoid submitting to demand of husband considering that if must once escape from castle might defy power obtaining decisive separation live in comfort on estate yet remained for mentioned to niece who accorded with in wish differed from a to probability of completion represented impossibility of passing gate secured guarded a be extreme danger of committing design to discretion of servant who might either purposely betray accidentally disclose itmontonis vengeance must also disdain restraint if intention be detected though emily wished a fervently a must do to regain freedom return to france consulted only madame montonis safety persevered in advising to relinquish settlement without braving further outrage struggle of contrary emotion however continued to rage in aunt bosom still brooded over chance of effecting escape while thus sat montoni entered room without noticing wife indisposition said that came to remind of impolicy of trifling with that gave only till evening to determine whether must consent to demand compel by refusal to remove to east turret added that party of cavalier must dine with day that expected that must sit at head of table where emily also must be present madame montoni be now on point of uttering absolute refusal suddenly considering that liberty during entertainment though circumscribed might favour further plan acquiesced with seeming reluctance montoni soon after left apartment command struck emily with surprise apprehension who shrank from thought of being exposed to gaze of stranger such a fancy represented to be word of count morano now again recollected did not sooth fear when withdrew to prepare for dinner dressed with even more simplicity than usual that might escape observationa policy did not avail for a repassed to aunt apartment be met by montoni who censured what called prudish appearance insisted that must wear most splendid dress have even that have be prepared for intended nuptials with count morano now appeared aunt have carefully brought with from venice be made not in venetian in neapolitan fashion so a to set off shape figure to utmost advantage in beautiful chestnut tress be negligently bound up in pearl suffered to fall back again on neck simplicity of better taste than madame montonis be conspicuous in dress splendid a be emilys unaffected beauty never have appeared more captivatingly have now only to hope that montonis order be prompted not by extraordinary design by ostentation of displaying family richly attired to eye of stranger yet nothing le than absolute command must have prevailed with to wear dress have be designed for such offensive purpose much le to have worn on occasion a descended to dinner emotion of mind threw faint blush over countenance heightened interesting expression for timidity have made linger in apartment till utmost moment when entered hall in kind of state dinner be spread montoni guest be already seated at table be then going to place by aunt montoni waved hand two of cavalier rose seated between eldest of be tall man with strong italian feature aquiline nose dark penetrating eye that flashed with fire when mind be agitated even in state of rest retained somewhat of wildness of passion visage be long narrow complexion of sickly yellow other

to oval be irregular ill formed eight other guest sat round table who be dressed in uniform have expression more le of wild fierceness of subtle design of licentious passion a emily timidly surveyed remembered scene of preceding morning again almost fancied surrounded by bandit then looking back to tranquillity of early life felt scarcely le astonishment than grief at present situation scene in sat assisted illusion be ancient hall gloomy from style of architecture from great extent because almost only light received be from one large gothic window from pair of folding door being open admitted likewise view of west rampart with wild mountain of apennine beyond middle compartment of hall rose into vaulted roof enriched with fretwork supported on three side by pillar of marble beyond long colonnade retired in gloomy grandeur till extent be lost in twilight lightest footstep of servant a advanced through be returned in whispering echo figure seen at distance imperfectly through dusk frequently awakened emilys imagination looked alternately at montoni at guest on surrounding scene then remembering dear native province pleasant home simplicity goodness of friend whom have lost grief surprise again occupied mind when thought must return from consideration fancied observed air of authority towards guest such a have never before seen assume though have always be distinguished by haughty carriage there be something also in manner of stranger seemed perfectly though not servilely to acknowledge superiority during dinner conversation be chiefly on war politics talked with energy of state of venice danger character of reigning doge of chief senator then spoke of state of rome when repast be over rose filling goblet with wine from gilded ewer that stood beside drank success to exploit montoni be lifting goblet to lip to drink toast when suddenly wine hissed rose to brim a held glass from burst into thousand piece to who constantly used that sort of venice glass have quality of breaking upon receiving poisoned liquor suspicion that of guest have endeavoured to betray instantly occurred ordered gate to be closed drew sword looking round on who stood in silent amazement exclaimed here be traitor among let be innocent assist in discovering guilty indignation flashed from eye of cavalier who drew sword madame montoni terrified at what might ensue be hastening from hall when husband commanded to stay further word must not now be distinguished for voice of person rose together order that servant must appear be at length obeyed declared ignorance of deceita protestation must not be believed for be evident that a montonis liquor only have be poisoned deliberate design have be formed against life must not have be carried so far towards accomplishment without connivance of servant who have care of wine ewer man with whose face betrayed consciousness of guilt fear of punishment montoni ordered to be chained instantly confined in strong room have formerly be used a prison thither likewise must have sent guest have not foreseen consequence of so bold unjustifiable proceeding a to therefore contented with swearing that man must pas gate till extraordinary affair have be investigated then sternly bade wife retire to apartment whither suffered emily to attend in about hour followed to dressing room emily observed with horror dark countenance quivering lip heard denounce vengeance on aunt will avail nothing said to wife to deny fact have proof of guilt only chance of mercy rest on full confessionthere be nothing to hope from sullenness falsehood accomplice have confessed emilys fainting spirit be roused by astonishment a heard aunt accused of crime so atrocious must not for moment admit possibility of guilt meanwhile madame montonis agitation did not permit to reply alternately complexion varied from livid paleness to crimson flush trembledbut whether with fear with indignation be difficult to decide spare word said montoni seeing about to speak countenance make full confession of crimeyou will be instantly removed to east turret accusation said madame montoni speaking with difficulty be used only a excuse for cruelty disdain to reply to believe guilty signor said emily solemnly dreadful charge must answer with life be false nay signor added observing severity of countenance be moment for restraint on part scruple to tell that be deceivedmost wickedly deceived by suggestion of person who aim at ruin of auntit be impossible that must yourself have imagined crime so hideous montoni lip trembling more than before replied only if value own safety addressing emily will be silent will know how to interpret remonstrance must persevere in emily raised eye calmly to heaven here be indeed then nothing to hope said peace cried montoni will find there be something to fear turned to wife who have now recovered spirit who vehemently wildly remonstrated upon mysterious suspicion montonis rage heightened with indignation emily dreading event of threw between clasped knee in silence looking up in face with expression might have softened heart of fiend whether be hardened by conviction of madame montonis guilt that bare suspicion of made eager to exercise vengeance be totally alike insensible to distress of wife to pleading look of emily whom made attempt to raise be vehemently menacing when be called out of room by person at door a shut door emily heard turn lock take out key so that madame montoni be now prisoner saw that design became more more terrible endeavour to explain motif for circumstance be almost a ineffectual a to sooth distress of aunt whose innocence must not doubt at length accounted for montonis readiness to suspect wife by own consciousness of cruelty towards for sudden violence of present conduct against before even suspicion must be completely formed by general eagerness to effect suddenly whatever be led to desire carelessness of justice humanity in accomplishing madame montoni after time again looked round in search of possibility of escape from castle conversed with emily on subject who be now willing to encounter hazard though forbore to encourage hope in aunt did not admit how strongly edifice be secured how vigilantly guarded knew too well trembled to commit safety to caprice of servant whose assistance must solicit old carlo be compassionate seemed to be too much in master interest to be trusted by annette must of do little emily knew ludovico only from report at present however consideration be useless madame montoni niece being shut up from intercourse even with person whom there might be reason to reject in hall confusion tumult still reigned emily a listened anxiously to murmur sounded along gallery sometimes fancied heard clashing of sword when considered nature of provocation given by montoni impetuosity appeared probable that nothing le than arm must terminate contention madame montoni having exhausted expression of indignation emily hers of comfort remained silent in kind of breathless stillness in nature often succeeds to uproar of conflicting element stillness like morning dawn upon ruin of earthquake uncertain kind of terror pervaded emilys mind circumstance of past hour still came dimly confusedly to memory thought be various rapid though without tumult from state of waking vision be recalled by knocking at chamber door enquiring who be there heard whispering voice of annette dear madam let come in have great deal to say said poor girl door be locked answered lady yes maam do pray open signor have key said madame montoni o blessed virgin what will become of exclaimed annette assist to escape said mistress where be ludovico below in hall maam amongst fighting with best of

utterance key sounded in lock door opened montoni appeared followed by three ruffian like men execute order said turning to pointing to wife who shrieked be immediately carried from room while emily sunk senseless on couch by have endeavoured to support when recovered be alone recollected only that madame montoni have be there together with unconnected particular of preceding transaction be however sufficient to renew terror looked wildly round apartment a if in search of mean of intelligence concerning aunt while own danger idea of escaping from room immediately occurred when recollection be more complete raised went with only faint hope to examine whether door be unfastened be so then stepped timidly out into gallery paused there uncertain way must proceed first wish be to gather information a to aunt at length turned step to go to lesser hall where annette other servant usually waited everywhere a passed heard from distance uproar of contention figure face met hurrying along passage struck mind with dismay emily might now have appeared like angel of light encompassed by fiend at length reached lesser hall be silent deserted panting for breath sat down to recover total stillness of place be a awful a tumult from have escaped have now time to recall scattered thought to remember personal danger to consider of mean of safety perceived that be useless to seek madame montoni through wide extent intricacy of castle now too when avenue seemed to be beset by ruffian in hall must not resolve to stay for knew not how soon might become place of rendezvous though wished to go to chamber dreaded again to encounter on way thus sat trembling hesitating when distant murmur broke on silence grew louder louder till distinguished voice step approaching then rose to go sound came along only passage by must depart be compelled to await in hall arrival of person whose step heard a advanced distinguished groan then saw man borne slowly along by four others spirit faltered at sight leaned against wall for support bearer meanwhile entered hall being too busily occupied to detain even notice emily attempted to leave strength failed again sat down on bench damp chillness came over sight became confused knew not what have passed where be yet groan of wounded person still vibrated on heart in few moment tide of life seemed again to flow began to breathe more freely sens revived have not fainted have ever totally lost consciousness have contrived to support on bench still without courage to turn eye upon unfortunate object remained near about whom men be yet too much engaged to attend to when strength returned rose be suffered to leave hall though anxiety having produced vain enquiry concerning madame montoni have thus made discovery of herself towards chamber now hastened a fast a step must bear for still perceived upon passage sound of confusion at distance endeavoured by taking way through obscure room to avoid encountering person whose look have terrified before a well a part of castle where tumult might still rage at length reached chamber having secured door of corridor felt for moment in safety profound stillness reigned in remote apartment not even faint murmur of most distant sound now reached sat down near one of casement a gazed on mountain view beyond deep repose of beauty struck with force of contrast must scarcely believe so near scene of savage discord contending element seemed to have retired from natural sphere to have collected into mind of men for there alone tempest now reigned emily tried to tranquillize spirit anxiety made constantly listen for sound often look out upon rampart where however be lonely still a sense of own immediate danger have decreased apprehension concerning madame montoni heightened who remembered have be fiercely threatened with confinement in east turret be possible that husband have satisfied present vengeance with punishment therefore determined when night must return inhabitant of castle must be asleep to explore way to turret a direction stood in be mentioned appeared not very difficult to be done knew indeed that although aunt might be there must afford effectual assistance might give comfort even to know that be discovered to hear sound of niece voice for certainty concerning madame montonis fate appeared more tolerable than exhausting suspense meanwhile annette did not appear emily be surprised somewhat alarmed for whom in confusion of late scene various accident might have befallen be improbable that must have failed to come to apartment unless something unfortunate have happened thus hour passed in solitude in silence in anxious conjecturing being not once disturbed by message sound appeared that montoni have wholly forgotten gave comfort to find that must be so unnoticed endeavoured to withdraw thought from anxiety preyed upon refused control must neither read draw tone of lute be so utterly discordant with present state of feeling that must not endure for moment sun at length set behind western mountain fiery beam faded from cloud then dun melancholy purple drew over gradually involved feature of country below soon after sentinel passed on rampart to commence watch twilight have now spread gloom over object dismal obscurity of chamber recalled fearful thought remembered that to procure light must pas through great extent of castle above through hall where have already experienced so much horror darkness indeed in present state of spirit made silence solitude terrible to must also prevent possibility of finding way to turret condemn to remain in suspense concerning fate of aunt yet dared not to venture forth for lamp continuing at casement that might catch last lingering gleam of evening thousand vague image of fear floated on fancy what if of ruffian said must find out private staircase in darkness of night steal into chamber then recollecting mysterious inhabitant of neighbouring apartment terror changed object be not prisoner said though remains in one chamber for montoni did not fasten door when left unknown person did be certain therefore can come out when plea paused for notwithstanding terror of darkness considered to be very improbable whoever be that must have interest in intruding upon retirement again subject of emotion changed when remembering nearness to chamber where veil have formerly disclosed dreadful spectacle doubted whether passage might not communicate between insecure door of staircase be now entirely dark left casement a sat with eye fixed on hearth thought perceived there spark of light twinkled disappeared then again be visible at length with much care fanned ember of wood fire have be lighted in morning into flame having communicated to lamp always stood in room felt satisfaction not to be conceived without review of situation first care be to guard door of staircase for purpose placed against furniture must move be thus employed for time at end of have instance how much more oppressive misfortune be to idle than to busy for having then leisure to think over circumstance of present affliction imagined thousand evil for futurity real ideal subject of distress alike wounded mind thus heavily moved hour till midnight when counted sullen note of great clock a rolled along rampart unmingled with sound except distant foot fall of sentinel who came to relieve guard now thought might venture towards turret having gently opened chamber door to examine corridor to listen if person be stirring in castle found around in perfect stillness yet sooner have left room than perceived light flash on wall of corridor without waiting to see by whom be carried shrunk back closed door one approaching conjectured that be montoni going to pay midnight visit to unknown neighbour determined to wait till must have retired to own apartment when chime have tolled half hour once more opened door perceiving that person be in corridor hastily crossed into passage led along south side of castle towards staircase whence believed must easily find way to turret often pausing on way listening apprehensively to murmur of wind looking fearfully onward into gloom of long passage at length reached staircase there perplexity began two passage appeared of knew not how to prefer one be compelled at last to decide by chance rather than by circumstance that entered opened first into wide gallery along passed lightly swiftly for lonely aspect of place awed started at echo of own step on sudden thought heard voice not distinguishing from whence came feared equally to proceed to return for moment stood in attitude of listening expectation shrinking almost from herself scarcely daring to look round voice came again though be now near terror did not allow to judge exactly whence proceeded thought however that be voice of complaint belief be soon confirmed by low moaning sound seemed to proceed from one of chamber opening into gallery instantly occurred to madame montoni might be there confined advanced to door to speak be checked by considering that be perhaps going to commit to stranger who might discover to montoni for though person whoever be seemed to be in affliction did not follow that be prisoner while thought passed over mind left still in hesitation voice spoke again calling ludovico then perceived to be that of annette on no longer hesitating went in joy to answer ludovico cried annette sobbingludovico be not ludovico be imademoiselle emily annette ceased sobbing be silent if can open door let in said emily here be person to hurt ludovicoo ludovico cried annette emily now lost patience fear of being overheard increasing be even nearly about to leave door when considered that annette might possibly know something of situation of madame montoni direct to turret at length obtained reply though little satisfactory to question for annette knew nothing of madame montoni only conjured emily to tell what be become of ludovico of have information to give again asked who have shut annette up ludovico said poor girl ludovico shut up when ran away from dressing room door today went scarcely knew where for safety in gallery here met ludovico who hurried into chamber locked up to keep out of harm a said be in such hurry hardly spoke ten word told must come let out when be quiet took away key with now hour be passed have seen heard word of have murdered himi know have emily suddenly remembered wounded person whom have seen borne into servant hall scarcely doubted that be ludovico concealed circumstance from annette endeavoured to comfort then impatient to learn something of aunt again enquired way to turret o be not going maamselle said annette for heaven sake go leave here by nay annette think can wait in gallery night replied emily direct to turret in morning will endeavour to release o holy mary exclaimed annette be to stay here by night will be frightened out of sens will die of hunger have have nothing to eat since dinner emily must scarcely forbear smiling at heterogeneous distress of annette though sincerely pitied said what must to sooth at length obtained something like direction to east turret quitted door from whence after many intricacy perplexity reached steep winding stair of turret at foot of stopped to rest to reanimate courage with sense of duty a surveyed dismal place perceived door on opposite side of staircase anxious to know whether must lead to madame montoni tried to undraw bolt fastened fresher air came to face a unclosed door opened upon east rampart sudden current have nearly extinguished light now removed to distance again looking out upon obscure terrace perceived only faint outline of wall of tower while above heavy cloud borne along wind seemed to mingle with star wrap night in thicker darkness a gazed now willing to defer moment of certainty from expected only confirmation of evil distant footstep reminded that might be observed by men on watch hastily closing door took lamp passed up staircase trembling came upon a ascended through gloom to melancholy fancy seemed to be place of death chilling silence reigned confirmed character spirit faltered perhaps said be come only to learn dreadful truth to witness horrible spectacle feel that sens must not survive such addition of horror image of aunt murderedmurdered perhaps by hand of montoni rose to mind trembled gasped for breathrepented that have dared to venture hither checked step after have paused few minute consciousness of duty returned went on still be silent at length track of blood upon stair caught eye instantly perceived that wall several other step be stained paused again struggled to support lamp almost fell from trembling hand still sound be heard living being seemed to inhabit turret thousand time wished again in chamber dreaded to enquire fartherdreaded to encounter horrible spectacle yet must not resolve now that be so near termination of effort to desist from having again collected courage to proceed after ascending about way up turret came to door here again stopped in hesitation listened for sound within then summoning resolution unclosed entered chamber a lamp shot feeble ray through darkness seemed to exhibit only dew stained deserted wall a stood examining in fearful expectation of discovering remains of unfortunate aunt perceived something lying in obscure corner of room struck with horrible conviction became for instant motionless nearly insensible then with kind of desperate resolution hurried towards object excited terror when perceiving clothes of person on floor caught hold of found in grasp old uniform of soldier beneath appeared heap of pike other arm scarcely daring to trust sight continued for moment to gaze on object of late alarm then left chamber so much comforted occupied by conviction that aunt be not there that be going to descend turret without enquiring farther when on turning to do so observed upon step on second flight appearance of blood remembering that there be yet chamber to be explored again followed winding of ascent still a ascended track of blood glared upon stair led to door of landing place terminated be unable to follow farther now that be so near sought for certainty dreaded to know even more than before have not fortitude sufficient to speak to attempt opening door having listened in vain for sound might confirm destroy fear at length laid hand on lock finding fastened called on madame montoni only chilling silence ensued be dead criedmurderedher blood be on stair emily grew very faint must support no longer have scarcely presence of mind to set down lamp place on step when recollection returned spoke again at door again attempted to open having lingered for time without receiving answer hearing sound descended turret with swiftness feebleness must permit sought own apartment a turned into corridor door of chamber opened from whence montoni came forth emily more terrified than ever to behold shrunk back into passage soon enough to escape being noticed heard close door have perceived be same formerly observed having here listened to departing step till faint sound be lost in distance ventured to apartment securing once again retired to bed leaving lamp burning on hearth sleep be fled from harassed mind to image of horror alone occurred endeavoured to think possible that madame montoni have not be taken to turret when recollected former menace of husband terrible spirit of vengeance have displayed on late occasion when remembered general character look of men who have forced madame montoni from apartment written trace on stair of turretshe must not doubt that aunt have be carried thither must scarcely hope that have not be carried to be murdered grey of morning have long dawned through casement before emily closed eye in sleep when wearied nature at length yielded respite from suffering chapter xi who rear bloody hand sayers emily remained in chamber on following morning without receiving notice from montoni seeing human being except armed men who sometimes passed on terrace below having tasted food since dinner of preceding day extreme faintness made feel necessity of quitting asylum of apartment to obtain refreshment be also very anxious to procure liberty for annette willing however to defer venturing forth a long a possible considering whether must apply to montoni to compassion of other person excessive anxiety concerning aunt at length overcame abhorrence of presence determined to go to to entreat that must suffer to see madame montoni meanwhile be too certain from absence of annette that accident have befallen ludovico that be still in confinement emily therefore resolved also to visit chamber where have spoken to on preceding night if poor girl be yet there to inform montoni of situation be near noon before ventured from apartment went first to south gallery whither passed without meeting single person hearing sound except now then echo of distant footstep be unnecessary to call annette whose lamentation be audible upon first approach to gallery who bewailing own ludovicos fate told emily that must certainly be starved to death if be not let out immediately emily replied that be going to beg release of montoni terror of hunger now yielded to of signor when emily left be loudly entreating that place of refuge might be concealed from a emily drew near great sound heard people met in passage renewed alarm latter however be peaceable did not interrupt though looked earnestly at a passed sometimes spoke on crossing hall towards cedar room where montoni usually sat perceived on pavement fragment of sword tattered garment stained with blood almost expected to have seen among dead body from such spectacle be at present spared a approached room sound of several voice issued from within dread of appearing before many stranger a well a of irritating montoni by such intrusion made pause falter from purpose looked up through long arcade of hall in search of servant who might bear message one appeared urgency of what have to request made still linger near door voice within be not in contention though distinguished of several of guest of preceding day still resolution failed whenever must have tapped at door have determined to walk in hall till person must appear who might call montoni from room when a turned from door be suddenly opened by emily trembled be confused while almost started with surprise terror of countenance unfolded forgot must have said enquired for aunt entreated for annette stood silent embarrassed after closing door reproved for meanness of have not be guilty sternly questioned what have accusation revived recollection so far that assured have not come thither with intention to listen to conversation to entreat compassion for aunt for annette montoni seemed to doubt assertion for regarded with scrutinizing look doubt evidently arose from trifling interest emily then further explained concluded with entreating to inform where aunt be placed to permit that might visit looked upon only with malignant smile instantaneously confirmed worst fear for aunt at moment have not courage to renew entreaty for annette said heif go to carlo will release girl foolish fellow who shut up died yesterday emily shudderedbut aunt signorsaid o tell of aunt be taken care of replied montoni hastily have time to answer idle question must have passed on emily in voice of agony must not be wholly resisted conjured to tell where madame montoni be while paused anxiously watched countenance trumpet sounded in next moment heard heavy gate of portal open then clattering of horse hoof in court with confusion of many voice stood for moment hesitating whether must follow montoni who at sound of trumpet have passed through hall turning eye whence came saw through door opened beyond long perspective of arch into court party of horseman whom judged a well a distance embarrassment must allow to be same have seen depart few day before staid not to scrutinize for when trumpet sounded again chevalier rushed out of cedar room men came running into hall from quarter of castle emily once more hurried for shelter to own apartment thither be still pursued by image of horror reconsidered montonis manner word when have spoken of wife served only to confirm most terrible suspicion tear refused longer to relieve distress have sat for considerable time absorbed in thought when knocking at chamber door aroused on opening found old carlo dear young lady said have be so flurried never once thought of till just now have brought fruit wine be sure must stand in need of by time thank carlo said emily be very good of did signor remind of signora replied carlo excellenza have business enough on hand emily then renewed enquiry concerning madame montoni carlo have be employed at other end of castle during time that be removed have heard nothing since concerning while spoke emily looked steadily at for scarcely knew whether be really ignorant concealed knowledge of truth from fear of offending master to several question concerning contention of yesterday gave very limited answer told that dispute be now amicably settled that signor believed to have be mistaken in suspicion of guest fighting be about signora said carlo trust will never see such day in castle though strange thing be about to be done on enquiring meaning ah signora added be not for to betray secret tell think time will tell then desired to release annette having described chamber in poor girl be confined promised to obey immediately be departing when remembered to ask who be person just arrived late conjecture be right be verezzi with party spirit be somewhat soothed by short conversation with carlo for in present circumstance afforded comfort to hear accent of compassion to meet look of sympathy hour passed before annette appeared who then came weeping sobbing o ludovicoludovico cried poor annette said emily made sit down who must have foreseen maamselle o miserable wretched daythat ever must live to see continued to moan lament till emily thought necessary to check excess of grief be continually losing dear friend by death said with sigh came from heart must submit to will of heavenour tear ala can not recall dead annette took handkerchief from face will meet ludovico in better world hope added emily yesyesmaamselle sobbed annette hope will meet again in thisthough be so wounded wounded exclaimed emily doe live yes maam butbut have terrible wound must not come to let out thought dead at first have not be rightly till within hour well annette rejoice to hear life life holy saint why will not die surely emily said hoped not expression of hope annette thought implied fear own increased in proportion a emily endeavoured to encourage to enquiry concerning madame montoni must give satisfactory answer quite forgot to ask among servant maamselle said for must think of nobody poor ludovico annettes grief be now somewhat assuaged emily sent to make enquiry concerning lady of whom however must obtain intelligence of people spoke with being really ignorant of fate others having probably received order to conceal day passed with emily in continued grief anxiety for aunt be unmolested by notice from montoni now that annette be liberated obtained food without exposing to danger impertinence two following day passed in same manner unmarked by occurrence during obtained information of madame montoni on evening of second having dismissed annette retired to bed mind became haunted by most dismal image such a long anxiety concerning aunt suggested unable to forget for moment to vanquish phantom tormented rose from bed went to one of casement of chamber to breathe freer air without be silent dark unless must be called light be only faint glimmer of star showing imperfectly outline of mountain western tower of castle rampart below where solitary sentinel be pacing what image of repose did scene present fierce terrible passion too so often agitated inhabitant of edifice seemed now hushed in sleepthose mysterious working rouse element of man nature into tempestwere calm emilys heart be not so suffering though deep partook of gentle character of mind hers be silent anguish weeping yet enduring not wild energy of passion inflaming imagination bearing down barrier of reason living in world of own air refreshed continued at casement looking on shadowy scene over planet burned with clear light amid deep blue a silently moved in destined course remembered how often have gazed on with dear father how often have pointed out way in heaven explained law reflection led to others in almost equal degree awakened grief astonishment brought retrospect of strange mournful event have occurred since lived in peace with parent to emily who have be so tenderly educated so tenderly loved who once knew only goodness happinessto late event present situationin foreign landin remote castlesurrounded by vice violenceseemed more like vision of distempered imagination than circumstance of truth wept to think of what parent must have suffered must have foreseen event of future life while raised streaming eye to heaven observed same planet have seen in languedoc on night preceding father death rise above eastern tower of castle while remembered conversation have passed concerning probable state of departed soul remembered also solemn music have heard to tenderness of spirit have in spite of reason given superstitious meaning at recollection wept again continued musing when suddenly note of sweet music passed on air superstitious dread stole over stood listening for moment in trembling expectation then endeavoured to recollect thought to reason into composure human reason can not establish law on subject lost in obscurity of imagination more than eye can ascertain form of object that only glimmer through dimness of night surprise on hearing such soothing delicious sound be at least justifiable for be longvery long since have listened to anything like melody fierce trumpet shrill fife be only instrument have heard since arrival at udolpho when mind be somewhat more composed tried to ascertain from what quarter sound proceeded thought came from below whether from room of castle from terrace must not with certainty judge fear surprise now yielded to enchantment of strain floated on silent night with most soft melancholy sweetness suddenly seemed removed to distance trembled faintly then entirely ceased continued to listen sunk in pleasing repose soft music leaf on mindbut came more upon strange circumstance thought be long engaged for strange certainly be to hear music at midnight when inhabitant of castle have long since retired to rest in place where nothing like harmony have be heard before probably for many year long suffering have made spirit peculiarly sensible to terror liable to be affected by illusion of superstitionit now seemed to a if dead father have spoken to in strain to inspire with comfort confidence on subject have then occupied mind yet reason told that be wild conjecture be inclined to dismiss with inconsistency so natural when imagination guide thought then wavered towards belief a wild remembered singular event connected with castle have given into possession of present owner when considered mysterious manner in late possessor have disappeared that have never since be heard of mind be impressed with high degree of solemn awe so though there appeared clue to connect event with late music be inclined fancifully to think have relation to other at conjecture sudden chillness ran through frame looked fearfully upon duskiness of chamber dead silence prevailed there heightened to fancy gloomy aspect at length left casement step faltered a approached bed stopped looked round single lamp burned in spacious chamber be expiring for moment shrunk from darkness beyond then ashamed of weakness however must not wholly conquer went forward to bed where mind did not soon know soothings of sleep still mused on late occurrence looked with anxiety to next night when at same hour determined to watch whether music returned if sound be human said will probably hear again chapter xii then oh blessed minister above keep in patience in ripend time unfold evil be here wrapt up in countenance shakespeare annette came almost breathless to emilys apartment in morning o maamselle

something to guess bya tall signor with longish face who walk so stately used to wear such high feather in hat used often to look down upon ground when people spoke to to look at people from under eyebrow a be so dark frowning have seen often often at venice maam then be so intimate with signor too now think of wonder what must be afraid of in lonely old castle that must shut up for be come abroad now for met on rampart just minute trembled when saw for always be afraid of somehow determined must not let see so went up to made low curtesy be welcome to castle signor orsino said o be signor orsino then said emily yes maamselle signor orsino who caused that venetian gentleman to be killed have be popping about from place to place ever since a hear good god exclaimed emily recovering from shock of intelligence be come to udolpho doe well to endeavour to conceal yes maamselle if be desolate place must conceal without shutting up in one room who must think of coming to look for here be sure must a soon think of going to look for anybody in other world there be truth in said emily who must now have concluded be orsinos music have heard on preceding night have not known that have taste skill in art though be unwilling to add to number of annettes surprise by mentioning subject of own enquired whether person in castle played on musical instrument o yes maamselle there be benedetto play great drum to admiration then there be launcelot trumpeter nay for matter ludovico can play on trumpetbut be ill now remember once emily interrupted have heard other music

yes do maamselle know that nobody know anything about be plain therefore be gone way of first lady of castlenobody ever knew anything about emily leaned head upon hand be for time silent then telling annette wished to be alone latter left room remark of annette have revived emilys terrible suspicion concerning fate of madame montoni resolved to make effort to obtain certainty on subject by applying to montoni once more when annette returned few hour after told emily that porter of castle wished very much to speak with for that have something of importance to say spirit have however of late be so subject to alarm that new circumstance excited message from porter when first surprise be over made look round for lurking danger more suspiciously perhaps because have frequently remarked unpleasant air countenance of man now hesitated whether to speak with doubting even that request be only pretext to draw into danger little reflection showed improbability of blushed at weak fear will speak to annette said desire to come to corridor immediately annette departed soon after returned barnardine maamselle said dare not come to corridor lest must be discovered be so far from post dare not even leave gate for moment now if will come to at portal through roundabout passage told of without crossing court have that to tell will surprise must not come through court lest signor must see emily approving roundabout passage other part of request now positively refused to go tell said if have anything of consequence to impart will hear in corridor whenever have opportunity of coming thither annette went to deliver message be absent considerable time when returned wont do maamselle said barnardine have be considering time what can be done for be a much a place be worth to leave post now if will come to east rampart in dusk of evening can perhaps steal away tell have to say emily be surprised alarmed at secrecy man seemed to think so necessary hesitated whether to meet till considering that might mean to warn of serious danger resolved to go soon after sunset said will be at end of east rampart then watch will be set added recollecting how can barnardine pas unobserved be just what said to maam answered that have key of gate at end of rampart lead towards court must let through way a for sentinel there be none at end of terrace because place be guarded enough by high wall of castle east turret said at other end be too far off to see if be pretty duskyish well said emily must hear what have to tell therefore desire will go with to terrace evening desired might

signor montoni where be signor must speak with be in cedar chamber maam counselling with other signor be going to give sort of treat today to make up for what passed at last suppose people be very

alone girl went to deliver message to barnardine montoni be however so much engaged during whole day that emily have opportunity of seeking release from terrible suspense concerning aunt annette be employed in watching step in attending upon ludovico whom assisted by caterina nursed with utmost care emily be of course left much alone thought dwelt often on message of porter be employed in conjecturing subject occasioned sometimes imagined concerned fate of madame montoni at others that related to personal danger threatened cautious secrecy barnardine observed in conduct inclined to believe latter a hour of appointment drew near impatience increased at length sun set heard passing step of sentinel going to post waited only for annette to accompany to terrace who soon after came descended together when emily expressed apprehension of meeting montoni of guest o there be fear of maamselle said annette be set in to feasting yet barnardine know reached first terrace where sentinel demanded who passed emily having answered walked on to east rampart at entrance of be again stopped having again replied be permitted to proceed emily did not like to expose to discretion of men at hour impatient to withdraw from situation stepped hastily on in search of barnardine be not yet come leaned pensively on wall of rampart waited for gloom of twilight sat deep on surrounding object blending in soft confusion valley mountain wood whose tall head stirred by evening breeze gave only sound that stole on silence except faint faint chorus of distant voice arose from within castle what voice be said emily a fearfully listened be only signor guest carousing replied annette good god thought emily can man heart be so gay when have made being so wretched if indeed aunt be yet suffered to feel wretchedness o be own suffering may heart never never be hardened against of others looked up with sensation of horror to east turret near then stood light glimmered through grate of lower chamber of upper one be dark presently perceived person moving with lamp across lower room circumstance revived hope concerning madame montoni whom have vainly sought in apartment have appeared to contain only soldier accoutrement emily however determined to attempt outer door of turret a soon a barnardine must withdraw if be unfastened to make effort to discover aunt moment passed still barnardine did not appear emily becoming uneasy hesitated whether to wait longer must have sent annette to portal to hasten feared to be left alone for be now almost dark melancholy streak of red still lingered in west be only vestige of departed day strong interest however barnardines message have awakened overcame other apprehension still detained while be conjecturing with annette what must thus occasion absence heard key turn in lock of gate near presently saw man advancing be barnardine of whom emily hastily enquired what have to communicate desired that must tell quickly for be chilled with evening air said must dismiss maid lady said man in voice deep tone of shocked what have to tell be to only emily after hesitation desired annette to withdraw to little distance now friend what must say be silent moment a if considering then said that must cost place at least if came to signor ear must promise lady that nothing will ever make tell syllable of matter have be trusted in affair if be known that betrayed trust life perhaps might answer be concerned for lady resolved to tell paused emily thanked assured that might repose on discretion entreated to dispatch annette told in hall how unhappy be about signora montoni how much wished to know what be become of most true said emily eagerly can inform conjure tell worst without hesitation rested trembling arm upon wall can tell said barnardine paused emily have power to enforce entreaty can tell resumed barnardinebut what exclaimed emily recovering resolution here be maamselle said annette who having heard eager tone in emily pronounced word came running towards retire said barnardine sternly be not wanted a emily said nothing annette obeyed can tell repeated porterbut know not howyou be afflicted

none of business so said nothing few day ago signor sent for barnardine say arean honest man think can trust assured excellenza that must then say a near a can remember have affair in hand want to assist inthen told what be to do that will say nothing aboutit concerned only signora o heaven exclaimed emilywhat have done barnardine hesitated be silent what fiend must tempt to such act cried emily chilled with horror scarcely able to support fainting spirit be fiend said barnardine in gloomy tone of voice be now silentemily have not courage to enquire further barnardine seemed to shrink from telling more at length said be of use to think of past signor be cruel enough must be obeyed what signified refusing must have found others who have scruple have murdered then said emily in hollow inward voicei be talking with murderer barnardine stood silent while emily turned from attempted to leave place stay lady said deserve to think so stillsince can believe capable of such deed if be innocent tell quickly said emily in faint accent for feel will not be able to hear long will tell more said walked away emily have just strength enough to bid stay then to call annette on whose arm leaned walked slowly up rampart till heard step behind be barnardine again send away girl said will tell more must not go said emily what have to say may hear may so lady said will know more then be going though slowly when emilys anxiety overcoming resentment fear man behaviour have roused desired to stay bade annette retire signora be alive said for be prisoner though excellenza have shut up in chamber over great gate of court have charge of be going to have told might see herbut now emily relieved from unutterable load of anguish by speech have now only to ask barnardines forgiveness to conjure that must let visit aunt complied with le reluctance than expected told that if must repair on following night when signor be retired to rest to postern gate of castle must perhaps see madame montoni amid thankfulness emily felt for concession thought observed malicious triumph in manner when pronounced last word in next moment dismissed thought having again thanked commended aunt to pity assured that must herself reward must be punctual to appointment bade good night retired unobserved to chamber be considerable time before tumult of joy barnardines unexpected intelligence have occasioned allowed emily to think with clearness to be conscious of real danger still surrounded madame montoni when agitation subsided perceived that aunt be yet prisoner of man to whose vengeance avarice might fall sacrifice when further considered savage aspect of person who be appointed to guard madame montoni doom appeared to be already sealed for countenance of barnardine seemed to bear stamp of murderer when have looked upon felt inclined to believe that there be deed however black might not be prevailed upon to execute reflection brought to remembrance tone of voice in have promised to grant request to see prisoner mused upon long in uneasiness doubt sometimes even hesitated whether to trust with at lonely hour have appointed once only once struck that madame montoni might be already murdered that ruffian be appointed to decoy to secret place where life also be to be sacrificed to avarice of montoni who then must claim securely contested estate in languedoc consideration of enormity of such guilt did at length relieve from belief of probability not from doubt fear recollection of barnardines manner have occasioned from subject thought at length passed to

montoni companionsthe loud contest dissolute laugh choral song made hall re echo at length heard heavy gate of castle shut for night sound instantly sunk into silence be disturbed only by whispering step of person passing through gallery to remote room emily now judging to be about time when have heard music on preceding night dismissed annette gently opened casement to watch for return planet have so particularly noticed at recurrence of music be not yet risen with superstitious weakness kept eye fixed on part of hemisphere where must rise almost expecting that when appeared sound must return at length came serenely bright over eastern tower of castle heart trembled when perceived have scarcely courage to remain at casement lest returning music must confirm terror subdue little strength yet retained clock soon after struck one knowing to be about time when sound have occurred sat down in chair near casement endeavoured to compose spirit anxiety of expectation yet disturbed everything however remained still heard only solitary step of sentinel lulling murmur of wood below again leaned from casement again looked a if for intelligence to planet be now risen high above

athwart mind such a have tormented on preceding night knew how to trust to dismiss frequently occurred to barnardine might have deceived concerning madame montoni whose murderer perhaps really be that have deceived by order of montoni more easily to draw into of desperate design of latter terrible suspicion madame montoni no longer lived thus came accompanied by one not le dreadful for unless crime by aunt have suffered be instigated merely by resentment unconnected with profit motive upon montoni did not appear very likely to act object must be unattained till niece be also dead to whom montoni knew that wife estate must descend emily remembered word have informed that contested estate in france must devolve to if madame montoni died without consigning to husband former obstinate perseverance of aunt made too probable that have to last withheld at instant recollecting barnardines manner on preceding night now believed what have then fancied that expressed malignant triumph shuddered at recollection confirmed fear determined not to meet on terrace soon after be inclined to consider suspicion a extravagant exaggeration of timid harassed mind must not believe montoni liable to such preposterous depravity a of destroying from one motive wife niece blamed for suffering romantic imagination to carry so far beyond bound of probability determined to endeavour to check rapid flight lest must sometimes extend into madness still however shrunk from thought of meeting barnardine on terrace at midnight still wish to be relieved from terrible suspense concerning aunt to see to sooth suffering made hesitate what to do yet how be possible annette can pas to terrace at hour said recollecting sentinel will stop signor montoni will hear of affair o maamselle be well thought of replied annette be what barnardine told about gave key bade say unlocks door at end of vaulted gallery that open near end of east rampart so that need not pas of men on watch bade say too that reason for requesting to come to terrace be because must take to place want to go to without opening great door of hall grate so heavily emilys spirit be somewhat calmed by explanation seemed to be honestly given to annette why did desire must come alone annette said why be what asked maamselle say why be young lady to come alonesurely may come with harm can do said nonoi tell not in gruff way nay say have be trusted in a great affair a warrant hard matter if cant keep secret now still must say nothing butnonono well say if will only trust will tell great secret be told month ago have never opened lip about yetso need not be afraid of telling must not do then maamselle went so far a to offer beautiful new sequin that ludovico gave for keepsake must not have parted with for st marcos place even must not do now what can be reason of know know maam who be going to see pray did barnardine tell maamselle that did not emily enquired who did annette showed that must keep secret during remainder of day emilys mind be agitated with doubt fear contrary determination on subject of meeting barnardine on rampart submitting to guidance scarcely knew whither pity for aunt anxiety for alternately swayed determination night came before have decided upon conduct heard castle clock strike eleventwelveand yet mind wavered time however be now come when must hesitate no longer then interest felt for aunt overcame other consideration bidding annette follow to outer door of vaulted gallery there await return descended from chamber castle be perfectly still great hall where so lately have witnessed scene of dreadful contention now returned only whispering footstep of two solitary figure gliding fearfully between pillar gleamed only to feeble lamp carried emily deceived by long shadow of pillar by catching light between often stopped imagining saw person moving in distant obscurity of perspective a passed pillar feared to turn eye toward almost expecting to see figure start out from behind broad shaft reached however vaulted gallery without interruption unclosed outer door with trembling hand charging annette not to quit to keep little open that might be heard if called delivered to lamp did not dare to take herself because of men on watch alone stepped out upon dark terrace everything be so still that feared lest own light step must be heard by distant sentinel walked cautiously towards spot where have before met barnardine listening for sound looking onward through gloom in search of at length be startled by deep voice spoke near paused uncertain whether be till spoke again then recognised hollow tone of barnardine who have be punctual to moment be at appointed place resting on rampart wall after chiding for not coming sooner saying that have be waiting nearly hour desired emily who made reply to follow to door through have entered terrace while unlocked looked back to that have left observing ray of lamp stream through small opening be certain that annette be still there remote situation must little befriend emily after have quitted terrace when barnardine unclosed gate dismal aspect of passage beyond shown by torch burning on pavement made shrink from following alone refused to go unless annette might accompany however barnardine absolutely refused to permit mingling at same time with refusal such artful circumstance to heighten pity curiosity of emily towards aunt that at length consented to follow alone to portal then took up torch led along passage at extremity of unlocked door whence descended few step into chapel a barnardine held up torch to light emily observed to be in ruin immediately recollected former conversation of annette concerning with very unpleasant emotion looked fearfully on almost roofless wall green with damp on gothic point of window where ivy briony have long supplied place of glass ran mantling among broken capital of column have once supported roof barnardine stumbled over broken pavement voice a uttered sudden oath be returned in hollow echo made more terrific emilys heart sunk still followed turned out of what have be principal aisle of chapel down step lady said barnardine a descended flight appeared to lead into vault emily paused on top demanded in tremulous tone whither be conducting to portal said barnardine can not go through chapel to portal said emily signora lead to inner court dont choose to unlock way will reach outer court presently emily still hesitated fearing not only to go on since have gone thus far to irritate barnardine by refusing to go further come lady said man who have nearly reached bottom of flight make little haste can not wait here night whither do step lead said emily yet pausing to portal repeated barnardine in angry tone will wait no longer a said moved on with light emily fearing to provoke by further delay reluctantly followed from step proceeded through passage adjoining vault wall of be dropping with unwholesome dew vapour crept along ground made torch burn so dimly that emily expected moment to see extinguished barnardine must scarcely find way a advanced vapour thickened barnardine believing torch be expiring stopped for moment to trim a then rested against pair of iron gate opened from passage emily saw by uncertain flash of light vault beyond near heap of earth seemed to surround open grave object in such scene must at time have disturbed now be shocked by instantaneous presentiment that be grave of unfortunate aunt that treacherous barnardine be leading to destruction obscure terrible place to have conducted seemed to justify thought be place suited for murder receptacle for dead where deed of horror might be committed vestige appear to proclaim emily be so overwhelmed with terror that for moment be unable to determine what conduct to pursue then considered that must be vain to attempt escape from barnardine by flight since length intricacy of way have passed must soon enable to overtake who be unacquainted with turning whose feebleness must not suffer to run long with swiftness feared equally to irritate by disclosure of suspicion refusal to accompany further certainly must do since be already a much in power a be possible must be if proceeded at length determined to suppress a far a must appearance of apprehension to follow silently whither designed to lead pale with horror anxiety now waited till barnardine have trimmed torch a sight glanced again upon grave must not forbear enquiring for whom be prepared took eye from torch fixed upon face without speaking faintly repeated question man shaking torch passed on followed trembling to second flight of step having ascended door delivered into first court of castle a crossed light showed high black wall around fringed with long grass dank weed found scanty soil among mouldering stone heavy buttress with here there between narrow grate admitted freer circulation of air to court massy iron gate led to castle whose clustering turret appeared above opposite huge tower arch of portal in scene large uncouth person of barnardine bearing torch formed characteristic figure barnardine be wrapt in long dark cloak scarcely allowed kind of half boot sandal be laced upon leg to appear showed only point of broad sword usually wore slung in belt across shoulder on head be heavy flat velvet cap somewhat resembling turban in be short feather visage beneath showed strong feature countenance furrowed with line of cunning darkened by habitual discontent view of court however reanimated emily who a crossed silently towards portal began to hope that own fear not treachery of barnardine have deceived looked anxiously up at first casement appeared above lofty arch of portcullis be dark enquired whether belonged to chamber where madame montoni be confined emily spoke low barnardine perhaps did not hear question for returned answer soon after entered postern door of gateway brought to foot of narrow staircase wound up one of tower up staircase signora lie said barnardine lie repeated emily faintly a began to ascend lie in upper chamber said barnardine a passed up wind poured through narrow cavity in wall made torch flare threw stronger gleam upon grim sallow countenance of barnardine discovered more fully desolation of placethe rough stone wall spiral stair black with age suit of ancient armour with iron visor that hung upon wall appeared trophy of former victory having reached landing place may wait here lady said applying key to door of chamber while go up tell signora be coming that ceremony be unnecessary replied emily aunt will rejoice to see be not so sure of said barnardine pointing to room have opened come in here lady while step up emily surprised somewhat shocked did not dare to oppose further a be turning away with torch desired must not leave in darkness looked around observing tripod lamp stood on stair lighted gave to emily who stepped forward into large old chamber closed door a listened anxiously to departing step thought descended instead of ascending stair gust of wind whistled round portal must not allow to hear distinctly other sound still however listened perceiving step in room above where have affirmed madame montoni to be anxiety increased though considered that thickness of floor in strong building might prevent sound reaching from upper chamber next moment in pause of wind distinguished barnardines step descending to court then thought heard voice rising gust again overcoming other sound emily to be certain on point moved softly to door on attempting to open discovered be fastened horrid apprehension have lately assailed returned at instant with redoubled force longer appeared like exaggeration of timid spirit seemed to have be sent to warn of fate now did not doubt that madame montoni have be murdered perhaps in very chamber that be brought hither for same purpose countenance manner recollected word of barnardine when have spoken of aunt confirmed worst fear for moment be incapable of considering of mean by might attempt escape still listened heard footstep on stair in room above thought however that again distinguished barnardines voice below went to grated window opened upon court to enquire further here plainly heard hoarse accent mingling with blast swept by be lost again so quickly that meaning must not be interpreted then light of torch seemed to issue from portal below flashed across court long shadow of man who be under arch way appeared upon pavement emily from hugeness of sudden portrait concluded to be that of barnardine other deep tone passed in wind soon convinced be not alone that companion be not person very liable to pity when spirit have overcome first shock of situation held up lamp to examine if chamber afforded possibility of escape be spacious room whose wall wainscoted with rough oak showed casement grated one emily have left other door than by have entered feeble ray of lamp however did not allow to see at once full extent perceived furniture except indeed iron chair fastened in centre of chamber immediately over depending on chain from ceiling hung iron ring having gazed upon for time with wonder horror next observed iron bar below made for purpose of confining foot on arm of chair be ring of same metal a continued to survey concluded that be instrument of torture struck that poor wretch have once be fastened in chair have there be starved to death be chilled by thought what be agony when in next moment occurred to that aunt might have be one of victim that might be next acute pain seized head be scarcely able to hold lamp looking round for support be seating unconsciously in iron chair suddenly perceiving where be started from in horror sprung towards remote end of room here again looked round for seat to sustain perceived only dark curtain descending from ceiling to floor be drawn along whole side of chamber ill a be appearance of curtain struck paused to gaze upon in wonder apprehension seemed to conceal recess of chamber wished yet dreaded to lift to discover what veiled twice be withheld by recollection of terrible spectacle daring hand have formerly unveiled in apartment of castle till suddenly conjecturing that concealed body of murdered aunt seized in fit of desperation drew aside beyond appeared corpse stretched on kind of low couch be crimsoned with human blood a be floor beneath feature deformed by death be ghastly horrible more than one livid wound appeared in face emily bending over body gazed for moment with eager frenzied eye in next lamp dropped from hand fell senseless at foot of couch when sens returned found surrounded by men among whom be barnardine who be lifting from floor then bore along chamber be sensible of what passed extreme languor of spirit did not permit to speak move even to feel distinct fear carried down staircase by have ascended when having reached arch way stopped one of men taking torch from barnardine opened small door be cut in great gate a stepped out upon road light bore showed several men on horseback in waiting whether be freshness of air revived emily that object now saw roused spirit of alarm suddenly spoke made ineffectual effort to disengage from grasp of ruffian who held barnardine meanwhile called loudly for torch while distant voice answered several person approached in same instant light flashed upon court of castle again vociferated for torch men hurried emily through gate at short distance under shelter of castle wall perceived fellow who have taken light from porter holding to man busily employed in altering saddle of horse round be several horseman looking on whose harsh feature received full glare of torch while broken ground beneath opposite wall with tufted shrub that overhung summit embattled watch tower above be reddened with gleam fading gradually away left remoter rampart wood below to obscurity of night what do waste time for there said barnardine with oath a approached horseman dispatchdispatch saddle will be ready in minute replied man who be buckling at whom barnardine now swore again for negligence emily calling feebly for help be hurried towards horse while ruffian disputed on to place one designed for not being ready at moment cluster of light issued from great gate immediately heard shrill voice of annette above of several other person who advanced in same moment distinguished montoni cavigni followed by number of ruffian faced fellow to whom no longer looked with terror with hope for at instant did not tremble at thought of danger might await within castle whence so lately so anxiously have wished to escape threatened from without have engrossed apprehension short contest ensued between party in that of montoni however be presently victor horseman perceiving that number be against being perhaps not very warmly interested in affair have undertaken galloped off while barnardine have run far enough to be lost in darkness emily be led back into castle a repassed court remembrance of what have seen in portal chamber came with horror to mind when soon after heard gate close shut once more within castle wall shuddered for herself almost forgetting danger have escaped must scarcely think that anything le precious than liberty peace be to be found beyond montoni ordered emily to await in cedar parlour whither soon followed then sternly questioned on mysterious affair though now viewed with horror a murderer of aunt scarcely knew what said in reply to impatient enquiry answer manner convinced that have not taken voluntary part in late scheme dismissed upon appearance of servant whom have ordered to attend that might enquire further into affair discover who have be accomplice in emily have be time in apartment before tumult of mind allowed to remember several of past circumstance then again dead form curtain in portal chamber have disclosed came to fancy uttered groan terrified annette more a emily forbore to satisfy curiosity on subject of for feared to trust with so fatal secret lest indiscretion must call down immediate vengeance of montoni on thus compelled to bear within own mind whole horror of secret oppressed reason seemed to totter under intolerable weight often fixed wild vacant look on annette when spoke either did not hear answered from purpose long fit of abstraction succeeded annette spoke repeatedly voice seemed not to make impression on sense of long agitated emily who sat fixed silent except now then heaved heavy sigh without tear terrified at condition annette at length left room to inform montoni of who have just dismissed servant without having made discovery on subject of enquiry wild description girl now gave of emily induced to follow immediately to chamber at sound of voice emily turned eye gleam of recollection seemed to shoot athwart mind for immediately rose from seat moved slowly to remote part of room spoke to in accent somewhat softened from usual harshness regarded with kind of half curious half terrified look answered only yes to whatever said mind still seemed to retain other impression than of fear of disorder annette must give explanation montoni having attempted for time to persuade emily to talk retired after ordering annette to remain with during night to inform in morning of condition when be gone emily again came forward asked who be that have be there to disturb annette said be signorsignor montoni emily repeated name after several time a if did not recollect then suddenly groaned relapsed into abstraction with difficulty annette led to bed emily examined with eager frenzied eye before lay down then pointing turned with shuddering emotion to annette who now more terrified went towards door that might bring one of female servant to pas night with emily observing going called by name then in naturally soft plaintive tone of voice begged that too must not forsake herfor since father died added sighing everybody forsakes father maamselle said annette be dead before knew be indeed rejoined emily tear began to flow now wept silently long after becoming quite calm at length sunk to sleep annette having have discretion enough not to interrupt tear girl a affectionate a be simple lost in moment former fear of remaining in chamber watched alone by emily during whole night chapter ii unfold what world what vast region hold th immortal mind hath forsook mansion in fleshly nook il penseroso emilys mind be refreshed by sleep on waking in morning looked with surprise on annette who sat sleeping in chair beside bed then endeavoured to recollect circumstance of preceding night be swept from memory seemed to retain trace of what have passed be still gazing with surprise on annette when latter awoke o dear maamselle do know cried know certainly replied emily be annette why be sitting by thus o have be very ill maamsellevery ill indeed be sure thought be very strange said emily still trying to recollect pastbut think do remember that fancy have be haunted by frightful dream good god added suddenly startingsurely be nothing more than dream fixed terrified look upon annette who intending to quiet said yes maamselle be more than dream be over now be murdered then said emily in inward voice shuddering instantaneously annette screamed for being ignorant of circumstance to emily referred attributed manner to disordered fancy when have explained to what own speech alluded emily recollecting attempt have be made to carry off asked if contriver of have be discovered annette replied that have not though might easily be guessed at then told emily might thank for deliverance who endeavouring to command emotion remembrance of aunt have occasioned appeared calmly to listen to annette though in truth heard scarcely word be said so maamselle continued latter be determined to be even with barnardine for refusing to tell secret by finding out so watched on terrace a soon a have opened door at end stole out from castle to try to follow for say be sure good can be planned why secrecy so sure enough have not bolted door after when opened saw by glimmer of torch at other end of passage way be going followed light at distance till came to vault of chapel there be afraid to go further for have heard strange thing about vault then again be afraid to go back in darkness by so by time barnardine have trimmed light have resolved to follow did so till came to great court there be afraid must see so stopped at door again watched across to gate when be gone up stair whipt after there a stood under gateway heard horse foot without several men talking heard swearing at barnardine for not bringing out just then have like to have caught for came down stair again have hardly time to get out of way have heard enough of secret now determined to be even with to save too maamselle for guessed to be new scheme of count morano though be gone away ran into castle have hard work to find way through passage under chapel what be very strange quite forgot to look for ghost have told about though must not go into place again by for world luckily signor signor cavigni be up so have soon train at heel sufficient to frighten barnardine rogue together annette ceased to speak emily still appeared to listen at length said suddenly think will go to myselfwhere be annette asked who be meant signor montoni replied emily must speak with annette now remembering order have given on preceding night respecting young lady rose said must seek honest girl suspicion of count morano be perfectly just emily too when thought on scheme have attributed to montoni who have not doubt on subject also began to believe that be by direction of morano that poison have formerly be mingled with wine profession of repentance morano have made to emily under anguish of wound be sincere at moment offered have mistaken subject of sorrow for while thought be condemning cruelty of late design be lamenting only state of suffering to have reduced a suffering abated former view revived till health being re established again found ready for enterprise difficulty porter of castle who have served on former occasion willingly accepted second bribe having concerted mean of drawing emily to gate morano publicly left hamlet whither have be carried after affray withdrew with people to at several mile distance from thence on night agreed upon by barnardine who have discovered from thoughtless prattle of annette most probable mean of decoying emily count sent back servant to castle while awaited arrival at hamlet with intention of carrying immediately to venice how second scheme be frustrated have already appeared violent various passion with italian lover be now agitated on return to city can only be imagined annette having made report to montoni of emilys health of request to see replied that might attend in cedar room in about hour be on subject pressed so heavily on mind that emily wished to speak to yet did not distinctly know what good purpose must answer sometimes even recoiled in horror from expectation of presence wished also to petition though scarcely dared to believe request must be granted that must permit since aunt be more to return to native country a moment of interview approached agitation increased so much that almost resolved to excuse under what must scarcely be called pretence of illness when considered what must be said concerning fate of aunt be equally hopeless a to event of entreaty terrified a to effect upon vengeful spirit of montoni yet to pretend ignorance of death appeared in degree to be sharing criminality indeed event be only ground on emily must rest petition for leaving udolpho while thought thus wavered message be brought importing that montoni must not see till next day spirit be then relieved for moment from almost intolerable weight of apprehension annette said fancied chevalier be going out to war again for courtyard be filled with horse heard that rest of party who went out before be expected at castle heard one of soldier too added say to comrade that must warrant theyd bring home rare deal of bootyso think if signor can with safe conscience send people out robbingwhy be business of mine only wish be once safe out of castle if have not be for poor ludovicos sake must have let count moranos people run away with for must have be serving good turn maamselle a well a annette might have continued thus talking for hour for interruption must have received from emily who be silent inattentive absorbed in thought passed whole of day in kind of solemn tranquillity such a be often result of faculty overstrained by suffering when night returned emily recollected mysterious strain of music that have lately heard in still felt degree of interest of hoped to hear again soothing sweetness influence of superstition now gained on weakness of long harassed mind looked with enthusiastic expectation to guardian spirit of father having dismissed annette for night determined to watch alone for return be not yet however near time when have heard music on former night anxious to call off thought from distressing subject sat down with one of few book that have brought from france mind refusing control became restless agitated went often to casement to listen for sound once thought heard voice then everything without casement remaining still concluded that fancy have deceived thus passed time till twelve oclock soon after distant sound that murmured through castle ceased sleep seemed to reign over emily then seated at casement where be soon recalled from reverie into sunk by very unusual sound not of music like low mourning of person in distress a listened heart faltered in terror became convinced that former sound be more than imaginary still at interval heard kind of feeble lamentation sought to discover whence came there be several room underneath adjoining rampart have be long shut up a sound probably rose from one of leaned from casement to observe whether light be visible there chamber a far a must perceive be quite dark at little distance on rampart below thought saw something moving faint twilight star shed did not enable to distinguish what be judged to be sentinel on watch removed light to remote part of chamber that might escape notice during further observation same object still appeared presently advanced along rampart towards window then distinguished something like human form silence with moved convinced be sentinel a drew near hesitated whether to retire thrilling curiosity inclined to stay dread of scarcely knew what warned to withdraw while paused figure came opposite to casement be stationary everything remained quiet have not heard even foot fall solemnity of silence with mysterious form saw subdued spirit so that be moving from casement when on sudden observed figure start away glide down rampart after be soon lost in obscurity of night emily continued to gaze for time on way have passed then retired within chamber musing on strange circumstance scarcely doubting that have witnessed supernatural appearance when spirit recovered composure looked round for other explanation remembering what have heard of daring enterprise of montoni occurred to that have just seen unhappy person who having be plundered by bandit be brought hither captive that music have formerly heard came from yet if have plundered still appeared improbable that must have brought to castle be also more consistent with manner of bandit to murder rob than to make prisoner what more than other circumstance contradicted supposition that be prisoner be that wandered on terrace without guard consideration made dismiss immediately first surmise afterwards be inclined to believe that count morano have obtained admittance into castle soon recollected difficulty danger must have opposed enterprise that if have so far succeeded to come alone in silence to casement at midnight be not conduct must have adopted particularly since private staircase communicating with apartment be known to neither must have uttered dismal sound have heard suggestion represented that might be person who have design upon castle mournful sound destroyed also probability thus enquiry only perplexed who what must be that haunted lonely hour complaining in such doleful accent in such sweet music for be still inclined to believe that former strain late appearance be connected have mean of ascertaining imagination again assumed empire roused mystery of superstition determined however to watch on following night when doubt might perhaps be cleared up almost resolved to address figure if must appear again chapter iii such be thick gloomy shadow damp oft seen in charnel vault sepulchre lingering sitting by new made grave milton on following day montoni sent second excuse to emily who be surprised at circumstance be very strange said to herself conscience tell purport of visit defers to avoid explanation now almost resolved to throw in way terror checked intention day passed a preceding one with emily except that degree of awful expectation concerning approaching night now somewhat disturbed dreadful calmness have pervaded mind towards evening second part of band have made first excursion among mountain returned to castle where a entered court emily in remote chamber heard loud shout strain of exultation like orgy of fury over horrid sacrifice even feared be about to commit barbarous deed conjecture from however annette soon relieved by telling that people be only exulting over plunder have brought with circumstance still further confirmed in belief that montoni have really commenced to be captain of bandit meant to retrieve broken fortune by plunder of traveller indeed when considered circumstance of situationin armed almost inaccessible castle retired far among recess of wild solitary mountain along whose distant skirt be scattered town city whither wealthy traveller be continually passingthis appeared to be situation of others most suited for success of scheme of rapine yielded to strange thought that montoni be become captain of robber character also unprincipled dauntless cruel enterprising seemed to fit for situation delighting in tumult in struggle of life be equally stranger to pity to fear very courage be sort of animal ferocity not noble impulse of principle such a inspirits mind against oppressor in cause of oppressed constitutional hardiness of nerve can not feel that therefore can not fear emilys supposition however natural be in part erroneous for be stranger to state of country

of life that midnight council be held at mansion in venice at orsino other member of present community then assisted with suggestion have since executed with wreck of fortune on return of night emily resumed station at casement there be now moon a rose over tufted wood yellow light served to show lonely terrace surrounding object more distinctly than twilight of star have done promised emily to assist observation must mysterious form return on subject again wavered in conjecture hesitated whether to speak to figure to strong almost irresistible interest urged terror at interval made reluctant to do so if be person who have design upon castle said curiosity may prove fatal to yet mysterious music lamentation heard must surely have proceeded from if so can not be enemy then thought of unfortunate aunt shuddering with grief horror suggestion of imagination seized mind with force of truth believed that form have seen be supernatural trembled breathed with difficulty icy coldness touched cheek fear for while overcame judgment resolution now forsook determined if figure must appear not to speak to thus time passed a sat at casement awed by expectation by gloom stillness of midnight for saw obscurely in moonlight only mountain wood cluster of tower formed west angle of castle terrace below heard sound except now then lonely watch word passed by sentinel on duty afterwards step of men who came to relieve guard whom knew at distance on rampart by pike glittered in moonbeam then by few short word in hailed fellow of night emily retired within chamber while passed casement when returned to be again quiet be now very late be wearied with watching began to doubt reality of what have seen on preceding night still lingered at window for mind be too perturbed to admit of sleep moon shone with clear lustre afforded complete view of terrace saw only solitary sentinel pacing at one end of at length tired with expectation withdrew to seek rest such however be impression left on mind by music complaining have formerly heard a well a by figure fancied have seen that determined to repeat watch on following night montoni on next day took notice of emilys appointed visit more anxious than before to see sent annette to enquire at what hour must admit mentioned eleven oclock emily be punctual to moment at called up fortitude to support shock of presence dreadful recollection enforced be with several of officer in cedar room on observing whom paused agitation increased while continued to converse with apparently not observing till of officer turning round saw emily uttered exclamation be hastily retiring when montonis voice arrested in faultering accent saidi must speak with signor montoni if be at leisure be friend replied must say may hear emily without replying turned from rude gaze of chevalier montoni then followed to hall whence led to small room of shut door with violence a looked on dark countenance again thought saw murderer of aunt mind be so convulsed with horror that have not power to recall thought enough to explain purport of visit to trust with mention of madame montoni be more than dared montoni at length impatiently enquired what have to say have time for trifling added moment be important emily then told that wished to return to france came to beg that must permit to do sobut when looked surprised enquired for motive of request hesitated became paler than before trembled have nearly sunk at foot observed emotion with apparent indifference interrupted silence by telling must be gone emily however recalled spirit sufficiently to enable to repeat request when montoni absolutely refused slumbering mind be roused can no longer remain here with propriety sir said may be allowed to ask by what right detain be will that remain here said montoni laying hand on door to go let suffice emily considering that have appeal from will forbore to dispute right made feeble effort to persuade to be just while aunt lived sir said in tremulous voice residence here be not improper now that be more may surely be permitted to depart stay can not benefit sir will only distress who told that madame montoni be dead said montoni with inquisitive eye emily hesitated for nobody have told so did not dare to avow having seen that spectacle in portal chamber have compelled to belief who told so repeated more sternly ala know too well replied emily spare on terrible subject sat down on bench to support if wish to see said montoni may lie in east turret now left room without awaiting reply returned to cedar chamber where such of chevalier a have not before seen emily began to rally on discovery have made montoni did not appear disposed to bear mirth changed subject having talked with subtle orsino on plan of excursion meditated for future day friend advised that must lie in wait for enemy verezzi impetuously opposed reproached orsino with want of spirit swore that if montoni must let lead on fifty men must conquer must oppose orsino smiled contemptuously montoni smiled too also listened verezzi then proceeded with vehement declamation assertion till be stopped by argument of orsino knew not how to answer better than by invective fierce spirit detested cunning caution of orsino whom constantly opposed whose inveterate though silent hatred have long ago incurred montoni be calm observer of whose different qualification knew how to bend opposite character to perfection of own design verezzi in heat of opposition now did not scruple to accuse orsino of cowardice at countenance of latter while made reply be overspread with livid paleness montoni who watched lurking eye saw put hand hastily into bosom verezzi whose face glowing with crimson formed striking contrast to complexion of orsino remarked not action continued boldly declaiming against coward to cavigni who be slily laughing at vehemence at silent mortification of orsino when latter retiring few step behind drew forth stilletto to stab adversary in back montoni arrested half extended arm with significant look made return poniard into bosom unseen by except for most of party be disputing at distant window on situation of dell where meant to form ambuscade when verezzi have turned round deadly hatred expressed on feature of opponent raising for first time suspicion of intention laid hand on sword then seeming to recollect strode up to montoni signor said with significant look at orsino be not band of assassin if have business for brave men employ on expedition will have last drop of blood if have only work for cowardskeep pointing to orsino let quit udolpho orsino still more incensed again drew forth stilletto rushed towards verezzi who at same instant advanced with sword when montoni rest of party interfered separated be conduct of boy said montoni to verezzi not of man be more moderate in speech moderation be virtue of coward retorted verezzi be moderate in everythingbut in fear accept word said montoni turning upon with fierce haughty look drawing sword out of scabbard with heart cried verezzi though did not mean for directed pas at montoni while fought villain orsino made attempt to stab verezzi be again prevented combatant be at length separated after very long violent dispute reconciled montoni then left room with orsino whom detained in private consultation for considerable time emily meanwhile stunned by last word of montoni forgot for moment declaration that must continue in castle while thought of unfortunate aunt who have said be laid in east turret in suffering remains of wife to lie thus long unburied there appeared degree of brutality more shocking than have suspected even montoni must practise after long struggle determined to accept permission to visit turret to take last look of ill fated aunt with design returned to chamber while waited for annette to accompany endeavoured to acquire fortitude sufficient to support through approaching scene for though trembled to encounter knew that to remember performance of last act of duty must hereafter afford consoling satisfaction annette came emily mentioned purpose from former endeavoured to dissuade though without effect annette be with much difficulty prevailed upon to accompany to turret consideration must make promise to enter chamber of death now left corridor having reached foot of staircase emily have formerly ascended annette declared must go further emily proceeded alone when saw track of blood have before observed spirit fainted being compelled to rest on stair almost determined to proceed further pause of few moment restored resolution went on a drew near landing place upon upper chamber opened remembered that door be formerly fastened apprehended that might still be so in expectation however be mistaken for door opened at once into dusky silent chamber round fearfully looked then slowly advanced when hollow voice spoke emily who be unable to speak to move from spot uttered sound of terror voice spoke again then thinking that resembled that of madame montoni emilys spirit be instantly roused rushed towards bed stood in remote part of room drew aside curtain within appeared pale emaciated face started back then again advanced shuddered a took up skeleton hand lay stretched upon quilt then let drop then viewed face with long unsettled gaze be that of madame montoni though so changed by illness that resemblance of what have be must scarcely be traced in what now appeared be still alive raising heavy eye turned on niece where have be so long said in same tone thought have forsaken do indeed live said emily at length be terrible apparition received answer again snatched up hand be substance exclaimed be coldcold a marble let fall o if really live speak said emily in voice of desperation may not lose sensessay know do live replied madame montoni buti feel that be about to die emily clasped hand held more eagerly groaned be silent for moment then emily endeavoured to soothe enquired what have reduced to present deplorable state montoni when removed to turret under improbable suspicion of having attempted life have ordered men employed on occasion to observe strict secrecy concerning to be influenced by double motive meant to debar from comfort of emilys visit to secure opportunity of privately dispatching must new circumstance occur to confirm present suggestion of suspecting mind consciousness of hatred deserved be natural enough must at first lead to attribute to attempt have be made upon life though there be other reason to believe that be concerned in atrocious design suspicion remained continued to confine in turret under strict guard without pity remorse have suffered to lie forlorn neglected under raging fever till have reduced to present state track of blood emily have seen on stair have flowed from unbound wound of one of men employed to carry madame montoni have received in late affray at night men having contented with securing door of prisoner room have retired from guard then be that emily at time of first enquiry have found turret so silent deserted when have attempted to open door of chamber aunt be sleeping occasioned silence have contributed to delude into belief that be more yet have terror permitted to persevere longer in call must probably have awakened madame montoni have be spared much suffering spectacle in portal chamber afterwards confirmed emilys horrible suspicion be corpse of man who have fallen in affray same have be borne into servant hall where took refuge from tumult man have lingered under wound for day soon after death body have be removed on couch on died for interment in vault beneath chapel through emily barnardine have passed to chamber emily after asking madame montoni thousand question concerning left sought montoni for more solemn interest felt for aunt made now regardless of resentment remonstrance might draw upon of improbability of granting what meant to entreat madame montoni be now dying sir said emily a soon a saw himyour resentment surely will not pursue to last moment suffer to be removed from forlorn room to own apartment to have necessary comfort administered of what service will be if be dying said montoni with apparent indifference service at leave of saving sir from few of pang of conscience must suffer when will be in same situation said emily with imprudent indignation of montoni soon made sensible by commanding to quit presence then forgetting resentment impressed only by compassion for piteous state of aunt dying without succour submitted to humble to montoni to adopt persuasive mean that might induce to relent towards wife for considerable time be proof against said looked at length divinity of pity beaming in emilys eye seemed to touch heart turned away ashamed of better feeling half sullen half relenting finally consented that wife must be removed to own apartment that emily must attend dreading equally that relief might arrive too late montoni might retract concession emily scarcely staid to thank for assisted by annette quickly prepared madame montonis bed carried cordial might enable feeble frame to sustain fatigue of removal madame be scarcely arrived in own apartment when order be given by husband that must remain in turret emily thankful that have made such dispatch hastened to inform of a well a that second removal must instantly prove fatal suffered wife to continue where be during day emily never left madame montoni except to prepare such little nourishing thing a judged necessary to sustain madame montoni received with quiet acquiescence though seemed sensible that must not save from approaching dissolution scarcely appeared to wish for life emily meanwhile watched over with most tender solicitude no longer seeing imperious aunt in poor object before sister of late beloved father in situation called for compassion kindness when night came determined to sit up with aunt latter positively forbade commanding to retire to rest annette alone to remain in chamber rest be indeed necessary to emily whose spirit frame be equally wearied by occurrence exertion of day must not leave madame montoni till after turn of midnight period then thought so critical by physician soon after twelve having enjoined annette to be wakeful to call must change appear for worse emily sorrowfully bade madame montoni good night withdrew to chamber spirit be more than usually depressed by piteous condition of aunt whose recovery scarcely dared to expect to own misfortune saw period inclosed a be in remote castle beyond reach of friend have possessed such beyond pity even of stranger while knew to be in power of man capable of action interest ambition might suggest occupied by melancholy reflection by anticipation a sad did not retire immediately to rest leaned thoughtfully on open casement scene before of wood mountain reposing in moonlight formed regretted contrast with state of mind lonely murmur of wood view of sleeping landscape gradually soothed emotion softened to tear continued to weep for time lost to everything to gentle sense of misfortune when at length took handkerchief from eye perceived before on terrace below figure have formerly observed stood fixed silent immediately opposite to casement on perceiving started back terror for time overcame curiosityat length returned to casement still figure be before now compelled to observe be utterly unable to speak a have formerly intended moon shone with clear light be perhaps agitation of mind that prevented distinguishing with degree of accuracy form before be still stationary began to doubt whether be really animated scattered thought be now so far returned a to remind that light exposed to dangerous observation be stepping back to remove when perceived figure move then wave what seemed to be arm a if to beckon while gazed fixed in fear repeated action now attempted to speak word died on lip went from casement to remove light a be doing heard from without faint groan listening not daring to return presently heard repeated good godwhat can mean said again listened sound came more after long interval of silence recovered courage enough to go to casement when again saw same appearance beckoned again again uttered low sound that groan be surely human said will speak who be cried emily in faint voice that wanders at late hour figure raised head suddenly started away glided down terrace watched for long while passing swiftly in moonlight heard footstep till sentinel from other extremity of rampart walked slowly along man stopped under window looking up called by name be retiring precipitately second summons inducing to reply soldier then respectfully asked if have seen anything pas on answering that have said more walked away down terrace emily following with eye till be lost in distance a be on guard knew must not go beyond rampart therefore resolved to await return soon after voice be heard at distance calling loudly then voice still more distant answered in next moment watch word be given passed along terrace a soldier moved hastily under casement called to enquire what have happened passed without regarding emilys thought returning to figure have seen can not be person who have design upon castle said one must conduct very differently must not venture where sentinel be on watch fix opposite to window where perceived must be observed much le must beckon utter sound of complaint can not be prisoner for how must obtain opportunity to wander thus if have be subject to vanity might have supposed figure to be inhabitant of castle who wandered under casement in hope of seeing of being allowed to declare admiration opinion never occurred to emily if have must have dismissed a improbable on considering that when opportunity of speaking have occurred have be suffered to pas in silence that even at moment in have spoken form have abruptly quitted place while mused two sentinel walked up rampart in earnest conversation of caught few word learned from that one of comrade have fallen down senseless soon after three other soldier appeared slowly advancing from bottom of terrace heard only low voice came at interval a drew near perceived to be voice of who walked in middle apparently supported by comrade again called to enquiring what have happened at sound of voice stopped looked up while repeated question be told that roberto fellow of watch have be seized with fit that cry a fell have caused false alarm be subject to fit said emily yes signora replied roberto if have not what saw be enough to have frightened pope be enquired emily trembling can not tell what be lady what saw how vanished replied soldier who seemed to shudder at recollection be person whom followed down rampart have occasioned alarm said emily endeavouring to conceal own person exclaimed manit be devil be not first time have seen will be last observed one of comrade laughing warrant not said well rejoined roberto may be a merry now a please be none so jocose other night sebastian when be on watch with launcelot launcelot need not talk of replied sebastian let remember how stood trembling unable to give word till man be gone if man have not come so silently upon must have seized soon made tell who be what man enquired emily be man lady said launcelot who stood by devil a comrade say what man who doe not live in castle must get within wall at midnight why might just a well pretend to march to venice get among senator when be counselling warrant must have more chance of getting out again alive than fellow that must catch within gate after dark so think have proved plainly enough that can be nobody life out of castle now will prove that can be nobody life in castlefor if didwhy must be afraid to be seen so after hope nobody will pretend to tell be anybody say again by holy pope be devil sebastian there know be not first time have seen when did see figure then before said emily half smiling who though thought conversation somewhat too much felt interest must not permit to conclude about week ago lady said sebastian taking up story where on rampart lady higher up did pursue that fled signora launcelot be on watch together everything be so still might have heard mouse stir when suddenly launcelot sayssebastian do see nothing turned head little to left a might bethus say hush said launcelotlook yonderjust by last cannon on rampart looked then thought did see something move there being light what star gave must not be certain stood quite silent to watch presently saw something pas along castle wall just opposite to why did not seize then cried soldier who have scarcely spoken till now aye why did not seize said roberto must have be there to have done replied sebastian must have be bold enough to have taken by throat though have be devil must not take such liberty perhaps because be not so well acquainted with a be a be saying stole by so quickly that have not time to get rid of surprise before be gone then knew be in vain to follow kept constant watch night saw no more next morning told of comrade who be on duty on other part of rampart what have seen have seen nothing laughed at be not till tonight that same figure walked again where did lose friend said emily to roberto when left lady replied man might see go down rampart be not till reached east terrace saw anything then moon shining bright saw something like shadow flitting before a be at distance stopped when turned corner of east tower where have seen figure not moment beforebut be gone a stood looking through old arch lead to east rampart where be sure have passed heard of sudden such soundit be not like groan cry shout anything ever heard in life heard only once be enough for for know nothing happened after till found comrade here about come said sebastian let go to poststhe moon be setting good night lady aye let go rejoined roberto good night lady good night holy mother guard said emily a closed casement retired to reflect upon strange circumstance have just occurred connecting with what have happened on former night endeavoured to derive from whole something more positive than conjecture imagination be inflamed while judgment be not enlightened terror of superstition again pervaded mind chapter iv there be one within besides thing that have heard seen recount most horrid sight seen by watch julius csar in morning emily found madame montoni nearly in same condition a on preceding night have slept little little have not refreshed smiled on niece seemed cheered by presence spoke only few word never named montoni who however soon after entered room wife when understood that be there appeared much agitated be entirely silent till emily rose from chair at bedside when begged in feeble voice that must not leave visit of montoni be not to sooth wife whom knew to be dying to console to ask forgiveness to make last effort to procure that signature must transfer estate in languedoc after death to rather than to emily be scene exhibited on part usual inhumanity on of madame montoni persevering spirit contending with feeble frame while emily repeatedly declared to willingness to resign claim to estate rather than that last hour of aunt must be disturbed by contention montoni however did not leave room till wife exhausted by obstinate dispute have fainted lay so long insensible that emily began to fear that spark of life be extinguished at length revived looking feebly up at niece whose tear be falling over made effort to speak word be unintelligible emily again apprehended be dying afterwards however recovered speech being somewhat restored by cordial conversed for considerable time on subject of estate in france with clearness precision directed niece where to find paper relative to have hitherto concealed from search of montoni earnestly charged never to suffer paper to escape soon after conversation madame montoni sunk into dose continued slumbering till evening when seemed better than have be since removal from turret emily never left for moment till long after midnight even then must not have quitted room have not aunt entreated that must retire to rest then obeyed more willingly because patient appeared somewhat recruited by sleep giving annette same injunction a on preceding night withdrew to own apartment spirit be wakeful agitated finding impossible to sleep determined to watch once more for mysterious appearance have so much interested alarmed be now second watch of night about time when figure have before appeared emily heard passing step of sentinel on rampart a changed guard when be again silent took station at casement leaving lamp in remote part of chamber that might escape notice from without moon gave faint uncertain light for heavy vapour surrounded often rolling over disk left scene below in total darkness be in one of moment of obscurity that observed small lambent flame moving at distance on terrace while gazed disappeared moon again emerging from lurid heavy thunder cloud turned attention to heaven where vivid lightning darted from cloud to cloud flashed silently on wood below loved to catch in momentary gleam gloomy landscape sometimes cloud opened light upon distant mountain while sudden splendour illumined recess of rock wood rest of scene remained in deep shadow at others partial feature of castle be revealed by glimpsethe ancient arch leading to east rampart turret above fortification beyond then perhaps whole edifice with tower dark massy wall pointed casement must appear vanish in instant emily looking again upon rampart perceived flame have seen before moved onward soon after thought heard footstep light appeared disappeared frequently while a watched glided under casement at same instant be certain that footstep passed darkness did not permit to distinguish object except flame moved away then by gleam of lightning perceived person on terrace anxiety of preceding night returned person advanced playing flame alternately appeared vanished emily wished to speak to end doubt whether figure be human supernatural courage failed a often a attempted utterance till light moved again under casement faintly demanded who passed friend replied voice what friend said emily somewhat encouraged who be what be light carry be anthonio one of signor soldier replied voice what be tapering light bear said emily see how dart upwardsand now vanishes light lady said soldier have appeared tonight a see on point of lance ever since have be on watch what mean can not tell be very strange said emily fellow guard continued man have same flame on arm say have sometimes seen before never did be lately come to castle for have not be long soldier how doe comrade account for said emily say be omen lady bodes good what harm can bode rejoined emily know not so much a lady whether emily be alarmed by omen not certainly be relieved from much terror by discovering man to be only soldier on duty immediately occurred to that might be who have occasioned so much alarm on preceding night there be however circumstance still required explanation a far a must judge by faint moonlight have assisted observation figure have seen did not resemble man in shape size besides be certain have carried no arm silence of step if step have moaning sound too have uttered strange disappearance be circumstance of mysterious import did not apply with probability to soldier engaged in duty of guard now enquired of sentinel whether have seen person besides fellow watch walking on terrace about midnight then briefly related what have observed be not on guard night lady replied man heard of what happened there be amongst who believe strange thing strange story too have long be told of castle be business of mine to repeat for part have reason to complain chief doe nobly by commend prudence said emily good night accept from added throwing small piece of coin then closing casement to put end to discourse when be gone opened again listened with gloomy pleasure to distant thunder began to murmur among mountain watched arrowy lightning broke over remoter scene pealing thunder rolled onward then reverbed by mountain other thunder seemed to answer from opposite horizon while accumulating cloud entirely concealing moon assumed red sulphureous tinge foretold violent storm emily remained at casement till vivid lightning now instant revealed wide horizon landscape below made no longer safe to do so went to couch unable to compose mind to sleep still listened in silent awe to tremendous sound seemed to shake castle to foundation have continued thus for considerable time when amidst uproar of storm thought heard voice raising to listen chamber door open annette enter with countenance of wild affright be dying maamselle lady be dying said emily started up ran to madame montonis room when entered aunt appeared to have fainted for be quite still insensible emily with strength of mind refused to yield to grief while duty required activity applied mean seemed likely to restore last struggle be overshe be gone for ever when emily perceived that effort be ineffectual interrogated terrified annette learned that madame montoni have fallen into doze soon after emilys departure in have continued until few minute before death wondered maamselle said annette what be reason lady did not seem frightened at thunder when be so terrified went often to bed to speak to appeared to be asleep till presently heard strange noise on going to saw be dying emily at recital shed tear have doubt that violent change in air tempest produced have effected fatal one on exhausted frame of madame montoni after deliberation determined that montoni must not be informed of event till morning for considered that might perhaps utter inhuman expression such a in present temper of spirit must not bear with annette alone therefore whom encouraged by own example performed of last solemn office for dead compelled to watch during night by body of deceased aunt during solemn period rendered more awful by tremendous storm shook air frequently addressed to heaven for support protection pious prayer may believe be accepted of god giveth comfort chapter v midnight clock have tolld hark bell of death beat slow heard ye note profound pause now now with rising knell fling to hollow gale sullen sound mason when montoni be informed of death of wife considered that have died without giving signature so necessary to accomplishment of wish sense of decency restrained expression of resentment emily anxiously avoided presence watched during two day two night with little intermission by corpse of late aunt mind deeply impressed with unhappy fate of object forgot fault unjust imperious conduct to herself remembering only suffering thought of only with tender compassion sometimes however must not avoid musing upon strange infatuation have proved so fatal to aunt have involved in labyrinth of misfortune from saw mean of escapingthe marriage with montoni when considered circumstance be more in sorrow than in angermore for purpose of indulging lamentation than reproach in pious care be not disturbed by montoni who not only avoided chamber where remains of wife be laid that part of castle adjoining to a if have apprehended contagion in death seemed to have given order respecting funeral emily began to fear meant to offer new insult to memory of madame montoni from apprehension be relieved when on evening of second day annette informed that interment be to take place night knew that montoni must not attend be so very grievous to to think that remains of unfortunate aunt must pas to grave without one relative friend to pay last decent rite that determined to be deterred by consideration for from observing duty must otherwise have shrunk from circumstance of following to cold vault to be to be carried by men whose air countenance seemed to stamp for murderer at midnight hour of silence privacy montoni have chosen for committing if possible to oblivion reliques of woman whom harsh conduct have at least contributed to destroy emily shuddering with emotion of horror grief assisted by annette prepared corpse for interment having wrapt in cerement covered with winding sheet watched beside till past midnight when heard approaching footstep of men who be to lay in earthy bed be with difficulty emily overcame emotion when door of chamber being thrown open gloomy countenance be seen by glare of torch carried two of without speaking lifted body on shoulder while third preceding with light descended through castle towards grave be in lower vault of chapel within castle wall have to cross two court towards east wing of castle adjoining chapel be like in ruin silence gloom of court have now little power over emilys mind occupied a be with more mournful idea scarcely heard low dismal hooting of night bird roosted among ivied battlement of ruin perceived still flittings of bat frequently crossed way when having entered chapel passed between mouldering pillar of aisle bearer stopped at flight of step led down to low arched door comrade having descended to unlock saw imperfectly gloomy abyss beyondsaw corpse of aunt carried down step ruffian like figure stood with torch at bottom to receive itall fortitude be lost in emotion of inexpressible grief terror turned to lean upon annette who be cold trembling like herself lingered so long on summit of flight that gleam of torch began to die away on pillar of chapel men be almost beyond view then gloom around awakening other fear sense of what considered to be duty overcoming reluctance descended to vault following echo of footstep faint ray pierced darkness till harsh grating of distant door be opened to receive corpse again appalled after pause of moment went on a entered vault saw between arch at distance men lay down body near edge of open grave where stood of montonis men priest whom did not observe till began burial service then lifting eye from ground saw venerable figure of friar heard in low voice equally solemn affecting perform service for dead at moment in let down body into earth scene be such a only dark pencil of domenichino perhaps must have done justice to fierce feature wild dress of condottieri bending with torch over grave into corpse be descending be contrasted by venerable figure of monk wrapt in long black garment cowl thrown back from pale face on light gleaming strongly showed line of affliction softened by piety few grey lock time have spared on temple while beside stood softer form of emily who leaned for support upon annette face half averted shaded by thin veil fell over figure mild beautiful countenance fixed in grief so solemn a admitted not of tear while thus saw committed untimely to earth last relative friend gleam thrown between arch of vault where here there broken ground marked spot in other body have be recently interred general obscurity beyond be circumstance that alone must have led on imagination of spectator to scene more horrible than even be pictured at grave of misguided unfortunate madame montoni when service be over friar regarded emily with attention surprise looked a if wished to speak to be restrained by presence of condottieri who a now led way to court amused with joke upon holy order endured in silence demanding only to be conducted safely to convent to emily listened with concern even horror when reached court monk gave blessing after lingering look of pity turned away to portal whither one of men carried torch while annette lighting preceded emily to apartment appearance of friar expression of tender compassion with have regarded have interested emily who though be at earnest supplication that montoni have consented to allow priest to perform last rite for deceased wife knew nothing concerning person till annette now informed that belonged to monastery situated among mountain at few mile distance superior who regarded montoni associate not only with aversion with terror have probably feared to offend by refusing request have therefore ordered monk to officiate at funeral who with meek spirit of christian have overcome reluctance to enter wall of such castle by wish of performing what considered to be duty a chapel be built on consecrated ground have not objected to commit to remains of late unhappy madame montoni several day passed with emily in total seclusion in state of mind partaking of terror for herself grief for departed at length determined to make other effort to persuade montoni to permit return to france why must wish to detain must scarcely dare to conjecture be too certain that did so absolute refusal have formerly given to departure allowed little hope that must now consent to horror presence inspired made defer from day to day mention of subject at last be awakened from inactivity only by message from desiring attendance at certain hour began to hope meant to resign now that aunt be more authority have usurped over till recollected that estate have occasioned so much contention be now hers then feared montoni be about to employ stratagem for obtaining that must detain prisoner till succeeded thought instead of overcoming with despondency roused latent power of fortitude into action property must willingly have resigned to secure peace of aunt resolved that common suffering of own must ever compel to give to montoni for valancourts sake also determined to preserve estate since must afford competency by hoped to secure comfort of future life a thought of indulged tenderness of tear anticipated delight of moment when with affectionate generosity might tell be own saw smile lighted up featuresthe affectionate regard spoke at once joy thanks at instant believed must brave suffering evil spirit of montoni might be preparing for remembering then for first time since aunt death paper relative to estate in question determined to search for a soon a interview with montoni be over with resolution met at appointed time waited to hear intention before renewed request with be orsino officer be standing near table covered with paper appeared to be examining sent for emily said montoni raising head that might be witness in business be transacting with friend orsino be required of will be to sign name to paper then took one up hurried unintelligibly over line laying before on table offered pen took be going to writewhen design of montoni came upon mind like flash of lightning trembled let pen fall refused to sign what have not read montoni affected to laugh at scruple taking up paper again pretended to read emily who still trembled on perceiving danger be astonished that own credulity have so nearly betrayed positively refused to sign paper montoni for time persevered in affecting to ridicule refusal when perceived by steady perseverance that understood design changed manner bade follow to room there told that have be willing to spare trouble of useless contest in affair where will be justice where must find law have therefore endeavoured to persuade rather than to compel to practice of duty a husband of late signora montoni added be heir of possessed estate therefore refused to in life time can no longer be withheld for own sake must undeceive respecting foolish assertion once made to in hearingthat estate must be yours if died without resigning to knew at moment have power to withhold from after decease think have more sense than to provoke resentment by advancing unjust claim be not in habit of flattering will therefore receive a sincere praise bestow when say that posse understanding superior to of sex that have none of contemptible foible frequently mark female charactersuch a avarice love of power latter make woman delight to contradict to tease when can not conquer if understand disposition mind hold in sovereign contempt common failing of sex montoni paused emily remained silent expecting for knew too well to believe must condescend to such flattery unless thought must promote own interest though have forborne to name vanity among foible of woman be evident that considered to be predominant one since designed to sacrifice to hers character understanding of whole sex judging a do resumed montoni can not believe will oppose where know can not conquer indeed that must wish to conquer be avaricious of property when have not justice on side think proper however to acquaint with alternative if have just opinion of subject in question will be allowed safe conveyance to france within short period if be so unhappy a to be misled by late assertion of signora will remain prisoner till be convinced of error emily calmly said be not so ignorant signor of law on subject a to be misled by assertion of person law in present instance give estate in question own hand will never betray right have be mistaken in opinion of appears rejoined montoni sternly speak boldly presumptuously upon subject understand for once be willing to pardon conceit of ignorance weakness of sex too from seems be not exempt claim allowance if persist in strainyou have everything to fear from justice from justice signor rejoined emily have nothing to feari have only to hope montoni looked at with vexation seemed considering what to say find that be weak enough resumed to credit idle assertion alluded to for own sake lament a to be of little consequence credulity can punish only must pity weakness of mind lead to so much suffering a be compelling to prepare for may find perhaps signor said emily with mild dignity that strength of mind be equal to justice of cause that can endure with fortitude when be in resistance of oppression speak like heroine said montoni contemptuously will see whether can suffer like one emily be silent left room recollecting that be for valancourts sake have thus resisted now smiled complacently upon threatened suffering retired to spot aunt have pointed out a repository of paper relative to estate where found a described since knew of better place of concealment than returned without examining content being fearful of discovery while must attempt perusal to own solitary chamber once more returned there thought again of late conversation with montoni of evil might expect from opposition to will power did not appear so terrible to imagination a be wont to do sacred pride be in heart taught to swell against pressure of injustice almost to glory in quiet sufferance of ill in cause have also interest of valancourt for object for first time felt full extent of own superiority to montoni despised authority till now have only feared a sat musing peal of laughter rose from terrace on going to casement saw with inexpressible surprise three lady dressed in gala habit of venice walking with several gentleman below gazed in astonishment made remain at window regardless of being observed till group passed under one of stranger looking up perceived feature of signora livona with whose manner have be so much charmed day after arrival at venice who have be there introduced at table of montoni discovery occasioned emotion of doubtful joy for be matter of joy comfort to know that person of mind so gentle a of signora livona seemed to be be near yet there be something so extraordinary in being at castle circumstanced a now be evidently by gaiety of air with own consent that very painful surmise arose concerning character thought be so shocking to emily whose affection fascinating manner of signora have won appeared so improbable when remembered manner that dismissed almost instantly on annettes appearance however enquired concerning stranger former be a eager to tell a emily be to learn be just come maamselle said annette with two signor from venice be glad to see such christian face once againbut what can mean by coming here must surely be stark mad to come freely to such place a yet do come freely for seem merry enough be sure be taken prisoner perhaps said emily taken prisoner exclaimed annette indeed maamselle not remember one of very well at venice came two three time to signor know maamselle be said did not believe word of itit be said that signor liked better than must do then why say bring to lady very true said ludovico looked a if knew more too emily desired annette must endeavour to learn who lady be a well a must concerning then changed subject spoke of distant france ah maamselle will never see more said annette almost weepingi must come on travel forsooth emily tried to sooth to cheer with hope in scarcely indulged howhow maamselle must leave france leave mon valancourt too said annette sobbing iiam sure if ludovico have be in france must never have left why do lament quitting france then said emily trying to smile since if have remained there must not have found ludovico ah maamselle only wish be out of frightful castle serving in france must care about nothing else thank good annette for affectionate regard time will come hope when may remember expression of wish with pleasure annette departed on business emily sought to lose sense of own care in visionary scene of poet have again to lament irresistible force of circumstance over taste power of mind that requires spirit at ease to be sensible even to abstract pleasure of pure intellect enthusiasm of genius with pictured scene now appeared cold dim a mused upon book before involuntarily exclaimed be indeed passage have so often given exquisite delight where did charm existwas in mind in imagination of poet lived in said pausing fire of poet be vain if mind of reader be not tempered like own however may be inferior to in power emily must have pursued train of thinking because relieved from more painful reflection found again that thought can not always be controlled by will hers returned to consideration of own situation in evening not choosing to venture down to rampart where must be exposed to rude gaze of montonis associate walked for air in gallery adjoining chamber on reaching further end of heard distant sound of merriment laughter be wild uproar of riot not cheering gaiety of tempered mirth seemed to come from part of castle where montoni usually be such sound at time when aunt have be so few day dead particularly shocked consistent a be with late conduct of montoni a listened thought distinguished female voice mingling with laughter confirmed worst surmise concerning character of signora livona companion be evident that have not be brought hither by compulsion beheld in remote wild of apennine surrounded by men whom considered to be little le than ruffian worst associate amid scene of vice from soul recoiled in horror be at moment when scene of present future opened to imagination that image of valancourt failed in influence resolution shook with dread thought understood horror montoni be preparing for shrunk from encounter with such remorseless vengeance a must inflict disputed estate now almost determined to yield at once whenever must again call upon that might regain safety freedom then remembrance of valancourt must steal to heart plunge into distraction of doubt continued walking in gallery till evening threw melancholy twilight through painted casement deepened gloom of oak wainscoting around while distant perspective of corridor be so much obscured a to be discernible only by glimmering window terminated along vaulted hall passage below peal of laughter echoed faintly at interval to remote part of castle seemed to render succeeding stillness more dreary emily however unwilling to return to more forlorn chamber whither annette be not yet come still paced gallery a passed door of apartment where have once dared to lift veil discovered to spectacle so horrible that have never after remembered with emotion of indescribable awe remembrance suddenly recurred now brought with reflection more terrible than have done late conduct of montoni occasioned hastening to quit gallery while have power to do so heard sudden step behind herit might be that of annette turning fearfully to look saw through gloom tall figure following horror of chamber rushed upon mind in next moment found clasped in arm of person heard deep voice murmur in ear when have power to speak to distinguish articulated sound demanded who detained be replied voicewhy be thus alarmed looked on face of person who spoke feeble light gleamed through high casement at end of gallery did not permit to distinguish feature whoever be said emily in trembling voice for heaven sake let go charming emily said man why will shut up in obscure place when there be so much gaiety below return with to cedar parlour where will be fairest ornament of partyyou will not repent exchange emily disdained to reply still endeavoured to liberate promise that will come continued will release immediately first give reward for so doing who be demanded emily in tone of mingled terror indignation while still struggled for libertywho be have cruelty thus to insult why call cruel said man must remove from dreary solitude to merry party below do not know emily now faintly remembered that be one of officer who be with montoni when attended in morning thank for kindness of intention replied without appearing to understand wish for nothing so much a that must leave charming emily said give up foolish whim for solitude come with to company eclipse beauty who make part of only be worthy of love attempted to kiss hand strong impulse of indignation gave power to liberate fled towards chamber closed door before reached having secured sunk in chair overcome by terror by exertion have made while heard voice attempt to open door without having power to raise at length perceived depart have remained listening for considerable time be somewhat revived by not hearing sound when suddenly remembered door of private staircase that might enter way since be fastened only on other side then employed in endeavouring to secure in manner have formerly done appeared to that montoni have already commenced scheme of vengeance by withdrawing from protection repented of rashness have made brave power of such man to retain estate seemed to be now utterly impossible to preserve life perhaps honour resolved if must escape horror of night to give up claim to estate on morrow provided montoni must suffer to depart from udolpho when have come to decision mind became more composed though still anxiously listened often started at ideal sound appeared to issue from staircase having sat in darkness for hour during time annette did not appear began to have serious apprehension for not daring to venture down into castle be compelled to remain in uncertainty a to cause of unusual absence emily often stole to staircase door to listen if step approached still sound alarmed determining however to watch during night once more rested on dark desolate couch bathed pillow with innocent tear thought of deceased parent then of absent valancourt frequently called upon name for profound stillness now reigned be propitious to musing sorrow of mind while thus remained ear suddenly caught note of distant music to listened attentively soon perceiving to be instrument have formerly heard at midnight rose stepped softly to casement to sound appeared to come from lower room in few moment soft melody be accompanied by voice so full of pathos that evidently sang not of imaginary sorrow sweet peculiar tone thought have somewhere heard before yet if be not fancy be at most very faint recollection stole over mind amidst anguish of present suffering like celestial strain soothing reassuring herpleasant a gale of spring sigh on hunter ear when awakens from dream of joy have heard music of spirit of hill note ossian r emotion can scarcely be imagined when heard sung with taste simplicity of true feeling one of popular air of native province to have so often listened with delight when child have so often heard father repeat to well known song never till now heard in native country heart melted while memory of past time returned pleasant peaceful scene of gascony tenderness goodness of parent taste simplicity of former lifeall rose to fancy formed picture so sweet glowing so strikingly contrasted with scene character danger now surrounded herthat mind must not bear to pause upon retrospect shrunk at acuteness of own suffering sigh be deep convulsed must no longer listen to strain have so often charmed to tranquillity withdrew from casement to remote part of chamber be not yet beyond reach of music heard measure change succeeding air called again to window for immediately recollected to be same have formerly heard in fishing house in gascony assisted perhaps by mystery have then accompanied strain have made so deep impression on memory that have never since entirely forgotten manner in be now sung convinced however unaccountable circumstance appeared that be same voice have then heard surprise soon yielded to other emotion thought darted like lightning upon mind discovered train of hope revived spirit yet hope be so new so unexpected so astonishing that did not dare to trust though must not resolve to discourage sat down by casement breathless overcome with alternate emotion of hope fear then rose again leaned from window that might catch nearer sound listened now doubting then believing softly exclaimed name of valancourt then sunk again into chair yes be possible that valancourt be near recollected circumstance induced to believe be voice have just heard remembered have more than once said that fishing house where have formerly listened to voice air where have seen pencilled sonnet addressed to herself have be favourite haunt before have be made known to there too have unexpectedly met appeared from circumstance more than probable that be musician who have formerly charmed attention author of line have expressed such tender admirationwho else indeed must be be unable at time to form conjecture a to writer since acquaintance with valancourt whenever have mentioned fishing house to have be known to have not scrupled to believe that be author of sonnet a consideration passed over mind joy fear tenderness contended at heart leaned again from casement to catch sound might confirm destroy hope though did not recollect to have ever heard sing

among battlement above endeavoured to console with belief that stranger whoever be have retired before have spoken beyond reach of voice appeared certain have valancourt heard recognised must instantly have replied to presently however considered that motive of prudence not accidental removal might occasion silence surmise led to reflection suddenly changed hope joy to terror grief for if valancourt be in castle be too probable that be here prisoner taken with of countryman many of whom be at time engaged in war of italy intercepted in attempt to reach have even recollected emilys voice must have feared in circumstance to reply to in presence of men who guarded prison what so lately have eagerly hoped now believed dreadeddreaded to know valancourt be near while be anxious to be relieved from apprehension for safety still be unconscious that hope of soon seeing struggled with fear remained listening at casement till air began to freshen one high mountain in east to glimmer with morning when wearied with anxiety retired to couch where found utterly impossible to sleep for joy tenderness doubt apprehension distracted during whole night now rose from couch opened casement to listen then must pace room with impatient step at length return with despondence to pillow never did hour appear to move so heavily a of anxious night after hoped that annette might appear conclude

to walk off like ghost leave to help one up will fall to cutting slashing till make rise up dead men say there be reason in thing though might have fallen down in fit be rule for being because be business of mine to look gruff fight battle emily endeavoured to correct superstitious weakness of annette though must not entirely subdue own to latter only replied nay maamselle will believe nothing be almost a bad a signor who be in great passion when told of what have happened swore that first man who repeated such nonsense must be thrown into dungeon under east turret be hard punishment too for only talking nonsense a called dare say have other reason for calling so than have maam emily looked displeased made reply a mused upon recollected appearance have lately so much alarmed considered circumstance of figure having stationed opposite to casement be for moment inclined to believe be valancourt whom have seen yet if be why did not speak to when have opportunity of doing soand if be prisoner in castle must be here in other character how must obtain mean of walking abroad on rampart thus be utterly unable to decide whether musician form have observed be same if be whether be valancourt however desired that annette must endeavour to learn whether prisoner be in castle also name o dear maamselle said annette forget to tell what bade ask about lady a call who be lately come to udolpho why signora livona that signor brought to see late lady at venice be mistress now be little better then dare say ludovico say pray be secret maam that excellenza introduced only to impose upon world have begun to make free with character so when people saw lady notice thought what have heard must be scandal other two be mistress of signor verezzi signor bertolini signor montoni invited to castle so yesterday gave great entertainment there be drinking tuscany wine sort laughing singing till made castle ring again thought be dismal sound so soon after poor lady death too brought to mind what must have thought if have heard thembut can not hear now poor soul said emily turned away to conceal emotion then desired annette to go make enquiry concerning prisoner might be in castle conjured to do with caution on account to mention name that of monsieur valancourt now think of maamselle said annette do believe there be prisoner for overheard one of signor men yesterday in servant hall talking something about ransom saying what fine thing be for excellenza to catch up men be a good booty a other because of ransom other man be grumbling saying be fine enough for signor none so fine for soldier because said dont go share there information heightened emilys impatience to know more annette immediately departed on enquiry late resolution of emily to resign estate to montoni now gave way to new consideration possibility that valancourt be near revived fortitude determined to brave threatened vengeance at least till must be assured whether be really in castle be in temper of mind when received message from montoni requiring attendance in cedar parlour obeyed with trembling on way thither endeavoured to animate fortitude with idea of valancourt montoni be alone sent for said to give opportunity of retracting late mistaken assertion concerning languedoc estate will condescend to advise where may commandif be really deluded by opinion that have right to estate at least persist in erroran error may perceive too late have be fatal to dare resentment further sign paper if have right in estate sir said emily of what service can be to must sign paper concerning if land be yours by law certainly may posse without interference consent will have more argument said montoni with look made tremble what have trouble to expect when condescended to reason with baby will be trifled with longer let recollection of aunt suffering in consequence of folly obstinacy teach lessonsign paper emilys resolution be for moment awedshe shrunk at recollection revived from vengeance threatened then image of valancourt who so long have loved who be now perhaps so near came to heart together with strong feeling of indignation with have always from infancy regarded act of injustice inspired with noble though imprudent courage sign paper said montoni more impatiently than before never sir replied emily that request must have proved to injustice of claim have even be ignorant of right montoni turned pale with anger while quivering lip lurking eye made almost repent boldness of speech then vengeance fall upon exclaimed with horrible oath think not will be delayed estate in languedoc gascony will be yours have dared to question rightnow dare to question power have punishment think not of be terrible nightthis very night night repeated voice montoni paused turned half round seeming to recollect proceeded in lower tone have lately seen one terrible example of obstinacy folly yet appears have not be sufficient to deter youi must tell of othersi must make tremble at bare recital be interrupted by groan seemed to rise from underneath chamber be in a threw glance round impatience rage flashed from eye yet something like shade of fear passed over countenance emily sat down in chair near door for various emotion have suffered now almost overcame montoni paused scarcely instant commanding feature resumed discourse in lower yet sterner voice say must give other instance of power of character seems understand must not defy mei must tell that when once resolution be takenbut be talking to baby let however repeat terrible a be example must recite recital must not now benefit for though repentance must put immediate end to opposition must not now appease indignationi will have vengeance a well a justice groan filled pause montoni made leave room instantly said seeming not to notice strange occurrence without power to implore pity rose to go found that must not support awe terror overcame sunk again into chair quit presence cried montoni affectation of fear ill becomes heroine who have just dared to brave indignation did hear nothing signor said emily trembling still unable to leave room heard own voice rejoined montoni sternly nothing else said emily speaking with difficultythere again do hear nothing now obey order repeated montoni for fool tricksi will soon discover by whom be practised emily again rose exerted to utmost to leave room while montoni followed instead of calling aloud to servant to search chamber a have formerly done on similar occurrence passed to rampart a in way to corridor rested for moment at open casement emily saw party of montonis troop winding down distant mountain whom noticed further than a brought to mind wretched prisoner be perhaps bringing to castle at length having reached apartment threw upon couch overcome with new horror of situation thought lost in tumult perplexity must neither repent of approve late conduct must only remember that be in power of man who have principle of actionbut will astonishment terror of superstition have for moment so strongly assailed now yielded to of reason be at length roused from reverie engaged by confusion of distant voice clattering of hoof seemed to come on wind from court sudden hope that good be approaching seized mind till remembered troop have observed from casement concluded to be party annette have said be expected at udolpho soon after heard voice faintly from hall noise of horse foot sunk away in wind silence ensued emily listened anxiously for annettes step in corridor pause of total stillness continued till again castle seemed to be tumult confusion heard echo of many footstep passing to fro in hall avenue below then busy tongue be loud on rampart having hurried to casement perceived montoni with of officer leaning on wall pointing from while several soldier be employed at further end of rampart about cannon continued to observe careless of passing time annette at length appeared brought intelligence of valancourt for maamselle said people pretend to know nothing about prisoner here be fine piece of business rest of party be just arrived maam came scampering in a if must have broken neck one scarcely knew whether man horse must get within gate first have brought wordand such news have brought word that party of enemy a call be coming towards castle so will have officer of justice suppose besieging terrible looking fellow one used to see at venice thank god exclaimed emily fervently there be yet hope left for then what mean maamselle do wish to fall into hand of sad looking men why used to shudder a passed must have guessed what be if ludovico have not told can not be in worse hand than at present replied emily unguardedly what reason have to suppose be officer of justice why people maam be in fright fuss dont know anything fear of justice must make so used to think nothing on earth must fluster unless indeed be ghost so now of be for hiding down in vault under castle must not tell signor maamselle overheard two of talkingholy what make look so sad maamselle dont hear what say yes do annette pray proceed well maamselle castle be in such hurly burly of men be loading cannon be examining great gate wall round be hammering patching up just a if repair have never be made be so long about what be to become of maamselle ludovico o when hear sound of cannon will die with fright if must catch great gate open for one minute must be even with for shutting within wall so longit must never see again emily caught latter word of annette o if must find open for one moment exclaimed peace might yet be saved heavy groan uttered wildness of look terrified annette still more than word who entreated emily to explain meaning of to whom suddenly occurred that ludovico might be of service if there must be possibility of escape who repeated substance of what have passed between montoni conjured to mention to person except to ludovico may perhaps be in power added to effect escape go to annette tell have to apprehend have already suffered entreat to be secret to lose time in attempting to release if be willing to undertake will be amply rewarded can not speak with for might be observed then effectual care must be taken to prevent flight be quick annette above be discreeti will await return in apartment girl whose honest heart have be much affected by recital be now a eager to obey a emily be to employ immediately quitted room emilys surprise increased a reflected upon annettes intelligence ala said what can officer of justice do against armed castle can not be such upon further consideration however concluded that montonis band having plundered country round inhabitant have taken arm be coming with officer of police party of soldier to force way into castle know not thought strength armed number within ala except from flight have nothing to hope montoni though not precisely what emily apprehended to bea captain of bandittihad employed troop in enterprise not le daring le atrocious than character must have undertaken have not only pillaged whenever opportunity offered helpless traveller have attacked plundered villa of several person being situated among solitary recess of mountain be totally unprepared for resistance in expedition commander of party did not appear men partly disguised have sometimes be mistaken for common robber at others for band of foreign enemy who at period invaded country though have already pillaged several mansion brought home considerable treasure have ventured to approach only one castle in attack of be assisted by other troop of own order from however be vigorously repulsed pursued by of foreign enemy who be in league with besieged montonis troop fled precipitately towards udolpho be so closely tracked over mountain when reached one of height in neighbourhood of castle looked back upon road perceived enemy winding among cliff below at not more than league distant upon discovery hastened forward with increased speed to prepare montoni for enemy be arrival have thrown castle into such confusion tumult a emily awaited anxiously information from below now saw from casement body of troop pour over neighbouring height though annette have be gone very short time have difficult dangerous business to accomplish impatience for intelligence became painful listened opened door often went out upon corridor to meet at length heard footstep approach chamber on opening door saw not annette old carlo new fear rushed upon mind said came from signor who have ordered to inform that must be ready to depart from udolpho immediately for that castle be about to be besieged that mule be preparing to convey with guide to place of safety of safety exclaimed emily thoughtlessly have then signor so much consideration for carlo looked upon ground made reply thousand opposite emotion agitated emily successively a listened to old carlo of joy grief distrust apprehension appeared vanished from mind with quickness of lightning one moment seemed impossible that montoni must take measure merely for preservation so very strange be sending from castle at must attribute only to design of carrying into execution new scheme of vengeance with have menaced in next instant appeared so desirable to quit castle under circumstance that must not rejoice in prospect believing change must be for better till remembered probability of valancourt being detained in when sorrow regret usurped mind wished much more fervently than have yet done that might not be voice have heard carlo having reminded that have time to lose for enemy be within sight of castle emily entreated to inform whither be to go after hesitation said have received no order to tell on repeating question replied that believed be to be carried into tuscany to tuscany exclaimed emilyand why thither carlo answered that knew nothing further than be to be lodged in cottage on border of tuscany at foot of apenninesnot day journey distant said emily now dismissed with trembling hand prepared small package that meant to take with while be employed about annette returned o maamselle said nothing can be done ludovico say new porter be more watchful even than barnardine be might a well throw in way of dragon a in ludovico be almost a broken hearted a be maam on account say be sure will never live to hear cannon fire twice now began to weep revived upon hearing of what have just occurred entreated emily to take with will do most willingly replied emily if signor montoni permit to annette made reply ran out of room immediately sought montoni who be on terrace surrounded by officer where began petition sharply bade go into castle absolutely refused request annette however not only pleaded for herself for ludovico montoni have ordered of men to take from presence before must retire in agony of disappointment returned to emily who foreboded little good towards from refusal to annette who soon after received summons to repair to great court where mule with guide be in waiting emily here tried in vain to sooth weeping annette who persisted in saying that must never see dear young lady again fear mistress secretly thought too well justified endeavoured to restrain while with apparent composure bade affectionate servant farewell annette however followed to court be now thronged with people busy in preparation for enemy having seen mount mule depart with attendant through portal turned into castle wept again emily meanwhile a looked back upon gloomy court of castle no longer silent a when have first entered resounding with noise of preparation for defence a well a crowded with soldier workman hurrying to fro when passed once more under huge portcullis have formerly struck with terror dismay looking round saw wall to confine stepsfelt in spite of anticipation sudden joy of prisoner who unexpectedly find at liberty emotion must not suffer now to look impartially on danger awaited without on mountain infested by hostile party who seized opportunity for plunder on journey commenced under guidance of men whose countenance certainly did not speak favourably of disposition in present moment must only rejoice that be liberated from wall have entered with such dismal foreboding remembering superstitious presentiment have then seized must now smile at impression have made upon mind a gazed with emotion upon turret of castle rising high over wood among wound stranger whom believed to be confined there returned to remembrance anxiety apprehension lest must be valancourt again passed like cloud upon joy recollected circumstance concerning unknown person since night when have first heard play song of native provincecircumstances have so often recollected compared before without extracting from anything like conviction still only prompted to believe that valancourt be prisoner at udolpho be possible however that men who be conductor might afford information on subject fearing to question immediately lest must be unwilling to discover circumstance to in presence of other watched for opportunity of speaking with separately soon after trumpet echoed faintly from distance guide stopped looked toward quarter whence came thick wood surrounded excluding view of country beyond one of men rode on to point of eminence afforded more extensive prospect to observe how near enemy whose trumpet guessed to be be advanced other meanwhile remained with emily to put question concerning stranger at udolpho ugo for be name said that there be several prisoner in castle neither recollected person precise time of arrival must therefore give information there be surliness in manner a spoke that made probable must not have satisfied enquiry even if must have done so having asked what prisoner have be taken about time a nearly a must remember when have first heard music that week said ugo be out with party upon mountain knew nothing of what be doing at castle have enough upon hand have warm work of bertrand other man being now returned emily enquired further when have related to companion what have seen travelled on in deep silence while emily often caught between opening wood partial glimpse of castle abovethe west tower whose battlement be now crowded with archer rampart below where soldier be seen hurrying along busy upon wall preparing cannon having emerged from wood wound along valley in opposite direction to that from whence enemy be approaching emily now have full view of udolpho with grey wall tower terrace high over topping precipice dark wood glittering partially with arm of condottieri a sun ray streaming through autumnal cloud glanced upon part of edifice whose remaining feature stood in darkened majesty continued to gaze through tear upon wall that perhaps confined valancourt now a cloud floated away be lighted up with sudden splendour then a suddenly be shrouded in gloom while passing gleam fell on wood top below heightened first tint of autumn have begun to steal upon foliage winding mountain at length shut udolpho from view turned with mournful reluctance to other object melancholy sighing of wind among pine waved high over steep distant thunder of torrent assisted musing conspired with wild scenery around to diffuse over mind emotion solemn yet not unpleasing be soon interrupted by distant roar of cannon echoing among mountain sound rolled along wind be repeated in faint fainter reverberation till sunk in sullen murmur be signal that enemy have reached castle fear for valancourt again tormented emily turned anxious eye towards that part of country where edifice stood intervening height concealed from view still however saw tall head of mountain immediately fronted late chamber on fixed gaze a if must have told of be passing in scene overlooked guide twice reminded that be losing time that have far to go before must turn from interesting object even when again moved onward often sent look back till only blue point brightening in gleam of sunshine appeared peeping over other mountain sound of cannon affected ugo a blast of trumpet doe war horse called forth fire of nature be impatient to be in midst of fight uttered frequent execration against montoni for having sent to distance feeling of comrade seemed to be very opposite adapted rather to cruelty than to danger of war emily asked frequent question concerning place of destination must only learn that be going to cottage in tuscany whenever mentioned subject fancied perceived in countenance of men expression of malice cunning alarmed be afternoon when have left castle during several hour travelled through region of profound solitude where bleat of sheep bark of watch dog broke on silence be now too far off to hear even faint thunder of cannon towards evening wound down precipice black with forest of cypress pine cedar into glen so savage secluded that if solitude ever have local habitation might have be place of dearest residence to emily appeared spot exactly suited for retreat of bandit in imagination already saw lurking under brow of projecting rock whence shadow lengthened by setting sun stretched across road warned traveller of danger shuddered at idea looking at conductor to observe whether be armed thought saw in bandit dreaded be in glen that proposed to alight for said ugo night will come on presently then wolf will make dangerous to stop be new subject of alarm to emily inferior to what suffered from thought of being left in wild at midnight with two such men a present conductor dark dreadful hint of what might be montonis purpose in sending hither came to mind endeavoured to dissuade men from stopping enquired with anxiety how far have yet to go many league yet replied bertrand a for signora may do a please about eating for will make hearty supper while can will have need of warrant before finish journey sun going down apace let alight under rock yonder comrade assented turning mule out of road advanced towards cliff overhung with cedar emily following in trembling silence lifted from mule having seated on grass at foot of rock drew homely fare from wallet of emily tried to eat little better to disguise apprehension sun be now sunk behind high mountain in west upon purple haze began to spread gloom of twilight to draw over surrounding object to low sullen murmur of breeze passing among wood no longer listened with degree of pleasure for conspired with wildness of scene evening hour to depress spirit suspense have so much increased anxiety a to prisoner at udolpho that finding impracticable to speak alone with bertrand on subject renewed question in presence of ugo be pretended to be entirely ignorant concerning stranger when have dismissed question talked with ugo on subject led to mention of signor orsino of affair have banished from venice respecting emily have ventured to ask few question ugo appeared to be well acquainted with circumstance of tragical event related minute particular that shocked surprised for appeared very extraordinary how such particular must be known to to person present when assassination be committed be of rank said bertrand state must not have troubled to enquire after assassin signor have be lucky hitherto be not first affair of kind have have upon hand to be sure when gentleman have other way of getting redresswhy must take aye said ugo why be not a good a be way to have justice done at once without more ado if go to law must stay till judge please may lose cause at last why best way then be to make sure of right while can execute justice yes yes rejoined bertrand if wait till justice be done youyou may stay long enough why if want friend of mine properly served how be to get revenge ten to one will tell be in right be in wrong if fellow have got possession of property think ought to be mine why may wait till starve perhaps before law will give then after judge may saythe estate be what be to be done case be plain enough must take at last emilys horror at conversation be heightened by suspicion that latter part of be pointed against that men have be commissioned by montoni to execute similar kind of justice in cause be speaking of signor orsino resumed bertrand be one of who love to do justice at once remember about ten year ago signor have quarrel with cavaliero of milan story be told then be still fresh in head quarrelled about lady that signor liked be perverse enough to prefer gentleman of milan even carried whim so far a to marry provoked signor a well might for have tried to talk reason to long while used to send people to serenade under window of night used to make verse about must swear be handsomest lady in milanbut must not donothing must bring to reason a said went so far at last a to marry other cavaliero made signor wrath with vengeance resolved to be even with though watched opportunity did not wait long for soon after marriage set out for padua nothing doubting warrant of what be preparing for cavaliero thought to be sure be to be called to account be to go off triumphant be soon made to know sort of story what then lady have promised to have signor orsino said ugo promised replied bertrand have not wit enough even to tell liked a heard contrary for used to say from first never meant to have be what provoked signor so with good reason for who like to be told that be disagreeable be saying a good be enough to tell need not have gone married what married then on purpose to plague signor said ugo dont know a for replied bertrand said indeed that have have regard for other gentleman great while be nothing to purpose must not have married then signor must not have be so much provoked might have expected what be to follow be not to be supposed must bear ill usage tamely might thank for what happened a said set out for padua husband road lay over barren mountain like suited signor purpose well watched time of departure sent men after with direction what to do kept distance till saw opportunity did not happen till second day journey when gentleman having sent servant forward to next town maybe to have horse in readiness signor men quickened pace overtook carriage in hollow between two mountain where wood prevented servant from seeing what passed though be then not far off when came up fired tromboni missed emily turned pale at word then hoped have mistaken while bertrand proceeded gentleman fired again be soon made to alight be a turned to call people that be struck be most dexterous feat ever sawhe be struck in back with three stillettos at once fell be dispatched in minute lady escaped for servant have heard firing came up before must be taken care of bertrand said signor when men returned bertrand exclaimed emily pale with horror on whom not syllable of narrative have be lost bertrand did say rejoined man with confusionno giovanni have forgot where wasbertrand said signor bertrand again said emily in faltering voice why do repeat name bertrand swore what signifies proceeded what man be calledbertrand giovannior roberto one for have put out twice with thatquestion bertrand giovannior what willbertrand said signor if comrade have done duty a well a must not have lost lady go honest fellow be happy with gave purse of goldand little enough too considering service have done aye aye said ugo little enoughlittle enough emily now breathed with difficulty must scarcely support when first saw men appearance connection with montoni have be sufficient to impress with distrust now when one of have betrayed to be murderer saw at approach of night under guidance among wild solitary mountain going scarcely knew most agonizing terror seized be le supportable from necessity found under of concealing symptom of from companion reflecting on character menace of montoni appeared not improbable that have delivered to for purpose of having murdered of thus securing to without further opposition delay estate for have so long so desperately contended yet if be design there appeared necessity for sending to such distance from castle for if dread of discovery have made unwilling to perpetrate deed there much nearer place might have sufficed for purpose of concealment consideration however did not immediately occur to emily with whom so many circumstance conspired to rouse terror that have power to oppose to enquire coolly into ground if have done so still there be many appearance must too well have justified most terrible apprehension did not now dare to speak to conductor at sound of whose voice trembled when now then stole glance at countenance seen imperfectly through gloom of evening served to confirm fear sun have now be set time heavy cloud whose lower skirt be tinged with sulphureous crimson lingered in west threw reddish tint upon pine forest sent forth solemn sound a breeze rolled over hollow moan struck upon emilys heart served to render more gloomy terrific object around herthe mountain shaded in twilightthe gleaming torrent hoarsely roaringthe black forest deep glen broken into rocky recess high overshadowed by cypress sycamore winding into long obscurity to glen emily a sent forth anxious eye thought there be end hamlet even cottage be seen still distant bark of watch dog even faint far off halloo came on wind in tremulous voice now ventured to remind guide that be growing late to ask again how far have to go be too much occupied by own discourse to attend to question forbore to repeat lest must provoke surly answer having however soon after finished supper men collected fragment into wallet proceeded along winding glen in gloomy silence while emily again mused upon own situation concerning motif of montoni for involving in that be for evil purpose towards must not doubt seemed that if did not intend to destroy with view of immediately seizing estate meant to reserve while in concealment for more terrible design for one might equally gratify avarice still more deep revenge at moment remembering signor brochio behaviour in corridor few preceding night latter supposition horrible a be strengthened in belief yet why remove from castle where deed of darkness have feared be often executed with secrecyfrom chamber perhaps with many foul midnight murder staind dread of what might be going to encounter be now so excessive that sometimes threatened sens often a went thought of late father of must have suffered must have foreseen strange dreadful event of future life how anxiously must have avoided that fatal confidence committed daughter to care of woman so weak a be madame montoni so romantic improbable indeed did present situation appear to emily particularly when compared with repose beauty of early day that there be moment when must almost have believed victim of frightful vision glaring upon disordered fancy restrained by presence of guide from expressing terror acuteness be at length lost in gloomy despair dreadful view of what might await hereafter rendered almost indifferent to surrounding danger now looked with little emotion on wild dingle gloomy road mountain whose outline be only distinguishable through duskobjects lately have affected spirit so much a to awaken horrid view of future to tinge with own gloom be now so nearly dark that traveller who proceeded only by slowest pace must scarcely discern way cloud seemed charged with thunder passed slowly along heaven showing at interval trembling star while grove of cypress sycamore overhung rock waved high in breeze a swept over glen then rushed among distant wood emily shivered a passed where be torch said ugo grows dark not so dark yet replied bertrand may find way ti best not light torch before can help for may betray if straggling party of enemy be abroad ugo muttered something emily did not understand proceeded in darkness while almost wished that enemy might discover for from change there be something to hope since must scarcely imagine situation more dreadful than present one a moved slowly along attention be surprised by thin tapering flame appeared by fit at point of pike bertrand carried resembling what have observed on lance of sentinel night madame montoni died have said be omen event immediately following appeared to justify assertion superstitious impression have remained on emilys mind present appearance confirmed thought be omen of own fate watched successively vanish return in gloomy silence be at length interrupted by bertrand let light torch said get under shelter of woodsa storm be coming onlook at lance held forth with flame tapering at point note see abb berthelon on electricity r aye said ugo be not one of believe in omen have left coward at castle who must turn pale at sight have often seen before thunder storm be omen of one be coming now sure enough cloud flash fast already emily be relieved by conversation from of terror of superstition of reason increased a waiting while ugo searched for flint to strike fire watched pale lightning gleam over wood be about to enter illumine harsh countenance of companion ugo must not find flint bertrand became impatient for thunder sounded hollowly at distance lightning be more frequent sometimes revealed nearer recess of wood displaying opening in summit illumined ground beneath with partial splendour thick foliage of tree preserving surrounding scene in deep shadow at length ugo found flint torch be lighted men then dismounted having assisted emily led mule towards wood skirted glen on left over broken ground frequently interrupted with brush wood wild plant be often obliged to make circuit to avoid must not approach wood without experiencing

watching moon stealing tremulous light over wave on woody summit of cliff wound along tuscan shore meanwhile bertrand be so well pleased with first flask that very willingly commenced attack on second be late before emily not without apprehension returned to cottage after evening frequently walked with maddelina be never unattended by bertrand mind became by degree a tranquil a circumstance of situation must permit quiet in be suffered to live encouraged to hope that be not sent hither with evil design have not appeared probable that valancourt be at time inhabitant of udolpho must have wished to remain at cottage till opportunity must offer of returning to native country concerning montonis motive for sending into tuscany be more than ever perplexed must believe that consideration for safety have influenced on occasion have be time at cottage before recollected that in hurry of leaving udolpho have forgotten paper committed to by late aunt relative to languedoc estate though

not confronted with accused man may falsely impeach enemy accomplish unjust revenge without fear of punishment detection that montoni must have recourse to diabolical mean of ruining person whom

castle be besieged by troop who seemed willing to dare everything to suffer patiently hardship in pursuit of victory strength of fortress however withstood attack with vigorous defence of garrison scarcity of provision on wild mountain soon compelled assailant to raise siege when udolpho be once more left to quiet possession of montoni dispatched ugo into tuscany for emily whom have sent from consideration of personal safety to place of greater security than castle be at time liable to be overrun by enemy tranquillity being once more restored to udolpho be impatient to secure again under roof have commissioned ugo to assist bertrand in guarding back to castle thus compelled to return emily bade kind maddelina farewell with regret after about fortnight stay in tuscany where have experienced interval of quiet be absolutely necessary to sustain long harassed spirit began once more to ascend apennines from whose height gave long sorrowful look to beautiful country extended at foot to distant mediterranean whose wave have so often wished must bear back to france distress felt on return towards place of former suffering be however softened by conjecture valancourt be there found degree of comfort in thought of being near notwithstanding consideration that be probably prisoner be noon when have left cottage evening be closed long before came within neighbourhood of udolpho there be moon shone only at interval for night be cloudy lighted by torch ugo carried traveller paced silently along emily musing on situation bertrand ugo anticipating comfort of flask of wine good fire for have perceived for time difference between warm climate of lowland of tuscany nipping air of upper region emily be at length roused from reverie by far off sound of castle clock to listened not without degree of awe a rolled away on breeze note succeeded died in sullen murmur among mountainsto mournful imagination seemed knell measuring out fateful period for aye there be old clock said bertrand there be still cannon have not silenced answered ugo crowed a loud a best of in midst of there be roaring out in hottest fire have seen many day said that of must have hit at old fellow escaped tower too road winding round base of mountain now came within view of castle be shown in perspective of valley by gleam of moonshine then vanished in shade while even transient view of have awakened poignancy of emilys feeling massy gloomy wall gave terrible idea of imprisonment suffering yet a advanced degree of hope mingled with terror for though be certainly residence of montoni be possibly also that of valancourt must not approach place where might be without experiencing somewhat of joy of hope continued to wind along valley soon after saw again old wall moonlit tower rising over wood strong ray enabled also to perceive ravage siege have madewith broken wall shattered battlement for be now at foot of steep on udolpho stood massy fragment have rolled down among wood through traveller now began to ascend there mingled with loose earth piece of rock have brought with wood too have suffered much from battery above for here enemy have endeavoured to screen from fire of rampart many noble tree be levelled with ground others to wide extent be entirely stripped of upper branch have better dismount said ugo lead mule up hill will get into of hole ball have left here be plenty of give torch continued ugo after have dismounted take care dont stumble over anything lie in way for ground be not yet cleared of enemy how exclaimed emily be of enemy here then nay dont know for now replied when came away saw one two of lying under tree a proceeded torch threw gloomy light upon ground far among recess of wood emily feared to look forward lest object of horror must meet eye path be often strewn with broken head of arrow with shattered remains of armour such a at period be mingled with lighter dress of soldier bring light hither said bertrand have stumbled over something rattle loud enough ugo holding up torch perceived steel breastplate on ground bertrand raised saw that be pierced through that lining be entirely covered with blood upon emilys earnest entreaty that must proceed bertrand uttering joke upon unfortunate person to whom have belonged threw hard upon ground passed on at step took emily feared to see vestige of death coming soon after to opening in wood bertrand stopped to survey ground be encumbered with massy trunk branch of tree have so lately adorned seemed to have be spot particularly fatal to besieger for be evident from destruction of tree here hottest fire of garrison have be directed a ugo held again forth torch steel glittered between fallen tree ground beneath be covered with broken arm with torn vestment of soldier whose mangled form emily almost expected to see again entreated companion to proceed who be however too intent in examination to regard turned eye from desolated scene to castle above where observed light gliding along rampart presently castle clock struck twelve then trumpet sounded of emily enquired occasion o be only changing watch replied ugo remember trumpet said emily be new custom be only old one revived lady always use in time of war have sounded at midnight ever since place be besieged hark said emily a trumpet sounded again in next moment heard faint clash of arm then watchword passed along terrace above be answered from distant part of castle after be again still complained of cold begged to go on presently lady said bertrand turning over broken arm with pike usually carried what have here hark cried emily what noise be that what noise be said ugo starting up listening hush repeated emily surely came from rampart above on looking up perceived light moving along wall while in next instant breeze swelling voice sounded louder than before who go yonder cried sentinel of castle speak will be worse for bertrand uttered shout of joy hah brave comrade be said blew shrill whistle signal be answered by from soldier on watch party then passing forward soon after emerged from wood upon broken road led immediately to castle gate emily saw with renewed terror whole of stupendous structure ala said to herself be going again into prison here have be warm work by st marco cried bertrand waving torch over ground ball have torn up earth here with vengeance aye replied ugo be fired from redoubt yonder rare execution did enemy made furious attack upon great gate might have guessed must never carry there for besides cannon from wall archer on two round tower showered down upon at rate that by holy peter there be standing never saw better sight in life laughed till side aked to see how knave scampered bertrand good fellow thou shouldst have be among warrant thou wouldst have won race hah be at old trick again said bertrand in surly tone be well for thee thou art so near castle thou knowest have killed man before now ugo replied only by laugh then gave further account of siege to a emily listened be struck by strong contrast of present scene with have so lately be acted here mingled uproar of cannon drum trumpet groan of conquered shout of conqueror be now sunk into silence so profound that seemed a if death have triumphed alike over vanquished victor shattered condition of one of tower of great gate by mean confirmed valiant account just given by ugo of scampering party who be evident have not only made stand have done much mischief before took to flight for tower appeared a far a emily must judge by dim moonlight that fell upon to be laid open battlement be nearly demolished while gazed light glimmered through one of lower loop hole disappeared in next moment perceived through broken wall soldier with lamp ascending narrow staircase wound within tower remembering that be same have passed up on night when barnardine have deluded with promise of seeing madame montoni fancy gave somewhat of terror have then suffered be now very near gate over soldier having opened door of portal chamber lamp carried gave dusky view of terrible apartment almost sunk under recollected horror of moment when have drawn aside curtain discovered object be meant to conceal perhaps said to herself be now used for similar purpose perhaps that soldier go at dead hour to watch over corpse of friend little remains of fortitude now gave way to united force of remembered anticipated horror for melancholy fate of madame montoni appeared to foretell own considered that though languedoc estate if relinquished must satisfy montonis avarice might not appease vengeance be seldom pacified by terrible sacrifice even thought that be to resign fear of justice might urge to detain prisoner to take away life be now arrived at gate where bertrand observing light glimmer through small casement of portal chamber called aloud soldier looking out demanded who be there here have brought prisoner said ugo open gate let in tell first who be that demand entrance replied soldier what old comrade cried ugo dont know not know ugo have brought home prisoner here bound hand foota fellow who have be drinking tuscany wine while here have be fighting will not rest till meet with match said bertrand sullenly hah comrade be said soldierill be with directly emily presently heard step descending stair within then heavy chain fall bolt undraw of small postern door opened to admit party held lamp low to show step of gate found once more beneath gloomy arch heard door close that seemed to shut from world for ever in next moment be in first court of castle where surveyed spacious solitary area with kind of calm despair while dead hour of night gothic gloom of surrounding building hollow imperfect echo returned a ugo soldier conversed together assisted to increase melancholy foreboding of heart passing on to second court distant sound broke feebly on silence gradually swelling louder a advanced emily distinguished voice of revelry laughter be to far other than sound of joy why have got tuscany wine among here said bertrand if one may judge by uproar be going forward ugo have taken larger share of than of fighting ill be sworn who be carousing at late hour excellenza signor replied soldier be sign be stranger at castle must not need to ask question be brave spirit do without sleepthey generally pas night in good cheer must that who keep watch have little of be cold work pacing rampart so many hour of night if one have good liquor to warm one heart courage lad courage ought to warm heart said ugo courage replied soldier sharply with menacing air ugo perceiving prevented saying more by returning to subject of carousal be new custom said when left castle signor used to sit up counselling aye for matter carousing too replied soldier since siege have done nothing make merry if be must settle account with for hard fighting same way have now crossed second court reached hall door when soldier bidding good night hastened back to post while waited for admittance emily considered how might avoid seeing montoni retire unnoticed to former apartment for shrunk from thought of encountering of party at hour uproar within castle be now so loud that though ugo knocked repeatedly at hall door be not heard by of servant circumstance increased emilys alarm while allowed time to deliberate on mean of retiring unobserved for though might perhaps pas up great staircase unseen be impossible must find way to chamber without light difficulty of procuring danger of wandering about castle without one immediately struck bertrand have only torch knew that servant never brought taper to door for hall be sufficiently lighted by large tripod lamp hung in vaulted roof while must wait till annette must bring taper montoni of companion might discover door be now opened by carlo emily having requested to send annette immediately with light to great gallery where determined to await passed on with hasty step towards staircase while bertrand ugo with torch followed old carlo to servant hall impatient for supper warm blaze of wood fire emily lighted only by feeble ray lamp above threw between arch of extensive hall endeavoured to find way to staircase now hid in obscurity while shout of merriment burst from remote apartment served by heightening terror to increase perplexity expected instant to see door of room open montoni companion issue forth having at length reached staircase found way to top seated on last stair to await arrival of annette for profound darkness of gallery deterred from proceeding farther while listened for footstep heard only distant sound of revelry rose in sullen echo from among arcade below once thought heard low sound from dark gallery behind turning eye fancied saw something luminous move in since must not at moment subdue weakness caused fear quitted seat crept softly down few stair lower annette not yet appearing emily now concluded that be gone to bed that nobody chose to call up prospect presented of passing night in darkness in place in other equally forlorn for knew must be impracticable to find way through intricacy of gallery to chamber drew tear of mingled terror despondency from eye while thus sat fancied heard again odd sound from gallery listened scarcely daring to breathe increasing voice below overcame other sound soon after heard montoni companion burst into hall who spoke a if be much intoxicated seemed to be advancing towards staircase now remembered that must come way to chamber forgetting terror of gallery hurried towards with intention of secreting in of passage opened beyond of endeavouring when signor be retired to find way to own room to of annette be in remote part of castle with extended arm crept along gallery still hearing voice of person below who seemed to stop in conversation at foot of staircase then pausing for moment to listen half fearful of going further into darkness of gallery where still imagined from noise have heard that person be lurking be already informed of arrival said be coming to seek in present state of mind purpose must be desperate then recollecting scene have passed in corridor on night preceding departure from castle o valancourt said must then resign for ever to brave longer injustice of montoni must not be fortitude rashness still voice below did not draw nearer became louder distinguished of verezzi bertolini above rest while few word caught made listen more anxiously for others conversation seemed to concern having ventured to step few pace nearer to staircase discovered that be disputing about seeming to claim former promise of montoni who appeared at first inclined to appease to persuade to return to wine afterwards to be weary of dispute saying that left to settle a must be returning with rest of party to apartment have just quitted verezzi then stopped where be signor said in voice of impatience tell where be have already told that know replied montoni who seemed to be somewhat overcome with wine be most probably gone to apartment verezzi bertolini now desisted from enquiry sprang to staircase together while emily who during discourse have trembled so excessively that have with difficulty supported seemed inspired with new strength moment heard sound of step ran along gallery dark a be with fleetness of fawn long before reached extremity light verezzi carried flashed upon wall appeared instantly perceiving emily pursued at moment bertolini whose step though swift be not steady whose impatience overcame what little caution have hitherto used stumbled fell at length lamp fell with be presently expiring on floor verezzi regardless of saving seized advantage accident gave over rival followed emily to whom however light have shown one of passage branched from gallery instantly turned into verezzi must just discern way have taken pursued sound of step soon sunk in distance while le acquainted with passage be obliged to proceed through dark with caution lest must fall down flight of step such a in extensive old castle frequently terminated avenue passage at length brought emily to corridor into own chamber opened not hearing footstep paused to take breath consider be safest design to be adopted have followed passage merely because be first appeared now that have reached end of be a perplexed a before

bed to recover breath composure to enquiry whether valancourt be among prisoner in castle annette replied that have not be able to hear that knew there be several person confined then proceeded in tedious way to give account of siege rather detail of terror various suffering during attack added when heard shout of victory from rampart thought be taken gave up for lost instead of have driven

in next instant voice called for heaven sake annette answer said emily softly remain quite still fear must extinguish lamp glare will betray holy virgin exclaimed annette forgetting discretion must not be in darkness now for whole world while spoke voice became louder than before repeated annettes name blessed virgin cried suddenly be only ludovico rose to open door emily prevented till must be more certain that be alone with whom annette at length talked for time learned that be come to enquire after whom have let out of room to go to emily that be now returned to lock in again emily fearful of being overheard if conversed longer through door consented that must be opened young man appeared whose open countenance confirmed favourable opinion of care of annette have already prompted to form entreated protection must verezzi make requisite ludovico offered to pas night in old chamber adjoining opened from gallery on first alarm to come to defence emily be much soothed by proposal ludovico having lighted lamp went to station while once more endeavoured to repose on mattress variety of interest pressed upon attention prevented sleep thought much on what annette have told her of dissolute manner of montoni associate more of present conduct towards of danger from have just escaped from view of present situation shrunk a from new picture of terror saw in castle inhabited by vice violence seated beyond reach of law justice in power of man whose perseverance be equal to occasion in whom passion of revenge be not weakest entirely supplied place of principle be compelled once more to acknowledge that must be folly not fortitude longer to dare power resigning hope of future happiness with valancourt determined that on following morning must compromise with montoni give up estate on condition that must permit immediate return to france such consideration kept waking for many hour night passed without further alarm from verezzi on next morning emily have long conversation with ludovico in heard circumstance concerning castle received hint of design of montoni considerably increased alarm on expressing surprise that ludovico who seemed to be so sensible of evil of situation must continue in informed that be not intention to do so then ventured to ask if must assist to escape from castle ludovico assured of readiness to attempt strongly represented difficulty of enterprise certain destruction must ensue must montoni overtake before have passed mountain however promised to be watchful of circumstance might contribute to success of attempt to think upon plan of departure emily now confided to name of valancourt begged must enquire for such person among prisoner in castle for faint hope conversation awakened made now recede from resolution of immediate compromise with montoni determined if possible to delay till heard further from ludovico if design be found to be impracticable to resign estate at once thought be on subject when montoni who be now recovered from intoxication of preceding night sent for immediately obeyed summons be alone find said that be not in chamber last night where be emily related to circumstance of alarm entreated protection from repetition of know term of protection said if really value will secure open declaration that must only conditionally protect while remained prisoner in castle showed emily necessity of immediate compliance with term first demanded whether must permit immediately to depart if gave up claim to contested estate in very solemn manner then assured that must immediately laid before paper be to transfer right of estate to be for considerable time unable to sign heart be torn with contending interest for be about to resign happiness of future yearsthe hope have sustained in so many hour of adversity after hearing from montoni recapitulation of condition of compliance remonstrance that time be valuable put hand to paper when have done fell back in chair soon recovered desired that must give order for departure that must allow annette to accompany montoni smiled be necessary to deceive said hethere be other way of making act reasonably will go must not be at present must first secure estate by possession when be done may return to france if will deliberate villany with violated solemn engagement have just entered into shocked emily a much a certainty that have made fruitless sacrifice must still remain prisoner have word to express what felt knew that must have be useless if have a looked piteously at montoni turned away at same time desired must withdraw to apartment unable to leave room sat down in chair near door sighed heavily have word tear why will indulge childish grief said endeavour to strengthen mind to bear patiently what can not now be avoided have real evil to lament be patient will be sent back to france at present retire to apartment dare not go sir said where will be liable to intrusion of signor verezzi have not promised to protect said montoni have promised sirreplied emily after hesitation be not promise sufficient added sternly will recollect former promise signor said emily trembling may determine for whether ought to rely upon will provoke to declare to will not protect then said montoni in tone of haughty displeasure if will satisfy will do immediately withdraw to chamber before retract promise have nothing to fear there emily left room moved slowly into hall where fear of meeting verezzi bertolini made quicken step though must scarcely support soon after reached once more own apartment having looked fearfully round to examine if person be there having searched part of fastened door sat down by one of casement here while looked out for hope to support fainting spirit have be so long harassed oppressed that if have not now struggled much against misfortune must have left perhaps for ever endeavoured to believe that montoni did really intend to permit return to france a soon a have secured property that must in mean time protect from insult chief hope rested with ludovico who doubted not must be zealous in cause though seemed almost to despair of success in one circumstance however have to rejoice in prudence rather fear have saved from mentioning name of valancourt to montoni be several time on point of doing before signed paper of stipulating for release if must be really prisoner in castle have done montonis jealous fear must now probably have loaded valancourt with new severity have suggested advantage of holding captive for life thus passed melancholy day a have before passed many in same chamber when night drew on must have withdrawn to annettes bed have not particular interest inclined to remain in chamber in spite of fear for when castle must be still customary hour arrived determined to watch for music have formerly heard though sound might not enable positively to determine whether valancourt be there must perhaps strengthen opinion that be impart comfort so necessary to present support on other hand if must be silent hardly dared to suffer thought to glance way waited with impatient expectation approaching hour night be stormy battlement of castle appeared to rock in wind at interval long groan seemed to pas on air such a often deceive melancholy mind in tempest amidst scene of desolation emily heard a formerly sentinel pas along terrace to post looking out from casement observed that watch be doubled precaution appeared necessary enough when threw eye on wall saw shattered condition well known sound of soldier march of distant voice passed in wind be lost again recalled to memory melancholy sensation have suffered when formerly heard same sound occasioned almost involuntary comparison between present late situation be subject for congratulation wisely checked course of thought while a hour be not yet come in have be accustomed to hear music closed casement endeavoured to await in patience door of staircase tried to secure a usual with of furniture of room expedient fear now represented to to be very inadequate to power perseverance of verezzi often looked at large heavy chest stood in chamber with wish that annette have strength enough to move while blamed long stay of girl who be still with ludovico other of servant trimmed wood fire to make room appear le desolate sat down beside with book eye perused while thought wandered to valancourt own misfortune a sat thus thought in pause of wind distinguished music went to casement to listen loud swell of gust overcame other sound when wind sunk again heard distinctly in deep pause succeeded sweet string of lute again rising tempest bore away note again be succeeded by solemn pause emily trembling with hope fear opened casement to listen to try whether own voice must be heard by musician for to endure longer state of torturing suspense concerning valancourt seemed to be utterly impossible there be kind of breathless stillness in chamber permitted to distinguish from below tender note of very lute have formerly heard with plaintive voice made sweeter by low rustling sound now began to creep along wood top till be lost in rising wind tall head then began to wave while through forest of pine on left wind groaning heavily rolled onward over wood below bending almost to root a long resounding gale swept away other wood on right seemed to answer loud lament then others further still softened into murmur died into silence emily listened with mingled awe expectation hope fear again melting sweetness of lute be heard same solemn breathing voice convinced that came from apartment underneath leaned far out of window that might discover whether light be there casement below a well a above be sunk so deep in thick wall of castle that must not see even faint ray probably glimmered through bar then ventured to call wind bore voice to other end of terrace then music be heard a before in pause of gust suddenly thought heard noise in chamber drew within casement in moment after distinguishing annettes voice at door concluded be have heard before let in move softly annette to casement said listen with music be returned be silent till measure changing annette exclaimed holy virgin know that song well be french song one of favourite song of dear country be ballad emily have heard on former night though not one have first listened to from fishing house in gascony o be frenchman sings said annette must be monsieur valancourt hark annette speak so loud said emily may be overheard what by chevalier said annette replied emily mournfully by somebody who may report to signor what reason have to think be monsieur valancourt who sings hark now voice swell louder do recollect tone fear to trust own judgment never happened to hear chevalier sing mademoiselle replied annette who a emily be disappointed to perceive have stronger reason for concluding to be valancourt than that musician must be frenchman soon after heard song of fishing house distinguished own name be repeated so distinctly that annette have heard also trembled sunk into chair by window annette called aloud monsieur valancourt monsieur valancourt while emily endeavoured to check repeated call more loudly than before lute voice suddenly stopped emily listened for time in state of intolerable suspense answer being returned doe not signify mademoiselle said annette be chevalier will speak to annette said emily think will speak if be will know voice speak again who be said that sings at late hour long silence ensued having repeated question perceived faint accent mingling in blast swept by sound be so distant passed so suddenly that must scarcely hear much le distinguish word uttered recognise voice after pause emily called again again heard voice a faintly a before perceived that there be other circumstance besides strength direction of wind to content with for great depth at casement be fixed in castle wall contributed still more than distance to prevent articulated sound from being understood though general one be easily heard emily however ventured to believe from circumstance of voice alone having be answered that stranger be valancourt a well a that knew gave up to speechless joy annette however be not speechless renewed call received answer emily fearing that further attempt certainly be a present highly dangerous might expose to guard of castle while must not perhaps terminate suspense insisted on annettes dropping enquiry for night though determined to question ludovico on subject in morning more urgently than have yet done be now enabled to say that stranger whom have formerly heard be still in castle to direct ludovico to part of in be confined emily attended by annette continued at casement for time remained still heard lute voice again emily be now a much oppressed by anxious joy a lately be by sense of misfortune with hasty step paced room now half calling on valancourts name then suddenly stopping now going to casement listening where however heard nothing solemn waving of wood sometimes impatience to speak to ludovico prompted to send annette to call sense of impropriety of at midnight restrained annette meanwhile a impatient a mistress went a often to casement to listen returned almost a much disappointed at length mentioned signor verezzi fear lest must enter chamber by staircase door night be now almost past mademoiselle said recollecting there be morning light beginning to peep over mountain yonder in east emily have forgotten till moment that person existed a verezzi danger have appeared to threaten mention of name renewed alarm remembered old chest that have wished to place against door now with annette attempted to move be so heavy that must not lift from floor what be in great old chest mademoiselle said annette make so weighty emily having replied that found in chamber when first came to castle have never examined itthen will maamselle said annette tried to lift lid be held by lock for have key indeed appeared from peculiar construction to open with spring morning now glimmered through casement wind have sunk into calm emily looked out upon dusky wood on twilight mountain just stealing in eye saw whole scene after storm lying in profound stillness wood motionless cloud above through dawn trembled scarcely appearing to move along heaven one soldier be pacing terrace beneath with measured step two more distant be sunk asleep on wall wearied with night watch having inhaled for while pure spirit of air of vegetation late rain have called forth having listened once more for note of music now closed casement retired to rest chapter ix thus on chill lapponians dreary land for many long month lost in snow profound when sol

prisoner in apartment described to by emily that be frenchman whom have taken in one of skirmish with party of countryman during interval emily escaped persecution of bertolini verezzi by confining to apartment except sometimes in evening ventured to walk in adjoining corridor montoni appeared to respect last promise though have prophaned first for to protection only must attribute present repose in be now so secure that did not wish to leave castle till must obtain certainty concerning valancourt for waited indeed without sacrifice of own comfort since circumstance have occurred to make escape probable on fourth day ludovico informed that have hope of being admitted to presence of prisoner being turn of soldier with whom have be for time familiar to attend on following night be not deceived in hope for under pretence of carrying in pitcher of water entered prison though prudence having prevented from telling sentinel real motive of visit be obliged to make conference with prisoner very short one emily awaited result in own apartment ludovico having promised to accompany annette to corridor in evening where after several hour impatiently counted arrived emily having then uttered name of valancourt must articulate more hesitated in trembling expectation chevalier must not entrust with name signora replied ludovico when just mentioned yours seemed overwhelmed with joy though be not so much surprised a expected doe then remember exclaimed o be mon valancourt said annette looked impatiently at ludovico who understood look replied to emily yes lady chevalier doe indeed remember be sure have very great regard for made bold to say have for then enquired how came to know be in castle whether ordered to speak to first question must not answer second did then went off into ecstasy again be afraid joy must have betrayed to sentinel at door how doe look ludovico interrupted emily be not melancholy ill with long confinementwhy a to melancholy saw symptom of lady while be with for seemed in finest spirit ever saw anybody in in life countenance be joy if one may judge from that be very well did not ask did send message said emily o yes signora something besides

before have give ludovico then drew forth miniature from bosom emily received with trembling hand perceived to be portrait of herselfthe very picture mother have lost so strangely in fishing house at la valle tear of mingled joy tenderness flowed to eye while ludovico proceededtell lady said chevalier a gave picture that have be companion only solace in misfortune tell have worn next heart sent a pledge of affection can never die must not part with to for wealth of world now part with only in hope of soon receiving from hand tell just then signora sentinel came in chevalier said more have before asked to contrive interview for with when told how little hope have of prevailing with guard to assist said be not perhaps of so much consequence a imagined bade contrive to bring back answer must inform of more than chose to do then so think lady be whole of what passed how ludovico will reward for zeal said emily indeed now posse mean when can see chevalier again be uncertain signora replied depends upon who stand guard next there be not more than one two among from whom must dare to ask admittance to prison chamber need not bid remember ludovico resumed emily how very much interested be in seeing chevalier soon when do so tell have received picture with sentiment wished tell have suffered much still suffer paused will tell will see lady said ludovico most certainly will

opportunity tell heart be unchanged above let see again a soon a possible ludovico think be needle to tell will very anxiously look for having then wished good night ludovico descended staircase emily retired to rest not to sleep for joy now rendered a wakeful a have ever be from grief montoni castle have vanished from mind like frightful vision of necromancer wandered once more in fairy scene of unfading happiness a when beneath beam of summer moon distant wood among by flood silverd with gleam soft embodied fay thro airy portal stream week elapsed before ludovico again visited prison for sentinel during period be men in whom must not confide feared to awaken curiosity by asking to see prisoner in interval communicated to emily terrific report of what be passing in castle of riot quarrel of carousal more alarming than while from circumstance mentioned not only doubted whether montoni meant ever to release greatly feared that have design concerning hersuch a have formerly dreaded name be frequently mentioned in conversation bertolini verezzi held together at time be frequently in contention montoni have lost large sum to verezzi so that there be dreadful possibility of designing to be substitute for debt a be ignorant that have formerly encouraged hope of bertolini also concerning after latter have done signal service knew not how to account for contention between bertolini verezzi cause of however appeared to be of little consequence for thought saw destruction approaching in many form entreaty to ludovico to contrive escape to see prisoner again be more urgent than ever at length informed that have again visited chevalier who have directed to confide in guard of prison from whom have already received instance of kindness who have promised to permit going into castle for hour on ensuing night when montoni companion must be engaged at carousal be kind to be sure added ludovico sebastian know run risk in letting chevalier out for if can get beyond bar iron door of castle must be cunning indeed chevalier desired signora to go to immediately to beg must allow to visit night if be only for moment for must no longer live under same roof without seeing hour said must not mention for must depend on circumstance just a said signora place desired must appoint a knowing be best for own safety emily be now so much agitated by near prospect of meeting valancourt that be time before must give answer to ludovico consider of place of meeting when did saw none promised so much security a corridor near own apartment be checked from leaving by apprehension of meeting of montonis guest on way to room dismissed scruple delicacy opposed now that serious danger be to be avoided by encountering be settled therefore that chevalier must meet in corridor at hour of night ludovico who be to be upon watch must judge safest emily a may be imagined passed interval in tumult of hope joy anxiety impatience never since residence in castle have watched with so much pleasure sun set behind mountain twilight shade darkness veil scene a on evening counted note of great clock listened to step of sentinel a changed watch only to rejoice that hour

joy be moment when be impossible for to feel emotion of regret melancholy for ordinary interestseven reflection that have resigned estate must have be provision for herself valancourt for life threw only light transient shade upon spirit idea of valancourt that must see so soon alone occupied heart at clock struck twelve opened door to listen if noise be in castle heard only distant shout of riot laughter echoed feebly along gallery guessed that signor guest be at banquet be now engaged for night said valancourt will soon be here having softly closed door paced room with impatient step often went to casement to listen for lute be silent agitation moment increasing be at length unable to support sat down by window annette whom detained be in meantime a loquacious a usual emily heard scarcely anything said having at length risen to casement distinguished chord of lute struck with expressive hand then voice have formerly listened to accompanied now rising love fannd now pleasing dole breathd in tender musing through heart now graver sacred strain stole a when seraphic hand hymn impart emily wept in doubtful joy tenderness when strain ceased considered a signal that valancourt be about to leave prison soon after heard step in corridorthey be light quick step of hope must scarcely support a approached opening door of apartment advanced to meet valancourt in next moment sunk in arm of stranger voicehis countenance instantly convinced fainted away on reviving found supported by stranger who be watching over recovery with countenance of ineffable tenderness anxiety have spirit for reply enquiry asked question burst into tear disengaged from arm when expression of countenance changed to surprise disappointment turned to ludovico for explanation annette soon gave information ludovico must not o sir said in voice interrupted with sob o sir be not other chevalier expected monsieur valancourt be not o ludovico how must deceive so poor lady will never recover itnever stranger who now appeared much agitated attempted to speak word faltered then striking hand against forehead a if in sudden despair walked abruptly to other end of corridor suddenly annette dried tear spoke to ludovico perhaps said after other chevalier be not perhaps chevalier valancourt be still below emily raised head replied ludovico monsieur valancourt never be below if gentleman be not if sir said ludovico addressing stranger must have have goodness to trust with name mistake have be avoided most true replied stranger speaking in broken italian be of utmost consequence to that

francei be countrymanwe be met in foreign land emily tried to compose spirit yet hesitated to grant request at length desiring that ludovico must wait on staircase detaining annette told stranger that

through hazard must encounter to deliver from recess of vice accept offered service of friend refuse reward of having at least attempted to deserve thanks deserve already sir said emily wish deserves warmest thanks will excuse for reminding of danger incur by prolonging interview will be great consolation to to remember whether friendly attempt to release succeed not have countryman who must so generously protect memonsieur du pont took hand feebly attempted to withdraw pressed respectfully to lip allow to breathe fervent sigh for happiness said to applaud for affection can not conquer a said emily heard noise from apartment turning round saw door from staircase open man rush into chamber will teach to conquer cried a advanced into corridor drew stiletto aimed at du pont who be unarmed who stepping back avoided blow then sprung upon verezzi from whom wrenched stiletto while struggled in others grasp emily followed by annette ran further into corridor calling on ludovico who be however gone from staircase a advanced terrified uncertain what to do distant noise seemed to arise from hall reminded her of danger be incurring sending annette forward in search of ludovico returned to spot where du pont verezzi be still struggling for victory be own cause be to be decided with of former whose conduct independently of circumstance must however have interested in success even have not disliked dreaded verezzi threw in chair supplicated to desist from further violence till at length du pont forced verezzi to floor where lay stunned by violence of fall then entreated du pont to escape from room before montoni party must appear still refused to leave unprotected while emily now more terrified for than for herself enforced entreaty heard step ascending private staircase o be lost cried be montonis people du pont made reply supported emily while with steady though eager countenance awaited appearance in next moment ludovico alone mounted landing place

yet did not conceal be quickly awakened from complacent delight scene have diffused upon mind by countess who discontented with object around impatient for refreshment repose hastened forward to large parlour whose cedar wainscot narrow pointed casement dark ceiling of carved cypress wood gave aspect of peculiar gloom dingy green velvet of chair couch fringed with tarnished gold have once be designed to enliven while countess enquired for refreshment count attended by son went to look over part of chteau lady blanche reluctantly remained to witness discontent ill humour of step mother how

be not common one a emily said remembered paper with picture have be found have scarcely doubt that have concerned marchioness de villeroi with supposition came scruple whether ought to enquire further on subject might prove to be same that father have so carefully endeavoured to conceal curiosity concerning marchioness powerful a be be probable must now have resisted a have formerly done on unwarily observing few terrible word in paper have never since be erased from memory have be certain that history of lady be subject of paper that such simple particular only a be probable dorothe must relate be included in father command what be known to must be secret to many other person since appeared very unlikely that st aubert must attempt to conceal what emily might learn by ordinary mean at length concluded that if paper have related to story of marchioness be not circumstance of dorothe must disclose that have thought sufficiently important to wish to have concealed therefore no longer hesitated to make enquiry might lead to gratification of curiosity ah maamselle said dorothe be sad story can not be told now what be saying never will tell many year have passed since happened never loved to talk of marchioness to anybody husband lived in family at time a well a myself knew many particular from nobody else did for be about person of lady in last illness saw heard a much

yours what may judge proper to conceal doe not concern alone must have le scruple in revealing let confidence in honour alone persuade to disclose what request well lady replied dorothe after long pause during eye be fixed upon emily seem so much interestedand picture face of yours make think have reason to be sothat will trust youand tell thing never told before to anybody husband though there be people who have suspected a much will tell particular of lady death too of own suspicion must first promise by saint emily interrupting solemnly promised never to reveal what must be confided to without dorothes consent there be horn maamselle sounding for dinner said dorothe must be gone when will see again enquired emily dorothe mused then replied why madam may make people curious if be

of festival of preceding evening led to mention of valancourt be young man of talent said be formerly acquainted with perceive emily said that be be introduced to at paris said count be much pleased with on first acquaintance paused emily trembled between desire of hearing more fear of showing count that felt interest on subject may ask said at length how long have known monsieur valancourtwill allow to ask reason for question sir said will answer immediatelycertainly said count be just will tell reason can not perceive that monsieur valancourt admires in however there be nothing extraordinary person who see must do same be above using common place compliment speak with sincerity what fear be that be favoured admirerwhy do fear sir said emily endeavouring to conceal emotionbecause replied count think not worthy of favour emily greatly agitated entreated further explanation will give said if will believe that nothing strong interest in welfare must induce to hazard assertioni must believe so sir replied emily let rest under tree said count observing paleness of countenance here be seatyou be fatigued sat down count proceeded many young lady circumstanced a be must think conduct on occasion on so short acquaintance impertinent instead of friendly from what have observed of temper understanding fear such return from acquaintance have be short long enough to make esteem feel lively interest in happiness deserve to be very happy trust that will be so emily sighed softly bowed thanks count paused again be unpleasantly circumstanced said opportunity of rendering important service will overcome inferior consideration will inform of manner of first acquaintance with chevalier valancourt if subject be not too painful emily briefly related accident of meeting in presence of father then so earnestly entreated count not to hesitate in declaring what knew that perceived violent emotion against be contending regarding with look of tender compassion considered how might communicate information with least pain to anxious auditor chevalier son said be introduced to other at table of brother officer at whose house also met invited to own whenever must be disengaged did not then know that have formed acquaintance with set of men disgrace to specie who live by plunder pas life in continual debauchery knew several of chevalier family resident at paris considered a sufficient pledge for introduction to own be ill will leave subjectno sir said emily beg will proceed be only distressedonly said count with emphasis however will

villanythat in consideration of party have initiated into secret of trade allotted share of profit impossible said emily suddenly butpardon sir scarcely know what say allow for distress of mind must indeed must believe that have not be truly informed chevalier have doubtless enemy who misrepresented himi must be most happy to believe so replied count can not nothing short of conviction regard for happiness must have urged to repeat unpleasant report emily be silent recollected valancourts saying on preceding evening discovered pang of self reproach seemed to confirm that count have related yet have not fortitude enough to dare conviction heart be overwhelmed with anguish at mere suspicion of guilt must not endure belief of after silence count said perceive can allow for want of conviction be necessary must give proof of what have asserted can not do without subjecting one who be very dear to to dangerwhat be danger apprehend sir said emily if can prevent may safely confide in honouron honour be certain can rely said count can trust fortitude do think can resist solicitation of favoured admirer when pleads in affliction for name of one who have robbed of blessingi will not be exposed to temptation sir said emily with modest pride for can not favour one whom must no longer esteem however readily give word tear in mean time contradicted first assertion felt that time effort only must eradicate affection have be formed on virtuous esteem cherished by habit difficulty will trust then said count for conviction be necessary to peace can not perceive be obtained without confidence son have too often be eye witness of chevalier ill conduct be very near being drawn in by be indeed drawn in to commission of many folly rescued from guilt destruction judge then mademoiselle st aubert whether father who have nearly lost only son by example of chevalier have not from conviction reason to warn whom esteem against trusting happiness in such hand have seen chevalier engaged in deep play with men whom almost shuddered to look upon if still doubt will refer to son must not doubt what have witnessed replied emily sinking with grief what assert chevalier have perhaps be drawn only into transient folly may never repeat if have known justness of former principle must allow for present incredulity ala observed count be difficult to believe will make wretched will not sooth by flattering false hope know how fascinating vice of gaming be how difficult be also to conquer habit chevalier might perhaps reform for while must soon relapse into dissipationfor fear not only bond of habit must be powerful that moral be corrupted andwhy must conceal from that play be not only vice appears to have taste for vicious pleasure count hesitated paused while emily endeavoured to support a with increasing perturbation expected what might further say long pause of silence ensued during be visibly agitated at length said must be cruel delicacy must prevail with to be silentand will inform that chevalier extravagance have brought twice into prison of paris from whence be last extricated a be told upon authority can not doubt by well known parisian countess with whom continued to reside when left paris paused again looking at emily perceived countenance change that be falling from seat caught have fainted called loudly for assistance be however beyond hearing of servant at chteau feared to leave while went thither for assistance yet knew not how otherwise to obtain till fountain at great distance caught eye endeavoured to support emily against tree under have be sitting while went thither for water again be perplexed for have nothing near in water must be brought while with increased anxiety watched thought perceived in countenance symptom of returning life be long however before revived then found supportednot by count by valancourt who be observing with look of earnest apprehension who now spoke to in tone tremulous with anxiety at sound of well known voice raised eye presently closed faintness again came over count with look somewhat stern waved to withdraw only sighed heavily called on name of emily a again held water have be brought to lip on count repeating action accompanying with word valancourt answered with look of deep resentment refused to leave place till must revive to resign for moment to care of person in next instant conscience seemed to inform of what have be subject of count conversation with emily indignation flashed in eye be quickly repressed succeeded by expression of serious anguish induced count to regard with more pity than resentment view of so much affected emily when again revived that yielded to weakness of tear soon restrained exerting resolution to appear recovered rose thanked count henri with whom valancourt have entered garden for care moved towards chteau without noticing valancourt who heart struck by manner exclaimed in low voicegood god how have deserved have be said to occasion change emily without replying with increased emotion quickened step what have thus disordered emily said a still walked by side give few moment conversation entreat youi be very miserable though be spoken in low voice be overheard by count who immediately replied that mademoiselle st aubert be then too much indisposed to attend to conversation that must venture to promise must see monsieur valancourt on morrow if be better valancourts cheek be crimsoned looked haughtily at count then at emily with successive expression of surprise grief supplication must neither misunderstand resist said languidlyi will be better tomorrow if wish to accept count permission will see then see exclaimed valancourt a threw glance of mingled pride resentment upon count then seeming to recollect addedbut will come madam will accept count permission when reached door of chteau lingered moment for resentment be now fled then with look so expressive of tenderness grief that emilys heart be not proof against bade good morning bowing slightly to count disappeared emily withdrew to own apartment under such oppression of heart a have seldom known when endeavoured to recollect that count have told to examine probability of circumstance believed to consider of future conduct towards valancourt when attempted to think mind refused control must only feel that be miserable one moment sunk under conviction that valancourt be no longer same whom have so tenderly loved idea of whom have hitherto supported under affliction cheered with hope of happier daysbut fallen worthless character whom must teach to despiseif must not forget then unable to endure terrible supposition rejected disdained to believe capable of conduct such a count have described to whom believed have be misrepresented by artful enemy there be moment when even ventured to doubt integrity of count to suspect that be influenced by selfish motive to break connection with valancourt be error of instant only count character have heard spoken of by du pont many other person have observed enabled to judge forbade supposition have confidence indeed be le there appeared to be temptation to betray into conduct so treacherous so cruel did reflection suffer to preserve hope that valancourt have be mi represented to count who have said that spoke chiefly from own observation from son experience must part from valancourt therefore for everfor what of happiness tranquillity must expect with man whose taste be degenerated into low inclination to whom vice be become habitual whom must no longer esteem though remembrance of what once be long habit of loving must render very difficult for to despise o valancourt must exclaim having be separated so longdo meet only to be miserableonly to part for ever amidst tumult of mind remembered pertinaciously seeming candour simplicity of conduct on preceding night have dared to trust own heart must have led to hope much from still must not resolve to dismiss for ever without obtaining further proof of ill conduct yet saw probability of procuring if indeed proof more positive be possible something however be necessary to decide upon almost determined to be guided in opinion solely by manner with valancourt must receive hint concerning late conduct thus passed hour till dinner time when emily struggling against pressure of grief dried tear joined family at table where count preserved towards most delicate attention countess mademoiselle bearn having looked for moment with surprise on dejected countenance began a usual to talk of trifle while eye of lady blanche asked much of friend who must only reply by mournful smile emily withdrew a soon after dinner a possible be followed by lady blanche whose anxious enquiry however found quite unequal to answer whom entreated to spare on subject of distress to converse on topic be now indeed so extremely painful to that soon gave up attempt blanche left with pity of sorrow

retirement of convent a well a kindness of abbess hoped to recover command of mind to teach resignation to event too plainly perceived be approaching to have lost valancourt by death to have seen married to rival must thought have given le anguish than conviction of unworthiness must terminate in misery to robbed even of solitary image heart so long have cherished painful reflection be interrupted for moment by note from valancourt written in evident distraction of mind entreating that must permit to see on approaching evening instead of following morning request occasioned so much agitation that be unable to answer wished to see to terminate present state of suspense yet shrunk from interview incapable of deciding for at length sent to beg few moment conversation with count in library where delivered to note requested advice after reading said that if believed well enough to support interview opinion be that for relief of party ought to take place that evening affection for

refuse yet be embarrassed by recollecting that be visitor in house of count who must not be pleased by return of valancourt other consideration however soon overcame granted request on condition that must neither think of count a enemy du pont a rival then left with heart so much lightened by short respite that almost lost former sense of misfortune emily withdrew to own room that might compose

what hour must see note arrived when be with count who have sought opportunity of again conversing with of valancourt for perceived extreme distress of mind feared more than ever that fortitude must desert emily having dismissed messenger count returned to subject of late conversation urging fear of valancourts entreaty again pointing out to lengthened misery must ensue if must refuse to encounter present uneasiness repeated argument must indeed alone have protected from affection still felt for valancourt resolved to be governed by hour of interview at length arrived emily went to at least with composure of manner valancourt be so much agitated that must not speak for several minute first word be alternately of lamentation entreaty reproach afterward said emily have loved youi do love better than life be ruined by own conduct yet must seek to entangle in connection must be miserable for rather than subject to punishment be due loss of be wretch will be villain longeri will not endeavour to shake resolution by pleading of selfish passion resign emily will endeavour to find consolation in considering that though be miserable at least may be happy merit of sacrifice be indeed not own for must never have attained strength of mind to surrender if prudence have not demanded paused moment while emily attempted to conceal tear came to eye must have said speak now a be wont to do checked herselfforgive emily said suffering have occasioned sometimes when think of wretched valancourt remember that only consolation must be to believe that be no longer unhappy by folly tear now fell fast upon cheek be relapsing into frenzy of despair when emily endeavoured to recall fortitude to terminate interview only seemed to increase distress of perceiving tear that be rising to go valancourt struggled once more to overcome own feeling to sooth hers remembrance of sorrow said will in future be protection o never again will example temptation have power to seduce to evil exalted

that situation of udolpho rendered too strong to be taken by open force except after tedious operation montoni have lately shown how capable be of adding to strength advantage must be derived from skill of commander so considerable body of troop a allotted to expedition must not approach udolpho without knowledge that be not for honour of republic to have large part of regular force employed for time a siege of udolpho must require upon attack of handful of object of expedition thought might be accomplished much more safely speedily by mingling contrivance with force be possible to meet

benevolence must suggest for softening sometimes allowed solitude wished for sometimes led into friendly party constantly protected a much a possible from shrewd enquiry critical conversation of countess often invited to make excursion with daughter during conversed entirely on question suitable to taste without appearing to consult thus endeavoured gradually to withdraw from subject of grief to awake other interest in mind emily to whom appeared a enlightened friend protector of youth soon felt for tender affection of daughter heart expanded to young friend blanche a to sister whose kindness simplicity compensated for want of more brilliant quality be long before must sufficiently abstract mind from valancourt to listen to story promised by old dorothe concerning curiosity have

led into late marchioness apartment emily passed into lofty chamber hung round with dark arras so spacious that lamp held up did not show extent while dorothe when entered have dropped into chair where sighing deeply scarcely trusted with view of scene so affecting to be time before emily perceived through dusk bed on marchioness be said to have died when advancing to upper end of room discovered high canopied tester of dark green damask with curtain descending to floor in fashion of tent half drawn remaining apparently a have be left twenty year before over whole bedding be thrown

characterised miniature pray maamselle stand beside picture may look at together said dorothe who when request be complied with exclaimed again at resemblance emily also a gazed upon thought that have somewhere seen person very like though must not now recollect who be in closet be many memorial of departed marchioness robe several article of dress be scattered upon chair a if have just be thrown

persuaded to take in garden seemed refreshed by told how much better looked remember what languid smile gave ala little thought that be to die night dorothe wept again then taking up veil threw suddenly over emily who shuddered to find wrapped round descending even to foot a endeavoured to throw off dorothe entreated that must keep on for one moment thought added how like must look to dear mistress in veilmay life maamselle be happier one than hers emily having disengaged from veil laid again on dressing table surveyed closet where object on eye fixed seemed to speak of marchioness in large oriel window of painted glass stood table with silver crucifix prayer book open emily remembered with emotion what dorothe have mentioned concerning custom of playing on lute in window before observed lute lying on corner of table a if have be carelessly placed there by hand have so often awakened be sad forlorn place said dorothe for when dear lady died have heart to put to right chamber lord never came into room after so remain just a did when lady be removed for interment while dorothe spoke emily be still looking on lute be spanish one remarkably large then with hesitating hand took up passed finger over chord be out of tune uttered deep full sound dorothe started at well known tone seeing lute in emilys hand said be lute lady marchioness loved so remember when last played upon itit be on night that died came a usual to undress a entered bed chamber heard sound of music from oriel perceiving be lady who be sitting there stepped softly to door stood little open to listen for musicthough be mournfulwas so sweet there saw with lute in hand looking upwards tear fell upon cheek while sung vesper hymn so soft so solemn voice trembled a be then must stop for moment wipe away tear go on again lower than before o have often listened to lady never heard anything so sweet a made cry almost to hear have be at prayer fancy for there be book open on table beside heraye there lie open still pray let leave oriel maamselle added dorothe be heart breaking place having returned into chamber desired to look once more upon bed when a came opposite to open door leading into saloon emily in partial gleam lamp threw into thought saw something glide along into obscurer part of room spirit have be much affected by surrounding scene be probable circumstance whether real imaginary must not have affected in degree did endeavoured to conceal emotion from dorothe who however observing countenance change enquired if be ill let go said emily faintly air of room be unwholesome when attempted to do so considering that must pas through apartment where phantom of terror have appeared terror increased too faint to support sat down on side of bed dorothe believing that be only affected by consideration of melancholy catastrophe have happened on spot endeavoured to cheer then a sat together on bed began to relate other particular concerning without reflecting that might increase emilys emotion because be particularly interesting to herself little before lady death said when pain be gone off called to stretching out hand to sat down just therewhere curtain fall upon bed how well remember look at timedeath be in iti can almost fancy see nowthere lay maamselleher face be upon pillow there black counterpane be not upon bed then be laid on after death be laid out upon emily turned to look within dusky curtain a if must have seen countenance of dorothe spoke edge of white pillow only appeared above blackness of pall a eye wandered over pall fancied saw move without speaking caught dorothes arm who surprised by action by look of terror accompanied turned eye from emily to bed where in next moment too saw pall slowly lifted fall again emily attempted to go dorothe stood fixed gazing upon bed at length saidit be only wind wave maamselle have left door open see how air wave lamp tooit be only wind have scarcely uttered word when pall be more violently agitated than before emily somewhat ashamed of terror stepped back to bed willing to be convinced that wind only have occasioned alarm when a gazed within curtain pall moved again in next moment apparition of human countenance rose above screaming with terror fled got out of chamber a fast a trembling limb must bear leaving open door of room through passed when reached staircase dorothe threw open chamber door where of female servant slept sunk breathless on bed while emily deprived of presence of mind made only feeble attempt to conceal occasion of terror from astonished servant though dorothe when must speak endeavoured to laugh at own fright be joined by emily remonstrance must prevail with servant who have quickly taken alarm to pas even remainder of night in room so near to terrific chamber dorothe having accompanied emily to own apartment then began to talk over with degree of coolness strange circumstance have just occurred emily must almost have doubted own perception have not of dorothe attested truth having now mentioned what have observed in outer chamber asked housekeeper whether be certain door have be left unfastened by person might secretly have entered apartment dorothe replied that have constantly kept key of several door in own possession that when have gone round through castle a frequently did to examine if be safe have tried door among rest have always found fastened be therefore impossible added that person must have got admittance into apartment if couldit be very improbable must have chosen to sleep in place so cold forlorn emily observed that visit to chamber have perhaps be watched that person for frolic have followed into room with design to frighten while be in oriel have taken opportunity of concealing in bed dorothe allowed that be possible till recollected that on entering apartment have turned key of outer door have be done to prevent visit being noticed by of family who might happen to be up must effectually have excluded person except from chamber now persisted in affirming that ghastly countenance have seen be nothing human dreadful apparition emily be very solemnly affected of nature might be appearance have witnessed whether human supernatural fate of deceased marchioness be truth not to be doubted unaccountable circumstance occurring in very scene of suffering affected emilys imagination with superstitious awe to after having detected fallacy at udolpho might not have yielded have be ignorant of unhappy story related by housekeeper now solemnly conjured to conceal occurrence of night to make light of terror have already betrayed that count might not be distressed by report must certainly spread alarm confusion among family time added may explain mysterious affair meanwhile let watch event in silence dorothe readily acquiesced now recollected that have left door of north suite of room open not having courage to return alone to lock even outer one emily after effort so far conquered own fear that offered to accompany to foot of back staircase to wait there while dorothe ascended whose resolution being reassured by circumstance consented to go left emilys apartment together sound disturbed stillness a passed along hall gallery on reaching foot of back staircase dorothes resolution failed again having however paused moment to listen sound being heard above ascended leaving emily below scarcely suffering eye to glance within first chamber fastened door shut up whole suite of apartment returned to emily a stepped along passage leading into great hall sound of lamentation be heard seemed to come from hall stopped in new alarm to listen when emily presently distinguished voice of annette whom found crossing hall with female servant so terrified by report other maid have spread that believing must be safe only where lady be be going for refuge to apartment emilys endeavour to laugh to argue out of terror be equally vain in compassion to distress consented that must remain in room during night chapter v hail mildly pleasing solitude companion of wise good thine be balmy breath of morn just a dew bent rose be born chief when evening scene decay faint landscape swim away thine be doubtful soft decline best hour of musing thine thomson emilys injunction to annette to be silent on subject of terror be ineffectual occurrence of preceding night spread such alarm among servant who now affirmed that have frequently heard unaccountable noise in chteau that report soon reached count of north side of castle being haunted treated at first with ridicule perceiving that be productive of serious evil in confusion occasioned among household forbade person to repeat on pain of punishment arrival of party of friend soon withdrew thought entirely from subject servant have now little leisure to brood over except indeed in evening after supper when assembled in hall related story of ghost till feared to look round room started if echo of closing door murmured along passage refused to go singly to part of castle on occasion annette made distinguished figure when told not only of wonder have witnessed of that have imagined in castle of udolpho

who having in preceding year seen lady blanche at paris have become declared admirer friendship count have long entertained for father equality of circumstance made secretly approve of connection

resolution never again to visit alone at so late hour began to approach chteau when heard voice calling from part of wood be nearest to be shout of count servant who be sent to search for when entered supper room where sat with henri blanche gently reproached with look blushed to have deserved little occurrence deeply impressed mind when withdrew to own room recalled so forcibly circumstance have witnessed few night before have scarcely courage to remain alone watched to late hour when sound having renewed fear at length sunk to repose be of short continuance for be disturbed by loud unusual noise seemed to come from gallery into chamber opened groan be distinctly heard immediately after dead weight fell against door with violence threatened to burst open called loudly to know who be there received answer though at interval still thought heard something like low moaning fear deprived of power to move soon after heard footstep in remote part of gallery a approached called more loudly than before till step paused at door then distinguished voice of several of servant who seemed too much engaged by circumstance without to attend to call annette soon after entering room for water emily understood that one of maid have fainted whom immediately desired to bring into room where assisted to restore when girl have recovered speech affirmed that a be passing up back staircase

did not disclose listened attentively to that dorothe communicated occasioned much thought perplexity from night terror of servant increased to excess that several of determined to leave chteau requested discharge of count who if have faith in subject of alarm thought proper to dissemble anxious to avoid inconvenience threatened employed ridicule then argument to convince have nothing to apprehend from supernatural agency fear have rendered mind inaccessible to reason be now that ludovico proved at once courage gratitude for kindness have received from count by offering to watch during night in suite of room reputed to be haunted feared said spirit if anything of human form appearedhe must prove that dreaded that a little count paused upon offer while servant who heard looked upon one in doubt amazement annette terrified for safety of ludovico employed tear entreaty to dissuade from purpose be bold fellow said count smiling think well of what be going to encounter before

baron calling loudly for people drew sword have not yet taken from side stood upon defence stranger slowly advancing told that there be nothing to fear that came with hostile design to communicate to terrible secret be necessary for to know baron appeased by courteous manner of stranger after surveying for time in silence returned sword into scabbard desired to explain mean by have obtained access to chamber purpose of extraordinary visit without answering of enquiry stranger said that must not then explain that if baron must follow to edge of forest at short distance from castle wall must there convince that have something of importance to disclose proposal again alarmed baron who must scarcely believe that stranger meant to draw to so solitary spot at hour of night without harbouring design against life refused to go observing at same time that if stranger purpose be honourable one must not persist in refusing to reveal occasion of visit in apartment where be while spoke viewed stranger still more attentively than before observed change in countenance symptom might intimate consciousness of evil design be habited like knight be of tall majestic stature of dignified courteous manner still however refused to communicate subject of errand in place that have mentioned at same time gave hint concerning secret must disclose awakened degree of solemn curiosity in baron at length

sir knight replied baron how be possible that future peace can depend upon present determination be not now to be told said stranger have explained to utmost be late if follow must be quicklyyou will do well to consider alternative baron mused a looked upon knight perceived countenance assume singular solemnity here ludovico thought heard noise threw glance round chamber then held up lamp to assist observation not perceiving anything to confirm alarm took up book again pursued story baron paced apartment for time in silence impressed by last word of stranger whose extraordinary request feared to grant feared also to refuse at length said sir knight be utterly unknown to tell yourselfis reasonable must trust alone with stranger at hour in solitary forest tell at least who be who assisted to secrete in chamber knight frowned at latter word be moment silent then with countenance somewhat stern said be english knight be called sir bevy of lancasterand deed be not unknown at holy

true knight did not herald announce why did not appear at banquet where presence must have be welcomed instead of hiding in castle stealing to chamber at midnight stranger frowned turned away in silence baron repeated question come not said knight to answer enquiry to reveal fact if must know more follow again pledge honour of knight that will return in safetybe quick in determinationi must be gone after further hesitation baron determined to follow stranger to see result of extraordinary request therefore again drew forth sword taking up lamp bade knight lead on latter obeyed opening

baron that latter restrained resentment passed on knight having descended staircase opened secret door baron have believed be known only to proceeding through several narrow winding passage came at length to small gate opened beyond wall of castle meanwhile baron followed in silence amazement on perceiving that secret passage be so well known to stranger felt inclined to return from adventure appeared to partake of treachery a well a danger then considering that be armed observing courteous noble air of conductor courage returned blushed that have failed for moment resolved to trace mystery to source now found on heathy platform before great gate of castle where on looking up perceived light glimmering in different casement of guest who be retiring to sleep while shivered in blast looked on dark desolate scene around thought of comfort of warm chamber rendered cheerful by blaze of wood felt for moment full contrast of present situation here ludovico paused moment looking at own fire gave brightening stir wind be strong baron watched lamp with anxiety expecting moment to see extinguished though flame wavered did not expire still followed stranger who often sighed a went did not speak when reached border of forest knight turned raised head a if meant to address baron then closing lip in silence walked on a entered beneath dark spreading bough baron affected by solemnity of scene hesitated whether to proceed demanded how much further be to go knight replied only by gesture baron with hesitating step suspicious eye followed through obscure intricate path till having proceeded considerable way again demanded whither be going refused to proceed unless be informed a said looked at own sword at knight alternately who shook head whose dejected countenance disarmed baron for moment of suspicion little further be place whither must lead said stranger evil will befall youi have sworn on honour of knight baron reassured again followed in silence soon arrived at deep recess of forest where dark lofty chesnuts entirely excluded sky be so overgrown with underwood that proceeded with difficulty knight sighed deeply a passed sometimes paused having at length reached spot where tree crowded into knot turned with terrific look pointing to ground baron saw there body of man stretched at length weltering in blood ghastly wound be on forehead death appeared already to have contracted feature baron on perceiving spectacle started in horror looked at knight for explanation be then going to raise body examine if there be yet remains of life stranger waving hand fixed upon look so earnest mournful a not only much surprised made desist be baron emotion when on holding lamp near feature of corpse discovered exact resemblance of stranger conductor to whom now looked up in astonishment enquiry a gazed perceived countenance of knight change begin to fade till whole form gradually vanished from astonished sense while baron stood fixed to spot voice be heard to utter word ludovico started laid down book for thought heard voice in chamber looked toward bed where however saw only dark curtain pall listened scarcely daring to draw breath heard only distant roaring of sea in storm blast that rushed by casement when concluding that have be deceived by sighings took up book to finish story while baron stood fixed to spot voice be heard to utter word note repetition seems to be intentional ludovico be picking up thread body of sir bevy of lancaster noble knight of england lie before be night waylaid murdered a journeyed from holy

in chapel of castle attended by noble knight lady who graced court of baron de brunne ludovico having finished story laid aside book for felt drowsy after putting more wood on fire taking glass of wine reposed in arm chair on hearth in dream still beheld chamber where really be once twice started from imperfect slumber imagining saw man face looking over high back of arm chair idea have so strongly impressed that when raised eye almost expected to meet other eye fixed upon own quitted seat looked behind chair before felt perfectly convinced that person be there thus closed hour chapter vii enjoy honey heavy dew of slumber thou hast figure fantasy busy care draw in brain of men therefore thou sleepst so sound shakespeare count who have slept little during night rose early anxious to speak with ludovico went to north apartment outer door having be fastened on preceding night be obliged to knock loudly for admittance knocking voice be heard considering distance of door from bedroom that ludovico wearied with watching have probably fallen into deep sleep count be not surprised on receiving answer leaving door went down to walk in ground be grey autumnal morning sun rising over provence gave only feeble light a ray struggled through vapour ascended from sea floated heavily over wood top be now varied with many mellow tint of autumn storm be passed wave be yet violently agitated course be traced by long line of foam while not breeze fluttered in sail of vessel near shore be weighing anchor to depart still gloom of hour be pleasing to count pursued way through wood sunk in deep thought emily also rose at early hour took customary walk along brow of promontory overhung mediterranean mind be now not occupied with occurrence of chteau valancourt be subject of mournful thought whom have not yet taught to consider with indifference though judgment constantly reproached for affection lingered in heart after esteem for be departed remembrance frequently gave parting look tone of voice when have bade last farewell accidental association now recalling circumstance to fancy with peculiar energy shed bitter tear to recollection having reached watch tower seated on broken step in melancholy dejection watched wave half hid in vapour a came rolling towards shore threw up light spray round rock below hollow murmur obscuring mist came in wreath up cliff gave solemnity to scene be in harmony with temper of mind sat given up to remembrance of past time till became too painful abruptly quitted place on passing little gate of watch tower observed letter engraved on stone postern paused to examine though appeared to have be rudely cut with pen knife character be familiar to at length recognising hand writing of valancourt read with trembling anxiety following line entitled shipwreck til solemn midnight on lonely steep beneath watch towrs desolated wall where mystic shape wonderer appall rest view below desert deep a through tempestuous cloud moon cold light gleam on wave viewless wind of night with loud mysterious force billow sweep sullen roar surge far below in still pause of gust hear voice of spirit rising sweet slow oft among cloud form

line appeared that valancourt have visited tower that have probably be here on preceding night for be such one a described that have left building very lately since have not long be light without light be impossible letter must have be cut be thus even probable that might be yet in garden a reflection passed rapidly over mind of emily called up variety of contending emotion almost overcame spirit first impulse be to avoid immediately leaving tower returned with hasty step towards chteau a passed along remembered music have lately heard near tower with figure have appeared in moment of agitation be inclined to believe that have then heard seen valancourt other recollection soon convinced of error on turning into thicker part of wood perceived person walking slowly in gloom at little distance mind engaged by idea of started paused imagining to be valancourt person advanced with quicker step before must recover recollection enough to avoid spoke then knew voice of count who expressed surprise on finding walking at so early hour made feeble effort to rally on love of solitude soon perceived to be more subject of concern than of light laughter changing manner affectionately expostulated with emily on thus indulging unavailing regret who though acknowledged justness of said must not restrain tear while did so presently quitted topic expressing surprise at not having yet heard from friend advocate at avignon in answer to question proposed to respecting estate of late madame montoni with friendly zeal endeavoured to cheer emily with hope of establishing claim to while felt that estate must now contribute little to happiness of life in valancourt have longer interest when returned to chteau emily retired to apartment count de villefort to door of north chamber be still fastened being now determined to arouse ludovico renewed call more loudly than before after total silence ensued count finding effort to be heard ineffectual at length began to fear that accident have befallen ludovico whom terror of imaginary being might have deprived of sens therefore left door with intention of summoning servant to force open of whom now heard moving in lower part of chteau to count enquiry whether have seen heard ludovico replied in affright that not one of have ventured on north side of chteau since preceding night sleep soundly then said count be at distance from outer door be fastened that to gain admittance to chamber will be necessary to force bring instrument follow servant stood mute dejected be not till nearly household be assembled that count order be obeyed in mean time dorothe be telling of door opened from gallery leading from great staircase into last ante room of saloon being much nearer to bed chamber appeared probable that ludovico might be easily awakened by attempt to open thither therefore count went voice be a ineffectual at door a have proved at remoter one now seriously interested for ludovico be going to strike upon door with instrument when observed singular beauty withheld blow appeared on first glance to be of ebony so dark close be grain so high polish proved to be only of larch wood of growth of provence then famous for forest of larch beauty of polished hue of delicate carving determined count to spare door returned to that leading from back staircase being at length forced entered first ante room followed by henri few of most courageous of servant rest awaiting event of enquiry on stair landing place be silent in chamber through count passed having reached saloon called loudly upon ludovico after still receiving answer threw open door of bedroom entered profound stillness within confirmed apprehension for ludovico for not even breathing of person in sleep be heard uncertainty be not soon terminated since shutter being closed chamber be too dark for object to be distinguished in count bade servant open who a crossed room to do so stumbled over something fell to floor when cry occasioned such panic among few of fellow who have ventured thus far that instantly fled count henri be left to finish adventure henri then sprung across room opening window shutter perceived that man have fallen over chair near hearth in ludovico have be sittingfor sat there no longer must anywhere be seen by imperfect light be admitted into apartment count seriously alarmed now opened other shutter that might be enabled to examine further ludovico not yet appearing stood for moment suspended in astonishment scarcely trusting sens till eye glancing on bed advanced to examine whether be there asleep person however be in proceeded to oriel where everything remained a on preceding night ludovico be nowhere to be found count now checked amazement considering that ludovico might have left chamber during night overcome by terror lonely desolation recollected report concerning have inspired yet if have be fact man must naturally have sought society fellow servant have declared have not seen door of outer room also have be found fastened with key on inside be impossible therefore for to have passed through outer door of suite be found on examination to be bolted locked with key also within count being then compelled to believe that lad have escaped through casement next examined such a opened wide enough to admit body of man be found to be carefully secured either by iron bar by shutter vestige appeared of person having attempted to pas be probable that ludovico must have incurred risk of breaking neck by leaping from window when might have walked safely through door count amazement did not admit of word returned once more to examine bedroom where be appearance of disorder except occasioned by late overthrow of chair near have stood small table on ludovicos sword lamp book have be reading remnant of flask of wine still remained at foot of table too be basket with fragment of provision wood henri servant now uttered astonishment without reserve though count said little there be seriousness in manner that expressed much appeared that ludovico must have quitted room by concealed passage for count must not believe that supernatural mean have occasioned event yet if there be such passage seemed inexplicable why must retreat through be equally surprising that not even smallest vestige must appear by progress must be traced in room everything remained a much in order a if have just walked out by common way count assisted in lifting arras with bed chamber saloon one of ante room be hung that might discover if door have be concealed behind after laborious search none be found at length quitted apartment having secured door of last ante chamber key of took into own possession then gave order strict search must be made for ludovico not only in

whenever topic now agitated count family with wonder alarm be introduced on disappearing of ludovico baron st foix seemed strengthened in former opinion concerning probability of apparition though be difficult to discover what connection there must possibly be between two subject to account for effect otherwise than by supposing that mystery attending ludovico by exciting awe curiosity reduced mind to state of sensibility rendered more liable to influence of superstition in general be however certain that from period baron adherent became more bigoted to own system than before while terror of count servant increased to excess occasioned many of to quit mansion immediately rest remained only till others must be procured to supply place most strenuous search after ludovico proved unsuccessful after several day of indefatigable enquiry poor annette gave up to despair other inhabitant of chteau to amazement emily whose mind have be deeply affected by disastrous fate of late

respectful love admiration of daughter to whom by dorothes consent at length mentioned appearance have witnessed in chamber of deceased marchioness at other period must have smiled at relation have believed that object have existed only in distempered fancy of relater now attended to emily with seriousness when concluded requested of promise that occurrence must rest in silence whatever may be

spirit be so much strengthened that thought must bear to visit garden where have so often walked with valancourt knowing that if delayed to do so scene must only affect more whenever must be viewed took advantage of present state of mind entered passing hastily gate leading from court into garden hurried up great avenue scarcely permitting memory to dwell for moment on circumstance of having here parted with valancourt soon quitted for other walk le interesting to heart brought at length to flight of step led from lower garden to terrace on seeing became agitated hesitated whether to ascend resolution returning proceeded ah said emily a ascended be same high tree used to wave over terrace same flowery thicketsthe liburnum wild rose cerinthewhich be wont to grow beneath ah there too on bank be very plant valancourt so carefully rearedo when last saw themshe checked thought must not restrain tear after walking slowly on for few moment agitation upon view of well known scene increased so much that be obliged to stop lean upon wall of terrace be mild beautiful evening sun be setting over extensive landscape to beam sloping from beneath dark cloud overhung west gave rich partial colouring touched tufted summit of grove rose from garden below with yellow gleam emily valancourt have often admired together scene at same hour be exactly on spot on night preceding departure for italy have listened to remonstrance against journey to pleading of passionate affection observation made on landscape brought to remembrance with minute particular of conversationthe alarming doubt have expressed concerning montoni doubt have since be fatally confirmed reason entreaty have employed to prevail with to consent to immediate marriage tenderness of love paroxysm of grief conviction that have repeatedly expressed that must never meet again in happiness circumstance rose afresh to mind awakened various emotion have then suffered tenderness for valancourt became a powerful a in moment when thought that be parting with happiness together when strength of mind have enabled to triumph over present suffering rather than to deserve reproach of conscience by engaging in clandestine marriagealas said emily a recollection came to mind have gained by fortitude then practisedam happy nowhe said must meet more in happiness o little thought own misconduct must separate lead to very evil then dreaded reflection increased anguish while be compelled to acknowledge that fortitude have formerly exerted if have not conducted to happiness have saved from irretrievable misfortunefrom valancourt in moment must not congratulate on prudence have saved must only lament with bitterest anguish circumstance have conspired to betray valancourt into course of life so different from virtue taste pursuit of early year have promised still loved too well to believe that heart be even now depraved though conduct have be criminal observation have fallen from m st aubert more than once now occurred to young man said speaking of valancourt have never be at paris remark have surprised at time be uttered now understood exclaimed sorrowfully o valancourt if such friend a father have be with at parisyour noble ingenuous nature must not have fallen sun be now set recalling thought from melancholy subject continued walk for pensive shade of twilight be pleasing to nightingale from surrounding grove began to answer other in long drawn plaintive note always touched heart while fragrance of flowery thicket bounded terrace be awakened by cool evening air floated so lightly among leaf that scarcely trembled a passed emily came at length to step of pavilion terminated terrace where last interview with valancourt before departure from thoulouse have so unexpectedly taken place door be now shut trembled while hesitated whether to open wish to see again place have be chief scene of former happiness at length overcoming reluctance to encounter painful regret must renew entered room be obscured by melancholy shade through open lattice darkened by hanging foliage of vine appeared dusky landscape garonne reflecting evening light west still glowing chair be placed near one of balcony a if person have be sitting there other furniture of pavilion remained exactly a usual emily thought looked a if have not once be moved since set out for italy silent deserted air of place added solemnity to emotion for heard only low whisper of breeze a shook leaf of vine very faint murmur of garonne seated in chair near lattice yielded to sadness of heart while recollected circumstance of parting interview with valancourt on spot be here too that have passed of happiest hour of life with when aunt favoured connection for here have often sat worked while conversed read now well remembered with what discriminating judgment with what tempered energy used to repeat of sublimest passage of favourite author how often must pause to admire with excellence with what tender delight must listen to remark correct taste be possible said emily a recollection returnedis possible that mind so susceptible of be grand beautiful must stoop to low pursuit be subdued by frivolous temptation remembered how often have seen sudden tear start in eye have heard voice tremble with emotion while related great benevolent action repeated sentiment of same character mind said heart be to be sacrificed to habit of great city recollection becoming too painful to be endured abruptly left pavilion anxious to escape from memorial of departed happiness returned towards chteau a passed along terrace perceived person walking with slow step dejected air under tree at distance twilight be now deep must not allow to distinguish who be imagined to be one of servant till sound of step seeming to reach turned half round thought saw valancourt whoever be instantly struck among thicket on left disappeared while emily eye fixed on place whence have vanished frame trembling so excessively that must scarcely support remained for moment unable to quit spot scarcely conscious of existence with recollection strength returned hurried toward house where did not venture to enquire who have be in garden lest must betray emotion sat down alone endeavouring to recollect figure air feature of person have just seen view of however have be so transient gloom have rendered so imperfect that must remember nothing with exactness yet general appearance of figure abrupt departure made still believe that person be valancourt sometimes indeed thought that fancy have be occupied by idea of have suggested image to uncertain sight conjecture be fleeting if be whom have seen wondered much that must be at thoulouse more how have gained admittance into garden a often a impatience prompted to enquire whether stranger have be admitted be restrained by unwillingness to betray doubt evening be passed in anxious conjecture in effort to dismiss subject from thought endeavour be ineffectual thousand inconsistent emotion assailed whenever fancied that valancourt might be near now dreaded to be true now feared to be false while constantly tried to persuade that wished person whom have seen might not be valancourt heart a constantly contradicted reason following day be occupied by visit of several neighbouring family formerly intimate with madame montoni who came to condole with emily on death to congratulate upon acquisition of estate to enquire about montoni concerning strange report have heard of own situation be done with utmost decorum visitor departed with a much composure a have arrived emily be wearied by formality disgusted by subservient manner of many person who have thought scarcely worthy of common attention while be believed to be dependant on madame montoni surely said there be magic in wealth can thus make person pay court to when doe not even benefit how strange be that fool knave with rich must be treated with more respect by world than good man wise man in poverty be evening before be left alone then wished to have refreshed spirit in free air of garden feared to go thither lest must meet again person whom have seen on preceding night must prove to be valancourt suspense anxiety suffered on subject found effort unable to control secret wish to see valancourt once more though unseen by powerfully prompted to go prudence delicate pride restrained determined to avoid possibility of throwing in way by forbearing to visit garden for several day when after near week again ventured made annette companion confined walk to lower ground often started a leaf rustled in breeze imagining that person be among thicket at turn of alley looked forward with apprehensive expectation pursued walk thoughtfully silently for agitation must not suffer to converse with annette to whom however thought silence be so intolerable that did not scruple at length to talk to mistress dear madam said why do start so one must think knew what have happened what have happened said emily in faltering voice trying to command emotion night before last know madam know nothing annette replied lady in more hurried voice night before last madam there be robber in garden robber said emily in eager yet doubting tone suppose be robber madam what else must be where did see annette rejoined emily looking round turning back towards chteau be not that saw madam be jean gardener be twelve oclock at night a be coming across court to go back way into house what must seebut somebody walking in avenue front garden gate so with jean

warrant examined well settled what window must break in at gun said emilythe gun yes madam in good time presently jean say robber opened gate be coming into court then thought proper to ask business so called out again bade say who be what wanted man must do turned upon heel passed into garden again jean knew then well enough how be so fired after fired exclaimed emily yes madam fired off gun holy virgin what make look so pale madam man be not killedi dare say if be comrade carried off for when jean went in morning to look for body be gone nothing to be seen track of blood on ground jean followed that might find out where man got into garden be lost in grass annette be interrupted for emilys spirit died away must have fallen to ground if girl have not caught supported to bench close to when after long absence sens returned emily desired to be led to apartment though trembled with anxiety to enquire further on subject of alarm found too ill at present to dare intelligence be possible might receive of valancourt having dismissed annette that might weep think at liberty endeavoured to recollect exact air of person whom have seen on terrace still fancy gave figure of valancourt have indeed scarcely doubt that be whom have seen at whom gardener have fired for manner of latter person a described by annette be not that of robber did appear probable that robber must have come alone to break into house so spacious a when emily thought sufficiently recovered to listen to what jean might have to relate sent for must inform of circumstance might lead to knowledge of person who have be shot of consequence of wound after severely reprimanding for having fired with bullet ordering diligent enquiry to be made in neighbourhood for discovery of wounded person dismissed remained in same state of terrible suspense tenderness have ever felt for valancourt be recalled by sense of danger more considered subject more conviction strengthened that be who have visited garden for purpose of soothing misery of disappointed affection amidst scene of former happiness dear madam said annette when returned never saw so affected before dare say man be not killed emily shuddered lamented bitterly rashness of gardener in having fired knew must be angry enough about madam must have told before knew so too for say annette say nothing about to lady lie on other side of house so did not hear gun perhaps must be angry with if knew seeing there be blood then say how be one to keep garden clear if one be afraid to fire at robber when one see more of said emily pray leave annette obeyed emily returned to agonizing consideration have assailed before at length endeavoured to sooth by new remark if stranger be valancourt be certain have come alone appeared therefore that have be able to quit garden without assistance circumstance did not seem probable have wound be dangerous with consideration endeavoured to support during enquiry be making by servant in neighbourhood day after day came still closed in uncertainty concerning affair emily suffering in silence at length drooped sunk under pressure of anxiety be attacked by slow fever when yielded to persuasion of annette

somewhat sheltered from air by overhanging cliff by wood of larch rose over precipice on left guide being yet ignorant how far be from inn traveller determined to rest till moon must rise storm disperse blanche recalled to sense of present moment looked on surrounding gloom with terror giving hand to st foix alighted whole party entered kind of cave if such must be called be only willow

thought le excellent when repast be finished st foix impatient for moon sauntered along precipice to point fronted east be yet wrapt in gloom silence of night be broken only by murmuring of wood waved far below by distant thunder now then by faint voice of party have quitted viewed with emotion of awful sublimity long volume of sulphureous cloud floated along upper middle region of air lightning flashed from sometimes silently at others followed by sullen peal of thunder mountain feebly prolonged while whole horizon abyss on stood be discovered in momentary light upon succeeding darkness fire have be kindled in cave threw partial gleam illumining point of opposite rock summit of pine wood that hung beetling on cliff below while recess seemed to frown in deeper shade st foix stopped to observe picture party in cave presented where elegant form of blanche be finely contrasted by majestic figure of count who be seated by on rude stone be rendered more impressive by grotesque habit strong feature of guide other attendant who be in back ground of piece effect of light too be interesting on surrounding figure threw strong though pale gleam glittered on bright arm while upon foliage of gigantic larch impended shade over cliff above appeared red dusky tint deepening almost imperceptibly into blackness of night while st foix contemplated scene moon broad yellow rose over eastern summit from among embattled cloud showed dimly grandeur of heaven mass of vapour rolled way down precipice beneath doubtful mountain what dreadful pleasure there to stand sublime like shipwreckd mariner on desert coast view thenormous waste of vapour tost in billow lengthning to thhorizon round minstrel from romantic reverie be awakened by voice of guide repeating name be reverbed from cliff to cliff till hundred tongue seemed to call when soon quieted fear of count lady blanche by returning to cave a storm however seemed approaching did not quit place of shelter count seated between daughter st foix endeavoured to divert fear of former conversed on subject relating to natural history of scene among wandered spoke of mineral fossile substance found in depth of mountainsthe vein of marble granite with abounded stratum of shell discovered near summit many thousand fathom above level of sea at vast distance from present shoreof tremendous chasm cavern of rock grotesque form of mountain various phenomenon seem to stamp upon world history of deluge from natural history descended to mention of event circumstance connected with civil story of pyrenees named of most remarkable fortress france spain have erected in pass of mountain gave brief account of celebrated siege encounter in early time when ambition first frightened solitude from deep recess made mountain before have echoed only to torrent roar tremble with clang of arm when man first footstep in sacred haunt have left print of blood a blanche sat attentive to narrative rendered scene doubly interesting resigned to solemn emotion while considered that be on very ground once polluted by event reverie be suddenly interrupted by sound came in windit be distant bark of watch dog traveller listened with eager hope a wind blew stronger fancied that sound came from great distance guide having little doubt that proceeded from inn be in search of count determined to pursue way moon now afforded stronger though still uncertain light a moved among broken cloud traveller led by sound recommenced journey along brow of precipice preceded by single torch now contended with moonlight for guide believing must reach inn soon after sunset have neglected to provide more in silent caution followed sound be heard at interval after time entirely ceased guide endeavoured however to point course to quarter whence have issued deep roaring of torrent soon seized attention presently came to tremendous chasm of mountain seemed to forbid further progress blanche alighted from mule a did count st foix while guide traversed edge in search of bridge however rude might convey to opposite side at length confessed what count have begun to suspect that have be for time doubtful of way be now certain only that have lost at little distance be discovered rude dangerous passage formed by enormous pine thrown across chasm united opposite precipice have be felled probably by hunter to facilitate chace of izard wolf whole party guide excepted shuddered at prospect of crossing alpine bridge whose side afforded kind of defence from to fall be to die guide however prepared to lead over mule while blanche stood trembling on brink listening to roar of water be seen descending from rock above overhung with lofty pine thence precipitating into deep abyss where white surge gleamed faintly in moonlight poor animal proceeded over perilous bridge with instinctive caution frightened by noise of cataract deceived by gloom impending foliage threw athwart way be now that solitary torch have be hitherto of little service be found to be inestimable treasure blanche terrified shrinking endeavouring to recollect firmness presence of mind preceded by lover supported by father followed red gleam of torch in safety to opposite cliff a went on height contracted formed narrow pas at bottom of torrent have just crossed be heard to thunder be again cheered by bark of dog keeping watch perhaps over flock of mountain to protect from nightly descent of wolf sound be much nearer than before while rejoiced in hope of soon reaching place of repose light be seen to glimmer at distance appeared at height considerably above level of path be lost seen again a if waving branch of tree sometimes excluded then admitted ray guide hallooed with strength sound of human voice be heard in return at length a more effectual mean of making known fired pistol while listened in anxious expectation noise of explosion be alone heard echoing among rock gradually sunk into silence friendly hint of man disturbed light however have be seen before now became plainer soon after voice be heard indistinctly on wind upon guide repeating call voice suddenly ceased light disappeared

preserved of in inferior station have be suffered to fall into decay be now frequently converted into more peaceful habitation of hunter shepherd who after day of toil retires hither with faithful dog forgets near cheerful blaze labour of chace anxiety of collecting wandering flock while be sheltered from nightly storm be always thus peacefully inhabited said lady blanche replied count be sometimes asylum of french spanish smuggler who cross mountain with contraband good from respective country latter be particularly numerous against whom strong party of king troop be sometimes sent desperate resolution of adventurer who knowing that if be taken must expiate breach of law by most cruel death travel in large party well armed often daunts courage of soldier smuggler who seek only safety never engage when can possibly avoid military also who know that in encounter danger be certain glory almost unattainable be equally reluctant to fight engagement therefore very seldom happens when doe never concludes till after most desperate bloody conflict be inattentive blanche added count have wearied with dull subject see yonder in moonlight be edifice have be in search of be fortunate to be so near before storm burst blanche looking up perceived that be at foot of cliff on whose summit building stood light now issued from barking of dog too have for time ceased guide began to doubt whether be really object of search from distance at surveyed shown imperfectly by cloudy moon appeared to be of more extent than single watch tower difficulty be how to ascend height whose abrupt declivity seemed to afford kind of pathway while guide carried forward torch to examine cliff count remaining with blanche st foix at foot under shadow of wood endeavoured again to beguile time by conversation again anxiety abstracted mind of blanche then consulted apart with st foix whether must be advisable must path be found to venture to edifice might possibly harbour bandit considered that own party be not small that several of be well armed after enumerating danger to be incurred by passing night in open wild exposed perhaps to effect of thunder storm there remained not doubt that ought to endeavour to obtain admittance to edifice above at hazard respecting inhabitant might harbour darkness dead silence surrounded appeared to contradict probability of being inhabited at shout from guide aroused attention after in few minute one of count servant returned with intelligence that path be found immediately hastened to join guide when ascended little winding way cut in rock among thicket of dwarf wood after much toil danger reached summit where several ruined tower surrounded by massy wall rose to view partially illumined by moonlight space around building be silent

to have flourished decayed with building still appeared frowningly to protect by few remaining branch leafless moss grown crowned trunk whose wide extent told how enormous tree have be in former age fortress be evidently once of great strength from situation on point of rock impending over deep glen have be of great power to annoy a well a to resist count therefore a stood surveying be somewhat surprised that have be suffered ancient a be to sink into ruin present lonely deserted air excited in breast emotion of melancholy awe while indulged for moment emotion thought heard sound of remote voice steal upon stillness from within building front of again surveyed with scrutinizing eye yet light be visible now determined to walk round fort to remote part of whence thought voice have arisen that might examine whether light must be discerned there before ventured to knock at gate for purpose entered upon terrace where remains of cannon be yet apparent in thick wall have not proceeded many pace when step be suddenly arrested by loud barking of dog within fancied to be same whose voice have be mean of bringing traveller thither now appeared certain that place be inhabited count returned to consult again with st foix whether must try to obtain admittance for wild aspect have somewhat shaken former resolution after second consultation submitted to consideration before determined be strengthened by discovery of dog guarded fort a well a by stillness pervaded therefore ordered one of servant to knock at gate who be advancing to obey when light appeared through loop hole of one of tower count called loudly receiving answer went up to gate struck upon with iron pointed pole have assisted to climb steep when echo have ceased that blow have awakened renewed barkingand there be now more than one dogwas only sound be heard count stepped back few pace to observe whether light be in tower perceiving that be gone returned to portal have lifted pole to strike again when again fancied

place count have observed hunter spear carried word from tower encouraged to await event gate be soon opened several men in hunter habit who have heard above what have passed below appeared having listened time to count told be welcome to rest there for night then pressed with much courtesy to enter to partake of such fare a be about to sit down to count who have observed attentively while

hunter however commended warmth of other apartment pressed removal with such seeming courtesy that count half doubting half fearful of betraying doubt consented to go long ruinous passage through went somewhat daunted thunder now burst in loud peal above made dangerous to quit place of shelter forbore to provoke conductor by showing that distrusted hunter led way with lamp count st foix who wished to please host by instance of familiarity carried seat blanche followed with faltering step a passed on part of dress caught on nail in wall while stopped somewhat too scrupulously to disengage count

lately under hand of surgeon there regardless of careless of friend whose late unkindness have urged to believe that be indifferent a to fate remained without informing of situation now being sufficiently recovered to bear travelling have taken la valle in way to estuvire count residence partly for purpose of hearing of emily of being again near partly for of enquiring into situation of

concerning emily gave nearly money have about though repeatedly refused declaring that mistress have amply supplied want then drawing ring of value from finger delivered with solemn charge to present to emily of whom entreated a last favour that must preserve for sake sometimes when looked upon remember unhappy giver theresa wept a received ring be more from sympathy than from presentiment of evil before must reply valancourt abruptly left cottage followed to door calling upon name entreating to return received answer saw more chapter xiv call up that left half told story of cambuscan bold milton on following morning a emily sat in parlour adjoining library reflecting on scene of preceding night annette rushed wildly into room without speaking sunk breathless into chair be time before must answer anxious enquiry of emily a to occasion of emotion at length exclaimed have seen ghost madam have seen ghost who do mean said emily with extreme impatience came in from hall madam continued annette a be crossing to parlour who be speaking of repeated emily who came in from hall be dressed just a have seen often often added annette ah who must have thought emilys patience be now exhausted be reprimanding for such idle fancy when servant entered room informed that stranger without begged leave to speak with immediately occurred to emily that stranger be valancourt told servant to inform that be engaged must not see person servant having delivered message returned with one from stranger urging first request saying that have something of consequence to communicate while annette who have hitherto sat silent amazed now started up cry be ludovicoit be ludovico ran out of room emily bade servant follow if really be ludovico to show into parlour in few minute ludovico appeared accompanied by annette who a joy rendered forgetful of rule of decorum towards mistress must not suffer person to be heard for time emily expressed surprise satisfaction on seeing ludovico in safety first emotion increased when delivered letter from count de villefort lady blanche informing of late adventure of present situation at inn among pyrenees where have be detained by illness of mon st

annette whose joy on seeing in safety must not have be more extravagant have arisen from grave meanwhile emily perused again letter of friend whose expression of esteem kindness be very necessary consolation to heart awakened a be by late interview to emotion of keener sorrow regret invitation to chteau le blanc be pressed with so much kindness by count daughter who strengthened by message from countess occasion of be so important to friend that emily must not refuse to accept though wished to remain in quiet shade of native home must avoid perceiving impropriety of remaining there alone since valancourt be again in neighbourhood sometimes too thought that change of scenery society of friend might contribute more than retirement to restore to tranquillity when ludovico again appeared desired to give detail of adventure in north apartment to tell by what mean became companion of bandit with whom count have found immediately obeyed while annette who have not yet have leisure to ask many question on subject prepared to listen with countenance of extreme curiosity venturing to remind lady of incredulity concerning spirit in castle of udolpho of own sagacity in believing in while emily blushing at consciousness of late credulity observed that if ludovicos adventure must justify annettes superstition have probably not be here to relate ludovico smiled at annette bowed to emily then began a follows may remember madam on night when sat up in north chamber lord count mon henri accompanied thither that while remained there nothing happened to excite alarm when be gone made fire in bedroom not being inclined to sleep sat down on hearth with book have brought with to divert mind confess did sometimes look round chamber with something like apprehension o very like dare say interrupted annette dare say too if truth be known shook from head to foot not quite so bad a replied ludovico smiling several time a wind whistled round castle shook old casement did fancy heard odd noise once twice got up looked about nothing be to be seen except grim figure in tapestry seemed to frown upon a looked at have sat thus for above hour continued ludovico when again thought heard noise glanced eye round room to discover what came from not perceiving anything began to read again when have finished story be upon felt drowsy dropped asleep presently be awakened by noise have heard before seemed to come from part of chamber where bed stood then whether be story have be reading that affected spirit strange report have be spread of apartment dont know when looked towards bed again fancied saw man face within dusky curtain at mention of emily trembled looked anxiously remembering spectacle have witnessed there with dorothe confess madam heart did fail at instant continued ludovico return of noise drew attention from bed then distinctly heard sound like of key turning in lock what surprised more be that saw door where sound seemed to come from in next moment however arras near bed be slowly lifted person appeared behind entering from small door in wall stood for moment a if half retreating with head bending under arras concealed upper part of face except eye scowling beneath tapestry a held then while raised higher saw face of man behind looking over shoulder know not how be though sword be upon table before have not power just then to seize sat quite still watching with eye half shut a if be asleep suppose thought so be debating what must do for heard whisper stood in same posture for value of minute then thought perceived other face in duskiness beyond door heard louder whisper door surprise said emily because understood that count have caused arras to be lifted wall examined suspecting that might have concealed passage through have departed doe not appear so extraordinary to madam replied ludovico that door must escape notice because be formed in narrow compartment appeared to be part of outward wall if count have not passed over might have thought be useless to search for door where seemed a if passage must communicate with one truth be that passage be formed within wall itselfbut to return to men whom saw obscurely beyond door who did not suffer to remain long in suspense concerning design rushed into room surrounded though not before have snatched up sword to defend what must one man do against four soon disarmed having fastened arm gagged mouth forced through private door leaving sword upon table to assist a said who must come in morning to look for in fighting against ghost then led through many narrow passage cut a fancied in wall for have never seen before down several flight of step till came to vault underneath castle then opening stone door must have taken for wall went through long passage down other step cut in solid rock when door delivered into cave after turning twining about for time reached mouth of found on sea beach at foot of cliff with chteau above boat be in waiting into ruffian got forcing along with soon reached small vessel be at anchor where other men appeared when setting aboard two of fellow who have seized followed other two rowed back to shore while set sail soon found out what meant be business of men at chteau landed in rousillon after lingering several day about shore of comrade came down from mountain carried with to fort where remained till lord so unexpectedly arrived for have taken good care to prevent running away having blindfolded during journey if have not done think never must have found road to town through wild country traversed after reached fort be watched like prisoner never suffered to go out without two three companion became so weary of life often wished to get rid of well let talk said annette did not gagg after got away from chteau so dont see what reason there be to be so very weary of living to say nothing about chance have of seeing again ludovico smiled emily also who enquired what be motive of men for carrying off soon found out madam resumed ludovico that be pirate who have during many year secreted spoil in vault of castle being so near sea suited purpose well to prevent detection have tried to have believed that chteau be haunted having discovered private way to north apartment have be shut up ever since death of lady marchioness easily succeeded housekeeper husband who be only person have inhabited castle for year be so terrified by strange noise heard in night that must live there no longer report soon went abroad that be haunted whole country believed more readily suppose because have be said that lady marchioness have died in strange way because lord never must return to place afterwards why said emily be not pirate contented with cavewhy did think necessary to deposit spoil in castle cave madam replied ludovico be open to anybody treasure must not long have remained undiscovered there in vault be secure so long a report prevailed of being haunted thus then appears that brought at midnight spoil took on sea kept till have opportunity of disposing of to advantage pirate be connected with spanish smuggler bandit who live among wild of pyrenees carry on various kind of traffic such a nobody must think of with desperate horde of bandit remained till lord arrived will never forget what felt when first discovered almost gave up for lost knew that if showed bandit must discover who be probably murder to prevent secret in chteau being detected therefore kept out of lord sight have strict watch upon ruffian determined if offered family violence to discover fight for life soon after overheard of laying most diabolical plan for murder plunder of whole party when contrived to speak to of lord attendant telling be going forward consulted what be best to be done meanwhile lord alarmed at absence of lady blanche demanded ruffian having given unsatisfactory answer lord mon st foix became furious so then thought good time to discover plot rushing into chamber called out treachery lord count defend lordship chevalier drew sword directly hard battle have conquered at last a madam be already informed of by lord count be extraordinary adventure said emily much praise be due ludovico to prudence intrepidity there be circumstance however concerning north apartment still perplex perhaps may be able to explain did ever hear bandit relate anything extraordinary of room madam replied ludovico never heard speak about room except to laugh at credulity of old housekeeper who once be very near catching one of pirate be since count arrived at chteau said laughed heartily a related trick have played off blush overspread emilys cheek impatiently desired ludovico to explain why lady said a fellow be one night in bedroom heard somebody approaching through next apartment not having time to lift up arras unfasten door hid in bed just by there lay for time in a great fright suppose a be in interrupted annette when sat up so boldly to watch by aye said ludovico in a great fright a ever made anybody else suffer presently housekeeper other person came up to bed when thinking be going to examine bethought that only chance of escaping detection be by terrifying so lifted up counterpane did not do till raised face above then set off said a if have seen devil got out of room undiscovered emily must not forbear smiling at explanation of deception have given so much superstitious terror be surprised that must have suffered to be thus alarmed till considered that when mind have once begun to yield to weakness of superstition trifle impress with force of conviction still however remembered with mysterious music have be heard at midnight near chteau le blanc asked ludovico if must give explanation of must not only know madam added that did not belong to pirate for have heard laugh about say believed devil be in league with there yes will answer for be said annette countenance brightening be sure all along that spirit have something to do with north apartment now see madam be right at last can not be denied that spirit be very busy in part of chteau replied emily smiling be surprised ludovico that pirate must persevere in scheme after

emptied when took away gloried exceedingly in opportunity of confirming superstitious report have be spread of north chamber be careful to leave everything there a have found better to promote
