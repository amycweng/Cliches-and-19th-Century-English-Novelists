circumstance till mentioned vicinity of dungeon to southern building dreadful relation formerly given by marquis instantly recurred to mind of ferdinand who did not hesitate to believe that moan heard came from restless spirit of murdered della campo at conviction horror thrilled nerve remembered oath be silent courage however yielded to idea of passing night alone in prison where if vengeful spirit of murdered must appear might even die of horror appearance must inspire mind of ferdinand be highly superior to general influence of superstition in present instance such strong correlative

be bound up father have also confessed that have there seen appearance must never after remember without horror have occasioned to quit that part of castle recollection presented to ferdinand chain of evidence too powerful to be resisted must not doubt that spirit of dead have for once be permitted to revisit earth to call down vengeance on descendant of murderer conviction occasioned degree of horror such a apprehension of mortal power must have excited determined if possible to prevail on peter to pas hour of midnight with in dungeon strictness of peter fidelity yielded to persuasion of ferdinand though bribe must tempt to incur resentment of marquis by permitting escape ferdinand passed day in lingering anxious expectation return of night brought peter to dungeon kindness exposed to

be now distinctly heard julia sinking with terror distinguished marquis heading troop soon after separating in two division surrounded monastery gate be immediately secured abate descending from turret assembled friar in hall where voice be soon heard above other part of tumult terror of julia made utterly forgetful of padre promise wished to fly for concealment to deep cavern belonging to monastery wound under wood madame whose penetration furnished with just knowledge of abate character founded security on pride therefore dissuaded julia from attempting to tamper with honesty of servant who have key of vault advised to rely entirely on effect of abate resentment towards marquis while madame endeavoured to soothe to composure message from abate required immediate attendance obeyed bade follow to room be directly over gate of monastery from thence saw father accompanied by duke de luovo a spirit died away at sight marquis called furiously to abate to deliver instantly

yet dreaded to inflame resentment of abate whose menace own heart too surely seconded at length that have uttered ' said ' despise a dastardly subterfuge of monkish cunning new insult add to desire of recovering daughter that of punishing must proceed to instant violence must now be imperfect revenge will therefore withdraw force appeal to higher power thus will be compelled at once to restore

recounted to madame particular of conference dwelt with emphasis on threat of abate madame though amazement be heightened at word very well understood how secret whatever be have be obtained confessor of vincent have already observed in monastery there be doubt that have disclosed must be collected from dying word of vincent knew also that secret must never be published unless a punishment for immediate violence being one of first principle of monastic duty to observe religious secrecy upon matter entrusted to in confession when first tumult of julia emotion subsided joy sudden departure of marquis occasioned yielded to apprehension have threatened to appeal to higher power who must compel abate to surrender menace excited just terror there remained mean of avoiding tyranny of marquis by quitting monastery therefore requested audience of abate having represented danger of present situation intreated permission to depart in quest of safer retreat abate who well knew marquis be wholly in power smiled at repetition of menace denied request under pretence of having now become responsible for to church bade be comforted promised protection assurance be given in so distant haughty

perplexity with herself when attempted to account for marquis appearance why after late daring menace must come secretly to visit abate by whose connivance alone must have gained admission to monastery what must have influenced abate to conduct circumstance though equally inexplicable united to confirm fear of treachery surrender to escape from abbey be now inpracticable for gate be constantly guarded even be possible to pas certain detection awaited julia without from marquis people who be stationed in wood thus encompassed with danger must only await in monastery issue of destiny while be lamenting with madame unhappy fate be summoned once more to attend abate at moment spirit entirely forsook crisis of fate seemed arrived for did not doubt that abate intended to surrender to marquis with whom supposed have negotiated term of accommodation be time before must recover composure sufficient to obey summons when did step bore towards abate room increased dread paused moment at door have courage to open idea of father immediate resentment arose to mind be upon point of retreating to chamber when sudden step within near door destroyed hesitation entered

exulted in successful vengeance marquis smarted beneath sting of disappointment menace of former be too seriously alarming to suffer marquis to prosecute violent measure have therefore resolved by opposing avarice to pride to soothe power must not subdue be unwilling to entrust abate with proof of compliance fear by offering bribe in letter preferred more humiliating safer method of private interview magnificent offer created temporary hesitation in mind of abate who secure of advantage shewed at first disposition to be reconciled suffered marquis to depart in anxious uncertainty after maturely deliberating upon proposal pride of abate surmounted avarice determined to prevail upon julia effectually to destroy hope of marquis by consecrating life to religion julia passed night next

confirmed odious idea character have formerly impressed heart recoiled in horror to be immured for life within wall of convent be fate little le dreadful yet such be effect of sacred love bore memory of hippolitus such aversion to duke that soon resolved to adopt veil on following evening informed abate of determination heart swelled with secret joy even natural severity of manner relaxed at intelligence assured of approbation protection with degree of kindness have never before manifested told ceremony must be performed on second day from present emotion scarcely suffered to hear last

instantly vanished thought only of escape mean have lately appeared so formidable so difficult in contrivance so dangerous in execution now seemed easy certain almost accomplished consulted on plan to be adopted agreed that in attempting to bribe servant of monastery to interest must incur danger too imminent yet appeared scarcely practicable to succeed in scheme without risquing after much

forgetful of own situation groaned aloud started with instantaneous design of avenging deed noise made alarmed bandit who looking whence came discovered count through casement instantly quitted prize rushed towards door of room be now returned to sense of danger endeavoured to escape to exterior part of ruin terror bewildered sens mistook way instead of regaining arch way perplexed with fruitless wandering at length found only more deeply involved in secret recess of pile step of pursuer gained fast upon continued to perplex with vain effort at escape till at length quite exhausted sunk on ground endeavoured to resign to fate listened with kind of stern despair be surprised to find silent on looking round perceived by ray of moonlight streamed through part of ruin from above that be in sort of vault from small mean have of judging thought be extensive in situation remained for considerable time ruminating on mean of escape yet scarcely believing escape be possible if continued in vault might continue there only to be butchered by attempting to rescue from place be now in must rush into hand of bandit judging therefore safer way of two to remain where be endeavoured to await fate with fortitude when suddenly loud voice of murderer burst upon ear heard step advancing quickly towards spot where lay despair instantly renewed vigour started from ground throwing round look of eager desperation eye caught glimpse of small door upon moon beam now fell made towards passed just a light of torch gleamed upon wall of vault groped way along winding passage at length came to flight of step notwithstanding darkness reached bottom in safety now for first time stopped to listen sound of pursuit be ceased be silent continuing to wander on in effectual endeavour to escape hand
