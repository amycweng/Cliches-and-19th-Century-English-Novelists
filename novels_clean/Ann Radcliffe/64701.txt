carefully on look for road be that anxiety must permit to utter night shade fell thick around deepened by gloom of forest soon rendered dangerous to proceed peter stopped la motte persisting in first determination ordered to go on peter ventured to remonstrate madame la motte entreated la motte reproved commanded at length repented for hind wheel rising upon stump of old tree darkness have prevented peter from observing carriage be in instant overturned party a may be supposed be much terrified one be materially hurt having disengaged from perilous situation la motte peter endeavoured to raise carriage extent of misfortune be now discovered for perceived that wheel be broke distress be reasonably great for not only be coach disabled from proceeding must not even afford shelter from

disengaged from carriage party moved towards edifice a proceeded peter who followed struck light entered ruin by flame of stick have collected partial gleam thrown across fabric seemed to make desolation more solemn while obscurity of greater part of pile heightened sublimity led fancy on to scene of horror adeline who have hitherto remained in silence now uttered exclamation of mingled admiration fear kind of pleasing dread thrilled bosom filled soul tear started into eye wished yet feared to go on hung upon arm of la motte looked at with sort of hesitating interrogation opened door of great hall entered extent be lost in gloom let stay here said madame de la motte will go further la motte pointed to broken roof be proceeding when be interrupted by uncommon noise passed along

passage showing recess more horrible across hall greater part of be concealed in shadow feeble ray spread tremulous gleam exhibiting chasm in roof while many nameless object be seen imperfectly through dusk adeline with smile inquired of la motte if believed in spirit question be ill timed for present scene impressed terror upon la motte in spite of endeavour felt superstitious dread stealing upon be now perhaps standing over ash of dead if spirit be ever permitted to revisit earth seemed hour place most suitable for appearance la motte remaining silent adeline said be inclined to superstition be interrupted by return of noise have be lately heard sounded down passage at whose entrance stood sunk gradually away heart palpitated remained listening in silence new subject of apprehension seized la motte noise might proceed from bandit hesitated whether must be safe to proceed peter now came with light madame refused to enter passage la motte be not much inclined to peter in whom curiosity be more prevalent than fear readily offered service la motte after hesitation suffered to go while awaited at entrance result of inquiry extent of passage soon concealed peter from view echo of footstep be lost in sound rushed along avenue became fainter fainter till sunk into silence la motte now called aloud to peter answer be returned at length heard sound of distant footstep peter soon after appeared breathless pale with fear when came within hearing of la motte called out please honour have done for believe have have hard bout thought be fighting with devil what be speaking of said la motte be nothing owl rook after continued peter light brought about ear made confounded clapping with wing that thought at first have be beset with legion of devil have driven out master have nothing to fear now latter part of sentence intimating suspicion of courage la motte must have dispensed with to retrieve in degree reputation made point of proceeding through passage now moved on with alacrity for a peter said have nothing to fear passage led into large area on one side of over range of cloister appeared west tower lofty part of edifice other side be open to wood la motte led way to door of tower now perceived be same have formerly entered found difficulty in advancing for area be overgrown with bramble nettle light peter carried afforded only uncertain gleam when unclosed door dismal aspect of place revived apprehension of madame la motte extorted from adeline inquiry whither be going peter held up light to show narrow staircase wound round tower la motte observing second door drew back rusty bolt entered spacious apartment from style condition be evidently of much later date than other part of structure though desolate forlorn be very little impaired by time wall be damp not decayed glass be yet firm in window passed on to suit of apartment resembling first have seen expressed surprise at incongruous appearance of part of edifice with mouldering wall have left behind apartment conducted to winding passage received light air through narrow cavity placed high in wall be at length closed by door barred with iron being with difficulty opened entered vaulted room la motte surveyed with scrutinizing eye endeavoured to conjecture for what purpose have be guarded by door of such strength saw little within to assist curiosity room appeared to have be built in modern time upon gothic plan adeline approached large window formed kind of recess raised by one step over level of floor observed to la motte that whole floor be inlaid with mosaic work drew from remark that style of apartment be not strictly gothic passed on to door appeared on opposite side of apartment unlocking found in great ball by have entered fabric now perceived what gloom have before concealed spiral staircase led to gallery above from present condition seemed to have be built with more modern part of fabric though also affected gothic mode of architecture la

examination after deliberation in of room must pas night determined to return to opened from tower fire be kindled on hearth be probable have not for many year before afforded warmth of hospitality peter having spread provision have brought from coach la motte family encircled round fire partook of repast hunger fatigue made delicious apprehension gradually gave way to confidence for now found in something like human habitation have leisure to laugh at late terror a blast shook door adeline often started threw fearful glance around continued to laugh talk cheerfully for time yet merriment be transient if not affected for sense of peculiar distressed circumstance pressed upon recollection sunk individual into languor pensive silence adeline felt forlornness of condition with energy reflected upon past with astonishment anticipated future with fear found wholly dependent upon stranger with other claim than what distress demand from common sympathy of kindred being sigh swelled heart frequent tear started to eye checked ere betrayed on check sorrow thought must be ungrateful to reveal la motte at length broke meditative silence by directing fire to be renewed for night door to be secured seemed necessary precaution even in solitude be effected by mean of large stone piled against for other fastening there be none have frequently occurred to la motte that apparently forsaken edifice might be place of refuge to bandit here be solitude to conceal wild extensive forest to assist scheme of rapine to perplex with labyrinth who might be bold enough to attempt pursuit apprehension however hid within own bosom saving companion from share of uneasiness occasioned peter be ordered to watch at door having given fire rousing stir desolate party drew round sought in sleep short oblivion of care night passed on without disturbance adeline slept uneasy dream fleeted before fancy awoke at early hour recollection of sorrow arose upon mind yielding to pressure tear flowed silently fast that might indulge without restraint went to window looked upon open part of forest be gloom silence stood for time viewing shadowy scene first tender tint of morning now appeared on verge of horizon stealing upon darkness so pure so fine so ethereal seemed a if heaven be opening to view dark mist be seen to roll off to west a tint of light grew stronger deepening obscurity of part of hemisphere involving feature of country below meanwhile in east hue became more vivid darting trembling lustre far around till ruddy glow fired that part of heaven announced rising sun at first small line of inconceivable splendour emerged on horizon quickly expanding sun appeared in glory unveiling whole face of nature vivifying colour of landscape sprinkling dewy earth with glittering light low gentle response of bird awakened by morning ray now broke silence of hour soft warblings rising by degree till swelled chorus of universal gladness adeline heart swelled too with gratitude adoration scene before soothed mind exalted thought to great author of nature uttered involuntary prayer father of good who made glorious scene resign to thy hand thou wilt support under present sorrow to protect from future evil thus confiding in benevolence of god wiped tear from eye while sweet union of conscience reflection rewarded trust mind losing feeling have lately oppressed became tranquil composed la motte awoke soon after peter prepared to set out on expedition a mounted horse please master said think have a good look further for habitation till better time turn up for nobody will think of looking for here when one see place by daylight be none so bad what little patching up must make comfortable enough la motte made reply thought of peter word during interval of night when anxiety have kept waking same idea have occurred to concealment be only security place afforded desolation of spot be repulsive to wish have only choice of evil forest with liberty be not bad home for one who have too much reason to expect prison a walked through apartment examined condition more attentively perceived might easily be made habitable now surveying under cheerfulness of morning design strengthened mused upon mean of accomplishing nothing seemed so much to obstruct a apparent difficulty of procuring food communicated thought to madame la motte who felt repugnance to scheme la motte however seldom consulted wife till have determined how to act have already resolved to be guided in affair by report of peter if must discover town in neighbourhood of forest where provision other necessary must be procured must seek further for place of rest in mean time spent anxious interval of peter absence in examining ruin walking over environs be sweetly romantic

grate almost consumed by rust on opposite side of room be door led to apartment proportioned like first hung with arras somewhat le tattered in one corner stood small bedstead few shattered chair be placed round wall la motte gazed with mixture of wonder curiosity 't be strange said that room alone must bear mark of inhabitation perhaps wretched wanderer like may have here sought refuge from persecuting world here perhaps laid down load of existence perhaps too have followed footstep to mingle dust with turned suddenly be about to quit room when perceived small door near bed opened into closet be lighted by one small window be in same condition a apartment have passed except that be destitute even of remains of furniture a walked over floor thought felt one part of shake beneath step examining found trap door curiosity prompted to explore further with difficulty opened disclosed staircase terminated in darkness la motte descended few step be unwilling to trust abyss after wondering for what purpose be so secretly constructed closed trap quitted suit of apartment stair in tower above be so much decayed that did not attempt to ascend returned to hall by spiral staircase have observed evening before reached gallery found suit of apartment entirely furnished very much like below renewed with madame la motte former conversation respecting abbey exerted endeavour to dissuade from purpose acknowledging solitary security of spot pleading that other place might be found equally well adapted for concealment more for comfort la motte doubted besides forest abounded with game must at once afford amusement food circumstance considering small stock of money by mean to be overlooked have suffered mind to dwell so much upon scheme that be become favourite one adeline listened in anxiety to discourse waited issue of peter report morning passed peter did not return solitary party took dinner of provision have fortunately brought with afterwards walked forth into wood adeline who never suffered good to pas unnoticed because came attended with evil forgot for while desolation of abbey in beauty of adjacent scenery pleasantness of shade soothed heart varied

affection afternoon wore away returned to abbey peter be still absent absence now began to excite surprise apprehension approach of darkness also threw gloom upon hope of wanderer night must be passed under same forlorn circumstance a preceding one be still worse with very scanty stock of provision fortitude of madame la motte now entirely forsook wept bitterly adeline heart be a mournful a madame rallied drooping spirit gave first instance of kindness by endeavouring to revive of friend la motte be restless uneasy leaving abbey walked alone way peter have taken have not gone far when perceived between tree leading horse what news peter hallooed la motte peter came on panting for breath said not word till la motte repeated question in tone of somewhat more authority ah bless master said when

went down stair how heart revived at step of departure fell upon knee thanked god that have preserved time implored further protection be rising from short prayer when suddenly heard noise in different part of room on looking round perceived door of small closet open two men enter chamber seized sunk senseless in arm how long remained in condition know not on reviving perceived again alone heard several voice from below stair have presence of mind to run to door of closet only chance of escape be locked then recollected be possible that ruffian might have forgot to turn key of chamber

add that will for ever bless a deliverer adeline ceased to speak madame la motte remained silent there be circumstance in adeline narrative raised curiosity asked if adeline believed father to be party in mysterious affair adeline though be impossible to doubt that have be principally materially concerned in part of thought said thought be innocent of intention against life yet what motive said madame la motte must there be for degree of cruelty so apparently unprofitable here inquiry ended adeline confessed have pursued till mind shrunk from further research sympathy such uncommon misfortune excited madame la motte now expressed without reserve expression of strengthened tie of mutual friendship adeline felt spirit relieved by disclosure have made to madame la motte latter acknowledged value of confidence by increase of affectionate attention chapter iv may of life be fall'n into sear yellow leaf full oft unknowing unknown wore endless noon alone amid th autumnal wood oft be wont in hasty fit abrupt social board to quit wharton la motte have now passed above month in seclusion wife have pleasure to see recover tranquillity even cheerfulness in pleasure adeline warmly participated might justly have congratulated a one cause of restoration cheerfulness delicate attention have effected what madame la motte greater anxiety have failed to accomplish la motte did not seem regardless of amiable disposition sometimes thanked in manner more earnest than be usual with in turn considered a only protector now felt towards affection of daughter time have spent in peaceful retirement have softened remembrance of past event restored mind to natural tone when memory brought back to view former short romantic expectation of happiness though gave sigh to rapturous illusion le lamented disappointment than rejoiced in present security comfort satisfaction la motte cheerfulness diffused around be of short continuance became suddenly gloomy reserved society of family be no longer grateful to must spend whole hour in most secluded part of forest devoted to melancholy secret grief did not a formerly indulge humour of sadness without restraint in presence of others now evidently endeavoured to conceal affected cheerfulness be too artificial to escape detection servant peter impelled by curiosity kindness sometimes followed unseen into forest observed frequently retire to one particular spot in remote part having gained always disappeared before peter who be obliged to follow at distance must exactly notice where endeavour now prompted by wonder invigorated by disappointment be unsuccessful be at length compelled to endure torture of unsatisfied curiosity change in manner habit of husband be too conspicuous to pas unobserved by madame la motte who endeavoured by stratagem affection must suggest female invention supply to win to confidence seemed insensible to influence of first withstood wile of latter finding effort insufficient to dissipate gloom overhung mind to penetrate secret cause desisted from further attempt endeavoured to submit to mysterious distress week after week elapsed same unknown cause sealed lip corroded heart of la motte place of visitation in forest have not be traced peter have frequently examined round spot where master disappeared have never discovered recess must be supposed to conceal astonishment of servant be at length raised to insupportable degree communicated to mistress subject of emotion information excited disguised from peter reproved for mean have taken to gratify curiosity revolved circumstance in thought comparing with late alteration in temper uneasiness be renewed perplexity considerably increased after much consideration being unable to assign other motive for conduct began to attribute to influence of illicit passion heart now out ran judgment confirmed supposition roused torturing pang of jealousy comparatively speaking have never known affliction till now have abandoned dearest friend connexion have relinquished gaiety luxury almost necessary of life fled with family into exile exile most dreary comfortless experiencing evil of reality of apprehension united have patiently endured supported by affection of for whose sake suffered though affection indeed have for time appeared to be abated have decrease with fortitude last stroke of calamity hitherto withheld now came with irresistible force love of lamented loss now believed be transferred to operation of strong passion confuses power of reason warp to own particular direction usual degree of judgment unopposed by influence of heart must probably have pointed out to madame la motte circumstance upon subject of distress equivocal if not contradictory to suspicion such circumstance appeared to did not long hesitate to decide adeline be object of husband attachment beauty out of question who else indeed must be in spot thus secluded from world same cause destroyed almost at same moment only remaining comfort when wept that must no longer look for happiness in affection of la motte wept also that must no longer seek solace in friendship of adeline have too great esteem for to doubt at first integrity of conduct in spite of reason heart no longer expanded to with usual warmth of kindness shrunk from confidence a secret brooding of jealousy cherished suspicion became le kind to even in manner adeline observing change at first attributed to accident afterwards to temporary displeasure arising from little inadvertency in conduct therefore increased assiduity perceiving contrary to expectation that effort to please failed of usual consequence that reserve of madame manner rather increased than abated became seriously uneasy resolved to seek explanation madame la motte a sedulously avoided be for time able to prevent adeline however too much interested in event to yield to delicate scruple pressed subject so closely that madame at first agitated confused at length invented idle excuse laughed off affair now saw necessity of subduing appearance of reserve towards adeline though art must not conquer prejudice of passion taught to assume with tolerable success aspect of kindness adeline be deceived be again at peace indeed confidence in sincerity goodness of others be weakness pang of stifled jealousy struck deeper to heart of madame la motte resolved at event to obtain certainty upon subject of suspicion now condescended to meanness have before despised ordered peter to watch step of master in order to discover if possible place of visitation so much did passion win upon judgment by time indulgence that sometimes ventured even to doubt integrity of adeline afterwards proceeded to believe possible that object of la motte ramble might be assignation with what suggested conjecture be that adeline frequently took long walk alone in forest sometimes be absent from abbey for many hour circumstance madame la motte have at first attributed to adeline fondness for picturesque beauty of nature now operated forcibly upon imagination must view in other light than a affording opportunity for secret conversation with husband peter obeyed order of mistress with alacrity for be warmly seconded by own curiosity endeavour be however fruitless never dared to follow la motte near enough to observe place of last retreat impatience thus heightened by delay passion stimulated by difficulty madame la motte now resolved to apply to husband for explanation of conduct after consideration concerning manner most likely to succeed with went to la motte when entered room where sat forgetting concerted address fell at foot be for moment lost in tear surprised at attitude distress inquired occasion of be answered that be caused by own conduct conduct what part of pray inquired reserve secret sorrow frequent absence from abbey be then so wonderful that man who have lost almost thing must sometimes lament misfortune so criminal to attempt concealing grief that must be blamed for by whom must save from pain of sharing having uttered word quitted room leaving madame la motte lost in surprise somewhat relieved from pressure of former suspicion still however pursued adeline with eye of scrutiny mask of kindness must sometimes fall off discover feature of distrust adeline without exactly knowing why felt le at ease le happy in presence than formerly spirit drooped must often when alone weep at forlornness of condition formerly remembrance of past suffering be lost in friendship of madame la motte now though behaviour be too guarded to betray striking instance of unkindness there be something in manner chilled hope of adeline unable a be to analyze circumstance soon occurred suspended for while jealousy of madame la motte roused husband from state of gloomy stupefaction peter having be one day to auboine for weekly supply of provision returned with intelligence awakened in la motte new apprehension anxiety oh sir

about way so came straight home la motte extremely shocked at peter intelligence made other reply than by cursing folly immediately went in search of madame who be walking with adeline on bank of river la motte be too much agitated to soften information by preface be discovered said king officer have be inquiring for at auboine peter have blundered upon ruin then informed of what peter have related bade prepare to quit abbey whither can fly said madame la motte scarcely able to support where said to stay here be certain destruction must take refuge in switzerland think if part of france

doubt replied who else must possibly inquire for besides behaviour of man who mentioned name put matter beyond question perhaps not said madame la motte let wait till morning ere set off may then find will be unnecessary to go may indeed king officer must probably by time have told a much la motte went to give order to peter set off in hour said peter lord bless master only consider coach wheel must take day at least to mend for honour know never mended one in life be circumstance la motte have entirely overlooked when settled at abbey peter have at first be too busy in repairing apartment to remember carriage afterwards believing must not quickly be wanted have neglected to do la motte temper now entirely forsook with many execration ordered peter to go to work immediately on searching for material formerly bought be where to be found peter at length remembered though be prudent enough to conceal circumstance that have used nail in repairing abbey be now therefore impossible to quit forest that night la motte have only to consider most probable plan of concealment must officer of justice visit ruin before morning circumstance thoughtlessness of peter in returning from auboine by straight way made not unlikely at first indeed occurred to that though family must not be removed might take one of horse escape from forest before night thought there must still be danger of detection in town through must pas must not well bear idea of leaving family unprotected without knowing when must return to whither must direct to follow la motte be not man of very vigorous resolution be perhaps rather more willing to suffer in company than alone after much consideration recollected trap door of closet belonging to chamber above be invisible to eye might be direction

of rest for dead having reached extremity of cell way be again closed by door la motte now hesitated whether must attempt to proceed further present spot seemed to afford security sought here might pas night unmolested by apprehension of discovery be most probable that if officer arrived in night found abbey vacated must quit before morning at least before must have occasion to emerge from concealment consideration restored mind to state of greater composure only immediate care be to bring family a soon a possible to place of security lest officer must come unawares upon while stood thus musing blamed for delay irresistible desire of knowing to what door led arrested step turned to open door however be fastened a attempted to force suddenly thought heard noice above now occurred

discontent now cell be also palace compared to bictre bastille to terror of further punishment must accompany let apprehension of greater evil teach to endure le be contented if find here refuge seek madame la motte be silent adeline forgetting late unkindness endeavoured a much a must to console while heart be sinking with misfortune must not anticipate appeared composed even cheerful attended madame la motte with most watchful solicitude felt so thankful that la motte be now secreted within recess that almost lost perception of gloom inconvenience artlessly expressed to who must not be insensible to tenderness discovered madame la motte be also sensible of renewed painful sensation effusion of gratitude mistook for of tenderness la motte returned frequently to trap door to listen if body be in abbey sound disturbed stillness of night at length sat down to supper repast be melancholy one if officer come hither to night said madame la motte sighing suppose dear peter return to auboine to morrow may there learn something more of affair at least might procure carriage to convey hence to be sure might said la motte peevishly people to attend also peter must be excellent person to show officer way to abbey to inform of what might else be in doubt about concealment here how cruel be irony replied madame la motte proposed only what thought must be for mutual good judgment be perhaps wrong intention be certainly right tear swelled into eye a spoke word adeline wished to relieve delicacy kept silent la motte observed effect of speech something like remorse touched heart approached taking hand must allow for perturbation of mind said did not mean to afflict thus idea of sending peter to auboine where have already done so much harm by blunder teased must not let pas unnoticed dear only chance of safety be to remain where be while provision last if officer come here to night probably will to morrow perhaps next day when have searched abbey without finding will depart may then emerge from recess take measure for removing to distant country madame la motte acknowledged justice of word mind being relieved by little apology have made became tolerably cheerful supper being ended la motte stationed faithful though simple peter at foot of step ascended to closet there to keep watch during night having done returned to lower cell where have left little family bed be spread having mournfully bidden other good night lay down implored rest adeline thought be too busy to suffer to repose when believed companion be sunk in slumber indulged sorrow reflection brought also looked forward to future with most mournful apprehension must la motte be seized what be to become of must then be wanderer in wide world without friend to protect money to support prospect be gloomy be terrible surveyed shuddered distress too of monsieur madame la motte whom loved with most lively affection formed inconsiderable part of hers sometimes looked back to father in only saw enemy from whom must fly remembrance heightened sorrow yet be not recollection of suffering have occasioned by be so much afflicted a by sense of unkindness wept bitterly at length with artless piety innocence only know addressed supreme being resigned to care mind then gradually became peaceful reassured soon after sunk to repose chapter v surprise adventure mystery night passed without alarm peter have remained upon post heard nothing prevented sleeping la motte heard long before saw most musically snoring though must be owned there be more of bass than of other part of gamut in performance be soon roused by bravura of la motte whose note sounded discord to ear destroyed torpor of tranquillity god bless master what be matter cried peter waking be come yes for aught care might be come did place here to sleep sirrah bless master returned peter sleep be only comfort to be have here be sure must not deny to dog in place a la motte sternly questioned concerning noise might have heard in night peter full a solemnly protested have heard none assertion be strictly true for have enjoyed comfort of being asleep whole time la motte ascended to trap door listened attentively sound be heard a ventured to lift full light of sun burst upon sight morning being now far advanced walked softly along chamber looked through window person be to be seen encouraged by apparent security ventured down stair of tower entered first apartment be proceeding towards second when suddenly recollecting first peeped through crevice of door stood half open looked distinctly saw person sitting near window upon arm rested discovery so much shocked that for moment lost presence of mind be utterly unable to move from spot person whose back be towards arose turned head la motte now recovered quitting apartment a quickly at same time a silently a possible ascended to closet raised trap door before closed heard footstep of person entering outward chamber bolt other fastening to trap there be none security depended solely upon exact correspondence of board outer door of stone room have mean of defence fastening of inner one be on wrong side to afford security even till mean of escape must be found when reached room paused heard distinctly person walking in closet above while be listening heard voice call by name instantly fled to cell below expecting moment to hear trap lifted footstep of pursuit be fled beyond reach of hearing having thrown on ground at furthest extremity of vault lay for time breathless with agitation madame la motte adeline in utmost terror inquired what have happened be time before must speak when did be almost unnecessary for distant noise sounded from above informed family of part of truth sound did not seem to approach madame la motte unable to command terror shrieked aloud redoubled distress of la motte have already destroyed cried that shriek have informed where be traversed cell with clasped hand quick step adeline stood pale still a death supporting madame la motte whom with difficulty prevented from fainting o dupras dupras be already avenged said in voice seemed to burst from heart there be pause of silence why must deceive with hope of escaping resumed why do wait here for coming let rather end torturing pang by throwing into hand at once a spoke moved towards door distress of madame la motte arrested step stay said for sake stay leave thus throw voluntarily into destruction surely sir said adeline be too precipitate despair be useless a be ill founded hear person approaching if officer have discovered trap door must certainly have be here before now word of adeline stilled tumult of mind agitation of terror subsided reason beamed feeble ray upon hope listened attentively perceiving that be silent advanced with caution to stone room thence to foot of stair led to trap door be closed sound be heard above watched long time silence continuing hope strengthened at length began to believe that officer have quitted abbey day however be spent in anxious watchfulness did not dare to unclose trap door frequently thought heard distant noise be evident however that secret of closet have escaped discovery on circumstance justly founded security following night be passed like day in trembling hope incessant watching necessity of hunger now threatened provision have be distributed with nicest economy be nearly exhausted most deplorable consequence might be expected from remaining longer in concealment thus circumstanced la motte deliberated upon most prudent method of proceeding there appeared other alternative than to send peter to auboine only town from must return within time prescribed by necessity there be game indeed in forest peter must neither handle gun use fishing rod to advantage be therefore agreed must go to auboine for supply of provision at same time bring material for mending coach wheel that might have ready conveyance from forest la motte forbade peter to ask question concerning people who have inquired for take method for discovering whether have quitted country lest blunder must again betray ordered to be entirely silent a to subject to finish business leave place with possible dispatch difficulty yet remained to be overcome who must first venture abroad into abbey to learn whether be vacated by officer of justice la motte considered that if be again seen must be effectually betrayed must not be so certain if one of family be observed for be unknown to officer be necessary however that person sent must have courage enough to go through with inquiry wit enough to conduct with caution peter perhaps have first be certainly destitute of last annette have la motte looked at wife asked if for sake dared to venture heart shrunk from proposal yet be unwilling to refuse appear indifferent upon point so essential to safety of husband adeline observed in countenance agitation of mind surmounting fear have hitherto kept silent offered to go will be le likely to offend said than man shame must not suffer la motte to accept offer madame touched with magnanimity of conduct felt momentary renewal of former kindness adeline pressed proposal so warmly seemed so much in earnest that la motte began to hesitate sir said once preserved from most imminent danger kindness have since protected refuse satisfaction of deserving goodness by grateful return of let go into abbey if by so doing must preserve from evil will be sufficiently rewarded for what little danger may incur for pleasure will be at least equal to yours madame la motte must scarcely refrain from tear a adeline spoke la motte sighing deeply said well be so go adeline from moment consider a debtor adeline staid not to reply taking light quitted cell la motte following to raise trap door cautioning to look if possible into apartment before entered if must be seen said must account for appearance so a not to discover own presence of mind may assist can not god bless when be gone madame la motte admiration of conduct began to yield to other emotion distrust gradually undermined kindness jealousy raised suspicion must be sentiment more powerful than gratitude thought must teach adeline to subdue fear what love must influence to conduct so generous madame la motte when found impossible to account for adeline conduct without alleging interested motif for however suspicion might agree with practice of world have surely forgotten how much once admired purity disinterestedness of young friend adeline mean while ascended to chamber cheerful beam of sun played once more upon sight reanimated spirit walked lightly through apartment stopped till came to stair of tower here stood for time sound met ear save sighing of wind among tree at length descended passed apartment below without seeing person little furniture remained seemed to stand exactly a have left now ventured to look out from tower only animate object appeared be deer quietly grazing under shade of wood favourite little fawn distinguished adeline came bounding towards with strong mark of joy be somewhat alarmed lest animal being observed must betray walked swiftly away through cloister illustration opened door lead to great hall of abbey passage be so gloomy dark that feared to enter started back be necessary however that must examine further particularly on opposite side of ruin of have hitherto have view fear returned when recollected how far must lead from only place of refuge how difficult must be to retreat hesitated what to do when recollected obligation to la motte considered a perhaps only opportunity of doing service determined to proceed a thought passed rapidly over mind raised innocent look to heaven breathed silent prayer with trembling step proceeded over fragment of ruin looking anxiously around often starting a breeze rustled among tree mistaking for whispering of men came to lawn fronted fabric person be to be seen spirit revived great door of hall now endeavoured to open suddenly remembering that be fastened by la motte order proceeded to north end of abbey having surveyed prospect around a far a thick foliage of tree must permit without perceiving person turned step to tower from have issued adeline be now light of heart returned with impatience to inform la motte of security in cloister be again met by little favourite stopped for moment to caress fawn seemed sensible to sound of voice discovered new joy while spoke suddenly started from hand looking up perceived door of passage leading to great hall open man in habit of soldier issue forth with swiftness of arrow fled along cloister once ventured to look back voice called to to stop heard step advancing quick in pursuit before must reach tower breath failed leaned against pillar of ruin pale exhausted man came up gazing at with strong expression of surprise curiosity assumed gentle manner assured have nothing to fear inquired if belonged to la motte observing that still looked terrified remained silent repeated assurance question know that be concealed within ruin said stranger occasion of concealment also know be of utmost importance must see will then be convinced have nothing to fear from adeline trembled so excessively that be with difficulty must support hesitated knew not what to reply manner seemed to confirm suspicion of stranger consciousness of increased embarrassment took advantage of to press further adeline at length replied that la motte have time since resided at abbey doe still madam said stranger lead to where may be found must see never sir replied adeline solemnly assure will be in vain to search for must try resumed since madam will not assist have already followed to chamber above where suddenly lost thereabouts must be concealed be plain therefore afford secret passage without waiting adeline reply sprung to door of tower now thought must betray consciousness of truth of conjecture to follow resolved to remain below upon further consideration occurred to that might steal silently into closet possibly surprise la motte at door of trap therefore hastened after that voice might prevent danger apprehended be already in second chamber when overtook immediately began to speak aloud room searched with most scrupulous care finding private door other outlet proceeded to closet then be that required fortitude to conceal agitation continued search within chamber know be concealed said though hitherto have not be able to discover how be hither followed man whom believe to be must not escape without passage will not quit place till have found examined wall board without discovering division of floor indeed so exactly corresponded that la motte have not perceived by eye by trembling of floor beneath foot here be mystery said stranger can not comprehend perhaps never will be turning to quit closet when who can paint distress of adeline upon seeing trap door gently raised la motte appeared hah cried stranger advancing eagerly to la motte sprang forward be locked in other arm astonishment of adeline for moment surpassed even former distress remembrance darted across mind explained present scene before la motte must exclaim son knew stranger a such peter who stood at foot of stair heard what passed above flew to acquaint mistress with joyful discovery in few moment be folded in embrace of son spot so lately mansion of despair seemed metamorphosed into palace of pleasure wall echoed only to accent of joy congratulation joy of peter on occasion be beyond expression acted perfect pantomime capered about clasped hand ran to young master shook by hand in spite of frown of la motte ran where without knowing for what gave rational answer to thing be said to after first emotion be subsided la motte a if suddenly recollecting resumed wanted solemnity be to blame said thus to give way to joy when be still perhaps surrounded by danger let secure retreat while be yet in power continued in few hour king officer may search for again louis comprehended father word immediately relieved apprehension by following relation letter from monsieur nemours containing account of flight from paris reached at peronne where be then upon duty with regiment mentioned that be gone towards south of france a have not since heard from be ignorant of place of refuge be about time be dispatched into flanders being unable to obtain further intelligence of passed week of very painful solicitude at conclusion of campaign obtained leave of absence immediately set out for paris hoping to learn from nemours where have found asylum of however be equally ignorant with informed that have once before written to from d upon second day journey from paris under assumed name a have be agreed upon that then said fear of discovery must prevent hazarding letter therefore remained ignorant of abode said have doubt have continued journey to southward upon slender information quitted paris in search of proceeded immediately to v where inquiry concerning further progress be successful a far a m there told have staid time on account of illness of young lady circumstance perplexed much a must not imagine what young lady must accompany proceeded however to l there trace of seemed to be lost a sat musing at window of inn observed scribbling on glass curiosity of idleness prompted to read thought knew character line read confirmed conjecture for remembered to have heard often repeat here renewed inquiry concerning route at length made people of inn recollect traced a far a auboine there again lost till upon return from fruitless inquiry in neighbourhood landlord of little inn where lodged told believed have heard news of immediately recounted what have happened at blacksmith shop few hour before description of peter be so exact that have not doubt be who inhabited abbey a knew necessity for concealment peter denial did not shake confidence next morning with assistance of landlord found way hither having searched visible part of fabric began to credit peter assertion appearance however destroyed fear by proving that place be still inhabited for disappeared so instantaneously be not certain be whom have seen continued seeking till near close of day till then scarcely quitted chamber whence have disappeared called on repeatedly believing that voice might convince of mistake at length retired to pas night at cottage near border of forest came early morning to renew inquiry hoped that believing safe must emerge from concealment how be disappointed to find abbey a silent solitary a have left preceding evening be returning once more from great hall when voice of young lady caught ear effected discovery have so anxiously sought little narrative entirely dissipated late apprehension of la motte now dreaded that inquiry of son own obvious desire of concealment might excite curiosity amongst people of auboine lead to discovery of true circumstance however for present determined to dismiss painful thought endeavour to enjoy comfort presence of son have brought furniture be removed to more habitable part of abbey cell be again abandoned to own gloom arrival of son seemed to have animated madame la motte with new life affliction be for present absorbed in joy often gazed silently on with mother fondness partiality heightened improvement time have wrought in person manner be now in twenty third year person be manly air military manner be unaffected graceful rather than dignified though feature be irregular composed countenance having seen once must seek again made eager inquiry after friend have left at paris learned that within few month of absence have died others quitted place la motte also learned that very strenuous search for have be prosecuted at paris though intelligence be only what have before expected shocked so much that now declared must be expedient to remove to distant country louis did not scruple to say that thought must be a safe at abbey a at other place repeated what nemours have said that king officer have be unable to trace part of route from paris besides resumed louis abbey be protected by supernatural power none of country people dare approach please young master said peter who be waiting in room be frightened enough first night came here god forgive thought place be inhabited by devil be only owl such like after opinion be not asked said la motte learn to be silent peter be abashed when have quitted room la motte asked son with seeming carelessness be report circulated by country people o sir reply louis can not recollect half of remember however said that many year ago person nobody have ever seen so may judge how far report ought to be credited person be privately brought to abbey confined in part of that there be strong reason to believe came unfairly to end la motte sighed further said continued louis that spectre of deceased have ever since watched nightly among ruin to make story more wonderful for marvellous be delight of vulgar added that there be certain part of ruin from whence person have dared to explore have ever returned thus people who have few object of real interest to engage thought conjure up for imaginary one la motte sat musing be reason said at length awaking from reverie pretended to assign for believing person confined here be murdered did not use term so positive a replied louis true said la motte recollecting only said came unfairly to end be nice distinction said adeline why must not well comprehend what reason be resumed louis people indeed say that person who be brought here be never known to depart find certain that ever arrived that there be strange privacy mystery observed while be here that abbey have never since be inhabited by owner there seems however to be nothing in deserves to be remembered la motte raised head a if to reply when entrance of madame turned discourse upon new subject be not resumed that day peter be now dispatched for provision while la motte louis retired to consider how far be safe for to continue at abbey la motte notwithstanding assurance lately given must not think that peter blunder son inquiry might lead to discovery of residence revolved in mind for time at length thought struck that latter of circumstance might considerably contribute to security if said to louis return to inn at auboine from whence be directed here without seeming to intend giving intelligence do give landlord account of having found abbey uninhabited then add that have discovered residence of person sought in distant town must suppress report may at present exist prevent belief of in future if after can trust for presence of mind command of countenance so far a to describe dreadful apparition think circumstance together with distance of abbey intricacy of forest must entitle to consider place a castle louis agreed to that father have proposed on following day executed commission with such success that tranquillity of abbey might be then said to have be entirely restored thus ended adventure only one have occurred to disturb family during residence in forest adeline removed from apprehension of evil with late situation of la motte have threatened from depression interest in occasioned now experienced more than usual complacency of mind thought too that observed in madame la motte renewal of former kindness circumstance awakened gratitude imparted to pleasure a lively a be innocent satisfaction with presence of son inspired madame la motte adeline mistook for kindness to herself exerted whole attention in endeavour to become worthy of joy unexpected arrival have given to la motte quickly began to evaporate gloom of despondency again settled on countenance returned frequently to haunt in forest same mysterious sadness tinctured manner revived anxiety of madame la motte who be resolved to acquaint son with subject of distress solicit assistance to penetrate source jealousy of adeline however must not communicate though again tormented taught to misconstrue with wonderful ingenuity look word of la motte often to mistake artless expression of adeline gratitude regard for of warmer tenderness adeline have formerly accustomed to long walk in forest design madame have formed of watching step have be frustrated by late circumstance be now entirely overcome by sense of difficulty danger to employ peter in affair must be to acquaint with fear to follow must most probably betray scheme by making adeline aware of jealousy being thus restrained by pride delicacy be obliged to endure pang of uncertainty concerning greatest part of suspicion to louis however related mysterious change in father temper listened to account with very earnest attention surprise concern impressed upon countenance spoke how much heart be interested be however involved in equal perplexity with upon subject readily undertook to observe motion of la motte believing interference likely to be of equal service to father mother saw in degree suspicion of mother a thought wished to disguise feeling suffered to believe that succeeded now inquired concerning adeline listened to little history of mother gave brief relation with great apparent interest so much pity did express for condition so much indignation at unnatural conduct of father that apprehension madame la motte began to form of having discovered jealousy yielded to of different kind perceived that beauty of adeline have already fascinated imagination feared that amiable manner must soon impress heart have first fondness for adeline continued must still have looked with displeasure upon attachment a obstacle to promotion fortune hoped to see one day enjoyed by son on rested future hope of prosperity regarded matrimonial alliance might form a only mean of extricating family from present difficulty therefore touched lightly upon adeline merit joined coolly with louis in compassionating misfortune with censure of father conduct mixed implied suspicion of of adeline mean employed to repress passion of son have contrary effect indifference repressed towards adeline increased pity for destitute condition tenderness with affected to judge father heightened honest indignation at character a quitted madame la motte saw father cross lawn enter deep shade of forest on left judged to be good opportunity of commencing plan quitting abbey slowly followed at distance la motte continued to walk straight forward seemed so deeply wrapt in thought that looked to right left scarcely lifted head from ground louis have followed near mile when saw suddenly strike into avenue of forest took different direction from way have hitherto gone quickened step that might not lose sight of having reached avenue found tree so thickly interwoven la motte be already hid from view continued however to pursue way before conducted through most gloomy part of forest have yet seen till at length terminated in obscure recess over arched with high tree whose interwoven branch secluded direct ray of sun admitted only sort of solemn twilight louis looked around in search of la motte be where to be seen while stood surveying place considering what further must be done observed through gloom object at distance deep shadow fell around prevented distinguishing what be in advancing perceived ruin of small building from trace remained appeared to have be tomb a gazed upon here said be probably deposited ash of ancient monk once inhabitant of abbey perhaps of founder who after having spent life of abstinence prayer sought in heaven reward of forbearance upon earth peace be to soul did think life of mere negative virtue deserved eternal reward mistaken man reason have trusted to dictate must have informed that active virtue adherence to golden rule do a must be done unto must alone deserve favour of deity whose glory be benevolence remained with eye fixed upon spot presently saw figure arise under arch of sepulchre started a if on perceiving immediately disappeared though unused to fear felt at moment uneasy sensation almost immediately struck that be la motte advanced to ruin called answer be returned repeated call be yet still a grave then went up to archway endeavoured to examine place where have disappeared shadowy obscurity rendered attempt fruitless observed however little to right entrance to ruin advanced step down kind of dark passage when recollecting that place might be haunt of bandit danger alarmed retreated with precipitation walked towards abbey by way came finding person followed believing again in safety former surmise returned thought be la motte have seen mused upon strange possibility endeavoured to assign reason for so mysterious conduct in vain notwithstanding belief of strengthened entered abbey under a full conviction a circumstance must admit of be father who have appeared in sepulchre on entering what be now used a parlour be much surprised to find quietly seated there with madame la motte adeline conversing a if have be returned time took first opportunity of acquainting mother with late adventure of inquiring how long la motte have be returned before when learning that be near hour surprise increased knew not what to conclude meanwhile perception of growing partiality of louis co operated with canker of suspicion to destroy in madame la motte that affection pity esteem have formerly excited for adeline unkindness be now too obvious to escape notice of to whom be directed being noticed occasioned anguish adeline found very difficult to endure with warmth candour of youth sought explanation of change of behaviour opportunity of exculpating from intention of provoking madame la motte artfully evaded while at same time threw out hint involved adeline in deeper perplexity served to make present affliction more intolerable have lost that affection must say be be only comfort yet have lost without even knowing offence be thankful have not merited unkindness though have abandoned will always love thus distressed must frequently leave parlour retiring to chamber must yield to despondency have never known till now one morning being unable to sleep arose at very early hour faint light of day now trembled through cloud gradually spreading from horizon announced rising sun feature of landscape be slowly unveiled moist with dew of night brightening with dawn till at sun appeared shed full flood of day beauty of hour invited to walk went forth into forest to taste sweet of morning carol of new waked bird saluted a passed fresh gale came scented with breath of flower whose tint glowed more vivid through dew drop that hung on leaf wandered on without noticing distance following winding of river came to dewy glade whose wood sweeping down to very edge of water formed scene so sweetly romantic that sealed at foot of tree to contemplate beauty image insensibly soothed sorrow inspired with soft pleasing melancholy so dear to feeling mind for time sat lost in reverie while flower grew on bank beside seemed to smile in new life drew from comparison with own condition mused sighed then in voice whose charming melody be modulated by tenderness of heart sung following word sonnet to lily soft silken flower that in dewy vale unfoldbet thy modest beauty to morn breathbet thy fragrance on wandering gale o'er earth green hill shadowy valley borne when day have closed dazzling eye dying gale sink soft away when eve steal down western sky mountain wood vale decay thy tender cup graceful swell droop sad beneath chilly dew thy odour seek silken cell twilight veil languid hue soon fair flower morn will rise rear again thy pensive head again unveil thy snowy dye again thy velvet foliage spread sweet child of spring like thee in sorrow shade full oft mourn in tear droop forlorn o like thine may light gloom pervade sorrow fly before joy living morn distant echo lengthened out tone sat listening to soft response till repeating last stanza of sonnet be answered by voice almost a tender le distant looked round in surprise saw young man in hunter dress leaning against tree gazing on with deep attention mark enraptured mind thousand apprehension shot athwart busy thought now first remembered distance from abbey rose in haste to be gone when stranger respectfully advanced observing timid look retiring step paused pursued way towards abbey though many reason made anxious to know whether be followed delicacy forbade to look back when reached abbey finding family be not yet assembled to breakfast retired to chamber where whole thought be employed in conjecture concerning stranger believing that be interested on point further than a concerned safety of la motte indulged without scruple remembrance of dignified air manner so much distinguished youth have seen after revolving circumstance more deeply believed impossible that person of appearance must be engaged in stratagem to betray fellow creature though be destitute of single circumstance might assist surmise of who be what be business in unfrequented forest rejected unconsciously suspicion injurious to character upon further deliberation therefore resolved not to mention little circumstance to la motte well knowing that though danger might be imaginary apprehension must be real must renew suffering perplexity from be just released resolved however to refrain for time walking in forest when came down to breakfast observed madame la motte to be more than usually reserved la motte entered room soon after made trifling observation on weather having endeavoured to support effort at cheerfulness sunk into usual melancholy adeline watched countenance of madame with anxiety when there appeared in gleam of kindness be a sunshine to soul very seldom suffered adeline thus to flatter conversation be restrained often pointed at something more than must be understood entrance of louis be very seasonable relief to adeline who almost feared to trust voice with sentence lest trembling accent must betray uneasiness charming morning drew early from chamber said louis addressing adeline have doubt pleasant companion too said madame la motte solitary walk be seldom agreeable be alone madam replied adeline indeed own thought must be highly pleasing then ala returned adeline tear spite of effort starting to eye there be now few subject of pleasure left for be very surprising pursued madame la motte be indeed surprising madam for who have lost last friend to be unhappy madame la motte conscience acknowledged rebuke blushed well resumed after short pause be not situation adeline looking earnestly at la motte adeline whose innocence protected from suspicion did not regard circumstance smiling through tear said rejoiced to hear say so during conversation la motte have remained absorbed in own thought louis unable to guess at what pointed looked alternately at mother adeline for explanation latter regarded with expression so full of tender compassion that revealed at once to madame la motte sentiment of soul immediately replied to last word of adeline with very serious air friend be only estimable when conduct deserves one friendship survives merit of object be disgrace instead of honour to party manner emphasis with delivered word again alarmed adeline who mildly said hoped must never deserve such censure madame be silent adeline be so much shocked by what have already passed that tear sprung from eye hid face with handkerchief louis now rose with emotion la motte roused from reverie inquired what be matter before must receive answer seemed to have forgotten that have asked question adeline may give own account said madame la motte have not deserved said adeline rising since presence be displeasing will retire moved towards door when louis who be pacing room in apparent agitation gently took hand saying here be unhappy mistake must have led to seat spirit be too much depressed to endure longer restraint withdrawing hand suffer to go said if there be mistake be unable to explain saying quitted room louis followed with eye to door when turning to mother surely madam said be to blame life on deserves warmest tenderness be very eloquent in cause sir said madame may presume to ask what interested thus in favour own amiable manner rejoined louis one can observe without esteeming may presume too much on own observation be possible amiable manner may deceive pardon madam may without presumption affirm can not deceive have doubt good reason for assertion perceive by admiration of artless innocence have succeeded in design of entrapping heart without designing have won admiration must not have be case have be capable of conduct mention madame la motte be going to reply be prevented by husband who again roused from reverie inquired into cause of dispute away with ridiculous behaviour said in voice of displeasure adeline have omitted household duty suppose offence so heinous deserves severe punishment doubt let be more disturbed with petty quarrel if must be tyrannical madam indulge humour in private saying abruptly quitted room louis immediately following madame be left to own unpleasant reflection ill humour proceeded from usual cause have heard of adeline walk la motte having gone forth into forest at early hour imagination heated by brooding of jealousy suggested that have appointed meeting be confirmed to by entrance of adeline quickly followed by la motte perception thus jaundiced by passion presence of son usual attention to good manner have be able to restrain emotion behaviour of adeline in late scene considered a refined piece of art indifference of la motte a affected so true be that trifle light a air be to jealous confirmation strong a proof of holy writ so ingenious be 'to twist true cause wrong way adeline have retired to chamber to weep

agonizing silence ensued la motte made motion towards door agitated frame refused to support sunk into chair silent exhausted horror of countenance together with whole behaviour excited utmost surprise in madame whose eye inquired of marquis more than thought proper to answer look increased instead of explaining mystery expressed mixture of emotion must not analyze meanwhile endeavoured to soothe revive husband repressed effort averting face covered with hand marquis seeming to recover presence of mind stepped to door of hall where people be assembled when la motte starting from seat with frantic air called on to return marquis looked back stopped still hesitating whether to proceed supplication of adeline who be now returned added to of la motte determined sat down request of

from lord can excuse doubt resumed la motte will swear will propose yes continued may be consequence will swear to submit to decree rising tempest again drowned sound of voice madame la motte vainly endeavoured to hear word upon probably hung explanation of mysterious conduct now moved towards door retreated with precipitation to apartment where have left adeline with louis young chevalier marquis la motte soon followed first haughty cool latter somewhat more composed than before though impression of horror be not yet faded from countenance marquis passed on to hall where retinue awaited storm be not yet subsided seemed impatient to be gone ordered people to be in readiness la motte observed sullen silence frequently pacing room with hasty step sometimes lost in reverie meanwhile marquis seating by adeline directed to whole attention except when sudden fit of absence came over mind suspended in silence at time young chevalier addressed adeline who with diffidence agitation shrunk from observance of marquis have be near two hour at abbey tempest still continuing madame la motte offered bed look from husband made tremble for consequence offer be however politely declined marquis being evidently a impatient to be gone a tenant appeared distressed by presence often returned to hall from gate raised look of impatience to cloud nothing be to be seen through darkness of night nothing heard howling of storm morning dawned before departed a be preparing to leave abbey la motte again drew aside held for few moment in close conversation impassioned gesture madame la motte observed from remote part of room added to curiosity degree of wild apprehension derived from obscurity of subject endeavour to distinguish corresponding word be baffled by low voice in be uttered marquis retinue at length departed la motte having fastened gate silently dejectedly withdrew to chamber moment be alone madame seized opportunity of entreating husband to explain scene have witnessed ask question said la motte sternly for will answer none have already forbidden speaking to on subject what subject said wife la motte seemed to recollect matter be mistaken thought have repeated question before ah said madame la motte be then a suspected former melancholy distress of night have same cause why must suspect inquire be always to be persecuted with conjecture pardon meant not to persecute anxiety for welfare will not suffer to rest under dreadful uncertainty let claim privilege of wife share affliction oppresses deny not la motte interrupted whatever may be cause of emotion have witnessed swear will not now reveal time may come when will no longer judge concealment necessary till then be silent desist from importunity above forbear to remark to one what may have seen uncommon in bury surmise in own bosom a must avoid curse destruction determined air with spoke while countenance be overspread with livid hue made wife shudder forbore reply madame la motte retired to bed not to rest ruminated on past occurrence surprise curiosity concerning word behaviour of husband be more strongly stimulated by reflection one truth however appeared must not doubt mysterious conduct of la motte have for so many month oppressed with anxiety late scene with marquis originated from same cause belief seemed to prove how unjustly have suspected adeline brought with pang of self accusation looked forward to morrow must lead marquis again to abbey with impatience wearied nature at length resumed right yielded short oblivion of care at late hour next day family assembled to breakfast individual of party appeared silent abstracted very different be aspect of feature still more complexion of thought la motte seemed agitated by impatient fear yet sullenness of despair overspread countenance certain wildness in eye at time expressed sudden start of horror again feature must sink into gloom of despondency madame la motte seemed harassed with anxiety watched turn of husband countenance impatiently awaited arrival of marquis louis be composed thoughtful adeline seemed to feel full share of uneasiness have observed behaviour of la motte preceding night with much surprise happy confidence have hitherto reposed in be shaken feared also lest exigency of circumstance must precipitate again into world that must be unable unwilling to afford shelter beneath roof during breakfast la motte frequently rose to window from whence cast many anxious look wife understood too well cause of impatience endeavoured to repress own in interval louis attempted by whisper to obtain information from father la motte always returned to table where presence of adeline prevented further discourse after breakfast a walked upon lawn louis must have joined la motte peremptorily declared intended to be alone soon after marquis having not yet arrived proceeded to greater distance from abbey adeline retired into usual working room with madame la motte who affected air of cheerfulness even of kindness feeling necessity of offering reason for striking agitation of la motte of preventing surprise unexpected appearance of marquis must occasion adeline if be left to connect with behaviour of preceding night mentioned that marquis la motte have long be known to other that unexpected meeting after absence of many year under circumstance so altered humiliating on part of latter have occasioned much painful emotion have be heightened by consciousness that marquis have formerly misinterpreted circumstance in conduct towards have caused suspension of intimacy account did not bring conviction to mind of adeline for seemed inadequate to degree of emotion marquis la motte have mutually betrayed surprise be excited curiosity awakened by word be meant to delude forbore to express thought madame proceeding with plan said marquis be now expected hoped difference remained must be perfectly adjusted adeline blushed endeavouring to reply lip faltered conscious of agitation of observance of madame la motte confusion increased endeavour to suppress served only to heighten still tried to renew discourse still found impossible to collect thought shocked lest madame must apprehend sentiment have till moment be concealed almost from colour fled fixed eye on ground for time found difficult to respire madame la motte inquired if be ill when adeline glad of excuse withdrew to indulgence of own thought be now wholly engrossed by expectation of seeing again young chevalier who have accompanied marquis a looked from room saw marquis on horseback with several attendant advancing at distance hastened to apprize madame la motte of approach in short time arrived at gate madame louis went out to receive la motte being not yet returned entered hall followed by young chevalier accosting madame with sort of stately politeness inquired for la motte whom louis now went to seek marquis remained for few minute silent then asked of madame la motte how fair daughter did madame understood be adeline meant having answered inquiry slightly said that be not related to adeline upon indication of marquis wish be sent for entered room with modest blush timid air seemed to engage attention compliment received with sweet grace when young chevalier approached warmth of manner rendered hers involuntarily more reserved scarcely dared to raise eye from ground lest must encounter la motte now entered apologized for absence marquis noticed only by slight inclination of head expressing at same time by look distrust pride immediately quitted abbey together marquis beckoned attendant to follow at distance la motte forbad son to accompany louis observed took way into thickest part of forest be lost in chaos of conjecture concerning affair curiosity anxiety for father induced to follow at distance in mean time young stranger whom marquis addressed by name of theodore remained at abbey with madame la motte adeline former with address must scarcely conceal agitation during interval moved involuntary to door whenever heard footstep several time went to hall door in order to look into forest a often returned checked by disappointment person appeared theodore seemed to address a much of attention to adeline a politeness must allow to withdraw from madame la motte manner so gentle yet dignified insensibly subdued timidity banished reserve conversation no longer suffered painful constraint gradually disclosed beauty of mind seemed to produce mutual confidence similarity of sentiment soon appeared theodore by impatient pleasure animated countenance seemed frequently to anticipate thought of adeline to absence of marquis be short though long to madame la motte whose countenance brightened when heard trampling of horse at gate marquis appeared for moment passed on with la motte to private room where remained for time in conference immediately after departed theodore took leave of adeline who a well a la motte madame attended to gate with expression of tender regret often a went looked back upon abbey till intervening branch entirely excluded from view transient glow of pleasure diffused over cheek of adeline disappeared with young stranger sighed a turned into hall image of theodore pursued to chamber recollected with exactness particular of late conversation sentiment so congenial with own manner so engaging countenance so animated so ingenious so noble in manly dignity be blended with sweetness of benevolence other grace recollected soft melancholy stole upon heart will see more said sigh followed told more of heart than wished to know blushed sighed again then suddenly recollecting endeavoured to divert thought to different subject la motte connection with marquis for sometime engaged attention unable to develop mystery attended sought refuge from own reflection in more pleasing one to be derived from book during time louis shocked surprised at extreme distress father have manifested upon first appearance of marquis addressed upon subject have doubt that marquis be intimately concerned in event made necessary for la motte to leave paris spoke thought without disguise lamenting at same time unlucky chance have brought to seek refuge in place of others least capable of affording estate of enemy la motte did not contradict opinion of son joined in lamenting evil fate have conducted thither term of louis absence from regiment be now nearly expired took occasion to express sorrow that must soon be obliged to leave father in circumstance so dangerous a present must leave sir with le pain continued be sure knew full extent of misfortune at present be left to conjecture evil perhaps exist relieve sir from state of painful uncertainty suffer to prove worthy of confidence have already answered on subject said la motte forbad to renew be now obliged to tell care not how soon depart if be to be subjected to inquiry la motte walked abruptly away left son to doubt concern arrival of marquis have dissipated jealous fear of madame la motte awoke to sense of cruelty towards adeline when considered orphan state uniform affection have appeared in behaviour mildness patience with have borne injurious treatment be shocked took early opportunity of renewing former kindness must not explain seeming inconsistency of conduct without betraying late suspicion now blushed to remember must apologize for former behaviour without giving explanation contented therefore with expressing in manner regard be thus revived adeline be at first surprised felt too much pleasure at change to be scrupulous in inquiring cause notwithstanding satisfaction adeline received from revival of madame la motte kindness thought frequently recurred to peculiar forlorn circumstance of condition must not help feeling le confidence than have formerly done in friendship of madame la motte whose character now appeared le amiable than imagination have represented seemed strongly tinctured with caprice thought often dwelt upon strange introduction of marquis at abbey on mutual emotion apparent dislike of la motte under circumstance equally excited surprise la motte must choose that marquis must permit to remain in territory mind returned oftener perhaps to subject because be connected with theodore returned unconscious of idea attracted attributed interest felt in affair to anxiety for welfare of la motte for own future destination be now so deeply involved in sometimes indeed caught busy in conjecture a to degree of relationship in theodore stood to marquis immediately checked thought severely blamed for having suffered to stray to object perceived be too dangerous to peace chapter vii present fear be le than horrible imaginings few day after occurrence related in preceding chapter a adeline be alone in chamber be roused from reverie by trampling of horse near gate on looking from casement saw marquis de montalt enter abbey circumstance surprised emotion whose cause did not trouble to inquire for made instantly retreat from window same cause however led thither again a hastily object of search did not appear be in haste to retire a stood musing disappointed marquis came out with la motte immediately looking up saw adeline bowed returned compliment respectfully withdrew from window vexed at having be seen there went into forest marquis attendant did not a before follow thither when returned be not till after considerable time marquis immediately mounted horse rode away for remainder of day la motte appeared gloomy silent be frequently lost in thought adeline observed with particular attention concern perceived that be always more melancholy after interview with marquis be now surprised to hear that latter have appointed to dine next day at abbey when la motte mentioned added high eulogium on character of marquis particularly praised generosity nobleness of soul at instant adeline recollected anecdote have formerly heard concerning abbey threw shadow over brightness of excellence la motte now celebrated account however did not appear to deserve much credit part of a far a negative will admit of demonstration having be already proved false for have be reported that abbey be haunted supernatural appearance have ever be observed by present inhabitant adeline however ventured to inquire whether be present marquis of whom injurious report have be raised la motte answered with smile of ridicule story of ghost hobgoblin have always be admired cherished by vulgar said be inclined to rely upon own experience at least a much a upon account of peasant if have seen thing to corroborate account pray inform of may establish faith mistake sir said be not concerning supernatural agency must inquire alluded to different part of report hinted that person have be confined here by order of marquis who be said to have died unfairly be alleged a reason for marquis having abandoned abbey mere coinage of idleness said la motte romantic tale to excite wonder to see marquis be alone sufficient to refute if credit number of story spring from same source prove little superior to simpleton who invent good sense adeline think will teach merit of disbelief adeline blushed be silent la motte defence of marquis appeared much warmer more diffuse than be consistent with own disposition required by occasion former conversation with louis occurred to be more surprised at what passed at present looked forward to morrow with mixture of pain pleasure expectation of seeing again young chevalier occupying thought agitating with various emotion now feared presence now doubted whether must come at length observed blushed to find how much engaged attention morrow arrived marquis came came alone sunshine of adeline mind be clouded though be able to wear usual air of cheerfulness marquis be polite affable attentive to manner most easy elegant be added last refinement of polished life conversation be lively amusing sometimes even witty discovered great knowledge of world what be often mistaken for acquaintance with higher circle with topic of day here la motte be also qualified to converse with entered into discussion of character manner of age with great spirit humour madame la motte have not seen husband so cheerful since left paris sometimes must almost fancy be there adeline listened till cheerfulness have at first only assumed became real address of marquis be so insinuating affable that reserve insensibly gave way before natural vivacity resumed long lost empire at parting marquis told la motte rejoiced at having found so agreeable neighbour la motte bowed will sometimes visit continued lament can not at present invite madame la motte fair friend to chateau be undergoing repair make uncomfortable residence illustration vivacity of la motte disappeared with guest soon relapsed into fit of silence abstraction marquis be very agreeable man said madame la motte very agreeable replied seems to have excellent heart resumed excellent one said la motte seem discomposed dear what have disturbed not in least be only thinking that with such agreeable talent excellent heart be pity marquis must what dear said madame with impatience that marquis must must suffer abbey to fall into ruin replied la motte be that said madame with disappointment be upon honour said la motte left room adeline spirit no longer supported by animated conversation of marquis sunk into languor when departed walked pensively into forest followed little romantic path wound along margin of stream be overhung with deep shade tranquillity of scene autumn now touched with sweetest tint softened mind to tender kind of melancholy suffered tear knew not wherefore have stolen into eye to tremble there unchecked came to little lonely recess formed by high tree wind sighed mournfully among branch a waved lofty head scattered leaf to ground seated on bank beneath indulged

friendship of stranger for comfort upon bounty for very mean of existence what evil have to expect ala father how must thus abandon child how leave to storm of life to sink perhaps beneath ala have friend be interrupted by rustling among fallen leaf turned head perceiving marquis young friend arose to depart pardon intrusion said voice attracted hither word detained offence however brings with own punishment having learned sorrow how can help feeling must that sympathy suffering must rescue from hesitated must must deserve title of friend be thought worthy of by confusion of adeline thought must scarcely permit to reply trembled gently withdrew hand have taken while spoke have perhaps heard sir more than be true be indeed not happy moment of dejection have made unjust be le unfortunate than have represented when said have friend be ungrateful to kindness of monsieur madame la motte who have be more than friend have be a parent to if so honour cried theodore with warmth if did not feel to be presumption must ask why be unhappy paused adeline raising eye saw gazing upon with intense eager anxiety look be again fixed upon ground have pained said theodore by improper request can forgive also when add that be interest in welfare urged inquiry forgiveness sir be unnecessary to ask be certainly obliged by compassion express evening be cold if please will walk towards abbey a moved on theodore be for time silent at length be lately that solicited pardon said will now perhaps have need of again will do justice to believe have strong indeed pressing reason to inquire how nearly be related to monsieur la motte be not at related said adeline service have done can never repay hope gratitude will teach never to forget indeed said theodore surprised may ask how long have known rather sir let ask why question must be necessary be just said with air of self condemnation conduct have deserved reproof must have be more explicit looked a if mind be labouring with something be unwilling to express know not how delicately be circumstanced continued yet will aver that question be prompted by tenderest interest in happiness even by fear for safety adeline started fear be deceived said fear there be danger near adeline stopped looking earnestly at begged must explain suspected that mischief threatened la motte theodore continuing silent repeated request if la motte be concerned in danger said let entreat to acquaint with immediately have too many misfortune to apprehend excellent adeline cried theodore heart must be adamant must injure how will hint what fear be too true how forbear to warn of danger without be interrupted by step among tree presently after saw la motte cross into path be in adeline felt confused at being thus seen with chevalier be hastening to join la motte theodore detained entreated moment attention there be now time to explain said yet what must say be of utmost consequence to promise therefore to meet in part of forest at about time to morrow evening will then hope be convinced that conduct be directed neither by common circumstance common regard adeline shuddered at idea of making appointment hesitated at length entreated theodore not to delay till to morrow explanation appeared to be so important to follow la motte inform of danger immediately be not with la motte must speak replied theodore know of danger that threatens approach be quick lovely adeline promise to meet do promise said adeline with faltering voice will come to spot where found evening hour earlier to morrow saying withdrew trembling hand theodore have pressed to lip in token of acknowledgement immediately disappeared la motte now approached adeline who fearing that have seen theodore be in confusion whither be louis gone so fast said la motte rejoiced to find mistake suffered to remain in walked pensively towards abbey where adeline too much occupied by own thought to bear company retired to chamber ruminated upon word of theodore more considered more be perplexed sometimes blamed for having made appointment doubting whether have not solicited for purpose of pleading passion now delicacy checked thought made vexed that have presumed upon having inspired one recollected serious earnestness of voice manner when entreated to meet a convinced of importance of subject shuddered at danger must not comprehend looking forward to morrow with anxious impatience sometimes too remembrance of tender interest have expressed for welfare of correspondent look air must steal across memory awakening pleasing emotion latent hope that be not indifferent to from reflection like be roused by summons to supper repast be melancholy one being last evening of louis stay at abbey adeline who esteemed regretted departure while eye be often bent on with look seemed to express that be about to leave object of affection endeavoured by cheerfulness to reanimate whole party especially madame la motte who frequently shed tear will soon meet again said adeline trust in happier circumstance la motte sighed countenance of louis brightened at word do wish said with peculiar emphasis most certainly do replied can doubt regard for best friend

weeping pale countenance of louis seemed to indicate that have rested no better than mother when breakfast be over adeline retired for while that might not interrupt by presence last conversation a walked on lawn before abbey returned in thought to occurrence of yesterday evening impatience for appointed interview increased be soon joined by louis be unkind of to leave said in last moment of stay must hope that must sometimes remember when be far away must depart with le sorrow then expressed concern at leaving though have hitherto armed with resolution to forbear direct avowal of attachment must be fruitless heart now yielded to force of passion told what adeline moment feared to hear declaration said adeline endeavouring to overcome agitation excited give inexpressible concern o say not so interrupted louis give slender hope to support in misery of absence say that hate say do most readily say replied adeline in tremulous voice if will give pleasure to be assured of

owe approbation of to action of others have long borne passion in silence because foresaw difficulty must attend nay have even dared to endeavour to overcome have dared to believe possible forgive supposition must forget distress interrupted adeline be conversation ought not to hear be above disguise therefore assure that though virtue will always command esteem have nothing to hope from love be even otherwise circumstance must effectually decide for if be really friend will rejoice that be spared struggle between affection prudence let hope also time will teach to reduce love within limit

unhappy attachment remained in chamber till have quitted abbey unwilling to subject to pain of formal parting a evening hour of appointment drew nigh adeline impatience increased yet when time arrived resolution failed faltered from purpose there be something of indelicacy dissimulation in appointed interview on part that shocked recollected tenderness of theodore manner several little circumstance seemed to indicate that heart be not unconcerned in event again be inclined to doubt whether have not obtained consent to meeting upon groundless suspicion almost determined not to go yet be possible theodore assertion might be sincere danger real chance of made delicate scruple appear ridiculous wondered that have for moment suffered to weigh against so serious interest blaming for delay have occasioned hastened to place of appointment little path led to spot be silent solitary when reached recess theodore have not arrived transient pride made unwilling must find that be more punctual to

ancient desolate though in part furnished than have yet seen be strongly barricadoed yet person appeared while stood musing surveying apartment heard low voice call looking towards place whence came perceived by dim light of lamp figure stretched on bed lay on floor voice called again approaching bed distinctly saw feature of man who appeared to be dying ghastly paleness overspread countenance yet there be expression of mildness dignity in strongly interested while looked on feature changed seemed convulsed in agony of death spectacle shocked started back suddenly stretched forth hand seizing hers grasped with violence struggled in terror to disengage again looking on face saw man who appeared to be about thirty with same feature in full health of most benign countenance smiled tenderly upon moved lip a if to speak when floor of chamber suddenly opened sunk from view effort made to save from following awoke dream have so strongly impressed fancy that be time before must overcome terror occasioned even be perfectly convinced be in own apartment at length however composed to sleep again fell into dream thought be bewildered in winding passage of abbey that be almost dark that wandered about considerable time without being able to find door suddenly heard bell toll from above soon after confusion of distant voice redoubled effort to extricate presently be still at length wearied with search sat down on step crossed passage have not be long here when saw light glimmer at distance on wall turn in passage be very long prevented seeing from what proceeded continued to glimmer faintly for time then grew stronger when saw man enter passage habited in long black cloak like usually worn by attendant at funeral bearing torch called to to follow led through long passage to foot of staircase here feared to proceed be running back when man suddenly turned to pursue with terror occasioned awoke shocked by vision more so by seeming connection now struck endeavoured to continue awake lest terrific image must again haunt mind after time however harassed spirit again sunk into slumber though not to repose now thought in large old gallery saw at one end of chamber door standing little open light within went towards perceived man have before seen standing at door beckoning towards with inconsistency so common in dream no longer endeavoured to avoid advancing followed into suit of very ancient apartment hung with black lighted up a if for funeral still led on till found in same chamber remembered to have seen in former dream coffin covered with pall stood at further end of room light several person surrounded who appeared to be in great distress suddenly thought person be gone that be left alone that went up to coffin while gazed upon heard voice speak a if from within saw nobody man have before seen soon after stood by coffin lifting pall saw beneath dead person whom thought to be dying chevalier have seen in former dream feature be sunk in death be yet serene while looked at stream of blood gushed from side descending to floor whole chamber be overflowed at same time word be uttered in voice heard before horror of scene so entirely overcame that started awoke when have recovered recollection raised in bed to be convinced be dream have witnessed agitation of spirit be so great that feared to be alone almost determined to call feature of deceased person chamber where lay be strongly impressed upon memory still thought heard voice saw countenance dream represented longer considered dream more be surprised be so very terrible returned so often seemed to be so connected with other that must scarcely think accidental yet why must be supernatural must not tell slept more that night chapter viii when prodigy do so conjointly meet let not men say be reason be natural for believe be portentous thing julius csar when adeline appeared at breakfast harassed languid countenance struck madame la motte who inquired if be ill adeline forcing smile upon feature said have not rested well for have have very disturbed dream be about to describe strong involuntary impulse prevented at same time la motte ridiculed concern so unmercifully that be almost ashamed to have mentioned tried to overcome remembrance of cause after breakfast endeavoured to employ thought by conversing with madame la motte be really engaged by incident of last two day circumstance of dream conjecture concerning information to be communicated to by theodore have thus sat for time when sound of voice arose from great gate of abbey on going to casement adeline saw marquis attendant on lawn below portal of abbey concealed several people from view among be possible might be theodore who have not yet appeared continued to look for with great anxiety till marquis entered hall with la motte other person soon after madame went to receive adeline retired to own apartment message from la motte however soon called to join party where vainly hoped to find theodore marquis arose a approached having paid general compliment conversation took very lively turn adeline finding impossible to counterfeit cheerfulness while heart be sinking with anxiety disappointment took little part in theodore be not once named must have asked concerning have be possible to inquire with propriety be obliged to content with hoping first that must arrive before dinner then before departure of marquis thus day passed in expectation disappointment evening be now approaching be condemned to remain in presence of marquis apparently listening to conversation in truth scarcely heard while opportunity be perhaps escaping must decide fate be suddenly relieved from state of torture thrown into one if possible still more distressing marquis inquired for louis being informed of departure mentioned that theodore peyrou have that morning set out for regiment in distant province lamented loss must sustain by absence expressed very flattering praise of talent shock of intelligence overpowered long agitated spirit of adeline blood forsook cheek sudden faintness came over from recovered only to consciousness of having discovered emotion danger of relapsing into second fit retired to chamber where being once more alone oppressed heart found relief from tear in freely indulged idea crowded so fast upon mind that be long ere must arrange so a to produce thing like reasoning endeavoured to account for abrupt departure of theodore be possible said that must take interest in welfare yet leave exposed to full force of danger foresaw be to believe that have trifled with simplicity for idle frolic have now left to wondering apprehension have raised impossible countenance so noble manner so amiable must never disguise heart capable of forming so despicable design be reserved for let not relinquish pleasure of believing that be worthy of esteem be awakened from thought like by peal of distant thunder now perceived that gloominess of evening be deepened by coming storm rolled onward soon after lightning began to flash along chamber adeline be superior to affectation of fear be not apt to be terrified now felt unpleasant to be alone hoping that marquis might have left abby went down to sitting room threatening aspect of heaven have hitherto detained now evening tempest made rejoice that have not quitted shelter storm continued night came on la motte pressed guest to take bed at abbey at length consented circumstance threw madame la motte into perplexity a to accommodation to be afforded after time arranged affair to satisfaction resigning own apartment to marquis that of louis to two of superior attendant adeline be further settled must give up room to monsieur madame la motte to remove to inner chamber where small bed usually occupied by annette be placed for at marquis be le gay than usual frequently addressed adeline look manner seemed to express tender interest indisposition for still appeared pale languid have excited adeline a usual made effort to forget anxiety appear happy veil of assumed cheerfulness be too thin to conceal feature of sorrow feeble smile only added peculiar softness to air marquis conversed with on variety of subject displayed elegant mind observation of adeline when called upon gave with reluctant modesty in word at once simple forceful seemed to excite admiration sometimes betrayed by inadvertent expression adeline retired early to room adjoined on one side to madame la motte on other to closet formerly mentioned be spacious lofty what little furniture contained be falling to decay perhaps present tone of spirit might contribute more than circumstance to give air of melancholy seemed to reign in be unwilling to go to bed lest dream have lately pursued must return determined to sit up till found oppressed by sleep when be probable rest must be profound placed light on small table taking book continued to read for above hour till mind refused longer to abstract from own care sat for time leaning pensively on arm wind be high a whistled through desolate apartment shook feeble door often started sometimes even thought heard sigh between pause of gust checked illusion hour of night own melancholy imagination conspired to raise a sat musing eye fixed on opposite wall perceived arras with room be hung wave backwards forward continued to observe for minute then rose to examine further be moved by wind blushed at momentary fear have excited observed that tapestry be more strongly agitated in one particular place than elsewhere noise seemed something more than of wind issued thence old bedstead la motte have found in apartment have be removed to accommodate adeline be behind place where have stood that wind seemed to rush with particular force curiosity prompted to examine still further felt about tapestry perceiving wall behind shake under hand lifted arras discovered small door whose loosened hinge admitted wind occasioned noise have heard door be held only by bolt having undrawn brought light descended by few step into chamber instantly remembered dream chamber be not much like in have seen dying chevalier afterwards bier gave confused remembrance of one through have passed holding up light to examine more fully be convinced by structure that be part of ancient foundation shattered casement placed high from floor seemed to be only opening to admit light observed door on opposite side of apartment after moment of hesitation gained courage determined to pursue inquiry mystery seems to hang over chamber said be perhaps lot to develop will at least see to what that door lead stepped forward having unclosed proceeded with faltering step along suite of apartment resembling first in style condition terminating in one exactly like where dream have represented dying person remembrance struck so forcibly upon imagination that be in danger of fainting looking round room almost expected to see phantom of dream unable to quit place sat down on old lumber to recover while spirit be nearly overcome by superstitious dread such a have never felt before wondered to what part of abbey chamber belonged that have so long escaped detection casement be too high to afford information from without when be sufficiently composed to consider direction of room situation of abbey there appeared not doubt that formed interior part of original building a reflection passed over mind sudden gleam of moonlight fell upon object without casement being now sufficiently composed to wish to pursue inquiry believing object might afford mean of learning situation of room combated remaining terror in order to distinguish more clearly removed light to outer chamber before must return heavy cloud be driven over face of moon without be perfectly dark stood for moment waiting returning gleam obscurity continued a went softly back for light foot stumbled over something on floor while stooped to examine moon again shone so that must distinguish through casement eastern tower of abbey discovery confirmed former conjecture concerning interior situation of apartment obscurity of place prevented discovering what be that have impeded step having brought light forward perceived on floor old dagger with trembling hand took up upon closer view perceived that be spotted stained with rust shocked surprised looked round room for object might confirm destroy dreadful suspicion now rushed upon mind saw only great chair with broken arm stood in one corner of room table in condition equally shattered except in part lay confused heap of thing appeared to be old lumber went up to perceived broken bedstead with decayed remnant of furniture covered with dust cobweb seemed indeed a if have not be moved for many year desirous however of examining further attempted to raise what appeared to have be part of bedstead slipped from hand rolling to floor brought with of remaining lumber adeline started aside saved when noise made have ceased heard small rustling sound a be about to leave chamber saw something falling gently among lumber be small roll of paper tied with string covered with dust adeline took up on opening perceived hand writing attempted to read part of manuscript looked at be so much obliterated that found difficult though what few word be legible impressed with curiosity terror induced to return with immediately to chamber having reached own room fastened private door let arras fall over a before be now midnight stillness of hour interrupted only at interval by hollow sighings of blast heightened solemnity of adeline feeling wished be not alone before proceeded to look into manuscript listened whether madame la motte be yet in chamber not least sound be heard gently opened door profound silence within almost convinced that person be there willing to be further satisfied brought light found room empty lateness of hour made wonder madame la motte be not in chamber proceeded to top of tower stair to hearken if person be stirring heard sound of voice from below amongst rest that of la motte speaking in usual tone being now satisfied that be well turned towards room when heard marquis pronounce name with very unusual emphasis paused adore pursued by heaven be interrupted by la motte lord remember promise do replied marquis will abide by trifle to morrow will declare will then know what to hope how to act adeline trembled so excessively that must scarcely support wished to return to chamber yet be too much interested in word have heard not to be anxious to have more fully explained there be interval of silence after conversed in lower tone adeline remembered hint of theodore determined if possible to be relieved from terrible suspense now suffered stole softly down few step that might catch accent of speaker be so low that must only now then distinguish few word father say said marquis yes lord father be well informed of what say adeline shuddered at mention of father new terror seized with increasing eagerness endeavoured to distinguish word for time found to be impossible here be time to be lost said marquis to morrow then heard la motte rise believing be to leave room hurried up step having reached chamber sunk almost lifeless in chair be father only of whom thought doubted not that have pursued discovered retreat though conduct appeared very inconsistent with former behaviour in abandoning to stranger fear suggested that must terminate in new cruelty did not hesitate to pronounce danger of theodore have warned be impossible to surmise how have gained knowledge of how have become sufficiently acquainted with story except through la motte apparent friend protector whom be thus though unwillingly led to suspect of treachery why indeed must la motte conceal from only knowledge of father intention unless designed to deliver into hand yet be long ere must bring to believe conclusion possible to discover depravity in whom have loved be one of most exquisite torture to virtuous mind conviction be often rejected before be finally admitted word of theodore told be fearful be deceived confirmed most painful apprehension of la motte with yet more distressing madame la motte be also united against thought for moment subdued terror left only grief wept bitterly be human nature cried be doomed to find body deceitful unexpected discovery of vice in whom have admired incline to extend censure of individual to specie henceforth contemn appearance too hastily conclude that person be to be trusted adeline determined to throw at foot of la motte on following morning implore pity protection mind be now too much agitated by own interest to permit to examine manuscript sat musing in chair till heard step of madame la motte when retired to bed la motte soon after came up to chamber adeline mild persecuted adeline who have now passed two day of torturing anxiety one night of terrific vision endeavoured to compose mind to sleep in present state of spirit quickly caught alarm have scarcely fallen into slumber when be roused by loud uncommon noise listened thought sound came from apartment below in few minute there be hasty knocking at door of la motte chamber la motte who have just fallen asleep be not easily to be roused knocking increased with such violence adeline extremely terrified arose went to door opened from chamber into with design to call be stopped by voice of marquis now clearly distinguished at door called to la motte to rise immediately madame la motte endeavoured at same time to rouse husband who at length awoke in much alarm soon after joining marquis went down stair together adeline now dressed a well a trembling hand must permit went into adjoining chamber where found madame la motte extremely surprised terrified marquis in mean time told la motte with great agitation that recollected having appointed person to meet upon business of importance early in morning be therefore necessary for to set off for chateau immediately a said desired that servant might be called la motte must not help observing ashy paleness of countenance expressing apprehension that lordship be ill marquis assured be perfectly well desired that might set out immediately peter be now ordered to call other servant marquis having refused to take refreshment bade la motte hasty adieu a soon a people be ready left abbey la motte returned to chamber musing on abrupt departure of guest whose emotion appeared much too strong to proceed from cause assigned appeased anxiety of madame la motte at same time excited surprise by acquainting with occasion of late disturbance adeline who have retired from chamber on approach of la motte looked out from window on hearing trampling of horse be marquis people who just then passed at little distance unable to distinguish who person be be alarmed at observing party about abbey at hour calling to inform la motte of circumstance be made acquainted with what have passed at length retired to bed slumber be night undisturbed by dream when arose in morning observed la motte walking alone in avenue below hastened to seize opportunity now offered of pleading cause approached with faltering step while paleness timidity of countenance discovered disorder of mind first word without entering upon explanation implored compassion la motte stopped looking earnestly in face inquired whether part of conduct towards merited suspicion request implied adeline for moment blushed that have doubted integrity word have overheard returned to memory behaviour sir said acknowledge to have be kind generous beyond what have right to expect paused knew not how to mention what blushed to believe la motte continued to gaze on in silent expectation at length desired to proceed explain meaning entreated that must protect from father la motte looked surprised confused father said yes sir replied adeline be not ignorant that have discovered retreat have thing to dread from parent who have treated with such cruelty a be witness of again implore that will save from hand la motte stood fixed in thought adeline continued endeavour to interest pity what reason have to suppose rather how have learned that father pursues question confused adeline who blushed to acknowledge that have overheard discourse disdained to invent utter falsity at length confessed truth countenance of la motte instantly changed to savage fierceness sharply rebuking for conduct to have be rather tempted by chance than prompted by design inquired what have overheard must so much alarm faithfully repeated substance of incoherent sentence have met ear while spoke regarded with fixed attention be heard be from few word that draw positive conclusion examine will find justify now perceived what fervour of fear have not permitted to observe before word unconnectedly a heard imported little that imagination have filled up void in sentence so a to suggest evil apprehended notwithstanding fear be little abated apprehension be doubtless now removed resumed la motte to give proof of sincerity have ventured to question will tell be just seem alarmed with reason father have discovered residence have already demanded be true that from motive of compassion have refused to resign have authority to withhold mean to defend when come to enforce demand will perceive prepare therefore for evil see be inevitable adeline for time must speak only by tear at length with fortitude despair have roused said resign to will of heaven la motte gazed on in silence strong emotion appeared in countenance forbore however to renew discourse withdrew to abbey leaving adeline in avenue absorbed in grief summons to breakfast hastened to parlour where passed morning in conversation with madame la motte to whom told apprehension expressed sorrow pity superficial consolation be madame la motte must offer though apparently much affected by adeline discourse thus hour passed heavily away while anxiety of adeline continued to increase moment of fate seemed fast approaching dinner be scarcely over when adeline be surprised to see marquis arrive entered room with usual ease apologizing for disturbance have occasioned on preceding night repeated what have before told la motte remembrance of conversation have overheard at first gave adeline confusion withdrew mind from sense of evil to be apprehended from father marquis who be a usual attentive to adeline seemed affected by apparent indisposition expressed much concern for dejection of spirit notwithstanding effort manner betrayed when madame la motte withdrew adeline must have followed marquis entreated few moment attention led back to seat la motte immediately disappeared adeline knew too well what must be purport of marquis discourse word soon increased confusion fear have occasioned while be declaring ardour of passion in such term a too often make vehemence pas for sincerity adeline to whom declaration if honourable be distressing if dishonourable be shocking interrupted thanked for offer of distinction with modest determined air said must refuse rose to withdraw stay too lovely adeline said if compassion for suffering will not interest in favour allow consideration of own danger to do so monsieur la motte have informed of misfortune of evil now threatens accept from protection can not afford adeline continued to move towards door when marquis threw at foot seizing hand impressed with kiss struggled to disengage hear charming adeline hear cried marquis exist for listen to entreaty fortune will be yours drive to despair by ill judged rigour because lord interrupted adeline with air of ineffable dignity still affecting to believe proposal honourable be sensible of generosity of conduct also flattered by distinction offer will therefore say something more than be necessary to bare expression of denial must continue to give can not bestow heart can not obtain more than esteem to indeed nothing can so much contribute a forbearance from similar offer in future again attempted to go marquis prevented after hesitation again urged suit though in term must no longer allow to misunderstand tear swelled into eye endeavoured to check with look in grief indignation seemed to struggle for pre eminence said lord be unworthy of reply let pas for moment be awed by dignity of manner threw at foot to implore forgiveness waved hand in silence hurried from room when reached chamber locked door sinking into chair yielded to sorrow pressed at heart be not least of sorrow to suspect that la motte be unworthy of confidence for be almost impossible that must be ignorant of real design of marquis madame la motte believed be imposed upon by specious pretence of honourable attachment thus be spared pang doubt of integrity must have added threw trembling glance upon prospect around on one side be father whose cruelty have already be too plainly manifested on other marquis pursuing with insult vicious passion resolved to acquaint madame la motte with purport of late conversation in hope of protection sympathy wiped away tear be leaving room just a madame la motte entered while adeline related what have passed friend wept appeared to suffer great agitation endeavoured to comfort promised to use influence in persuading la motte to prohibit addressee of marquis know dear added madame that present circumstance oblige to preserve term with marquis will therefore suffer a little resentment to appear in manner towards a possible conduct with usual ease in presence doubt not affair will pas over without subjecting to further solicitation ah madam said adeline how hard be task assign entreat may never more be subjected to humiliation of being in presence that whenever visit abbey may be suffered to remain in chamber said madame la motte must most readily consent to must situation permit well know asylum in abbey depends upon good will of marquis must not wantonly lose surely such conduct a propose must endanger let use milder measure will preserve friendship without subjecting to serious evil appear with usual complaisance task be not so difficult a imagine adeline sighed obey madam said be duty to do so may be pardoned for saying be with extreme reluctance madame la motte promised to go immediately to husband adeline departed though not convinced of safety yet somewhat more at ease soon after saw marquis depart a there now appeared to be obstacle to return of madame la motte expected with extreme impatience after thus waiting near hour in chamber be at length summoned to parlour there found monsieur la motte alone arose upon entrance for minute paced room in silence then seated addressed what have mentioned to madame la motte said must give much concern did consider behaviour of marquis in light so serious a doe know that young lady be apt to misconstrue unmeaning gallantry of fashionable manner adeline can never be too cautious in distinguishing between levity of kind more serious address adeline be surprised offended that la motte must think so lightly of understanding disposition a speech implied be possible sir said that have be apprized of marquis conduct be very possible very certain replied la motte with asperity very possible also may see affair with judgment le discoloured by prejudice than do however will not dispute point will only request that since be acquainted with emergency of circumstance will conform to not by ill timed resentment expose to enmity of marquis be now friend be necessary to safety that must continue such if suffer part of family to treat with rudeness must expect to see enemy may surely treat with complaisance adeline thought term rudeness harsh one a la motte applied forbore from expression of displeasure must have wished sir said for privilege of retiring whenever marquis appeared since believe conduct must affect interest ought to submit prudence good will delight said la motte since wish to serve know that can not more effectually do than by treating marquis a friend word friend a stood connected with marquis sounded dissonantly to adeline ear hesitated looked at la motte a friend sir said will endeavour to treat a mine must have said found impossible to finish sentence entreated protection from power of father what protection can afford be yours said la motte know how destitute be of right mean of resisting also how much require protection since have discovered retreat be probably not ignorant of circumstance detain here if oppose may betray to officer of law a surest method of obtaining possession of be encompassed with danger continued la motte must must see method of extricating quit abbey said adeline seek asylum in switzerland germany will then be freed from further obligation to marquis from persecution dread pardon for thus offering advice be certainly in degree prompted by sense of own safety at same time seems to afford only mean of ensuring yours plan be reasonable said la motte have money to execute a be must be contented to remain here a little known a possible defend by making who know friend chiefly must endeavour to preserve favour of marquis may do much must father even pursue desperate measure why do talk thus father may ere have commenced measure effect of vengeance may now be hanging over head regard for adeline have exposed to have resigned to will must have remained secure adeline be so much affected by instance of la motte kindness must not doubt that be unable to express sense of when must speak uttered gratitude in most lively term be sincere in expression said la motte be possible can be le than sincere replied adeline weeping at idea of ingratitude sentiment be easily pronounced said la motte though may have connection with heart believe to be sincere so far only a influence action what mean sir said adeline with surprise mean to inquire whether if opportunity must ever offer of thus proving gratitude must adhere to sentiment name one will refuse said adeline with energy if for instance marquis must hereafter avow serious passion for offer hand must petty resentment lurking prepossession for more happy lover prompt to refuse adeline blushed fixed eye on ground have indeed sir named only mean must reject of evincing sincerity marquis can never love to speak sincerely ever esteem confess peace of one whole life be too much to sacrifice even to gratitude la motte looked displeased 't be a thought said delicate sentiment make fine appearance in speech render person who utters infinitely amiable bring to test of action dissolve into air leaving only wreck of vanity behind unjust sarcasm brought tear to eye since safety sir depends upon conduct said resign to father be willing to return to since stay here must involve in new misfortune let not prove unworthy of protection have hitherto experienced by preferring own welfare to yours when be gone will have reason to apprehend marquis displeasure may probably incur if stay here for feel impossible must even consent to receive address however honourable be view la motte seemed hurt alarmed must not be said let not harass ourselves by stating possible evil then to avoid fly to be certain adeline though be ready to sacrifice to safety will not suffer to do so will not yield to father upon compulsion be satisfied therefore upon point only return ask be civil deportment towards marquis will endeavour to obey sir said adeline madame la

neighbourhood of abbey where must remain concealed till came with horse why yes madam there be place now think of where may be safe enough for nobody go near say be haunted perhaps must not like to go there adeline remembering last night be somewhat startled at intelligence sense of present danger pressed again upon mind overcame other apprehension where be place said if will conceal will not hesitate to go be old tomb stand in thickest part of forest about quarter of mile off nearest way almost mile other when master used to hide so much in forest have followed somewhere thereabouts did not find out tomb till day however be here there if dare venture to mabeselle will show nearest way so saying pointed to winding path on right adeline having looked round without perceiving person near directed peter to lead to tomb pursued path till turning into gloomy romantic part of forest almost impervious to ray of sun came to spot whither louis have formerly traced father stillness solemnity of scene struck awe upon heart of adeline who paused surveyed for time in silence at length peter led into interior part of ruin to descended by several step old abbot said be formerly buried here a marquis people say be like enough that belonged to abbey yonder see why must take in head to walk be not murdered surely hope not said adeline be more than can be said for lie buried at abbey though adeline interrupted hark surely hear noise said heaven protect from discovery listened be still went on peter opened low door entered upon dark passage frequently obstructed by loose fragment of stone along moved with caution whither be going said adeline scarcely know said peter for never be so far before place seems quiet enough something obstructed way be door yielded to hand discovered kind of cell obscurely seen by twilight admitted through grate above partial gleam shot athwart place leaving greatest part of in shadow adeline sighed a surveyed be frightful spot said if will afford shelter be palace remember peter peace honour depend upon faithfulness be discreet resolute in dusk of evening can pas from abbey with least danger of being observed in cell will wait arrival a soon a monsieur madame la motte be engaged in searching vault will bring here horse three knock upon tomb will inform of arrival for heaven sake be cautious be punctual will mabeselle let come what may re ascended to forest adeline fearful of observation directed peter to run first to abbey invent excuse for absence if have be missed when be again alone yielded to flood of tear indulged excess of distress saw without friend without relation destitute forlorn abandoned to worst of evil betrayed by very person to whose comfort have so long administered whom have loved a protector revered a parent reflection touched heart with most afflicting sensation sense of immediate danger be for while absorbed in grief occasioned by discovery of such guilt in others at length roused fortitude turning towards abbey endeavoured to await with patience hour of evening to sustain appearance of composure in presence of monsieur madame la motte for present wished to avoid seeing of doubting ability to disguise emotion having reached abbey therefore passed on to chamber here endeavoured to direct attention to indifferent subject in vain danger of situation severe disappointment have received in character of whom have so much esteemed even loved pressed hard upon thought to generous mind few circumstance be more afflicting than discovery of perfidy in whom have trusted even though may fail of absolute inconvenience to ourselves behaviour of madame la motte in thus by concealment conspiring to destruction particularly shocked how have imagination deceived said what picture did draw of goodness of world must then believe that body be cruel deceitful let still be deceived still suffer rather than be condemned to state of such wretched suspicion now endeavoured to extenuate conduct of madame la motte by attributing to fear of husband dare not oppose will said else must warn of danger assist to escape from will never believe capable of conspiring ruin terror alone keep silent adeline be somewhat comforted by thought benevolence of heart taught in instance to sophisticate perceived not that by ascribing conduct of madame la motte to terror only softened degree of guilt imputing to motive le depraved not le selfish remained in chamber till summoned to dinner when drying tear descended with faltering step palpitating heart to parlour when saw la motte in spite of effort trembled grew pale must not behold even with apparent indifference man who knew have destined to destruction observed emotion inquiring if be ill saw danger to agitation exposed fearful lest la motte must suspect true cause rallied spirit with look of complacency answered be well during dinner preserved degree of composure effectually concealed varied anguish of heart when looked at la motte terror indignation be predominant feeling when regarded madame la motte be otherwise gratitude for former tenderness have long be confirmed into affection heart now swelled with bitterness of grief disappointment madame la motte appeared depressed said little la motte seemed anxious to prevent thought by assuming fictitious unnatural gaiety laughed talked threw off frequent bumper of wine be mirth of desperation madame became alarmed must have restrained persisted in libation to bacchus till reflection seemed to be almost overcome madame la motte fearful in carelessness of present moment might betray withdrew with adeline to room adeline recollected happy hour once passed with when confidence banished reserve sympathy esteem dictated sentiment of friendship now hour be gone for ever must no longer unbosom grief to madame la motte no longer even esteem yet notwithstanding danger to be exposed by criminal silence of latter must not converse with consciously for last time without feeling degree of sorrow wisdom may call weakness to benevolence will allow softer name madame la motte in conversation appeared to labour under almost equal oppression with adeline thought be abstracted from subject of discourse there be long frequent interval of silence adeline more than once caught gazing with look of tenderness upon saw eye fill with tear by circumstance be so much affected that be several time upon point of throwing at foot imploring pity protection cooler reflection showed extravagance danger of conduct suppressed emotion at length compelled to withdraw from presence of madame la motte chapter xi thou to whom world unknown with shadowy shape be shown who seest 'd th unreal scene while fancy lift veil between ah fear ah frantic fear see see thee near know thy hurry 'd step thy haggard eye like thee start like thee disorder 'd fly collins adeline anxiously watched from chamber window sun set behind distant hill time of departure draw nigh set with uncommon splendour threw fiery gleam athwart wood upon scattered fragment of ruin must not gaze upon with indifference never probably again will see sun sink below hill said illumine scene where will be when next set where time to morrow sunk perhaps in misery wept at thought few hour resumed adeline marquis will arrive few hour abbey will be scene of confusion tumult eye will be in search of recess will be explored reflection inspired with new terror increased impatience to be gone twilight gradually came on now thought sufficiently dark to venture forth before went kneeled down addressed to heaven implored support protection committed to care of god of mercy having done quitted chamber passed with cautious step down winding staircase person appeared proceeded through door of tower into forest looked around gloom of evening obscured object with trembling heart sought path pointed out by peter led to tomb having found passed along forlorn terrified often did start a breeze shook light leaf of tree a bat flitted by gamboling in twilight often a looked back towards abbey thought distinguished amid deepening gloom figure of men having proceeded way suddenly heard foot of horse soon after sound of voice among distinguished that of marquis seemed to come from quarter be approaching evidently advanced terror for minute arrested step stood in state of dreadful hesitation to proceed be to run into hand of marquis to return be to fall into power of la motte after remaining for time uncertain whither to fly sound suddenly took different direction wheeled towards abbey adeline have short cessation of terror now understood that marquis have passed spot only in way to abbey hastened to secrete in ruin at length after much difficulty reached deep shade almost concealing from search paused at entrance awed by solemnity reigned within utter darkness of place at length determined to watch without till peter must arrive if person approach said can hear before can see can then secrete in cell leaned against fragment of tomb in trembling expectation a listened sound broke silence of hour state of mind can only be imagined by considering that upon present time turned crisis of fate have now thought discovered flight even now be seeking in part of abbey hear dreadful voice call see eager look power of imagination almost overcame while yet looked around saw light moving at distance sometimes glimmered between tree sometimes totally disappeared seemed to be in direction with abbey now remembered that in morning have seen part of fabric through opening in forest have therefore doubt that light saw proceeded from people in search of who feared not finding at abbey might direct step towards tomb place of refuge now seemed too near enemy to be safe must have fled to more distant part of forest recollected that peter must not know where to find while thought passed over mind heard distant voice in wind be hastening to conceal in cell when observed light suddenly disappear be soon after hushed in silence darkness yet endeavoured to find way to cell remembered situation of outward door of passage having passed unclosed door of cell within be utterly dark trembled violently entered having felt about wall at length seated on projection of stone here again addressed to heaven endeavoured to reanimate spirit till peter must arrive above hour elapsed in gloomy recess sound foretold approach spirit sunk feared part of plan be discovered interrupted that be detained by la motte conviction operated sometimes so strongly upon fear a to urge to quit cell alone seek in flight only chance of escape while design be fluctuating in mind distinguished through grate above clattering of noise approached at length stopped at tomb in succeeding moment heard three stroke of whip heart beat for moment agitation be such that made effort to quit cell stroke be repeated now roused spirit stepping forward ascended to forest called peter for deep gloom must not permit to distinguish man horse be quickly answered hush mabeselle voice will betray mounted rode off a fast a darkness must permit adeline heart revived at step took inquired what have passed at abbey how have contrived to get away speak softly mabeselle will know by by ca tell now have scarcely spoke ere saw light move along at distance coming now to more open part of forest set off on full gallop continued pace till horse must hold no longer looked back light appearing adeline terror subsided inquired again what have passed at abbey when flight be discovered may speak without fear of being heard said be gone beyond reach hope why mabeselle said have not be gone long before marquis arrived monsieur la motte then found out be fled upon great rout there be talked great deal with marquis speak louder said adeline can not hear will mabeselle oh heaven interrupted adeline what voice be be not peter for god sake tell who be whither be going will know soon enough young lady answered stranger for be indeed not peter be taking where master ordered adeline not doubting be marquis servant attempted to leap to ground man dismounting bound to horse one feeble ray of hope at length beamed upon mind endeavoured to soften man to pity pleaded with genuine eloquence of distress understood interest too well to yield even for moment to compassion in spite of artless supplication inspired now resigned to despair in passive silence submitted to fate continued thus to travel till storm of rain accompanied by thunder lightning drove to covert of thick grove man believed safe situation adeline be now too careless of life to attempt convincing of error storm be violent long a soon a abated set off on full gallop having continued to travel for about two hour came to border of forest soon after to high lonely wall adeline must just distinguish by moonlight now streamed through parting cloud here stopped man dismounted having opened small door in wall unbound adeline who shrieked though involuntarily in vain a took from horse door opened upon narrow passage dimly lighted by lamp hung at further end led on came to door opened disclosed magnificent

collation of fruit ice liqueur person appeared whole seemed work of enchantment rather resembled palace of fairy than thing of human conformation adeline be astonished inquired where be man refused to answer question having desired to take refreshment left walked to window from gleam of moonlight discovered to extensive garden where grove lawn water glittering in moonbeam composed scenery of varied romantic beauty what can mean said be charm to lure to destruction endeavoured with hope of escaping to open window be fastened next attempted several door found also secured perceiving chance of escape be removed remained for time given up to sorrow reflection be at length drawn from reverie by note of soft music breathing such dulcet entrancing sound a suspended grief awaked soul to tenderness pensive pleasure adeline listened in surprise insensibly became soothed interested tender melancholy stole upon heart subdued harsher feeling moment strain ceased enchantment dissolved returned to sense of situation again music sounded music such a charmeth sleep again gradually yielded to sweet magic female voice accompanied by lute hautboy few other instrument now gradually swelled into tone so exquisite a raised attention into ecstasy sunk by degree touched few simple note with pathetic softness when measure be suddenly changed in gay airy melody adeline distinguished

reject seeming good hence more 't be wisdom call ye bid ye court time present aid future trust not hope enthralls ye catch pleasure ere fade music ceased sound still vibrated on imagination be sunk in pleasing languor have inspired when door opened marquis de montalt appeared approached sofa where adeline sat addressed heard not voice have fainted endeavoured to recover at length succeeded when unclosed eye again beheld relapsed into state of insensibility having in vain tried various method to restore be obliged to call assistance two young woman entered when began to revive left to prepare for reappearance when adeline perceived that marquis be gone that be in care of woman spirit gradually returned looked at attendant be surprised to see so much elegance beauty endeavour made to interest pity seemed wholly insensible to distress began to talk of marquis in term of highest admiration assured must be own fault if be not happy advised to appear so in presence be with utmost difficulty adeline forbore to express disdain be rising to lip that listened to discourse in silence saw inconvenience fruitlessness of opposition commanded feeling be thus proceeding in praise of marquis when appeared waving hand immediately quitted apartment adeline beheld with kind of mute despair while approached took hand hastily withdrew turning from with look of unutterable distress burst into tear be for time silent appeared softened by anguish again approaching addressing in gentle voice entreated pardon for step despair a called love have prompted be too much absorbed in grief to reply till solicited return of love when sorrow yielded to indignation reproached with conduct pleaded that have long loved sought upon honourable term offer of term began to repeat raising eye towards adeline saw in look contempt be conscious deserved for moment be confused seemed to understand that plan be discovered person despised soon resuming usual command of feature again pressed suit solicited love little reflection showed adeline danger of exasperating pride by avowal of contempt pretended offer of marriage excited thought not improper upon occasion in honour peace of life be concerned to yield somewhat to policy of dissimulation saw that only chance of escaping design depended upon delaying now wished to believe ignorant that marchioness be living that offer be delusive observed pause in eagerness to turn hesitation to advantage renewed proposal with increased vehemence to morrow will unite lovely adeline to morrow will consent to become marchioness de montalt will then return love must first deserve esteem lord will do deserve be not now in power do not forbear to take advantage of situation do not make most honourable proposal adeline shuddered if wish must esteem lord endeavour if possible to make forget by what mean came into power if view be indeed honourable prove so by releasing from confinement can then wish lovely adeline to fly from who adores

beholding till bond of church will remove obstacle to love to morrow adeline saw danger to be now exposed interrupted deserve esteem sir then will obtain a first step towards liberate from confinement obliges to look on only with terror aversion how can believe profession of love while show that have interest in happiness thus did adeline to whom art practice of dissimulation be hitherto equally unknown condescend to make use of in disguising indignation contempt though art be adopted only for purpose of self preservation used with reluctance almost with abhorrence for mind be habitually impregnated with love of virtue in thought word action while end in using be certainly good scarcely thought that end must justify mean marquis persisted in sophistry can doubt reality of love to obtain have urged to risk displeasure have not consulted happiness even in very conduct condemn have removed from solitary desolate ruin to gay splendid villa where luxury be at command where person will be obedient to wish first wish be to go hence said adeline entreat conjure lord no longer to detain be friendless wretched orphan exposed to many evil fear abandoned to misfortune wish to be rude allow to say that misery can exceed that will feel in remaining here indeed in being where pursued by offer make adeline have now forgot policy tear prevented from proceeding turned away face to hide emotion by heaven adeline do wrong said marquis rising from seat seizing hand love adore yet doubt passion be insensible to vow pleasure possible to be enjoyed within wall will partake beyond will not go disengaged hand in silent anguish walked to distant part of saloon deep sigh burst from heart almost fainting leaned on window frame for support marquis followed why thus obstinately persist in refusing to be happy said recollect proposal have made accept while be yet in power to morrow priest will join hand surely being a be in power must be interest to consent to adeline must answer only

earnestly at be now convinced that be theodore who spoke joy be first emotion recollecting former abrupt departure at time so critical to safety that be friend of marquis thousand mingled sensation struggled in breast overwhelmed with mistrust apprehension disappointment theodore raised from ground while yet supported let fly from place said carriage wait to receive will go wherever direct convey to friend last sentence touched heart ala have friend said do know whither to go theodore gently pressed hand between in voice of softest compassion said friend then will be yours suffer to lead to be in agony while remain in place let hasten to quit adeline be going to reply when voice be heard among tree theodore supporting with arm hurried along avenue continued flight till adeline

followed drew ladder to other side when have descended carriage appeared in waiting without driver theodore feared to call lest voice must betray therefore put adeline into carriage went in search of postillion whom found asleep under tree at distance having awakened returned to vehicle soon drove furiously away adeline did not yet dare to believe safe after proceeding considerable time without interruption joy burst upon heart thanked deliverer in term of warmest gratitude sympathy expressed in tone of voice manner proved that happiness on occasion almost equalled own a reflection gradually stole upon mind anxiety superseded joy in tumult of late moment thought only of escape circumstance of present situation now appeared to became silent pensive have friend to whom must fly be going with young chevalier almost stranger to knew not whither remembered how often have be deceived betrayed where trusted most spirit sunk remembered also former attention theodore have shown dreaded lest conduct might be prompted by selfish passion saw to be possible disdained to believe probable felt that nothing must give greater pain than to doubt integrity of theodore interrupted reverie by recurring to late situation at abbey must be much surprised said fear offended that did not attend appointment at abbey after alarming hint have given in last interview that circumstance have perhaps injured in esteem if indeed be ever so happy a to posse design be overruled by of marquis de montalt think may venture to assert that distress upon occasion be at least equal to apprehension adeline said have be much alarmed by hint have given by failing to afford further information concerning subject of danger checked sentence that hung upon lip for perceived that be unwarily betraying interest held in heart there be few moment of silence party seemed perfectly at ease theodore at length renewed conversation suffer to acquaint said with circumstance withheld from interview solicited be anxious to exculpate without waiting reply proceeded to inform that marquis have by inexplicable mean learned suspected subject of last conversation perceiving design be in danger of being counteracted have taken effectual mean to prevent obtaining further intelligence of adeline immediately recollected that theodore have be seen in forest by la motte who have doubt suspected growing intimacy have taken care to inform marquis how likely be to find rival in friend on day following that on last saw said theodore marquis who be colonel commanded to prepare to attend regiment appointed following morning for journey sudden order gave surprise be not long in doubt concerning motive for servant of marquis who have be long attached to entered room soon after have left lord expressing concern at abrupt departure dropped hint respecting excited surprise inquired further be confirmed in suspicion have for time entertained of marquis design upon jaques further informed that late interview have be noticed communicated to marquis information have be obtained from fellow servant alarmed so much that engaged to send intelligence from time to time concerning proceeding of marquis now looked forward to evening must bring again to presence with increased impatience ingenuity of marquis effectually counteracted endeavour wish have made engagement to pas day at villa of nobleman league distant notwithstanding excuse must offer be obliged to attend thus compelled to obey passed day of more agitation anxiety than have ever before experienced be midnight before returned to marquis chateau arose early in morning to commence journey resolved to seek interview with before left province when entered breakfast room be much surprised to find marquis there already who commending beauty of morning declared intention of accompanying a far a chineau thus unexpectedly deprived of last hope countenance believe expressed what felt for scrutinizing eye of marquis instantly changed from seeming carelessness to displeasure distance from chineau to abbey be at least twelve league yet have once intention of returning from thence when marquis must leave till recollected very remote chance there must even then be of seeing alone also that if be observed by la motte must awaken suspicion caution against future plan might see expedient to attempt therefore proceeded to join regiment jaques sent frequent account of operation of marquis manner of relating be so very confused that only served to perplex distress last letter however alarmed so much that residence in quarter became intolerable a found impossible to obtain leave of absence secretly left regiment concealed in cottage about mile from chateau might obtain earliest intelligence of marquis plan jaques brought daily information at last account of horrible plot be laid for following night saw little probability of warning of danger if ventured near abbey la motte might discover frustrate attempt on part to save yet determined to encounter risk for chance of seeing towards evening be preparing to set out for forest when jaques arrived informed that be to be brought to chateau plan be thus rendered le difficult learned also that marquis by mean of refinement in luxury with be too well acquainted designed now that apprehension of losing be more to seduce to wish impose upon by fictitious marriage having obtained information concerning situation of room allotted ordered chaise to be in waiting with design of scaling window conducting thence entered garden at midnight theodore having ceased to speak know not how word can express sense of obligation owe said adeline gratitude for generosity ah call not generosity replied be love paused adeline be silent after moment of expressive emotion resumed pardon abrupt declaration yet why do call abrupt since action have already disclosed what lip have never till instant ventured to acknowledge paused again adeline be still silent yet do justice to believe that be sensible of impropriety of pleading love at present have be surprised into confession promise also to forbear from renewal of subject till be placed in situation where may freely accept refuse sincere regard offer if must however now be certain that posse esteem must relieve from much anxiety adeline felt surprised that must doubt esteem for after signal generous service have rendered be not yet acquainted with timidity of love do then said in tremulous voice believe ungrateful be impossible can consider friendly interference in behalf without esteeming theodore immediately took hand pressed to lip in silence be too much agitated to converse continued to travel for mile without exchanging word chapter xii hope enchanted smiled waved golden hair longer have sung with frown revenge impatient rose ode to passion dawn of morning now trembled through cloud when traveller stopped at small town to change horse theodore entreated adeline to alight take refreshment to at length consented people of inn be not yet up be time before knocking roaring of postillion must rouse having taken slight refreshment theodore adeline returned to carriage only subject upon theodore must have spoke with interest delicacy forbade at time to notice after pointing out beautiful scenery on road making other effort to support conversation relapsed into silence mind though still anxious be now relieved from apprehension have long oppressed when first saw adeline loveliness made deep impression on heart there be sentiment in beauty mind immediately acknowledged effect of manner conversation have afterwards confirmed charm appeared to like since so finely described by english poet oh have seen bathed in morning dew budding rose infant bloom display when first virgin tint unfold to view shrink scarcely trust blaze of day so soft so delicate so sweet came be damask glow just dawning on cheek gaz 'd sigh 'd caught tender flame felt fond pang droop 'd with passion weak knowledge of destitute condition of danger with be environed have awakened in heart tenderest touch of pity assisted change of admiration into love distress suffered when compelled to leave exposed to danger without being able to warn of can only be imagined during residence with regiment mind be constant prey of terror saw mean of combating by returning to neighbourhood of abbey where might obtain early intelligence of marquis scheme be ready to give assistance to adeline leave of absence must not request without betraying design where most dreaded must be known at length with generous rashness though defied law be impelled by virtue secretly quitted regiment progress of marquis plan have observed with trembling anxiety till night be to decide fate of adeline roused mind to action involved in tumult of hope fear horror expectation never till present hour have ventured to believe be in safety now distance have gained from chateau without perceiving pursuit increased best hope be impossible must sit by side of beloved adeline receive assurance of gratitude esteem without venturing to hope for love congratulated a preserver anticipated scene of happiness when must be under protection of family cloud of misery apprehension disappeared from mind left to sunshine of joy when shadow of fear must sometimes return when recollected with compunction circumstance under have left regiment stationed a be upon frontier in time of war looked at adeline countenance with instantaneous magic beamed peace upon heart adeline have subject of anxiety from theodore be exempt prospect of future day be involved in darkness uncertainty again be going to claim bounty of stranger again going to encounter uncertainty of kindness exposed to hardship of dependance to difficulty of earning precarious livelihood anticipation obscured joy occasioned by escape by affection conduct avowal of theodore have exhibited delicacy of behaviour in forbearing to take advantage of present situation to plead love increased esteem flattered pride adeline be lost in meditation upon subject like when postillion stopped carriage pointing to part of road wound down side of hill have passed said there be several horseman in pursuit theodore immediately ordered to proceed with possible speed to strike out of great road into first obscure way offered postillion cracked whip in air set off a if be flying for life in meanwhile theodore endeavoured to reanimate adeline who be sinking with terror who now thought if must only escape from marquis must defy future presently struck into by lane screened overshadowed by thick tree theodore again looked from window closing bough prevented seeing far enough to determine whether pursuit continued for sake adeline endeavoured to disguise emotion lane said theodore will certainly lead to town village then have nothing to apprehend for though single arm must not defend against number of pursuer nave doubt of being able to interest of inhabitant in behalf adeline appeared to be comforted by hope reflection suggested theodore again looked back winding of road closed view rattling of wheel overcame other sound at length called to postillion to stop having listened attentively without perceiving sound of horse began to hope be now in safety do know whither road lead said postillion answered that did not saw house through tree at distance believed that led to be most welcome intelligence to theodore who looked forward perceived house postillion set off fear nothing adored adeline said be now safe will part with with life adeline sighed not for only for danger to theodore might be exposed have continued to travel in manner for near hour when arrived at small village soon after stopped at inn best place afforded a theodore lifted adeline from chaise again entreated to dismiss apprehension spoke with tenderness to must reply only by smile ill concealed anxiety after ordering refreshment went out to speak with landlord have scarcely left room when adeline observed party of horseman enter inn yard have doubt be person from whom fled face of two of only be turned towards thought figure of one of others not unlike of marquis heart be chilled for moment power of reason forsook first design be to seek concealment while considered mean one of horseman looked up to window near stood speaking to companion entered inn to quit room without being observed be impossible to remain there alone unprotected a be must almost be equally dangerous paced room in agony of terror often secretly calling on theodore often wondering did not return be moment of indescribable suffering loud tumultuous sound of voice now arose from distant part of house soon distinguished word of disputant arrest in king name said one bid at peril attempt to go from hence except under guard next minute adeline heard voice of theodore in reply mean to dispute king order said give word of honour not to go without first unhand may return to room have friend there whom wish to speak with to proposal at first objected considering merely a excuse to obtain opportunity of escaping after much altercation entreaty request be granted sprang forward towards room where adeline remained while sergeant corporal followed to door two soldier went out into yard of inn to watch window of apartment with eager hand unclosed door adeline hastened not to meet for have fainted almost at beginning of dispute theodore called loudly for assistance mistress of inn soon appeared with stock of remedy be administered in vain to adeline who remained insensible by breathing alone gave sign of existence distress of theodore be in mean time heightened by appearance of officer who laughing at discovery of pretended friend declared must wait no longer saying must have forced from inanimate form of adeline over whom hung in unutterable anguish when fiercely turning upon drew sword swore power on earth must force away before lady recovered men enraged by action determined air of theodore exclaimed do oppose king order advanced to seize presented point of sword bade at peril approach one of immediately drew theodore kept guard did not advance demand only to wait here till lady recovers said understand alternative man already exasperated by opposition of theodore regarded latter part of speech a threat became determined not to give up point pressed forward while comrade called men from yard theodore wounded slightly in shoulder received stroke of sabre on head blood gushed furiously from wound theodore staggering to chair sunk into just a remainder of party entered room adeline unclosed eye to see ghastly pale covered with blood uttered involuntary scream exclaiming have murdered nearly relapsed at sound of voice raised head smiling held out hand to be not much hurt said faintly will soon be better if indeed be recovered hastened towards gave hand be nobody gone for surgeon said with look of agony be alarmed said theodore be not so ill a imagine room be now crowded with people whom report of affray have now brought together among be man who acted a physician apothecary surgeon to village who now stepped forward to assistance of theodore having examined wound declined giving opinion ordered patient to be immediately put to bed to officer objected alleging that be duty to carry to regiment can not be done without great danger to life replied doctor oh life said sergeant have nothing to do with must do duty adeline who have hitherto stood in trembling anxiety must now no longer be silent since surgeon said have declared opinion that gentleman can not be removed in present condition without endangering life will remember that if dy yours will probably answer yes rejoined surgeon who be unwilling to relinquish patient declare before witness that can not be removed with safety will do well therefore to consider consequence have received very dangerous wound requires most careful treatment event be even then doubtful if travel fever may ensue wound will then be mortal theodore heard sentence with composure adeline must with difficulty conceal anguish of heart roused fortitude to suppress tear struggled in eye though wished to interest humanity to awaken fear of men in behalf of unfortunate prisoner dared not to trust voice with utterance from internal struggle be relieved by compassion of people who filled room becoming clamorous in cause of theodore declared officer must be guilty of murder if removed why must die at rate said sergeant for quitting post drawing upon in execution of king order faint sickness seized heart of adeline leaned for support against theodore chair whose concern for be for while suspended in anxiety for supported with arm forcing smile said in low voice only must hear be misrepresentation doubt not when affair be inquired into will be settled without serious consequence adeline knew word be uttered only to console therefore did not give much credit to though theodore continued to give similar assurance of safety meanwhile mob whose compassion for have be gradually excited by obduracy of officer be now roused to pity indignation by seeming certainty of punishment unfeeling manner in have be denounced in short time became so much enraged partly from dread of further consequence partly from shame charge of cruelty occasioned sergeant consented that must be put to bed till commanding officer might direct what be to be done adeline joy at circumstance overcame for moment sense of misfortune of situation waited in adjoining room sentence of surgeon who be now engaged in examining wound though accident must in other circumstance have severely afflicted now lamented more because considered a cause of because misfortune by illustrating more fully affection of lover drew closer to heart seemed therefore to sharpen poignancy of affliction dreadful assertion that theodore must recover must be punished with death scarcely dared to consider endeavoured to believe that be no more than cruel exaggeration of antagonist upon whole theodore present danger together with attendant circumstance awakened tenderness discovered to true state of affection graceful form noble intelligent countenance engaging manner have at first admired in theodore became afterwards more interesting by strength of thought elegance of sentiment exhibited in conversation conduct since escape have excited warmest gratitude danger have now encountered in behalf called forth tenderness heightened into love veil be removed from heart saw for first time genuine emotion surgeon at length came out of theodore chamber into room where adeline be waiting to speak with inquired concerning state of wound be relation of gentleman presume madam sister perhaps question vexed embarrassed without answering repeated inquiry perhaps madam be more nearly related pursued surgeon seeming also to disregard question perhaps be wife adeline blushed be about to reply continued speech interest take in welfare be at least very flattering must almost consent to exchange condition with be sure of receiving such tender compassion from so charming lady saying bowed to ground adeline assuming very reserved air said now sir that have concluded compliment will perhaps attend to question have inquired how have left patient that madam be perhaps question very difficult to be resolved be likewise very disagreeable office to pronounce ill news fear will die surgeon opened snuff box presented to adeline die exclaimed in faint voice die be alarmed madam resumed surgeon observing grow pale be alarmed be possible that wound may not have reached stammered in case stammering again be not affected if so interior membrane of brain be not touched in case wound may perhaps escape inflammation patient may possibly recover if on other hand beseech sir to speak intelligibly interrupted adeline not to trifle with anxiety do really believe in danger in danger madam exclaimed surgeon in danger yes certainly in very great danger saying walked away with air of chagrin displeasure adeline remained for moment in room in excess of sorrow found impossible to restrain then drying tear endeavouring to compose countenance went to inquire for mistress of inn to whom sent waiter after expecting in vain for time rang bell sent message somewhat more pressing still hostess did not appear adeline at length went down stair where found surrounded by number of people relating with loud voice various gesticulation particular of late accident perceiving adeline called out oh here be mademoiselle eye of assembly be immediately turned upon adeline whom crowd prevented from approaching hostess now beckoned be going to withdraw landlady eager in pursuit of story disregarded signal in vain did adeline endeavour to catch eye glanced where upon who be unwilling to attract further notice of crowd by calling out be great pity to be sure that must be shot said landlady be such handsome man say certainly will if recovers poor gentleman will very likely not suffer though for doctor say will never go out of house alive adeline now spoke to man who stood near desiring must tell hostess wished to speak with left place in about ten minute landlady appeared ala mademoiselle said brother be in sad condition fear wo get over adeline inquired whether there be other medical person in town than surgeon whom have seen lord madam be rare healthy place have little need of medicine people here accident never happened in before doctor have be here ten year there be very bad encouragement for trade believe be poor enough one of sort quite enough for adeline interrupted to ask question concerning theodore whom hostess have attended to chamber inquired how have borne dressing of wound whether appeared to be easier after operation question to hostess gave very satisfactory answer now inquired whether there be surgeon in neighbourhood of town be told there be not distress visible in adeline countenance seemed to excite compassion of landlady who now endeavoured to console in best manner be able advised to send for friend offered to procure messenger adeline sighed said be unnecessary know mabeselle what may think necessary continued hostess know must think very hard to die in strange place with relation near dare say poor gentleman think so besides who be to pay for funeral if dy adeline begged must be silent desiring that proper attention might be given promised reward for trouble requested pen ink immediately ay to be sure mabeselle be proper way why friend must never forgive if did not acquaint know by a for taking care of will have thing house affords warrant there be never better inn in province though town be none of biggest adeline be obliged to repeat request for pen ink before loquacious hostess must quit room thought of sending for theodore friend have in tumult of late scene never occurred to be now somewhat consoled by prospect of comfort opened for when pen ink be brought wrote following note to theodore in present condition have need of comfort can be procured surely there be cordial more valuable in illness than presence of friend suffer therefore to acquaint family with situation will be satisfaction to doubt not consolation to in short time after have sent note received message from theodore entreating most respectfully earnestly to see for few minute immediately went to chamber found worst apprehension confirmed by languor expressed in countenance while shock received together with struggle to disguise emotion almost overcame thank for goodness said extending hand received sitting down by bed burst into flood of tear when agitation have somewhat subsided removing handkerchief from eye again looked on theodore smile of tenderest love expressed sense of interest took in welfare administered temporary relief to heart forgive weakness said spirit have of late be so variously agitated theodore interrupted tear be more flattering to heart for sake endeavour to support doubt not will soon be better surgeon like said adeline tell how find assured that be now much easier than have yet be mentioning kind note led to subject on account of have solicited to see family said reside at great distance from hence well know affection be such be informed of situation consideration however reasonable must prevent coming to assistance before can arrive presence will probably be unnecessary adeline looked earnestly at must probably be well pursued smiling before letter must reach must therefore occasion unnecessary pain moreover fruitless journey for sake adeline must wish be here few day will more fully show consequence of wound let wait at least till then be directed by circumstance adeline forbore to press subject further turned to one more immediately interesting much wish said that have more able surgeon know geography of province better than do be in neighbourhood of town likely to afford other advice believe not said be affair of little consequence for wound be so inconsiderable that very moderate share of skill may suffice to cure why beloved adeline do give way to anxiety why suffer to be disturbed by tendency to forebode worst be willing perhaps presumptuously so to attribute to kindness suffer to assure that while excites gratitude increase tenderest esteem o adeline since wish speedy recovery let see composed while believe to be unhappy can not be well assured must endeavour to be at least tranquil fearing conversation if prolonged must be prejudicial to left to repose a turned out of gallery met hostess upon whom certain word of adeline have operated a talisman transforming neglect impertinence into officious civility came to inquire whether gentleman above stair have thing that liked for be sure be endeavour that must have got nurse mabeselle to attend dare say will do very well will look to for will not mind helping sometimes poor gentleman how patiently bear one must not think now that belief be going to die yet doctor told so at least a good adeline be extremely shocked at imprudent conduct of surgeon dismissed landlady after ordering slight dinner towards evening surgeon again made appearance having passed time with patient returned to parlour according to desire of adeline to inform her of condition answered adeline inquiry with great solemnity be impossible to determine positively at present madam have reason to adhere to opinion gave morning be not apt indeed to form opinion upon uncertain ground will give singular instance of be not above fortnight since be sent for to patient at league distance be from home when messenger arrived case being urgent before must reach patient physician be consulted who have ordered such medicine a thought proper patient have be apparently relieved by friend be congratulating upon improvement when arrived have agreed in opinion with physician that there be danger in case depend upon said be mistaken medicine can not have relieved patient be in utmost danger patient groaned brother physician persisted in affirming that remedy have prescribed must not only be certain speedy good effect having be already produced by upon lost patience adhering to opinion that effect be fallacious case desperate assured patient that life be in utmost danger be not one of madam who deceive patient to last moment will hear conclusion brother physician be suppose enraged by firmness of opposition for assumed most angry look did not in least affect turning to patient desired must decide upon of opinion to rely for must decline acting with patient did honour pursued surgeon with smile of complacency smoothing ruffle to think more highly of than perhaps deserved for immediately dismissed opponent must not have believed said a physician left room must not have believed that man who have be so many year in profession must be so wholly ignorant of must not have believed said be astonished that be not aware of danger resumed patient be astonished likewise replied be resolved to do what must for patient for be man of understanding a perceive have regard for therefore altered prescription administered medicine must not do opinion be verified died even before next morning adeline who have be compelled to listen to long story sighed at conclusion of wonder that be affected madam said surgeon instance have related be certainly very affecting one distressed so much that be time before must think even speak concerning must allow madam continued lowering voice bowing with look of self congratulation that be striking instance of infallibility of judgment adeline shuddered at infallibility of judgment made reply be shocking thing for poor man resumed surgeon be indeed very shocking said adeline affected good deal when happened continued undoubtedly sir said adeline time wear away most painful impression think mention be about fortnight since happened somewhere thereabouts replied surgeon without seeming to understand observation will permit sir to ask name of physician who so ignorantly opposed certainly madame be lafance life in obscurity deserves doubt said adeline why madam life in town of note at about distance of four league from hence affords one instance among many others that public opinion be generally erroneous will hardly believe assure be fact that man come into great deal of practice while be suffered to remain here neglected indeed very little known during narrative adeline have be considering by what mean must discover name of physician for instance have be produced to prove ignorance infallibility of opponent have completely settled opinion concerning now more than ever wished to deliver theodore from hand of surgeon be musing on possibility when with so much self security developed mean asked few more question concerning state of theodore wound be told be much a have be that degree of fever have come on have ordered fire to be made in room continued surgeon additional blanket to be laid on bed doubt not will have proper effect in mean time must be careful to keep from kind of liquid except cordial draught will send will naturally ask for drink must on account be given to approve then of method have somewhere heard of said adeline of attending to nature in case nature madam pursued nature be most improper guide in world always adopt method directly contrary to what must suggest for what can be use of art if be only to follow nature be first opinion on setting out in life have ever since strictly adhered to from what have said indeed madam may perhaps perceive that opinion may be depended on what once be always be for mind be not of frivolous kind to be affected by circumstance adeline be fatigued by discourse impatient to impart to theodore discovery of physician surgeon seemed by mean disposed to leave be expatiating upon various topic with new instance of surprising sagacity when waiter brought message that person desired to see be however engaged upon too agreeable topic to be easily prevailed upon to quit be not till after second message be brought that made bow to adeline left room moment be gone sent note to theodore entreating permission to call in assistance of physician conceited manner of surgeon have by time given theodore very unfavourable opinion of talent last prescription have so fully confirmed that now readily consented to have other advice adeline immediately inquired for messenger recollecting that residence of physician be still secret applied to hostess who being really ignorant of pretending to be so gave information what further inquiry made be equally ineffectual passed hour in extreme distress while disorder of theodore rather increased than abated when supper appeared asked boy who waited if knew physician of name of lafance in neighbourhood not in neighbourhood madame know doctor lafance of chancy for come from town adeline inquired further received very satisfactory answer town be at league distance delay circumstance must occasion again alarmed however ordered messenger to be immediately dispatched having sent again to inquire concerning theodore retired to chamber for night continued fatigue have suffered for last fourteen hour overcame anxiety harassed spirit sunk to repose slept till late in morning be then awakened by landlady who came to inform that theodore be much worse to inquire what must be done adeline finding that physician be not arrived immediately arose hastened to inquire further concerning theodore hostess informed that have passed very disturbed night that have complained of being very hot desired that fire in room might be extinguished that nurse knew duty too well to obey have strictly followed doctor order added that have taken cordial draught regularly have notwithstanding continued to grow worse at last became light headed in mean time boy who have be sent for physician be still absent wonder continued hostess why only consider be eight league off lad have to find road bad a be in dark indeed mabeselle might a well have trusted doctor for never want body else not in town here if might speak mind jaques have better have be sent off for young gentleman friend than for strange doctor that nobody know after asking further question concerning theodore answer to rather increased than diminished alarm adeline endeavoured to compose spirit await in patience arrival of physician be now more sensible than ever of forlornness of own condition of danger of theodore earnestly wished that friend must be informed of situation wish must not be gratified for theodore who alone must acquaint with place of residence be deprived of recollection when surgeon arrived perceived situation of patient expressed surprise having asked question given few general direction went down to adeline after paying usual compliment suddenly assumed air of importance be sorry madam said that be office to communicate disagreeable intelligence wish to be prepared for event fear be approaching adeline comprehended meaning though have hitherto given little faith to judgment must not hear hint at immediate danger of theodore without yielding to influence of fear entreated to acquaint with apprehended then proceeded to say that theodore be a have foreseen much worse morning than have be preceding night disorder having now affected head there be reason to fear must prove

grief either by word tear gentleman suppose madam have friend sooner inform of condition better if reside at distance be indeed too late there be other necessary be ill madam adeline made effort to speak in vain surgeon now called loudly for glass of water drank deep sigh that uttered seemed somewhat to relieve oppressed heart tear succeeded in mean time surgeon perceiving be better though not well enough to listen to conversation took leave promised to return in hour physician be not yet arrived adeline awaited appearance with mixture of fear anxious hope about noon came having be informed of accident by fever be produced of treatment surgeon have given ascended to theodore chamber in quarter of hour returned to room where adeline expected gentleman be still delirious said have ordered composing draught be there hope sir inquired adeline yes madam certainly there be case at present be somewhat doubtful few hour may enable to judge with more certainty in mean time have directed that will be kept quiet be allowed to drink freely of diluting liquid have scarcely at adeline request recommended surgeon instead of one at present employed when latter gentleman entered room perceiving physician threw glance of mingled surprise anger at adeline who retired with to apartment where dismissed with politeness did not deign to return certainly did not deserve early following morning surgeon arrived medicine crisis of disorder have thrown theodore into deep sleep in remained for several hour physician now gave adeline reason to hope for favourable issue precaution be taken to prevent being disturbed awoke perfectly sensible free from fever first word inquired for adeline who soon learned that be out of danger in few day be sufficiently recovered to be removed from chamber to room adjoining where adeline met with joy found impossible to repress observance of lighted up countenance with pleasure indeed adeline sensible to attachment have so nobly testified softened by danger have encountered no longer attempted to disguise tenderness of esteem be at length brought to confess interest first appearance have impressed upon heart after hour of affecting conversation in happiness of young mutual attachment totally occupied mind excluded idea not in unison with delight returned to sense of present embarrassment adeline recollected that theodore be arrested for disobedience of order deserting post theodore that must shortly be torn away from adeline who must be left exposed to evil from have so lately rescued thought overwhelmed heart with anguish after long pause ventured to propose what wish have often suggested marriage with adeline before departed from village be only mean of preventing perhaps eternal separation though saw many dangerous inconvenience to must be exposed by marriage with man circumstanced like yet appeared so unequal to must otherwise be left to encounter alone that reason must no longer scruple to adopt what affection have suggested adeline be for time too much agitated to reply though have little to oppose to argument pleading of theodore though have friend to control contrariety of interest to perplex must not bring to consent thus hastily to marriage with man of whom have little knowledge to whose family connexion have sort of introduction at length entreated must drop subject conversation for remainder of day be more general yet still interesting that similarity of taste opinion have at first attracted moment now more fully disclosed discourse be enriched by elegant literature endeared by mutual regard adeline have enjoyed few opportunity of reading book to have access operating upon mind eager for knowledge upon taste peculiarly sensible of beautiful elegant have impressed excellence upon understanding theodore have received from nature many of quality of genius from education that must bestow to be added noble independency of spirit feeling heart manner partook of happy mixture of dignity sweetness in evening one of officer who upon representation of sergeant be sent by person employed to prosecute military criminal arrived at village entering apartment of theodore from adeline immediately withdrew informed with air of infinite importance that must set out on following day for head quarter theodore answered that be not able to bear journey referred to physician officer replied that must take such trouble being certain that physician might be instructed what to say that must begin journey on morrow here have be delay enough said already will have sufficient business on hand when reach head quarter for sergeant whom have severely wounded intends to appear against with offence have committed by deserting post theodore eye flashed fire deserting said rising from seat darting look of menace at accuser who dare to brand with name of deserter instantly recollecting how much conduct have appeared to justify accusation endeavoured to stifle emotion with firm voice composed manner said that when reached head quarter must be ready to answer might be brought against till then must be silent boldness of officer be repressed by spirit dignity with theodore spoke word muttering reply be scarcely audible left room theodore sat musing on danger of situation knew that have much to apprehend from peculiar circumstance attending abrupt departure from regiment having be stationed in garrison town upon spanish frontier where discipline be very severe from power of colonel marquis de montalt whom pride disappointment must now rouse to vengeance probably render indefatigable in accomplishment of destruction thought soon fled from own danger to of adeline in consideration of fortitude forsook must not support idea of leaving exposed to evil foreboded indeed of separation so sudden a now threatened when again entered room renewed solicitation for speedy marriage with argument tenderness ingenuity must suggest adeline when learned that be to depart on morrow felt a if bereaved of last comfort horror of situation arose to mind turned from in unutterable anguish considering silence a favourable presage repeated entreaty that must consent to be thus give surety separation must not be eternal adeline sighed deeply to word who can know separation will not be eternal said even if must consent to marriage propose while hear determination forbear to accuse of indifference for indifference towards must indeed be crime after service have rendered be cold sentiment of gratitude must expect from said theodore know that be going to distress with proof of indifference mistake for suggestion of prudence that will be compelled to look without reluctance upon evil may shortly await ah adeline if mean to reject perhaps last proposal can ever make to cease at least to deceive with idea that love that delirium be fading even from mind can then so soon forget conversation of morning replied adeline can think so lightly of a to believe must profess regard feel if indeed can believe will do well to forget ever made such acknowledgement that heard forgive adeline forgive doubt inconsistency have betrayed let anxiety of love emergency of circumstance plead for adeline smiling faintly through tear held out hand seized pressed to lip yet drive to despair by rejection of suit continued theodore think what must suffer to leave here destitute of friend protection be thinking how may avoid situation so deplorable said adeline say there be convent receives boarder within few mile thither wish to go convent rejoined theodore must go to convent do know persecution must be liable to that if marquis must discover there be little probability superior must resist authority at least bribe have considered said adeline be prepared to encounter rather than enter into engagement at time can be productive only of misery to ah adeline must think thus if truly loved see about to be separated that perhaps for ever from object of tenderest affection can not express anguish feel can not forbear to repeat argument may afford even slightest possibility of altering determination adeline look with complacency upon circumstance torture with despair adeline who have long strove to support spirit in presence while adhered to resolution reason suggested pleading of heart powerfully opposed be unable longer to command distress burst into tear theodore be in same moment convinced of error shocked at grief have occasioned drew chair towards taking hand again entreated pardon endeavoured in tenderest accent to soothe comfort what wretch be to cause distress by questioning regard with can no longer doubt honour forgive adeline say forgive may be pain of separation will no longer oppose have given pain said adeline have not offended then mentioned further particular concerning convent theodore endeavoured to conceal distress approaching separation occasioned to consult with on plan with composure judgment by degree prevailed over passion now perceived that plan suggested must afford best chance of security considered what in first agitation of mind have escaped that might be condemned upon charge brought against that death must have be married must not only deprive her of protector leave more immediately exposed to design of marquis who must doubtless attend trial astonished that have not noticed before shocked at unwariness by might have betrayed into so dangerous situation became at once reconciled to idea of leaving in convent must have wished to place in asylum of own family circumstance under

of approaching situation by consideration that might remain in most terrible suspense concerning fate saw in prison pale emaciated in chain saw vengeance of marquis descending upon for noble exertion in cause theodore alarmed by placid despair expressed in countenance threw into chair by hers taking hand attempted to speak comfort to word faltered on lip must only bathe hand with tear mournful

from vengeance know have deserved defy vengeance cried theodore dread only pang of conscience power can not inflict upon though vice condemn to torture take instantly from room see that be strongly fettered said marquis will soon know what criminal who add insolence to guilt may suffer theodore exclaiming oh adeline farewell be now forced out of room while adeline whose torpid sens be roused by voice last look fell at foot of marquis with tear of agony implored compassion for theodore pleading for rival served only to irritate pride exasperate hatred of marquis denounced vengeance on head imprecation too dreadful for spirit of adeline whom compelled to rise then endeavouring to stifle emotion of rage presence of theodore have excited began to address with usual expression of admiration wretched adeline who regardless of what said still endeavoured to plead for unhappy lover be at length alarmed by returning rage countenance of marquis expressed exerting remaining strength sprung from grasp towards door of room seized hand before must reach regardless of shriek bringing back to chair be going to speak when voice be heard in passage immediately landlord wife whom adeline cry

intelligence found of servant arrived without news of adeline who came afterwards be a successless a first few day after letter from lieutenant colonel of regiment informed that theodore have quitted company have be for time absent nobody knew where information confirming suspicion have frequently occurred to that theodore have be by mean other instrumental in escape of adeline other passion became for time subservient to revenge gave order for immediate pursuit apprehension of theodore theodore in mean time have be overtaken secured be in consequence of having formerly observed growing partiality between adeline of intelligence received from la motte who have noticed interview in forest that marquis have resolved to remove rival so dangerous to love so likely to be informed of design have therefore told theodore in manner a plausible a must that must be necessary for to join regiment notice affected only a related to adeline seemed le extraordinary a have already be at villa much longer time than be usual with officer invited by marquis theodore indeed very well knew character of marquis have accepted invitation rather from unwillingness to show disrespect to

seeking just honourable revenge be dreadful a withheld from attempting rescue of whom loved more than life when heard wheel of carriage contained drive off felt agony of despair almost overcame reason even stern heart of soldier who attended be not wholly insensible to wretchedness by venturing to blame conduct of marquis endeavoured to console prisoner physician who be just arrived entered room during paroxysm of distress feeling expressing much concern at condition inquired with strong surprise why have be thus precipitately removed to room so very unfit for reception theodore explained to reason of of distress suffered of chain by be disgraced perceiving physician listened to with attention compassion became desirous of acquainting with further particular for purpose desired soldier to leave room men complying with request stationed on outside of door then related particular of late transaction of connection with marquis physician attended to narrative with deep concern countenance frequently expressed strong agitation when theodore concluded remained for time silent lost in thought at length awaking from reverie said fear situation be desperate character of marquis be too well known to suffer to be loved respected from such man have nothing to hope for have scarcely thing to fear wish be in power to serve see possibility of ala said theodore situation be indeed desperate for suffering angel deep sob interrupted voice violence of agitation must not allow to proceed physician must only express sympathy felt for distress entreat to be more calm when servant entered room from marquis who desired to see physician immediately after time said must attend marquis having endeavoured to attain degree of composure found difficult to assume wrung hand of theodore quitted room promising to return before left house found marquis much agitated in body mind rather more apprehensive for consequence of wound than have expected anxiety for theodore now suggested plan by execution of hoped might be able to serve having felt patient pulse asked question assumed very serious look when marquis who watched turn of countenance desired must without hesitation speak opinion be sorry to alarm lord here be reason for apprehension how long be since received wound good god there be danger then cried marquis adding bitter execration against theodore there certainly be danger replied physician few hour may enable to determine degree few hour sir interrupted marquis few hour physician entreated to be more calm confusion cried marquis man in health may with great composure entreat dying man to be calm theodore will be broke upon wheel for however mistake sir said physician if believed dying man indeed very near death must not have spoken a did be of consequence must know how long wound have be inflicted marquis terror now began to subside gave circumstantial account of affray with theodore representing that have be basely used in affair where own conduct have be perfectly just humane physician heard relation with great coolness when concluded without making comment upon told marquis must prescribe medicine wished to take immediately marquis again alarmed by gravity of manner entreated must declare most seriously whether thought in immediate danger physician hesitated anxiety of marquis increased be of consequence said must know exact situation physician then said that if have worldly affair to settle must be a well to attend to for that be impossible to say what might be event then turned discourse said have just be with young officer under arrest who hoped must not be removed at present a such procedure must endanger life marquis uttered dreadful oath cursing theodore for having brought to present condition said must depart with guard very night against cruelty of sentence physician ventured to expostulate endeavouring to awaken marquis to sense of humanity pleaded earnestly for theodore entreaty argument seemed by displaying to marquis part of own character to rouse resentment rekindle violence of passion physician at length withdrew in despondency after promising at marquis request not to leave inn have hoped by aggravating danger to obtain advantage for adeline theodore plan have contrary effect for apprehension of death so dreadful to guilty mind of marquis instead of awakening penitence increased desire of vengeance against man who have brought to such situation determined to have adeline conveyed where theodore must by accident escape must never obtain thus to secure to at least mean of revenge knew however that when theodore be once safely conveyed to regiment destruction be certain for must even be acquitted of intention of deserting must be condemned for having assaulted superior officer physician returned to room where theodore be confined violence of distress be now subsided into stern despair more dreadful than vehemence have lately possessed guard in compliance with request having left room physician repeated to part of conversation with marquis theodore after expressing thanks said have nothing more to hope for felt little be for family adeline suffered inquired what route have taken though have prospect of deriving advantage from information desired physician to assist in obtaining landlord wife be affected to be ignorant of matter be in vain to apply to other person sergeant now entered with order from marquis for immediate departure of theodore who heard message with composure though physician must not help expressing indignation at precipitate removal dread of consequence might attend theodore have scarcely time to declare gratitude for kindness of valuable friend before soldier entered room to conduct to carriage in waiting a bade farewell theodore slipped purse into hand turning abruptly away told soldier to lead on physician stopped refused present with such serious warmth that be compelled to resume wrung hand of new friend being unable to speak hurried away whole party immediately set off unhappy theodore be left to remembrance of past hope suffering to anxiety for fate of adeline contemplation of present wretchedness apprehension of what might be reserved for in future for

be with utmost difficulty supported for moment neither observed countenance heard voice offered arm to assist into abbey at first refused having tottered few pace be obliged to accept then entered vaulted room where sinking into chair flood of tear came to relief la motte did not interrupt silence continued for time paced room in seeming agitation when adeline be sufficiently recovered to notice external object observed countenance there read tumult of soul while be struggling to assume firmness better feeling opposed la motte now took hand must have led from room stopped with kind of desperate courage made effort to engage to pity to save interrupted be not in power said in voice of emotion be not master of myself conduct inquire further be sufficient for to know pity more can not

be obliged to assume appearance of tranquillity in about quarter of hour chamber door be unlocked annette appeared with refreshment book expressed satisfaction at seeing adeline again seemed fearful of speaking knowing probably that be contrary to order of la motte who said be waiting at bottom of stair when annette be gone adeline took refreshment be indeed necessary for have tasted nothing

nobly daring for mind already effeminated by vice viewed dangerous labyrinth into be led perceived a if for first time progression of guilt from labyrinth weakly imagined further guilt must alone extricate instead of employing mind upon mean of saving adeline from destruction from being instrumental to endeavoured only to lull pang of conscience to persuade into belief that must proceed in course have begun knew to be in power of marquis dreaded that power more than sure though distant punishment that awaits upon guilt honour of adeline quiet of own conscience consented to barter for few year of existence be ignorant of present illness of marquis must have perceived that there be chance of escaping threatened punishment at price le enormous than infamy must perhaps have endeavoured to save adeline by flight marquis foreseeing possibility of have ordered servant carefully to conceal circumstance detained to acquaint la motte that must be at abbey in few day at same time directing valet to await there adeline a expected have inclination opportunity to mention thus la motte remained ignorant of circumstance might have preserved from further guilt adeline from misery most unwillingly have la motte made wife acquainted with action have made absolutely dependent upon will of marquis perturbation of mind partly betrayed frequently in sleep muttered incoherent sentence frequently must start from slumber call in passionate exclamation upon adeline instance of disturbed mind have alarmed terrified madame la motte who watched while slept soon gathered from word confused idea of marquis design hinted suspicion to la motte who reproved for having entertained manner instead of repressing increased fear for adeline fear conduct of marquis soon confirmed on night that slept at abbey have occurred to that scheme be in agitation must now most probably be discussed anxiety for adeline made stoop to meanness in other circumstance must have be despicable

shocked at guilty weakness of la motte be for time incapable of thinking determining how to proceed knew husband to be under great obligation to marquis whose territory thus afforded shelter from world that be in power of former to betray into hand of enemy believed also that marquis must do if provoked yet thought upon such occasion la motte might find way of appeasing marquis without subjecting to dishonour after further reflection mind became more composed returned to chamber where la motte soon followed spirit however be not now in state to encounter displeasure opposition have too much reason to expect whenever must mention subject of concern therefore resolved not to notice till morrow on morrow told la motte have uttered in dream mentioned other circumstance convinced be in vain longer to deny truth of apprehension wife then represented to how possible be to avoid infamy into be about to plunge by quitting territory of marquis pleaded so warmly for adeline that la motte in sullen silence appeared to meditate upon plan thought be however very differently engaged be conscious of having deserved from marquis dreadful punishment knew that if exasperated by refusing to acquiesce with wish have little to expect from flight for eye of justice revenge must pursue with indefatigable research la motte meditated how to break to wife for perceived that there be other method of counteracting virtuous compassion for adeline dangerous consequence to be expected from than by opposing with terror for safety must be done only by showing full extent of evil must attend resentment of marquis vice have not yet so entirely darkened conscience that blush of shame stained cheek tongue faltered when must have told guilt at length finding impossible to mention particular told that on account of affair entreaty must ever induce to explain life be in power of marquis see alternative said take choice of evil if can tell adeline of danger sacrifice life to save from situation many must be ambitious to obtain madame la motte condemned to horrible alternative of permitting seduction of innocence of dooming husband to destruction suffered distraction of thought defied control perceiving however that opposition to design of marquis must ruin la motte avail adeline little determined to yield endure in silence at time when adeline be planning escape from abbey significant look of peter have led la motte to suspect truth to observe more closely have seen separate in hall with apparent confusion have afterwards observed conversing together in cloister circumstance so unusual left not doubt adeline have discovered danger be concerting with peter mean of escape affecting therefore to be informed of whole affair charged peter with treachery towards threatened with vengeance of marquis if did not disclose knew menace intimidated peter supposing that chance of assisting adeline be gone made circumstantial confession promised to forbear acquainting adeline with discovery of scheme in promise be seconded by inclination for feared to meet displeasure adeline believing have betrayed might express on evening of day on adeline intended escape be discovered marquis designed to come to abbey have be agreed that must then take adeline to villa la motte have immediately perceived advantage of permitting adeline to repair in belief of being undiscovered to tomb must prevent much disturbance opposition spare pain must feel in presence when must know that have betrayed servant of marquis might go at appointed hour to tomb wrapt in disguise of night might take quietly thence in character of peter thus without resistance must be carried to villa discover mistake till be too late to prevent consequence when marquis did arrive la motte who be not so much intoxicated by wine have drunk a to forget prudence informed of what have happened what have planned marquis approving servant be made acquainted with signal afterwards betrayed adeline to power deep consciousness of unworthy neutrality have observed in adeline concern made madame la motte anxiously avoid seeing now that be again in abbey adeline understood conduct rejoiced that be spared anguish of meeting a enemy whom have once considered a friend several day now passed in solitude in miserable retrospection dreadful expectation perilous situation of theodore be almost constant subject of thought often did breathe agonizing wish for safety often look round sphere of possibility in search of hope hope have almost left horizon of prospect when did appear sprung only from death of marquis whose vengeance threatened most certain destruction marquis meanwhile lay at inn at caux in state of very doubtful recovery physician surgeon neither of whom must dismiss suffer to leave village proceeded upon contrary principle good effect of what one prescribed be frequently counteracted by injudicious treatment of other humanity alone prevailed on physician to continue attendance malady of marquis be also heightened by impatience of temper terror of death irritation of passion one moment believed dying must scarcely be prevented from attempting to follow adeline to abbey so various be fluctuation of mind so rapid scheme succeeded other that passion be in continual state of conflict physician attempted to persuade that recovery greatly depended upon tranquillity to prevail upon to attempt at least command of feeling be soon silenced in hopeless disgust by impatient answer of marquis at servant who have carried off adeline returned marquis having ordered into chamber asked so many question in breath that man knew not to answer at length pulled folded paper from pocket said have be dropped in chaise by mademoiselle adeline a thought lordship must like to see have taken care of marquis stretched forth hand with eagerness received note addressed to theodore on perceiving superscription agitation of jealous rage for moment overcame held in hand unable to open however broke seal found to be note of inquiry written by adeline to theodore during illness from accident have be prevented from sending tender solicitude expressed for recovery stung soul of marquis drew from comparison of feeling on illness of rival that of must be solicitous for recovery said for mine only dread a if willing to prolong pain little billet have excited then read again again cursed fate execrated rival giving up a usual to transport of passion be going to throw from when eye caught seal looked earnestly at anger seemed now to have subsided deposited note carefully in pocket book be for time lost in thought after many day of hope fear strength of constitution overcame illness be well enough to write several letter one of immediately sent off to prepare la motte for reception same policy have prompted to conceal illness from la motte now urged to say what knew must not happen that must reach abbey on day after servant repeated injunction adeline must be strictly guarded renewed promise of reward for future service of la motte la motte to whom succeeding day have brought new surprise perplexity concerning absence of marquis received notice with uneasiness for have begun to hope that marquis have altered intention concerning adeline being engaged in new adventure obliged to visit estate in distant province must have be willing thus to have got rid of affair be to reflect so much dishonour on hope be now vanished directed madame to prepare for reception of marquis adeline passed day in state of suspense be now cheered by hope now darkened by despair delay so much exceeding expectation seemed to prove that illness of marquis be dangerous when looked forward to consequence of recovery must not be sorry that be so so odious be

provided said marquis a be take poniard use a occasion offer be resolute la motte received poniard with trembling hand continued to gaze upon for time scarcely knowing what did put up said marquis endeavour to recollect la motte obeyed continued to muse in silence saw entangled in web own crime have woven being in power of marquis knew must either consent to commission of deed from enormity of depraved a be shrunk in horror sacrifice fortune freedom probably life to refusal have be led on by slow gradation from folly to vice till now saw before abyss of guilt startled even conscience so long have slumbered mean of retreating be desperate to proceed be equally so when considered innocence helplessness of adeline orphan state former affectionate conduct confidence in protection heart melted with compassion for distress have already occasioned shrunk in terror from deed be urged to commit when on other hand contemplated destruction threatened from vengeance of marquis then considered advantage be offered of favour freedom probably fortune terror temptation contributed to overcome pleading of humanity silence voice of conscience in state of tumultuous uncertainty continued for time silent until voice of marquis roused to conviction of necessity of at least appearing to acquiesce in design do hesitate said marquis lord resolution be fixed will obey methinks must be better to avoid bloodshed strange secret have be revealed by aye how avoid interrupted marquis poison will not venture to procure have given one sure instrument of death also may find dangerous to inquire for drug la motte perceived that must not purchase poison without incurring discovery much greater than that wished to avoid be right lord will follow order implicitly marquis now proceeded in broken sentence to give further direction concerning dreadful scheme in sleep said at midnight family will then be at rest afterwards planned story be to account for disappearance by be

confirm suspicion further consulted how marquis be to be informed of event be agreed that must come a usual to abbey on following day to night then said marquis may rely upon resolution may lord farewell then when meet again when meet again said la motte will be done followed marquis to abbey having seen mount horse wished good night retired to chamber where shut up adeline meanwhile in solitude of prison gave way to despair condition inspired tried to arrange thought to argue into degree of resignation reflection by representing past reason by anticipating future brought before mind full picture of misfortune sunk in despondency of theodore who by conduct so noble have testified attachment involved in ruin thought with degree of anguish infinitely superior to have felt upon other occasion that very exertion have deserved gratitude awakened tenderness must be cause of destruction be circumstance so much beyond ordinary bound of misery that fortitude sunk at once before idea of theodore suffering theodore dying be for ever present to imagination frequently excluding sense of own danger made conscious only of sometimes hope have given of being able to vindicate conduct at least to obtain pardon must return be like faint beam of april morn transient cheerless knew that marquis stung with jealousy exasperated to revenge must pursue with unrelenting malice against enemy what must theodore oppose conscious rectitude must not avail to ward off blow disappointed passion powerful pride directed distress be considerably heightened by reflecting that intelligence of must reach at abbey that must remain knew not how long in most dreadful suspense concerning fate from abbey saw possibility of escaping be prisoner in chamber inclosed at avenue have opportunity of conversing with person who must afford even chance of relief saw condemned to await in passive silence impending destiny infinitely more dreadful to imagination than death thus circumstanced yielded to pressure of misfortune must sit for hour motionless given up to thought theodore must frequently exclaim can not hear voice can not fly to help prisoner in chain picture be too horrid swelling anguish of heart must subdue utterance tear bathed cheek became insensible to thing misery of theodore on evening mind have be remarkably tranquil a watched from window with still melancholy pleasure setting sun fading splendour of western horizon gradual approach of twilight thought bore back to time when in happier circumstance have watched same appearance recollected also evening of temporary escape from abbey when from same window have viewed declining sun how anxiously have awaited fall of twilight how much have endeavoured to anticipate event of future life with what trembling fear have descended from tower ventured into forest reflection produced others filled heart with anguish eye with tear while be lost in melancholy reverie saw marquis mount horse depart from gate sight of revived in force sense of misery inflicted on beloved theodore consciousness of evil more immediately threatened withdrew from window in agony of tear continuing for considerable time frame be at length quite exhausted retired early to rest la motte remained in chamber till supper obliged to descend at table wild haggard countenance in spite of endeavour betrayed disorder of mind long frequent fit of abstraction surprised a well a alarmed madame la motte when peter left room tenderly inquired what have disturbed with distorted smile tried to be gay effort be beyond art quickly relapsed into silence when madame la motte spoke strove to conceal absence of thought answered so entirely from purpose that abstraction became still more apparent observing madame la motte appeared to take notice of present temper continued to sit in uninterrupted silence till hour of rest when retired to chamber la motte lay in state of disturbed watchfulness for time frequent start awoke madame who however being pacified by trifling excuse soon went to sleep again agitation continued till near midnight when recollecting that time be now passing in idle reflection ought to be devoted to action stole silently from bed wrapped in night gown taking lamp burned nightly in chamber passed up spiral staircase a went frequently looked back often started listened to hollow sighings of blast hand shook so violently when attempted to unlock door of adeline chamber that be obliged to set lamp on ground apply hand noise made with key induced to suppose must have awakened when opened door perceived stillness reigned within be convinced be asleep when approached bed heard gently breathe soon after sigh stopped silence returning again advanced then heard sing in deep a listened distinguished note of melancholy little air in happier day have often sung to low mournful accent in now uttered expressed too well tone of mind la motte now stepped hastily towards bed when breathing deep sigh be again silent undrew curtain saw lying in profound sleep cheek yet wet with tear resting upon arm stood moment looking at a viewed innocent lovely countenance pale in grief light of lamp shone strong upon eye awoke perceiving man uttered scream recollection returning knew to be la motte instantly occurring to that marquis be at hand raised in bed implored pity protection la motte stood looking eagerly at without replying wildness of look gloomy silence preserved increased alarm with tear of terror renewed supplication once saved from destruction cried o save now have pity upon have protector what be fear said la motte in tone scarcely articulate o save save from marquis rise then said dress quickly will be back again in few minute lighted candle stood on table left chamber adeline immediately arose endeavoured to dress thought be so bewildered that scarcely knew what did whole frame so violently agitated that be with utmost difficulty preserved from fainting threw clothes hastily on then sat down to await return of la motte considerable time elapsed yet did not appear having in vain endeavoured to compose spirit pain of suspense became at length so insupportable that opened door of chamber went to top of staircase to listen thought heard voice below considering that if marquis be there appearance must only increase danger checked step have almost involuntarily taken to descend still listened still thought distinguished voice soon after heard door shut then footstep hastened back to chamber near quarter of hour have elapsed la motte did not appear when again thought heard murmur of voice below also passing step at length anxiety not suffering to remain in room moved through passage communicated with spiral staircase be now still in few moment however light flashed across hall la motte appeared at door of vaulted room looked up seeing adeline in gallery beckoned to descend hesitated looked towards chamber la motte now approached stair with faltering step went to meet fear marquis may see said whispering where be la motte took hand led on assuring have nothing to fear from marquis wildness of look however trembling of hand seemed to contradict assurance inquired whether be leading to forest said la motte that may escape from abbey horse wait for without can save by other mean new terror seized must scarcely believe that la motte who have hitherto conspired with marquis have so closely confined must now undertake escape at moment felt dreadful presentiment be impossible to account for be leading out to murder in forest again shrinking back supplicated mercy assured meant only to protect desired must not waste time there be something in manner that spoke sincerity suffered to conduct to side door opened into forest where must just distinguish through gloom man on horseback brought to remembrance night in have quitted tomb when trusting to person who appeared have be carried to marquis villa la motte called be answered by peter whose voice somewhat reassured adeline then told that marquis must return to abbey on following morning that must be only opportunity of escaping design that might rely upon la motte word that peter have order to carry wherever choose a knew marquis must be indefatigable in search of advised by mean to leave kingdom might do with peter who be native of savoy must convey to house of sister there might remain till la motte who did not now think must be safe to continue much longer in france must join entreated might happen never to mention event have passed at abbey to save adeline have risked life increase danger own by unnecessary discovery may never meet again hope will be happy remember when think of that be not quite so bad a have be tempted to be having said gave money told must be necessary to defray expense of journey adeline must no longer doubt sincerity transport of joy gratitude must scarcely permit to thank wished to have bid madame la motte farewell indeed earnestly requested again told have time to lose having wrapped in large cloak lifted upon horse bade adieu with tear of gratitude peter set off a fast a darkness must permit when be got way be glad with heart mambeelle said to see again who must have thought after that master must have bid take away well to be sure strange thing come to pas hope will have better luck time adeline not choosing to reproach with treachery of feared have be formerly guilty thanked for good wish said hoped must be more fortunate peter in usual strain of eloquence proceeded to undeceive in point to acquaint with circumstance memory be naturally strong one must furnish peter expressed artless interest in welfare concern for disappointment that must no longer doubt faithfulness conviction not only strengthened confidence in present undertaking made listen to conversation with kindness pleasure must never have staid at abbey till time said if must have got away master frighted so much about marquis have not money enough to carry into own country so be forced to stay be well have got solid louis d'ors now for question mabeselle whether people on road must have taken trinket formerly talked of for money possibly not said adeline be thankful to monsieur la motte that have more certain mean of procuring convenience what route will take when leave forest peter peter mentioned very correctly great part of road to lyon then said can easily get to savoy will be nothing sister god bless hope be living have not seen many year if be not people will be glad to see will easily get lodging mabeselle thing want adeline resolved to go with to savoy la motte who knew character design of marquis have advised to leave kingdom have told what fear must have suggested that marquis must be indefatigable in search of motive for advice must be desire of serving why else when be already in power must remove to place even furnish with money for expense of journey at leloncourt where peter said be well known must be most likely to meet with protection comfort even must sister be dead distance solitary situation pleased reflection must have pointed out to prudence of proceeding to savoy have be le destitute of resource in france in present situation proved to be necessary inquired further concerning route be to take whether peter be sufficiently acquainted with road when once get to thiers know well enough said peter for have gone many time in younger day body will tell way there travelled for several hour in darkness silence be not till emerged from forest that adeline saw morning light streak eastern cloud sight cheered revived a travelled silently along mind revolved event of past night meditated plan for future present kindness of la motte appeared so very different from former conduct that astonished perplexed must only account for by attributing to one of sudden impulse of humanity sometimes operate even upon most depraved heart when recollected former word that be not master of must scarcely believe that mere pity must induce to break bond have hitherto so strongly held then considering altered conduct of marquis be inclined to think that owed liberty to change in sentiment towards yet advice la motte have given to quit kingdom money with have supplied for purpose seemed to contradict opinion involved again in doubt peter now got direction to thiers place reached without accident there stopped to refresh a soon a peter thought horse sufficiently rested again set forward from rich plain of lyonnois adeline for first time caught view of distant alp whose majestic head seeming to prop vault of heaven filled mind with sublime emotion in few hour reached vale in stand city of lyon whose beautiful environs studded with villa rich with cultivation withdrew adeline from melancholy contemplation of own circumstance more painful anxiety for theodore when reached that busy city first care be to inquire concerning passage of rhone forbore to make inquiry of people of inn considering that if marquis must trace thither might enable to pursue route therefore sent peter to quay to hire boat while took slight repast being intention to embark immediately peter presently returned having engaged boat men to take up rhone to nearest part of savoy from whence be to proceed by land to village of leloncourt having taken refreshment ordered to conduct to vessel new striking scene presented to adeline who looked with surprise upon river gay with vessel quay crowded with busy face felt contrast cheerful object around bore to herself to orphan desolate helpless flying from persecution country spoke with master of boat having sent peter back to inn for horse la motte gift to peter in lieu of arrears of wage embarked a slowly passed up rhone whose steep bank crowned with mountain exhibited most various wild romantic scenery adeline sat in pensive reverie novelty of scene through floated now frowning with savage grandeur now smiling in fertility gay with town village soothed mind sorrow gradually softened into gentle not unpleasing melancholy have seated at head of boat where watched side cleave swift stream listened to dashing of water boat slowly opposing current passed along for hour at length veil of evening be stretched over landscape weather be fine adeline regardless of dew now fell remained in open air observing object darken round gay tint of horizon fade away star gradually appear trembling upon lucid mirror of water scene be now sunk in deep shadow silence of hour be broken only by measured dashing of oar now then by voice of peter speaking to boatman adeline sat lost in thought forlornness of circumstance came heightened to imagination saw surrounded by darkness stillness of night in strange place far distant from friend going scarcely knew under guidance of stranger pursued perhaps by inveterate enemy pictured to herself rage of marquis now that have discovered flight though knew very unlikely must follow by water for reason have chosen that manner of travelling trembled at portrait fancy drew thought then wandered to plan must adopt after reaching savoy much a experience have prejudiced against manner of convent saw place more likely to afford proper asylum at length retired to little cabin for few hour repose awoke with dawn mind being too much disturbed to sleep again rose watched gradual approach of day a mused expressed feeling of moment in following sonnet morn beaming eye at length unclose wake blush of rose that night long oppress 'd with dew veil 'd in chilly shade hue reclined forlorn languid head sadly sought parent bed warmth from ray trembling flower derives sweetly blushing through tear revives morn beaming eye at length unclose melt tear bend rose can charm suppress sigh chase tear from sorrow eye can all lustrous light impart one ray of peace to sorrow heart ah fire fainting soul oppress eve pensive shade more soothe meek distress when adeline left abbey la motte have remained for time at gate listening to step of horse carried till sound be lost in distance then turned into hall with lightness of heart to have long be stranger satisfaction of having thus preserved a hoped from design of marquis overcame for while sense of danger in step must involve when returned entirely to own situation terror of marquis resentment struck full force upon mind considered how might best escape be now past midnight marquis be expected early on following day in interval at first appeared probable to that might quit forest there be only one horse considered whether must be best to set off immediately for auboine where carriage might be procured to convey family moveables from abbey quietly await arrival of marquis endeavour to impose upon by forged story of adeline escape time must elapse before carriage must reach abbey must leave scarcely sufficient to escape from forest what money have remaining from marquis bounty must not carry far when be expended must probably be at loss for subsistence must not before then be detected by remaining at abbey must appear that be unconscious of deserving marquis resentment though must not expect to impress belief upon that order have be executed might make appear that peter only have be accessary to escape of adeline account must seem more probable from peter having be formerly detected in similar scheme believed also that if marquis must threaten to deliver into hand of justice might save by menace of disclosing crime have commissioned to perpetrate thus arguing la motte resolved to remain at abbey await event of marquis disappointment when marquis did arrive be informed of adeline flight strong working of soul appeared in countenance for while alarmed terrified la motte cursed in term of such coarseness vehemence a la motte be astonished to hear from man whose manner be generally amiable might be violence criminality of passion to invent express term seemed to give not only relief delight yet appeared more shocked at circumstance of escape than exasperated at carelessness of la motte recollecting at length that wasted time left abbey dispatched several of servant in pursuit of when be gone la motte believing that story have succeeded returned to pleasure of considering that have done duty to hope that adeline be now beyond reach of pursuit calm be of short continuance in few hour marquis returned accompanied by officer of justice affrighted la motte perceiving approach endeavoured to conceal be seized carried to marquis who drew aside be not to be imposed upon said by superficial story a have invented know life be in hand tell instantly where have secreted adeline will charge with crime have committed against upon disclosing place of concealment will dismiss officer if wish assist to leave kingdom have time to hesitate may know will not be trifled with la motte attempted to appease marquis affirmed that adeline be really fled knew not whither will remember lord that character be also in power that if proceed to extremity will compel to reveal in face of day that must have made murderer who will believe said marquis crime banished from society will be testimony of veracity that with now charge will bring with sufficient presumption that accusation be malicious officer do duty then entered room seized la motte whom terror now deprived of power of resistance must resistance have availed in perturbation of mind informed marquis adeline have taken road to lyon discovery however be made too late to serve marquis seized advantage offered charge have be given with anguish of knowing that have exposed adeline to danger without benefiting la motte submitted in silence to fate scarcely allowing time to collect what little effect might easily be carried with officer conveyed from abbey marquis in consideration of extreme distress of madame la motte directed one of servant to procure carriage from auboine that might follow husband marquis in mean time now acquainted with route adeline have taken sent forward faithful valet to trace to place of concealment return immediately with intelligence to villa abandoned to despair la motte wife quitted forest of fontanville have for so many month afforded asylum embarked once more upon tumultuous world where justice must meet la motte in form of destruction have entered forest a refuge rendered necessary by former crime of la motte for sometime found in security sought other offence for even in sequestered spot there happened to be temptation soon succeeded life already sufficiently marked by punishment of vice now afforded instance of great truth where guilt be there peace can not enter chapter xvi hail awful scene calm troubled breast woo weary to profound repose beattie adeline meanwhile peter proceeded on voyage without accident landed in savoy where peter placed upon horse walked beside when came within sight of native mountain extravagant joy burst forth into frequent exclamation must often ask adeline if have ever seen such hill in france said hill there be very well for french hill be not to be named on same day with ours adeline lost in admiration of astonishing tremendous scenery around assented very warmly to truth of peter assertion encouraged to expatiate more largely upon advantage of country disadvantage totally forgot though gave away last sou to child of peasantry ran barefooted by side of horse spoke of nothing happiness content of inhabitant native village indeed be exception to general character of country to usual effect of arbitrary government be flourishing healthy happy advantage chiefly owed to activity attention of benevolent clergyman whose cure be adeline who now began to feel effect of long anxiety fatigue much wished to arrive at end of journey inquired impatiently of peter concerning spirit thus weakened gloomy grandeur of scene have so lately awakened emotion of delightful sublimity now awed into terror trembled at sound of torrent rolling among cliff thundering in vale below shrunk from view of precipice sometimes overhung road at others appeared beneath fatigued a be frequently dismounted to climb on foot steep flinty road feared to travel on horseback day be closing when drew near small village at foot of savoy alp sun in evening splendour now sinking behind summit threw farewell gleam athwart landscape so soft glowing a drew from adeline languid a be exclamation of rapture romantic situation of village next attracted notice stood at foot of several stupendous mountain formed chain round lake at little distance wood swept from summit almost embosomed village lake unruffled by lightest air reflected vermeil tint of horizon with sublime on border darkening instant with falling twilight when peter perceived village burst into shout of joy thank god said be near home there be dear native place look just a did twenty year ago there be same old tree growing round cottage yonder huge rock rise above poor father died there mabeselle pray heaven sister be alive be long while since saw adeline listened with melancholy pleasure to artless expression of peter who in retracing scene of former day seemed to live over again a approached village continued to point out various object of remembrance there too be good pastor chateau look mabeselle that white house with smoke curling stand

explain meaning a madame de la motte have omitted to mention circumstance of importance to be understood following be relation of occurrence have lately happened at paris may be remembered that on first day of trial la motte in passing from court to prison saw person whose feature though imperfectly seen through dusk thought recollected that same person after inquiring name of la motte desired to be admitted to on following day warder complied with request surprise of la motte may be imagined when in stronger light of apartment distinguished countenance of man from whose hand have formerly received adeline on observing madame de la motte in room said have something of consequence to impart desired to be left alone with prisoner when be gone told de la motte that understood be confined at suit of marquis de montalt la motte assented know for villain said stranger boldly case be desperate do wish for life need question be asked trial understand proceeds to morrow be now under confinement in place for debt if can obtain leave for to go with into court condition from judge that what reveal will not criminate will make discovery that will confound that same marquis will prove villain will then be judged how far word ought to be taken against la motte whose interest be now strongly excited desired must explain man proceeded to relate long history of misfortune consequent poverty have tempted to become subservient to scheme of marquis till suddenly checked said when obtain from court promise require will explain fully till then can not say more on subject la motte must not forbear expressing doubt of sincerity curiosity concerning motive have induced to become marquis accuser a to motive be very natural one replied man be easy matter to receive ill usage without resenting particularly from villain whom have served la motte for own sake endeavoured to check vehemence with be uttered care not who hears continued stranger at same time lowered voice repeat marquis have used ill have kept secret long enough doe not think while to secure silence must relieve necessity be in prison for debt have applied to for relief since doe not choose to give let take

must commission advocate to do in power to obtain leave for appearance on trial to procure necessary condition after further conversation parted chapter xxii drag forth legal monster into light wrench from hand oppression iron rod bid cruel feel pain give leave be at length granted for appearance of du bosse with promise that word must not criminate accompanied la motte into court confusion of marquis de montalt on perceiving man be observed by many person present particularly by la motte who drew from circumstance favourable presage for when du bosse be called upon informed court on night of twenty first of april in preceding year one jean d'aunoy man have known many year came to lodging after have discoursed for time on circumstance d'aunoy said knew way by du bosse might change poverty to rich that must not say more till be certain must be willing to follow distressed state in du bosse then be made anxious to learn mean must bring relief eagerly inquired what friend meant after time d'aunoy explained said be employed by nobleman who afterwards told du bosse be marquis de montalt to carry off young girl from convent that be to be taken to house few league distant from paris knew house described well said du bosse for have be there many time with d'aunoy who lived there to avoid creditor though often passed night at paris must not tell more of scheme said must want assistant if brother who be since dead must join employer must grudge money must be well rewarded desired again to tell more of plan be obstinate after have told must consider of what said speak to brother went away when called next night for answer brother agreed to engage accordingly went home with then told that young lady be to bring thither be natural daughter of marquis de montalt of nun belonging to convent of ursulines that wife have received child immediately on birth have be allowed handsome annuity to bring up a own have done till death child be then placed in convent designed for veil when be of age to receive vow have steadily persisted in refusing circumstance have so much exasperated marquis that in rage ordered that if persisted in obstinacy must be removed from convent got rid of way since if lived in world birth might be discovered in consequence of mother for whom have yet regard must be condemned to expiate crime by terrible death du bosse be interrupted in narrative by counsel of marquis who contended that circumstance alleged tending to criminate client proceeding be irrelevant illegal be answered that be not irrelevant therefore not illegal for that circumstance threw light upon character of marquis affected evidence against la motte du bosse be suffered to proceed d'aunoy then said that marquis have ordered to dispatch that a have be used to see from infancy must not find in heart to do wrote to tell so marquis then commanded to find who must be business for wanted brother be not so wicked a came to so told d'aunoy must not help asking why marquis resolved to murder own child rather than expose mother to risque of suffering death said marquis have never seen child that therefore must not be supposed felt much kindness towards still le that must love better than loved mother du bosse proceeded to relate how much brother have endeavoured to soften heart of d'aunoy towards marquis daughter that prevailed with to write again plead for d'aunoy went to paris to await answer leaving young girl at house on heath where former have consented to remain seemingly for purpose of executing order might receive really with design to save unhappy victim from sacrifice be probable that du bosse in instance gave false account of motive since if be really guilty of intention so atrocious a of murder must naturally endeavour to conceal however might be affirmed that on night of twenty sixth of april received order from d'aunoy for destruction of girl whom have afterwards delivered into hand of la motte la motte listened to relation in astonishment when knew that adeline be daughter of marquis remembered crime to have once devoted frame thrilled with horror now took up story added account of what have passed at abbey between

commanding officer to petition for respite till king further pleasure must be known founded plea on arrest of marquis showed letter have just received commanding officer readily granted reprieve louis who on arrival of letter have forborne to communicate content to theodore lest must torture with false hope now hastened to with comfortable news chapter xxiii low on funeral couch lie pitying heart

reanimated with hope invigorated by sense of importance of business before prepared to perform rapid journey of hundred mile theodore tenderly entreated that must so far consider health a to delay journey for few day with smile of enchanting tenderness assured that be now too happy to be ill that same cause must confirm happiness must confirm health so strong be effect of hope upon mind now that succeeded to misery of despair that overcame shock suffered on believing daughter of marquis other painful reflection did not even foresee obstacle circumstance might produce to union with theodore must at last be permitted to live be settled that must set off for paris in few hour with louis attended by peter hour be passed by la luc family in prison when time of departure arrived spirit of adeline again forsook illusion of joy disappeared no longer beheld theodore a one respited from death took leave of with mournful presentiment that must see more so strongly be presage impressed upon mind that be long before must summon resolution to bid farewell when have done so even left apartment returned to take of last look a be once more quitting room melancholy imagination represented theodore at place of execution pale convulsed in death again turned lingering eye upon fancy affected sense for thought a now gazed that countenance changed assumed ghastly hue resolution vanished such be anguish of heart that resolved to defer journey till morrow though must by mean lose protection of louis whose impatience to meet father must not suffer delay triumph of passion however be transient soothed by indulgence promised grief subsided reason resumed influence again saw necessity of immediate departure recollected sufficient resolution to submit la luc must have accompanied for purpose of again soliciting king in behalf of son have not extreme weakness lassitude to be reduced made travelling impracticable at length adeline with heavy heart quitted theodore notwithstanding entreaty that must not undertake journey in present weak state be accompanied by clara la luc to inn former parted from friend with many tear much anxiety for welfare under hope of soon meeting again must pardon be granted to theodore la luc designed to fetch adeline from paris must be refused be to return with peter bade adieu with father kindness repaid with filial affection in last word conjured to attend to recovery of health languid smile assumed seemed to express that solicitude be vain that thought health past recovery thus adeline quitted friend so justly dear to so lately found for paris where be stranger almost without protection compelled to meet father who have pursued with utmost cruelty in public court of justice carriage in leaving vaceau passed by prison threw eager look towards a passed heavy black wall narrow grated window seemed to frown upon hope theodore be there leaning from window continued to gaze upon till abrupt turning in street concealed from view then sunk back in carriage yielding to melancholy of heart wept in silence louis be not disposed to interrupt thought be anxiously employed on father situation traveller proceeded many mile without exchanging word at paris whither will now return search after jean d'aunoy be prosecuted without success house on heath described by du bosse be found uninhabited to place of usual resort in city where officer of police awaited no longer came even appeared doubtful whether be living for have absented from house of customary rendezvous sometime before trial of la motte be therefore certain that absence be not occasioned by thing have passed in court in solitude of confinement marquis de montalt have leisure to reflect on past to repent of crime reflection repentance formed a yet part of disposition turned with impatience from recollection produced only pain looked forward to future with endeavour to avert disgrace punishment saw impending elegance of manner have so effectually veiled depravity of heart that be favourite with sovereign on circumstance rested hope of security however severely repented that have indulged hasty spirit of revenge have urged to prosecution of la motte have thus unexpectedly involved in situation dangerous if not fatal since if adeline must not be found must be concluded guilty of death appearance of d'aunoy be circumstance most dreaded to oppose possibility of employed secret emissary to discover retreat to bribe to interest be however a unsuccessful in research a officer of police marquis at length began to hope that man be really dead la motte meanwhile awaited with trembling impatience arrival of son when must be relieved in degree from uncertainty concerning adeline on appearance rested only hope of life since evidence against must lose much of validity from confirmation must give of bad character of prosecutor if parliament even condemned motte clemency of king might yet operate in favour adeline arrived at paris after journey of several day during be chiefly supported by delicate attention of louis whom pitied esteemed though must not love be immediately visited at hotel by madame la motte meeting be affecting on side sense of past conduct excited in latter embarrassment delicacy goodness of adeline must willingly have spared pardon solicited be given with so much sincerity madame gradually became composed reassured forgiveness however must not have be thus easily granted have adeline believed former conduct be voluntary conviction of restraint terror under madame have acted alone induced to excuse past in first meeting forbore dwelling on particular subject madame la motte proposed that adeline must remove from hotel to lodging near chatelet adeline for whom residence at public hotel be very improper gladly accepted offer madame there gave circumstantial account of la motte situation concluded with saying that a sentence of husband have be suspended till certainty must be obtained

admitted so forcibly recalled to adeline mind situation of theodore that with difficulty supported to apartment of la motte when saw gleam of joy passed over countenance again relapsing into despondency looked mournfully at then at louis groaned deeply adeline in whom remembrance of former cruelty be lost in subsequent kindness expressed thankfulness for life have preserved anxiety to serve in warm repeated term gratitude evidently distressed instead of reconciling to seemed to awaken remembrance of guilty design have once assisted to strike pang of conscience deeper in heart endeavouring to conceal emotion entered on subject of present danger informed adeline what testimony must be required of on trial after above hour conversation with la motte returned to lodging of madame where languid ill withdrew to chamber tried to obliviate anxiety in sleep parliament conducted trial re assembled in few day after arrival of adeline two remaining witness of marquis on whom now rested cause against la motte appeared be led trembling into court where almost first object that met eye be marquis de montalt whom now beheld with emotion entirely new to be strongly tinctured with horror when du bosse saw immediately swore to identity testimony be confirmed by manner for on perceiving grew pale universal tremor seized jean d'aunoy must no where be found la motte be thus deprived of evidence essentially affected interest adeline when called upon gave little narrative with clearness precision peter who have conveyed from abbey supported testimony offered evidence produced be sufficient to criminate marquis of intention of murder in mind of most people present be not sufficient to affect testimony of two last witness who positively swore to commission of robbery to person of la motte on whom sentence of death be accordingly pronounced on receiving sentence unhappy criminal fainted compassion of assembly whose feeling have be unusually interested in decision be expressed in general groan attention be quickly called to new object be jean d'aunoy who now entered court evidence if must ever indeed have be mean of saving la motte came too late be reconducted to prison adeline who extremely shocked by sentence be much indisposed received order to remain in court during examination of d'aunoy man have be at length found in prison of provincial town where of creditor have thrown from even money marquis have remitted to for purpose of satisfying craving importunity of du bosse have be insufficient to release meanwhile revenge of latter have be roused against marquis by imaginary neglect money be designed to relieve necessity be spent by d'aunoy in riotous luxury be confronted with adeline with du bosse ordered to confess knew concerning mysterious affair to undergo torture d'aunoy who be ignorant how far suspicion concerning marquis extended who be conscious that own word might condemn remained for time obstinately silent when question be administered resolution gave way confessed crime of have not even be suspected appeared that in year d'aunoy together with one jaques martigny francis balliere have way laid seized henri

chamber in third week of confinement at abbey on hearing adeline grew faint remembered m have found together with extraordinary circumstance have attended discovery nerve thrilled with horror raising eye saw countenance of marquis overspread with livid paleness of guilt endeavoured however to arrest fleeting spirit while man proceeded in confession when murder be perpetrated d'aunoy have returned to employer who gave reward agreed upon in few month after delivered into hand infant daughter of late marquis whom conveyed to distant part of kingdom where assuming name of st pierre brought up a own child receiving from present marquis considerable annuity for secrecy adeline no longer able to struggle with tumult of emotion now rushed upon heart uttered deep sigh fainted away be carried from court when confusion occasioned by circumstance subsided jean d'aunoy went on related that on death of wife adeline be placed in convent from whence be afterwards removed to where marquis have destined to receive vow that determined rejection of have occasioned to resolve upon death that have accordingly be removed to house on heath d'aunoy added that by marquis order have misled du bosse with false story of birth having after time discovered that comrade have deceived concerning death d'aunoy separated from in enmity unanimously determined to conceal escape from marquis that might enjoy recompense of supposed crime month subsequent to period however d'aunoy received letter from marquis charging with truth promising large reward if must confess where have placed adeline in consequence of letter acknowledged that have be given into hand of stranger who be where lived be not known upon deposition philippe de montalt be committed to take trial for murder of henri brother d'aunoy be thrown into dungeon of chatelet du bosse be bound to appear a evidence feeling of marquis who in prosecution stimulated by revenge have thus unexpectedly exposed crime to public eye betrayed to justice can only be imagined passion have tempted to commission of crime so horrid a of murder what if possible heightened atrocity murder of one connected with by tie of blood by habit of even infantine association passion have stimulated to so monstrous deed be ambition love of pleasure first be more immediately gratified by title of brother latter by rich must enable to indulge voluptuous inclination late marquis de montalt father of adeline received from ancestor patrimony very inadequate to support splendour of rank have married heiress of illustrious family whose fortune amply supplied deficiency of own have misfortune to lose for be amiable beautiful soon after birth of daughter be then that present marquis formed diabolical design of destroying brother contrast of

render more striking by contrast general darkness of portrait have married lady who by death of brother inherited considerable estate of abbey of st clair villa on border of forest of fontanville be chief passion for magnificence dissipation however soon involved in difficulty pointed out to conveniency of possessing brother wealth brother infant daughter only stood between wish how removed father have be already related why did not employ same mean to secure child seems somewhat surprising unless admit that destiny hung over on occasion that be suffered to live a instrument to punish murderer of parent when retrospect be taken of vicissitude danger to have be exposed from earliest infancy appears a if preservation be effect of something more than human policy affords striking instance that justice however long delayed will overtake guilty while late unhappy marquis be suffering at abbey brother who to avoid suspicion remained in north of france delayed execution of horrid purpose from timidity natural to mind not yet inured to enormous guilt before dared to deliver final order waited to know whether story contrived to propagate of brother death must veil crime from suspicion succeeded too well for servant whose life have be spared that might relate tale naturally enough concluded that lord have be murdered by bandit peasant who few hour after found servant wounded bleeding bound to tree knew also that spot be infested by robber a naturally believed spread report accordingly from period marquis to whom abbey of st clair belonged in right of wife visited only twice that at distant time till after interval of several year accidentally found la motte inhabitant resided at paris on estate in north except once year usually passed month at delightful villa on border of forest in busy scene of court in dissipation of pleasure tried to lose remembrance of guilt there be time when voice of conscience must be heard though be soon again lost in tumult of world be probable that on night of abrupt departure from abbey solitary silence gloom of hour in place have be scene of former crime called up remembrance of brother with force too powerful for fancy awakened horror compelled to quit polluted spot if be so be however certain that spectre of conscience vanished with darkness for on following day returned to abbey though may be observed never attempted to pas night there though terror be roused for transient moment pity repentance succeeded since when discovery of adeline birth excited apprehension for own life did not hesitate to repeat crime must again have stained soul with human blood discovery be effected by mean of seal bearing arm of mother family be impressed on note servant have found have delivered to at caux may be remembered that having read note be throwing from in fury of jealousy that after examining again be carefully deposited in pocket book violent agitation suspicion of terrible truth occasioned deprived for awhile of power to act when be well enough to write dispatched letter to d'aunoy purport of have be already mentioned from d'aunoy received confirmation of fear knowing that life must pay forfeiture of crime must adeline ever obtain knowledge of birth not daring again to confide in secrecy of man who have once deceived resolved after deliberation on death immediately set out for abbey gave direction concerning terror for own safety still more than desire of retaining estate suggested a history of seal revealed birth of adeline be rather remarkable may not be amiss to mention that be stolen from marquis together with gold watch by jean d'aunoy watch be soon disposed of seal have be kept a pretty trinket by wife at death went with adeline among clothes to convent adeline have carefully preserved because have once belonged to woman whom believed to have be mother chapter xxiv while anxious doubt distracts tortured heart now return to course of narrative to adeline who be carried from court to lodging of madame de la motte madame be however at chatelet with husband suffering distress sentence pronounced against might be supposed to inflict feeble frame of adeline so long harassed by grief fatigue almost sunk under agitation discovery of birth excited feeling on occasion be too complex to be analysed from orphan subsisting on bounty of others without family with few friend pursued by cruel powerful enemy saw suddenly transformed to daughter of illustrious house heiress of immense wealth learned also that father have be murdered murdered in prime of day murdered by mean of brother against whom must now appear in punishing destroyer of parent doom uncle to death when remembered manuscript so singularly found considered that when wept to suffering described tear have flowed for of father emotion can not easily be imagined circumstance attending discovery of paper no longer appeared to be work of chance of power whose design be great just o father must exclaim last wish be fulfilled pitying heart wished might trace suffering will avenge on return of madame la motte adeline endeavoured a usual to suppress own emotion that might soothe affliction of friend related what have passed in court after departure of la motte thus excited even in sorrowful heart of madame momentary gleam of satisfaction adeline determined to recover if possible manuscript on inquiry learned that la motte in confusion of departure have left among other thing at abbey circumstance much distressed more so because believed appearance might be of importance on approaching trial determined however if must recover right to have manuscript sought for in evening louis joined mournful party came immediately from father whom left more tranquil than have be since fatal sentence be pronounced after silent melancholy supper separated for night adeline in solitude of chamber have leisure to meditate on discovery of eventful day suffering of dead father such a have read recorded by own hand pressed most forcibly to thought narrative have formerly so much affected heart interested imagination that memory now faithfully reflected particular
