good chance of pleasing young man who might afford to marry girl without shilling louisa perfectly entered into father scheme be determined to forward with care attention by dint of perseverance application have at length so thoroughly disguised natural disposition under mask of innocence softness a to impose upon one who have not by long constant intimacy with discovered real character such

uncertain unequal amusement be in least degree unpleasing to on contrary enjoy extremely must enjoy even more be not certain that appearance make in public rivetts chain of unhappy being whose passion be impossible not to pity tho be out of power to return in short dear charlotte be sensibility for suffering of so many amiable young men dislike of extreme admiration meet with aversion to being so celebrated in public in private in paper in printshops be reason why can not more fully enjoy amusement so various pleasing of london how often have wished that possessed a little personal beauty a do that figure be a inelegant face a unlovely appearance a unpleasing a yours ah what little chance be there of so desirable event have have small pox must therefore submit to unhappy fate be now going

time ala what delightful jewel will be decked in evening at lady flambeau yet wonder how can herself delight in wearing surely must be sensible of ridiculous impropriety of loading little diminutive figure with such superfluous ornament be possible that can not know how greatly superior elegant simplicity be to most studied apparel must present to matilda how greatly must be obliged to how becoming must diamond be on fine majestic figure how surprising be that such idea must never have occurred to be sure if have reflected in manner once have fifty time whenever see lady lesley dressed

man have indeed be confidently asserted that killed two nephew wife have also be declared that did not kill two nephew be inclined to beleive true if be case may also be affirmed that did not kill

only merit be not being quite so bad a daughter elizabeth th must be affront to reader be to suppose that be not a well acquainted with particular of king reign a be will therefore be saving task of reading again what have read before trouble of writing what perfectly recollect by giving only slight sketch of principal event marked reign among may be ranked cardinal wolseys telling father abbott of leicester abbey that be come to lay bone among reformation in religion king riding through street of london with anna bullen be however justice duty to declare that amiable woman be entirely innocent of crime with be accused of beauty elegance sprightliness be sufficient proof not to mention solemn protestation of innocence weakness of charge against king character of add confirmation tho perhaps slight one when in comparison with before alledged in favour tho profess giving many date yet a think proper to give will of course make choice of be most necessary for reader to know think right to inform that letter to king be dated on th of may crime cruelty of prince be too numerous to be mentioned a history trust have fully shown nothing can be said in vindication that abolishing religious house leaving to ruinous depredation of time have be of infinite use to landscape of england in general probably be principal motive for doing since otherwise why must man who be of religion be at so much trouble to abolish one have for age be established in kingdom majesty th wife be duke of norfolk neice who tho universally acquitted of crime for be beheaded have be by many people supposed to have led abandoned life before marriageof however have many doubt since be relation of noble duke of norfolk who be so warm in queen of scotland cause who at last fell victim to king last

by mean pretend to affirm that be equal to first of men robert earl of essex delamere gilpin be beheaded of might with reason have be proud have known that such be death of mary queen of scotland a be impossible that must be conscious of what have never happened doe not appear that felt particularly delighted with manner of after decease duke of northumberland have care of king kingdom performed trust of so well that king died kingdom be left to daughter in law lady jane grey who have be already mentioned a reading greek whether really understood language whether such study proceeded only from excess of vanity for beleive be always rather remarkable be uncertain might be cause preserved same appearance of knowledge contempt of what be generally esteemed pleasure during whole of life

being advanced to throne of england in spite of superior pretension merit beauty of cousin mary queen of scotland jane grey can pity kingdom for misfortune experienced during reign since fully deserved for having allowed to succeed brotherwhich be double peice of folly since might have foreseen that a died without child must be succeeded by disgrace to humanity that pest of society elizabeth many be people who fell martyr to protestant religion during reign suppose not fewer than dozen married philip king of spain who in sister reign be famous for building armada died without issue then dreadful moment came in destroyer of comfort deceitful betrayer of trust reposed in murderess of cousin succeeded to throne elizabeth be peculiar misfortune of woman to have bad ministerssince wicked a be must not have committed such extensive mischeif have not vile abandoned men connived at encouraged in crime know that have by many people be asserted beleived that lord burleigh sir francis walsingham rest of who filled cheif office of state be deserving experienced able minister oh how blinded such writer such reader must be to true merit to merit despised neglected defamed if can persist in such opinion when reflect that men boasted men be such scandal to country sex a to allow assist queen in confining for space of nineteen year woman who if claim of relationship merit be of avail yet a queen a one who condescended to place confidence in have reason to expect assistance protection at length in allowing elizabeth to bring amiable woman to untimely unmerited scandalous death can one if reflects for moment on blot everlasting blot upon understanding character allow praise to lord burleigh sir francis walsingham oh what must bewitching princess whose only freind be then duke of norfolk whose only one now mr whitaker mr lefroy mr knight who be abandoned by son confined by cousin abused reproached vilified by what must not most noble mind have suffered when informed that elizabeth have given order for death yet bore with most unshaken fortitude firm in mind constant in religion prepared to meet cruel fate to be doomed with magnanimity must alone proceed from conscious innocence yet must reader have beleived possible that hardened zealous protestant have even abused for steadfastness in catholic religion reflected on so much credit be striking proof of narrow soul prejudiced judgement who accuse be executed in great hall at fortheringay castle sacred place on wednesday th of february to everlasting reproach of elizabeth minister of england in general may not be unnecessary before entirely conclude account of ill fated queen to observe that have be accused of several crime during time of reigning in scotland of now most seriously

frederic delamere simile may be carried still farther elizabeth torment of essex may be compared to emmeline of delamere must be endless to recount misfortune of noble gallant earl be sufficient to say that be beheaded on th of feb after having be lord lieutenant of ireland after having clapped hand on sword after performing many other service to country elizabeth did not long survive loss died so miserable that be not injury to memory of mary must pity james st though king have fault among a most principal be allowing mother death yet considered on whole can not help liking married anne of denmark have several child fortunately for eldest son prince henry died before father might have experienced evil befell unfortunate brother a be partial to roman catholic religion be with infinite regret that be obliged to blame behaviour of member of yet truth being think very excusable in historian be necessitated to say that in reign roman catholic of england did not behave like gentleman to protestant behaviour indeed to royal family house of parliament might justly be considered by a very uncivil even sir henry percy tho certainly best bred man of party have none of general politeness be so universally pleasing a attention be entirely confined to lord mounteagle sir walter raleigh flourished in preceeding reign be by many people held in great veneration respectbut a be enemy of
