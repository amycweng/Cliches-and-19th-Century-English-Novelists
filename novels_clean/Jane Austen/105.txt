hearing of so often that became vain to attempt concealing longer even partially from daughter have given hint of last spring in town have gone so far even a to say can retrench doe occur to that there be one article in can retrench elizabeth to do justice have in first ardour of female alarm set seriously to think what must be done have finally proposed two branch of economy to cut off

to remove embarrassment reduce expenditure without involving loss of indulgence of taste pride chapter ii mr shepherd civil cautious lawyer who might be hold view on sir walter must rather have disagreeable prompted by anybody else excused from offering slightest hint only begged leave to recommend implicit reference to excellent judgement of lady russell from whose known good sense fully expected to have just such resolute measure advised a meant to see finally adopted lady russell be most anxiously zealous on subject gave much serious consideration be woman rather of sound than of quick ability whose difficulty in coming to decision in instance be great from opposition of two leading principle be of strict integrity with delicate sense of honour be a desirous of saving sir walter feeling a solicitous for credit of family a aristocratic in idea of what be due to a anybody of sense honesty must well be be benevolent charitable good woman capable of strong attachment most correct in conduct strict in notion of decorum with manner be held standard of good breeding have cultivated mind be generally speaking rational consistentbut have prejudice on side of ancestry have value for rank consequence blinded little to fault of who possessed widow of only knight gave dignity of baronet due sir walter independent of claim a old acquaintance attentive neighbour obliging landlord husband of very dear friend father of anne sister be a being sir walter in apprehension entitled to great deal of compassion consideration under present difficulty must retrench did not admit of doubt be very anxious to have done with least possible pain to elizabeth drew up plan of economy made exact calculation did what nobody else thought of doing consulted anne who never seemed considered by others a having interest in question consulted in degree be influenced by in marking out scheme of retrenchment be at last submitted to sir walter emendation of anne have be on side of honesty against importance wanted more vigorous measure more complete reformation quicker release from debt much higher tone of indifference for everything justice equity if can persuade father to said lady russell looking over paper much may be done if will adopt regulation in seven year will be clear hope may be able to convince elizabeth kellynch hall have respectability in can not be affected by reduction that true dignity of sir walter elliot will be very far from lessened in eye of sensible people by acting like man of principle what will be doing in fact what very many of first family have done ought to do there will be nothing singular in case be singularity often make worst part of suffering a always doe of conduct have great hope of prevailing must be serious decided for after person who have contracted debt must pay though great deal be due to feeling of gentleman head of house like father there be still more due to character of honest man be principle on anne wanted father to be proceeding friend to be urging considered a act of indispensable duty to clear away claim of creditor with expedition most comprehensive retrenchment must secure saw dignity in anything short of wanted to be prescribed felt a duty rated lady russell influence highly a to severe degree of self denial own conscience prompted believed there might be little more difficulty in persuading to complete than to half reformation knowledge of father elizabeth inclined to think that sacrifice of one pair of horse must be hardly le painful than of so on through whole list of lady russell too gentle reduction how anne more rigid requisition might have be taken be of little consequence lady russell have success at must not be put up with be not to be borne what comfort of life knocked off journey london servant horse tablecontractions restriction where to live no longer with decency even of private gentleman must sooner quit kellynch hall at once than remain in on such disgraceful term quit kellynch hint be immediately taken up by mr shepherd whose interest be involved in reality of sir walter retrenching who be perfectly persuaded that nothing must be done without change of abode since idea have be started in very quarter ought to dictate have scruple said in confessing judgement to be entirely on side did not appear to that sir walter must materially alter style of living in house have character of hospitality ancient dignity to support in other place sir walter might judge for must be looked up to a regulating mode of life in way might choose to model household sir walter must quit kellynch hall after very few day more of doubt indecision great question of whither must go be settled first outline of important change made out there have be three alternative london bath house in country anne wish have be for latter small house in own neighbourhood where might still have lady russell society still be near mary still have pleasure of sometimes seeing lawn grove of kellynch be object of ambition usual fate of anne attended in having something very opposite from inclination fixed on disliked bath did not think agreed with bath be to be home sir walter have at first thought more of london mr shepherd felt that must not be trusted in london have be skilful enough to dissuade from make bath preferred be much safer place for gentleman in predicament might there be important at comparatively little expense two material advantage of bath over london have of course be given weight more convenient distance from kellynch only fifty mile lady russell spending part of winter there to very great satisfaction of lady russell whose first view on projected change have be for bath sir walter elizabeth be induced to believe that must lose consequence enjoyment by settling there lady russell felt obliged to oppose dear anne known wish must be too much to expect sir walter to descend into small house in own neighbourhood anne must have found mortification of more than foresaw to sir walter feeling must have be dreadful with regard to anne dislike of bath considered a prejudice mistake arising first from circumstance of having be three year at school there after mother death secondly from happening to be not in perfectly good spirit only winter have afterwards spent there with lady russell be fond of bath in short disposed to think must suit a to young friend health by passing warm month with at kellynch lodge danger must be avoided be in fact change must do health spirit good anne have be too little from home too little seen spirit be not high larger society must improve wanted to be more known undesirableness of other house in same neighbourhood for sir walter be certainly much strengthened by one part very material part of scheme have be happily engrafted on beginning be not only to quit home to see in hand of others trial of fortitude stronger head than sir walter have found too much kellynch hall be to be let however be profound secret not to be breathed beyond own circle sir walter must not have borne degradation of being known to design letting house mr shepherd have once mentioned word advertise never dared approach again sir walter spurned idea of being offered in manner forbad slightest hint being dropped of having such intention be only on supposition of being spontaneously solicited by most unexceptionable applicant on own term a great favour that must let at how quick come reason for approving what like lady russell have excellent one at hand for being extremely glad that sir walter family be to remove from country elizabeth have be lately forming intimacy wished to see interrupted be with daughter of mr shepherd who have returned after unprosperous marriage to father house with additional burden of two child be clever young woman who understood art of pleasingthe art of pleasing at least at kellynch hall who have made so acceptable to miss elliot a to have be already staying there more than once in spite of lady russell who thought friendship quite out of place must hint of caution reserve lady russell indeed have scarcely influence with elizabeth seemed to love rather because must love than because elizabeth deserved have never received from more than outward attention nothing beyond observance of complaisance have never succeeded in point wanted to carry against previous inclination have be repeatedly very earnest in trying to get anne included in visit to london sensibly open to injustice discredit of selfish arrangement shut out on many lesser occasion have endeavoured to give elizabeth advantage of own better judgement experience always in vain elizabeth must go own way never have pursued in more decided opposition to lady russell than in selection of mr clay turning from society of so deserving sister to bestow affection confidence on one who ought to have be nothing to object of distant civility from situation mr clay be in lady russell estimate very unequal in character believed very dangerous companion removal must leave mr clay behind bring choice of more suitable intimate within miss elliots reach be therefore object of first rate importance chapter iii must take leave to observe sir walter said mr shepherd one morning at kellynch hall a laid down newspaper that present juncture be much in favour peace will be turning rich naval officer ashore will be wanting home must not be better time sir walter for having choice of tenant very responsible tenant many noble fortune have be made during war if rich admiral be to come in way sir walter must be very lucky man shepherd replied sir walter thats have to remark prize indeed must kellynch hall be to rather greatest prize of let have taken ever so many before hey shepherd mr shepherd laughed a knew must at wit then added presume to observe sir walter in way of business gentleman of navy be well to deal with have have little knowledge of method of doing business be free to confess that have very liberal notion be a likely to make desirable tenant a set of people one must meet with therefore sir walter what must take leave to suggest be that if in consequence of rumour getting abroad of intention must be contemplated a possible thing because know how difficult be to keep action design of one part of world from notice curiosity of other consequence have tax john shepherd might conceal family matter chose for nobody must think worth while to observe sir walter elliot have eye upon may be very difficult to elude therefore thus much venture upon that will not greatly surprise if with caution rumour of truth must get abroad in supposition of a be going to observe since application will unquestionably follow must think from wealthy naval commander particularly worth attending to beg leave to add two hour will bring over at time to save trouble of replying sir walter only nodded soon afterwards rising pacing room observed sarcastically there be few among gentleman of navy imagine who must not be surprised to find in house of description must look around doubt bless good fortune said mr clay for mr clay be present father have driven over nothing being of so much use to mr clay health a drive to kellynch quite agree with father in thinking sailor might be very desirable tenant have known good deal of profession besides liberality be so neat careful in way valuable picture of yours sir walter if chose to leave must be perfectly safe everything in about house must be taken such excellent care of garden shrubbery must be kept in almost a high order a be now need not be afraid miss elliot of own sweet flower garden being neglected a to rejoined sir walter coolly supposing be induced to let house have by mean made up mind a to privilege to be annexed to be not particularly disposed to favour tenant park must be open to of course few navy officer men of other description can have have range what restriction might impose on use of pleasure ground be thing be not fond of idea of shrubbery being always approachable must recommend miss elliot to be on guard with respect to flower garden be very little disposed to grant tenant of kellynch hall extraordinary favour assure be sailor soldier after short pause mr shepherd presumed to say in case there be established usage make everything plain easy between landlord tenant interest sir walter be in pretty safe hand depend upon for taking care that tenant have more than just right venture to hint sir walter elliot can not be half so jealous for own a john shepherd will be for here anne spoke navy think who have done so much for have at least equal claim with other set of men for comfort privilege home can give sailor work hard enough for comfort must allow very true very true what miss anne say be very true be mr shepherd rejoinder oh certainly be daughter sir walter remark be soon afterwards profession have utility must be sorry to see friend of mine belonging to indeed be reply with look of surprise yes be in two point offensive to have two strong ground of objection to first a being mean of bringing person of obscure birth into undue distinction raising men to honour father grandfather never dreamt of secondly a cut up man youth vigour most horribly sailor grows old sooner than other man have observed life man be in greater danger in navy of being insulted by rise of one whose father father might have disdained to speak to of becoming prematurely object of disgust than in other line one day last spring in town be in company with two men striking instance of what be talking of lord st ives whose father know to have be country curate without bread to eat be to give place to lord st ives certain admiral baldwin most deplorable looking personage can imagine face colour of mahogany rough rugged to last degree line wrinkle nine grey hair of side nothing dab of powder at top in name of heaven who be that old fellow said to friend of mine who be standing near sir basil morley old fellow cried sir basil be admiral baldwin what do take age to be sixty said perhaps sixty two forty replied sir basil forty more picture to yourselves amazement will not easily forget admiral baldwin never saw quite so wretched example of what sea faring life can do to degree know be same with be knocked about exposed to climate weather till be not fit to be seen be pity be not knocked on head at once before reach admiral baldwin age nay sir walter cried mr clay be being severe indeed have little mercy on poor men be not born to be handsome sea be beautifier certainly sailor do grow old betimes have observed soon lose look of youth then be not same with many other profession perhaps most other soldier in active service be not at better off even in quieter profession there be toil labour of mind if not of body seldom leaf man look to natural effect of time lawyer plod quite care physician be up at hour travelling in weather even clergyman stopt moment to consider what might do for clergymanand even clergyman know be obliged to go into infected room expose health look to injury of poisonous atmosphere in fact a have long be convinced though profession be necessary honourable in turn be only lot of who be not obliged to follow who can live in regular way in country choosing own hour following own pursuit living on own property without torment of trying for more be only lot say to hold blessing of health good appearance to utmost know other set of men what lose something of personableness when cease to be quite young seemed a if mr shepherd in anxiety to bespeak sir walter good will towards naval officer a tenant have be gifted with foresight for very first application for house be from admiral croft with whom shortly afterwards fell into company in attending quarter session at taunton indeed have received hint of admiral from london correspondent by report hastened over to kellynch to make admiral croft be native of somersetshire who having acquired very handsome fortune be wishing to settle in own country have come down to taunton in order to look at advertised place in immediate neighbourhood however have not suited that accidentally hearingit be just a have foretold mr shepherd observed sir walter concern must not be kept secretaccidentally hearing of possibility of kellynch hall being to let understanding mr shepherd connection with owner have introduced to in order to make particular inquiry have in course of pretty long conference expressed a strong inclination for place a man who knew only by description must feel given mr shepherd in explicit account of proof of being most responsible eligible tenant who be admiral croft be sir walter cold suspicious inquiry mr shepherd answered for being of gentleman family mentioned place anne after little pause followed added be rear admiral of white be in trafalgar action have be in east indie since be stationed there believe several year then take for granted observed sir walter that face be about a orange a cuff cape of livery mr shepherd hastened to assure that admiral croft be very hale hearty well looking man little weather beaten to be sure not much quite gentleman in notion behaviour not likely to make smallest difficulty about term only wanted comfortable home to get into a soon a possible knew must pay for convenience knew what rent ready furnished house of consequence might fetch must not have be surprised if sir walter have asked more have inquired about manor must be glad of deputation certainly made great point of said sometimes took out gun never killed quite gentleman mr shepherd be eloquent on subject pointing out circumstance of admiral family made peculiarly desirable a tenant be married man without child very state to be wished for house be never taken good care of mr shepherd observed without lady did not know whether furniture might not be in danger of suffering a much where there be lady a where there be many child lady without family be very best preserver of furniture in world have seen mr croft too be at taunton with admiral have be present almost time be talking matter over very well spoken genteel shrewd lady seemed to be continued asked more question about house term tax than admiral seemed more conversant with business moreover sir walter found be not quite unconnected in country more than husband be to say be sister to gentleman who did live amongst once told so sister to gentleman who lived few year back at monkford bless what be name at moment can not recollect name though have heard so lately penelope dear can help to name of gentleman who lived at monkford mr croft brother mr clay be talking so eagerly with miss elliot that did not hear appeal have conception whom can mean shepherd remember gentleman resident at monkford since time of old governor trent bless how very odd will forget own name soon suppose name be so very well acquainted with gentleman so well by sight seen hundred time came to consult once remember about trespass of one of neighbour farmer man breaking into orchard wall torn down apple stolen caught in fact afterwards contrary to judgement submitted to amicable compromise very odd indeed after waiting moment mean mr wentworth suppose said anne mr shepherd be gratitude wentworth be very name mr wentworth be very man have curacy of monkford know sir walter time back for two three year came there about year take remember be sure wentworth oh aymr wentworth curate of monkford misled by term gentleman thought be speaking of man of property mr wentworth be nobody remember quite unconnected nothing to do with strafford family one wonder how name of many of nobility become so common a mr shepherd perceived that connexion of croft did service with sir walter mentioned more returning with zeal to dwell on circumstance more indisputably in favour age number fortune high idea have formed of kellynch hall extreme solicitude for advantage of renting making appear a if ranked nothing beyond happiness of being tenant of sir walter elliot extraordinary taste certainly must have be supposed in secret of sir walter estimate of due of tenant succeeded however though sir walter must ever look with evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit house think infinitely too well off in being permitted to rent on highest term be talked into allowing mr shepherd to proceed in treaty authorising to wait on admiral croft who still remained at taunton fix day for house being seen sir walter be not very wise still have experience enough of world to feel that more unobjectionable tenant in essential than admiral croft bid fair to be must hardly offer so far went understanding vanity supplied little additional soothing in admiral situation in life be just high enough not too high have let house to admiral croft must sound extremely well very much better than to mere mr mr save perhaps half dozen in nation always need note of explanation admiral speaks own consequence at same time can never make baronet look small in dealing intercourse sir walter elliot must ever have precedence nothing must be done without reference to elizabeth inclination be growing so strong for removal that be happy to have fixed expedited by tenant at hand not word to suspend decision be uttered by mr shepherd be completely empowered to act sooner have end be reached than anne who have be most attentive listener to whole left room to seek comfort of cool air for flushed cheek a walked along favourite grove said with gentle sigh few month more perhaps may be walking here chapter iv be not mr wentworth former curate of monkford however suspicious appearance may be captain frederick wentworth brother who being made commander in consequence of action off st domingo not immediately employed have come into somersetshire in summer of having parent living found home for year at monkford be at time remarkably fine young man with great deal of intelligence spirit brilliancy anne extremely pretty girl with gentleness modesty taste feeling sum of attraction on side might have be enough for have nothing to do have hardly anybody to love encounter of such lavish recommendation must not fail be gradually acquainted when acquainted rapidly deeply in love must be difficult to say have seen highest perfection in other have be happiest in receiving declaration proposal in having accepted short period of exquisite felicity followed short one trouble soon arose sir walter on being applied to without actually withholding consent saying must never be gave negative of great astonishment great coldness great silence professed resolution of doing nothing for daughter thought very degrading alliance lady russell though with more tempered pardonable pride received a most unfortunate one anne elliot with claim of birth beauty mind to throw away at nineteen involve at nineteen in engagement with young man who have nothing to recommend hope of attaining affluence in chance of most uncertain profession connexion to secure even farther rise in profession must be indeed throwing away grieved to think of anne elliot so young known to so few to be snatched off by stranger without alliance fortune rather sunk by into state of most wearing anxious youth killing dependence must not be if by fair interference of friendship representation from one who have almost mother love mother right must be prevented captain wentworth have fortune have be lucky in profession spending freely what have come freely have realized nothing be confident that must soon be rich full of life ardour knew that must soon have ship soon be on station must lead to everything wanted have always be lucky knew must be so still such confidence powerful in own warmth bewitching in wit often expressed must have be enough for anne lady russell saw very differently sanguine temper fearlessness of mind operated very differently on saw in aggravation of evil only added dangerous character to be brilliant be headstrong lady russell have little taste for wit of anything approaching to imprudence horror deprecated connexion in light such opposition a feeling produced be more than anne must combat young gentle a be might yet have be possible to withstand father ill will though unsoftened by one kind word look on part of sister lady russell whom have always loved relied on must not with such steadiness of opinion such tenderness of manner be continually advising in vain be persuaded to believe engagement wrong thing indiscreet improper hardly capable of success not deserving be not merely selfish caution under acted in putting end to have not imagined consulting good even more than own must hardly have given up belief of being prudent self denying principally for advantage be chief consolation under misery of parting final parting consolation be required for have to encounter additional pain of opinion on side totally unconvinced unbending of feeling ill used by so forced relinquishment have left country in consequence few month have seen beginning end of acquaintance not with few month ended anne share of suffering from attachment regret have for long time clouded enjoyment of youth early loss of bloom spirit have be lasting effect more than seven year be gone since little history of sorrowful interest have reached close time have softened down much perhaps nearly of peculiar attachment to have be too dependent on time alone aid have be given in change of place except in one

thoroughly natural happy sufficient cure at time of life have be possible to nice tone of mind fastidiousness of taste in small limit of society around have be solicited when about two twenty to change name by young man who not long afterwards found more willing mind in younger sister lady russell have lamented refusal for charles be eldest son of man whose landed property general importance be second in country only to sir walter of good character appearance however lady russell might have asked yet for something more while anne be nineteen must have rejoiced to see at twenty two so respectably removed from partiality injustice of father house settled so permanently near in case anne have left nothing for advice to do though lady russell a satisfied a ever with own discretion never wished past undone began now to have anxiety border on hopelessness for anne being tempted by man of talent independence to enter state for held to be peculiarly fitted by warm affection

prosperous path have very soon after engagement ceased got employ that have told must follow have taken place have distinguished early gained other step in rank must now by successive capture have made handsome fortune have only navy list newspaper for authority must not doubt being rich in favour of constancy have reason to believe married how eloquent must anne elliot have be how eloquent at least be wish on side of early warm attachment cheerful confidence in futurity against over anxious caution seems to insult exertion distrust providence have be forced into prudence in youth learned romance a grew older natural sequel of unnatural beginning with circumstance recollection feeling must not hear that captain wentworths sister be likely to live at kellynch without revival of former pain many stroll many sigh be necessary to dispel agitation of idea often told be folly before must harden nerve sufficiently to feel continual discussion of croft business evil be assisted however by perfect indifference apparent unconsciousness among only three of own friend in secret of past seemed almost to deny recollection of must do justice to superiority of lady russell motif in over of father elizabeth must honour better feeling of calmness general air of oblivion among be highly important from sprung in event of admiral croft really taking kellynch hall rejoiced anew over conviction have always be most grateful to of past being known to three only among connexion by whom syllable believed must ever be whispered in trust among brother only with whom have be residing

knowledge of afterwards with support hoped that acquaintance between herself croft with lady russell still resident in kellynch mary fixed only three mile off must be anticipated need not involve particular awkwardness chapter v on morning appointed for admiral mr croft seeing kellynch hall anne found most natural to take almost daily walk to lady russell keep out of way till be over when found most natural to be sorry that have missed opportunity of seeing meeting of two party proved highly satisfactory decided whole business at once lady be previously well disposed for agreement saw nothing therefore good manner in other with regard to gentleman there be such hearty good humour open trusting liberality on admiral side a must not influence sir walter who have besides be flattered into very best most polished behaviour by mr shepherd assurance of being known by report to admiral a model of good breeding house ground furniture be approved croft be approved term time thing body be right mr shepherd clerk be set to work without there having be single preliminary difference to modify of that indenture sheweth sir walter without hesitation declared admiral to be best looking sailor have ever met with went so far a to say that if own man might have have arranging of hair must not be ashamed of being seen with where admiral with sympathetic cordiality observed to wife a

might convey to bath after christmas having engagement of own must take from kellynch for several week be unable to give full invitation wished anne though dreading possible heat of september in white glare of bath grieving to forego influence so sweet so sad of autumnal month in country did not think that everything considered wished to remain must be most right most wise therefore must involve least suffering to go with others something occurred however to give different duty mary often little unwell always thinking great deal of own complaint always in habit of claiming anne when anything be matter be indisposed foreseeing that must not have day health autumn entreated rather required for be hardly entreaty to come to uppercross cottage bear company a long a must want instead of going to bath can not possibly do without anne be mary reasoning elizabeth reply be then be sure anne have better stay for nobody will want in bath to be claimed a good though in improper style be at least better than being rejected a good at anne glad to be thought of use glad to have anything marked out a duty certainly not sorry to have scene of in country own dear country readily agreed to stay

infinitely more dangerous attraction than merely personal might have be anne be so impressed by degree of danger that must not excuse from trying to make perceptible to sister have little hope of success elizabeth who in event of reverse must be so much more to be pitied than must never thought have reason to reproach for giving warning spoke seemed only to offend elizabeth must not conceive how such absurd suspicion must occur to indignantly answered for party perfectly knowing situation mr clay said warmly never forgets who be a be rather better acquainted with sentiment than can be can assure that upon subject of marriage be particularly nice that reprobate inequality of condition rank more strongly than most people a to father really must not have thought that who have kept single so long for sake need be suspected now if mr clay be very beautiful woman grant might be wrong to have so much with not that anything in world be sure must induce father to make degrading match might be rendered unhappy poor mr clay who with merit can never have be reckoned tolerably pretty really think poor mr clay may be staying here in perfect safety one must imagine have never heard father speak of personal misfortune though know must fifty time that tooth of hers freckle freckle disgust so very much a do have known face not materially disfigured by few abominates must have heard notice mr clay freckle there be hardly personal defect replied anne agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to think very differently answered elizabeth shortly agreeable manner may set off handsome feature can never alter plain one however at rate a have great deal more at stake on point than anybody else can have think rather unnecessary in to be advising anne have done glad that be over not absolutely hopeless of doing good elizabeth though resenting suspicion might yet be made observant by last office of four carriage horse be to draw sir walter miss elliot mr clay to bath

that good humoured mutual affection of have known so little with of sister be received with great cordiality nothing seemed amiss on side of great house family be generally a anne very well knew least to blame half hour be chatted away pleasantly enough be not at surprised at end of to have walking party joined by miss musgroves at mary particular invitation chapter vi anne have not wanted visit to uppercross to learn that removal from one set of people to though at distance of only three mile will often include total change of conversation opinion idea have never be staying there before without being struck by without wishing that other elliots must have advantage in seeing how unknown unconsidered there be affair at kellynch hall be treated a of such general publicity pervading interest yet with experience believed must now submit to feel that lesson in art of knowing own nothingness beyond own circle be become necessary for for certainly coming a did with heart full of subject have be completely occupying house in kellynch for many week have expected rather more curiosity sympathy than found in separate very similar remark of mr mr musgrove so miss anne sir walter sister be gone what part of bath do think will settle in without much waiting for answer in young lady addition of hope will be in bath in winter remember papa if do go must be in good situation none of queen square for in anxious supplement from mary ofupon word will be pretty well off when be gone away to be happy at bath must only resolve to avoid such self delusion in future think with heightened gratitude of

with brother in law in child who loved nearly a well respected great deal more than mother have object of interest amusement wholesome exertion charles musgrove be civil agreeable in sense temper be undoubtedly superior to wife not of power conversation grace to make past a be connected together at dangerous contemplation though at same time anne must believe with lady russell that more equal match might have greatly improved that woman of real understanding might have given more consequence to character more usefulness rationality elegance to habit pursuit a be did nothing with much zeal sport time be otherwise trifled away without benefit from book anything else have very good spirit never seemed much affected by wife occasional lowness bore with unreasonableness sometimes to anne admiration upon whole though there be very often little disagreement in have sometimes more share than wished being appealed to by party might pas for happy couple be always perfectly agreed in want of more money strong inclination for handsome present from father here a on most topic have superiority for while mary thought great shame that present be not made always contended for father having many other us for money right to spend a liked a to management of child theory be much better than wife practice not so bad must manage very well if be not for mary interference be what anne often heard say have good deal of faith in when listening in turn to mary reproach of charles spoil child so can not get into order never have smallest temptation to say very true one of least agreeable circumstance of residence there be being treated with too much confidence by party being too much in secret of complaint of house known to have influence with sister be continually requested at least receiving hint to exert beyond what be practicable wish must persuade mary not to be always fancying ill be charles language in unhappy mood thus spoke mary do believe if charles be to see dying must not think there be anything matter with be sure anne if must might persuade really be very illa great deal worse than ever own mary declaration be hate sending child to great house though grandmamma be always wanting to see for humour indulges to such degree give so much trash sweet thing that be sure to come back sick cross for rest of day mr musgrove took first opportunity of being alone with anne to say oh miss anne can not help wishing mr charles have little of method with child be quite different creature with to be sure in general be so spoilt be pity can not put sister in way of managing be a fine healthy child a ever be seen poor little dear without partiality mr charles know more how must be treated bless how troublesome be sometimes assure miss anne prevents wishing to see at house so often a otherwise must believe mr charles be not quite pleased with not inviting oftener know be very bad to have child with one one be obligated to be checking moment dont do dont do that one can only keep in tolerable order by more cake than be good for have communication moreover from mary mr musgrove think servant so steady that must be high treason to call in question be sure without exaggeration that upper house maid laundry maid instead of being in business be gadding about village day long meet wherever go declare never go twice into nursery without seeing something of if jemima be not trustiest steadiest creature in world must be enough to spoil for tell be always tempting to take walk with on mr musgroves side be make rule of never interfering in of daughter in

be afraid of mentioning again be mary complaint mr musgrove be very apt not to give precedence be due when dined at great house with other family did not see reason why be to be considered so much at home a to lose place one day when anne be walking with only musgroves one of after talking of rank people of rank jealousy of rank said have scruple of observing to how nonsensical person be about place because world know how easy indifferent be about wish anybody must give mary hint that must be great deal better if be not so very tenacious especially if must not be always putting forward to take place of mamma nobody doubt right to have precedence of mamma must be more becoming in not to be always insisting on be not that mamma care about least in world know be taken notice of by many

be meant for sister benefit in other respect visit began proceeded very well own spirit improved by change of place subject by being removed three mile from kellynch mary ailment lessened by having constant companion daily intercourse with other family since there be superior affection confidence employment in cottage to be interrupted by be rather advantage be certainly carried nearly a far a possible for met morning hardly ever spent evening asunder believed must not have done so well without sight of mr mr musgroves respectable form in usual place without talking laughing singing of daughter played great deal better than of miss musgroves having voice knowledge of harp fond parent to sit by fancy delighted performance be little thought of only out of civility to refresh others a be well aware knew that when played be giving pleasure only to herself be new sensation excepting one short period of life have never since age of fourteen never since loss of dear mother known happiness of being listened to encouraged by just appreciation real taste in music have be always used to feel alone in world mr mr musgroves fond partiality for own daughter performance total indifference to other person gave much more pleasure for sake than mortification for own party at great house be sometimes increased by other company neighbourhood be not large musgroves be visited by everybody have more dinner party more caller more visitor by invitation by chance than other family be more completely popular girl be wild for dancing evening ended occasionally in unpremeditated little ball there be family of cousin within walk of uppercross in affluent circumstance who depended on musgroves for pleasure must come at time help play at anything dance anywhere anne very much preferring office of musician to more active post played country dance to by hour together kindness always recommended musical power to notice of mr mr musgrove more than anything else often drew complimentwell done miss anne very well done indeed lord bless how little finger of yours fly about so passed first three week michaelmas came now anne heart must be in kellynch again beloved home made over to others precious room furniture grove prospect beginning to own other eye other limb must not think of much else on th of september have sympathetic touch in evening from mary who on having occasion to note down day of month exclaimed dear be not day croft be to come to kellynch be glad did not think of before how low make croft took possession with true naval alertness be to be visited mary deplored necessity for nobody knew how much must suffer must put off a long a must be not easy till have talked charles into driving over on early day be in very animated comfortable state of imaginary agitation when came back anne have very sincerely rejoiced in there being mean of going wished however to see croft be glad to be within when visit be returned came master of house be not at home two sister be together a chanced that mr croft fell to share of anne while admiral sat by mary made very agreeable by good humoured notice of little boy be well able to watch for likeness if failed in feature to catch in voice in turn of sentiment expression mr croft though tall fat have squareness uprightness vigour of form gave importance to person have bright dark eye good teeth altogether agreeable face though reddened weather beaten complexion consequence of having be almost a much at sea a husband made seem to have lived year longer in world than real eight thirty manner be open easy decided like one who have distrust of herself doubt of what to do without approach to coarseness however want of good humour anne gave credit indeed for feeling of great consideration towards in related to kellynch pleased especially a have satisfied in very first half minute in instant even of introduction that there be not smallest symptom of knowledge suspicion on mr croft side to give bias of sort be quite easy on head consequently full of strength courage till for moment electrified by mr croft suddenly saying be not sister find that brother have pleasure of being acquainted with when be in country anne hoped have outlived age of blushing age of emotion certainly have not perhaps may not have heard that be married added mr croft must now answer a ought be happy to feel when mr croft next word explained to be mr wentworth of whom spoke that have said nothing might not do for brother immediately felt how reasonable be that mr croft must be thinking speaking of edward not of frederick with shame at own forgetfulness applied to knowledge of former neighbour present state with proper interest rest be tranquillity till just a be moving heard admiral say to mary be expecting brother of mr croft here soon dare say know by name be cut short by eager attack of little boy clinging to like old friend declaring must not go being too much engrossed by proposal of carrying away in coat pocket c to have moment for finishing recollecting what have begun anne be left to persuade a well a must that same brother must still be in question must not however reach degree of certainty a not to be anxious to hear whether anything have be said on subject at other house where croft have previously be calling folk of great house be to spend evening of day at cottage being now too late in year for such visit to be made on foot coach be beginning to be listened for when youngest miss musgrove walked in be coming to apologize that must have to spend evening by be first black idea mary be quite ready to be affronted when louisa made right by saying that only came on foot to leave more room for harp be bringing in carriage will tell reason added about be come on to give notice that papa mamma be out of spirit evening especially mamma be thinking so much of poor richard agreed must be best to have harp for seems to amuse more than piano forte will tell why be out of spirit when croft called morning called here afterwards did not happened to say that brother captain wentworth be just returned to england paid off something be coming to see almost directly most unluckily came into mamma head when be gone that wentworth something very like be name of poor richards captain at one time know when where great while before died poor fellow upon looking over letter thing found be so be perfectly sure that must be very man head be quite full of of poor richard so must be a merry a can that may not be dwelling upon such gloomy thing real circumstance of pathetic piece of family history be that musgroves have have ill fortune of very troublesome hopeless son good fortune to lose before reached twentieth year that have be sent to sea because be stupid unmanageable on shore that have be very little cared for at time by family though quite a much a deserved seldom heard of scarcely at regretted when intelligence of death abroad have worked way to uppercross two year before have in fact though sister be now doing must for by calling poor richard be nothing better than thick headed unfeeling unprofitable dick musgrove who have never done anything to entitle to more than abbreviation of name living dead have be several year at sea have in course of removal to midshipman be liable especially such midshipman a captain wish to get rid of be six month on board captain frederick wentworths frigate laconia from laconia have under influence of captain written only two letter father mother have ever received from during whole of absence be to say only two disinterested letter rest have be mere application for money in letter have spoken well of captain yet so little be in habit of attending to such matter so unobservant incurious be a to name of men ship that have made scarcely impression at time that mr musgrove must have be suddenly struck very day with recollection of name of wentworth a connected with son seemed one of extraordinary burst of mind do sometimes occur have gone to letter found all a supposed re perusal of letter after so long interval poor son gone for ever strength of fault forgotten have affected spirit exceedingly thrown into greater grief for than have known on first hearing of death mr musgrove be in lesser degree affected likewise when reached cottage be evidently in want first of being listened to anew on subject afterwards of relief cheerful companion must give to hear talking so much of captain wentworth repeating name so often puzzling over past year at last ascertaining that might that probably must turn out to be very same captain wentworth whom recollected meeting once twice after coming back from cliftona very fine young manbut must not say whether be seven eight year ago be new sort of trial to anne nerve found however that be one to must inure since actually be expected in country must teach to be insensible on such point not only did appear that be expected speedily musgroves in warm gratitude for kindness have shewn poor dick very high respect for character stamped a be by poor dick having be six month under care mentioning in strong though not perfectly well spelt praise a fine dashing felow only two perticular about schoolmaster be bent on introducing seeking acquaintance a soon a must hear of arrival resolution of doing so helped to form comfort of evening chapter vii very few day more captain wentworth be known to be at kellynch mr musgrove have called on come back warm in praise be engaged with croft to dine at uppercross by end of week have be great disappointment to mr musgrove to find that earlier day must be fixed so impatient be to shew gratitude by seeing captain wentworth under own roof welcoming to be strongest best in cellar week must pas only week in anne reckoning then supposed must meet soon began to wish that must feel secure even for week captain wentworth made very early return to mr musgroves civility be calling there in same half hour mary be actually setting forward for great house where a afterwards learnt must inevitably have found when be stopped by eldest boy being at moment brought home in consequence of bad fall child situation put visit entirely aside must not hear of escape with indifference even in midst of serious anxiety afterwards felt on account collar bone be found to be dislocated such injury received in back a roused most alarming idea be afternoon of distress anne have thing to do at once apothecary to send for father to have pursued informed mother to support keep from hysteric servant to control youngest child to banish poor suffering one to attend soothe besides sending a soon a recollected proper notice to other house brought accession rather of frightened enquiring companion than of very useful assistant brother return be first comfort must take best care of wife second blessing be arrival of apothecary till came have examined child apprehension be worse for being vague suspected great injury knew not where now collar bone be soon replaced though mr robinson felt felt rubbed looked grave spoke low word to father aunt still be to hope best to be able to part eat dinner in tolerable ease of mind then be just before parted that two young aunt be able so far to digress from nephew state a to give information of captain wentworths visit staying five minute behind father mother to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted be with how much handsomer how infinitely more agreeable thought than individual among male acquaintance who have be at favourite before how glad have be to hear papa invite to stay dinner how sorry when said be quite out of power how glad again when have promised in reply to papa mamma farther pressing invitation to come dine with on morrowactually on morrow have promised in so pleasant manner a if felt motive of attention just a ought in short have looked said everything with such exquisite grace that must assure head be turned by off ran quite a full of glee a of love apparently more full of captain wentworth than of little charles same story same rapture be repeated when two girl came with father through gloom of evening to make enquiry mr musgrove no longer under first uneasiness about heir must add confirmation praise hope there must be now occasion for putting captain wentworth off only be sorry to think that cottage party probably must not like to leave little boy to give meeting oh a to leaving little boy father mother be in much too strong recent alarm to bear thought anne in joy of escape must not help adding warm protestation to theirs charles musgrove indeed afterwards shewed more of inclination child be going on so well wished so much to be introduced to captain wentworth that perhaps might join in evening must not dine from home might walk in for hour in be eagerly opposed by wife with oh indeed charles can not bear to have go away only think if anything must happen child have good night be going on well next day must be work of time to ascertain that injury have be done to spine mr robinson found nothing to increase alarm charles musgrove began consequently to feel necessity for longer confinement child be to be kept in bed amused a quietly a possible what be there for father to do be quite female case must be highly absurd in who must be of use at home to shut up father very much wished to meet captain wentworth there being sufficient reason against ought to go ended in making bold public declaration when came in from shooting of meaning to dress directly dine at other house nothing can be going on better than child said so told father just now that must come thought quite right sister being with love have scruple at must not like to leave see can be of use anne will send for if anything be matter husband wife generally understand when opposition will be vain mary knew from charles manner of speaking that be quite determined on going that must be of use to teaze said nothing therefore till be out of room a soon a there be only anne to hear so be to be left to shift by with poor sick child not creature coming near evening knew how must be be always luck if there be anything disagreeable going on men be always sure to get out of charles be a bad a of very unfeeling must say be very unfeeling of to be running away from poor little boy talk of being going on so well how doe know that be going on well that there may not be sudden change hour hence did not think charles must have be so unfeeling so here be to go away enjoy because be poor mother be not to be allowed to stir yet be sure be more unfit than anybody else to be about child being mother be very reason why feeling must not be tried be not at equal to saw how hysterical be yesterday be only effect of suddenness of alarmof shock will not be hysterical again dare say will have nothing to distress perfectly understand mr robinson direction have fear indeed mary can not wonder at husband nursing doe not belong to man be not province sick child be always mother property own feeling generally make so hope be a fond of child a mother know that be of more use in sick room than charles for can not be always scolding teazing poor child when be ill saw morning that if told to keep quiet be sure to begin kicking about have not nerve for sort of thing must be comfortable to be spending whole evening away from poor boy yes see papa can why must not jemima be so careful must send word hour how be really think charles might a well have told father must come be not more alarmed about little charles now than be be dreadfully alarmed yesterday case be very different to day well if think too late to give notice for suppose be to go a well a husband leave little charles to care mr mr musgrove can not think wrong while remain with be serious cried mary eye brightening dear thats very good thought very good indeed to be sure may just a well go a not for be of use at homeam only harasses who have not mother feeling be great deal properest person can make little charles do anything always mind at word will be great deal better than leaving only with jemima oh will certainly go be sure ought if can quite a much a charles for want excessively to be acquainted with captain wentworth know mind being left alone excellent thought of yours indeed anne will go tell charles get ready directly can send for know at moment notice if anything be matter dare say there will be nothing to alarm must not go may be sure if did not feel quite at ease about dear child next moment be tapping at husband dressing room door a anne followed up stair be in time for whole conversation began with mary saying in tone of great exultation mean to go with charles for be of more use at home than be if be to shut up for ever with child must not be able to persuade to do anything did not like anne will stay anne undertakes to stay at home take care of be anne own proposal so will go with will be great deal better for have not dined at other house since tuesday be very kind of anne be husband answer must be very glad to have go seems rather hard that must be left at home by to nurse sick child anne be now at hand to take up own cause sincerity of manner being soon sufficient to convince where conviction be at least very agreeable have farther scruple a to being left to dine alone though still wanted to join in evening when child might be at rest for night kindly urged to let come fetch be quite unpersuadable being case have ere long pleasure of seeing set off together in high spirit be gone hoped to be happy however oddly constructed such happiness might seem a for herself be left with a many sensation of comfort a be perhaps ever likely to be hers knew to be of first utility to child what be to if frederick wentworth be only mile distant making agreeable to others must have liked to know how felt a to meeting perhaps indifferent if indifference must exist under such circumstance must be indifferent unwilling have wished ever to see again need not have waited till time must have done what must not believe that in place must have done long ago when event have be early giving independence alone have be wanting brother sister came back delighted with new acquaintance visit in general there have be music singing talking laughing be most agreeable charming manner in captain wentworth shyness reserve seemed to know other perfectly be coming very next morning to shoot with charles be to come to breakfast not at cottage though have be proposed at first then have be pressed to come to great house instead seemed afraid of being in mr charles musgroves way on account of child therefore somehow hardly knew how ended in charles being to meet to breakfast at father anne understood wished to avoid seeing have inquired after found slightly a might suit former slight acquaintance seeming to acknowledge such a have acknowledged actuated perhaps by same view of escaping introduction when be to meet morning hour of cottage be always later than of other house on morrow difference be so great that mary anne be not more than beginning breakfast when charles came in to say that be just setting off that be come for dog that sister be following with captain wentworth sister meaning to visit mary child captain wentworth proposing also to wait on for few minute if not inconvenient though charles have answered for child being in such state a must make inconvenient captain wentworth must not be satisfied without running on to give notice mary very much gratified by attention be delighted to receive while thousand feeling rushed on anne of be most consoling that must soon be over be soon over in two minute after charles preparation others appeared be in drawing room eye half met captain wentworths bow curtsey passed heard voice talked to mary said be right said something to miss musgroves enough to mark easy footing room seemed full full of person voice few minute ended charles shewed at window be ready visitor have bowed be gone miss musgroves be gone too suddenly resolving to walk to end of village with sportsman room be cleared anne might finish breakfast a must be over be over repeated to herself again again in nervous gratitude worst be over mary talked must not attend have seen have met have be once more in same room soon however began to reason with herself try to be feeling le eight year almost eight year have passed since have be given up how absurd to be resuming agitation interval have banished into distance indistinctness what might not eight year do event of description change alienation removalsall must be comprised in oblivion of past how natural how certain too included nearly third part of own life ala with reasoning found that to retentive feeling eight year may be little more than nothing now how be sentiment to be read be like wishing to avoid next moment be hating for folly asked question on one other question perhaps utmost wisdom might not have prevented be soon spared suspense for after miss musgroves have returned finished visit at cottage have spontaneous information from mary captain wentworth be not very gallant by anne though be so attentive to henrietta asked what thought of when went away said be so altered must not have known again mary have feeling to make respect sister in common way be perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting peculiar wound altered beyond knowledge anne fully submitted in silent deep mortification doubtless be so must take revenge for be not altered not for worse have already acknowledged to herself must not think differently let think of a must no year have destroyed youth bloom have only given more glowing manly open look in respect lessening personal advantage have seen same frederick wentworth so altered that must not have known again be word must not dwell with yet soon began to rejoice that have

ill at gibraltar with recommendation from former captain to captain wentworth oh charles tell captain wentworth need not be afraid of mentioning poor dick before for must be rather pleasure to hear talked of by such good friend charles being somewhat more mindful of probability of case only nodded in reply walked away girl be now hunting for laconia captain wentworth must not deny pleasure of taking precious volume into own hand to save trouble once more read aloud little statement of name rate present non commissioned class observing over that too have be one of best friend man ever have ah be pleasant day when have laconia how fast made money in friend of mine have lovely cruise together off western island poor harville sister know how much wanted money worse than have wife excellent

never left assure captain wentworth be very sorry ever left there be momentary expression in captain wentworths face at speech certain glance of bright eye curl of handsome mouth convinced anne instead of sharing in mr musgroves kind wish a to son have probably be at pain to get rid of be too transient indulgence of self amusement to be detected by who understood le than in moment be perfectly collected serious almost instantly afterwards coming up to sofa on mr musgrove be sitting took place by latter entered into conversation with in low voice about son doing with so much sympathy natural grace a shewed kindest consideration for be real unabsurd in parent feeling be actually on same sofa for mr musgrove have most readily made room for be divided only by mr musgrove be insignificant barrier indeed mr musgrove be of comfortable substantial size infinitely more fitted by nature to express good cheer good humour than tenderness sentiment while agitation of anne slender form pensive face may be considered a very completely screened captain wentworth must be allowed credit for self command with attended to large fat sighings over destiny of son whom alive nobody have cared for personal size mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportion large bulky figure have a good right to be in deep affliction a most graceful set of limb in world fair not fair there be unbecoming conjunction reason will patronize in vainwhich taste can not toleratewhich ridicule will seize admiral after taking two three refreshing turn about room with hand behind being called to order by wife now came up to captain wentworth without observation of what might be interrupting thinking only of own thought began with if have be week later at lisbon last spring frederick must have be asked to give passage to lady mary grierson daughter must be glad be not week later then admiral abused for want of gallantry defended though professing that must never willingly admit lady on board ship of excepting for ball visit few hour might comprehend if know myself said be from want of gallantry towards be rather from feeling how impossible be with one effort one sacrifice to make accommodation on board such a woman ought to have there can be want of gallantry admiral in rating claim of woman to personal comfort high be do hate to hear of woman on board to see on board ship under command will ever convey family of lady anywhere if can help brought sister upon oh frederick can not believe of youall idle refinementwomen may be a comfortable on board a in best house in england believe have lived a much on board a most woman know nothing superior to accommodation of man of war declare have not comfort indulgence about even at kellynch hall with kind bow to anne

harvilles from world end if wanted imagine did not feel evil in depend upon be perfectly comfortable might not like better for perhaps number of woman child have right to be comfortable on board dear frederick be talking quite idly pray what must become of poor sailor wife who often want to be conveyed to one port after husband if everybody have feeling feeling see did not prevent taking mr harville family to plymouth hate to hear talking so like fine gentleman a if woman be fine lady instead of rational creature none of expect to be in smooth water day ah dear said admiral when have got wife will sing different tune when be married if have good luck to live to war will see do a great many others have done will have very thankful to anybody will bring wife ay that will now have done

back again only once besides being in different place about home cork lisbon gibraltar never went beyond streights never be in west indie call bermuda bahama know west indie mr musgrove have not word to say in dissent must not accuse herself of having ever called anything in whole course of life do assure maam pursued mr croft that nothing can exceed accommodation of man of war speak know of higher rate when come to frigate of course be more confined though reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of can safely say that happiest part of life have be spent on board ship while be together know there be nothing to be feared thank god have always be blessed with excellent health climate disagrees with little disordered always first twenty four hour of going to sea never knew what sickness be afterwards only time ever really suffered in body mind only time that ever fancied unwell have idea of danger be winter passed by at deal when admiral captain croft then be in north sea lived in perpetual fright at time have manner of imaginary complaint from not knowing what to do with when must hear from next a long a must be together nothing ever ailed never met with smallest inconvenience aye to be sure yes indeed oh yes be quite of opinion mr croft be mr musgroves hearty answer there be nothing so bad a separation be quite of opinion know what be for mr musgrove always attends assize be so glad when be over be safe back again evening ended with dancing on being proposed anne offered service a usual though eye must sometimes fill with tear a sat at instrument be extremely glad to be employed desired nothing in return to be unobserved be merry joyous party one seemed in higher spirit than captain wentworth felt that have thing to elevate general attention deference especially attention of young woman must do miss hayters female of family of cousin already mentioned be apparently admitted to honour of being in love with a for henrietta louisa seemed so entirely occupied by that nothing continued appearance of most perfect good will between must have made credible that be not decided rival if be little spoilt by such universal such eager admiration who must wonder be of thought occupied anne while finger be mechanically at work proceeding for hour together equally without error without consciousness once felt that be looking at observing altered feature perhaps trying to trace in ruin of face have once charmed once knew that must have spoken of be hardly aware of till heard answer then be sure of having asked partner whether miss elliot never danced answer be oh never have quite given up dancing have rather play be never tired of playing once too spoke to have left instrument on dancing being over have sat down to try to make out air wished to give miss musgroves idea of unintentionally returned to part of room saw instantly rising said with studied politeness beg pardon madam be seat though immediately drew back with decided negative be not to be induced to sit down again anne did not wish for more of such look speech cold politeness ceremonious grace be worse than anything chapter ix captain wentworth be come to kellynch a to home to stay a long a liked being a thoroughly object of admiral fraternal kindness a of wife have intended on first arriving to proceed very soon into shropshire visit brother settled in country attraction of uppercross induced to put off there be so much of friendliness of flattery of everything most bewitching in reception there old be so hospitable young so agreeable that must not resolve to remain where be take charm perfection of edward wife upon credit little longer be soon uppercross with almost day musgroves must hardly be more ready to invite than to come particularly in morning when have companion at home for admiral mr croft be generally out of door together interesting in new possession grass sheep dawdling about in way not endurable to third person driving out in gig lately added to establishment hitherto there have be one opinion of captain wentworth among musgroves dependency be unvarying warm admiration everywhere intimate footing be not more than established when certain charles hayter returned among to be good deal disturbed by to think captain wentworth very much in way charles hayter be eldest of cousin very amiable pleasing young man between whom henrietta there have be considerable appearance of attachment previous to captain wentworths introduction be in order having curacy in neighbourhood where residence be not required lived at father house only two mile from uppercross short absence from home have left fair one unguarded by attention at critical period when came back have pain of finding very altered manner of seeing captain wentworth mr musgrove mr hayter be sister have have money marriage have made material difference in degree of consequence mr hayter have property of own be insignificant compared with mr musgroves while musgroves be in first class of society in country young hayters must from parent inferior retired unpolished way of living own defective education have be hardly in class at for connexion with uppercross eldest son of course excepted who have chosen to be scholar gentleman who be very superior in cultivation manner to rest two family have always be on excellent term there being pride on one side envy on other only such consciousness of superiority in miss musgroves a made pleased to improve cousin charles attention to henrietta have be observed by father mother without disapprobation must not be great match for if henrietta liked himand henrietta did seem to like henrietta fully thought so before captain wentworth came from time cousin charles have be very much forgotten of two sister be preferred by captain wentworth be a yet quite doubtful a far a anne observation reached henrietta be perhaps prettiest louisa have higher spirit knew not now whether more gentle more lively character be most likely to attract mr mr musgrove from seeing little from entire confidence in discretion of daughter of young men who came near seemed to leave everything to take chance there be not smallest appearance of solicitude remark about in mansion house be different at cottage young couple there be more disposed to speculate wonder captain wentworth have not be above four five time in miss musgroves company charles hayter have just reappeared when anne have to listen to opinion of brother sister a to be one liked best charles gave for louisa mary for henrietta quite agreeing that to have marry must be extremely delightful charles have never seen pleasanter man in life from what have once heard captain wentworth say be very sure that have not made le than twenty thousand pound by war here be fortune at once besides there must be chance of what might be done in future war be sure captain wentworth be a likely man to distinguish a officer in navy oh must be capital match for of sister upon word must replied mary dear if must rise to very great honour if must ever be made baronet lady wentworth sound very well must be noble thing indeed for henrietta must take place of then henrietta must not dislike that sir frederick lady wentworth must be new creation however never think much of new creation suited mary best to think one preferred on very account of charles hayter whose pretension wished to see put end to looked down very decidedly upon hayters thought must be quite misfortune to have existing connection between family renewedvery sad for herself child know said can not think at fit match for henrietta considering alliance musgroves have made have right to throw away think young woman have right to make choice may be disagreeable inconvenient to principal part of family be giving bad connection to who have not be used to pray who be charles hayter nothing country curate most improper match for miss musgrove of uppercross husband however must not agree with here for besides having regard for cousin charles hayter be eldest son saw thing a eldest son now be talking nonsense mary be therefore answer must not be great match for henrietta charles have very fair chance through spicers of getting something from bishop in course of year two will please to remember that be eldest son whenever uncle dy step into very pretty property estate at winthrop be not le than two hundred fifty acre besides farm near taunton be of best land in country grant that of charles must be very shocking match for henrietta indeed must not be be only one must be possible be very good natured good sort of fellow whenever winthrop come into hand will make different sort of place of live in very different sort of way with property will never be contemptible mangood freehold property henrietta might do worse than marry charles hayter if have louisa can get captain wentworth will be very well satisfied charles may say what plea cried mary to anne a soon a be out of room must be shocking to have henrietta marry charles hayter very bad thing for still worse for therefore be very much to be wished that captain wentworth may soon put quite out of head have very little doubt that have took hardly notice of charles hayter yesterday wish have be there to see behaviour a to captain wentworths liking louisa a well a henrietta be nonsense to say so for certainly doe like henrietta great deal best charles be so positive wish have be with yesterday for then might have decided between be sure must have thought a did unless have be determined to give against dinner at mr musgroves have be occasion when thing must have be seen by anne have staid at home under mixed plea of headache of own return of indisposition in little charles have thought only of avoiding captain wentworth escape from being appealed to a umpire be now added to advantage of quiet evening a to captain wentworths view deemed of more consequence that must know own mind early enough not to be endangering happiness of sister impeaching own honour than that must prefer henrietta to louisa louisa to henrietta of must in probability make affectionate good humoured wife with regard to charles hayter have delicacy must be pained by lightness of conduct in well meaning young woman heart to sympathize in of suffering occasioned if henrietta found mistaken in nature of feeling alteration must not be understood too soon charles hayter have met with much to disquiet mortify in cousin behaviour have too old regard for to be so wholly estranged a might in two meeting extinguish past hope leave nothing to do to keep away from uppercross there be such change a became very alarming when man a captain wentworth be to be regarded a probable cause have be absent only two sunday when parted have left interested even to height of wish in prospect of soon quitting present curacy obtaining that of uppercross instead have then seemed object nearest heart that dr shirley rector who for more than forty year have be zealously discharging duty of office be now growing too infirm for many of must be quite fixed on engaging curate must make curacy quite a good a must afford must give charles hayter promise of advantage of having to come only to uppercross instead of going six mile way of having in respect better curacy of belonging to dear dr shirley of dear good dr shirleys being relieved from duty must no longer get through without most injurious fatigue have be great deal even to louisa have be almost everything to henrietta when came back ala zeal of business be gone by louisa must not listen at to account of conversation have just held with dr shirley be at window looking out for captain wentworth even henrietta have at best only divided attention to give seemed to have forgotten former doubt solicitude of negotiation well be very glad indeed always thought must have always thought sure did not appear to thatin short know dr shirley must have curate have secured promise be coming louisa one morning very soon after dinner at musgroves at anne have not be present captain wentworth walked into drawing room at cottage where be only little invalid charles who be lying on sofa surprise of finding almost alone with anne elliot deprived manner of usual composure started must only say thought miss musgroves have be here mr musgrove told must find here before walked to window to recollect feel how ought to behave be up stair with sister will be down in few moment dare say have be anne reply in confusion be natural if child have not called to come do something for must have be out of room next moment released captain wentworth a well a herself continued at window after calmly politely saying hope little boy be better be silent be obliged to kneel down by sofa remain there to satisfy patient thus continued few minute when to very great satisfaction heard other person crossing little vestibule hoped on turning head to see master of house proved to be one much le calculated for making matter easycharles hayter probably not at better pleased by sight of captain wentworth than captain wentworth have be by sight of anne only attempted to say how do do will not sit down others will be here presently captain wentworth however came from window apparently not ill disposed for conversation charles hayter soon put end to attempt by seating near table taking up newspaper captain wentworth returned to window minute brought addition younger boy remarkable stout forward child of two year old having got door opened for by one without made determined appearance among went straight to sofa to see what be going on put in claim to anything good might be giving away there being nothing to eat must only have play a aunt must not let tease sick brother began to fasten upon a knelt in such way busy a be about charles must not shake off spoke to ordered entreated insisted in vain once did contrive to push away boy have greater pleasure in getting upon back again directly walter said get down moment be extremely troublesome be very angry with walter cried charles hayter why do not do a be bid hear aunt speak come to walter come to cousin charles not bit did walter stir in moment however found in state of being released from one be taking from though have bent down head so much that little sturdy hand be unfastened from around neck be resolutely borne away before knew that captain wentworth have done sensation on discovery made perfectly speechless must not even thank must only hang over little charles with most disordered feeling kindness in stepping forward to relief manner silence in have passed little particular of circumstance with conviction soon forced on by noise be studiously making with child that meant to avoid hearing thanks rather sought to testify that conversation be last of want produced confusion of varying very painful agitation a must not recover from till enabled by entrance of mary miss musgroves to make over little patient to care leave room must not stay might have be opportunity of watching love jealousy of fourthey be now altogether must stay for none of be evident that charles hayter be not well inclined towards captain wentworth have strong impression of having said in vext tone of voice after captain wentworths interference ought to have minded walter told not to teaze aunt must comprehend regretting captain wentworth must do what ought to have done charles hayters feeling anybodys feeling must interest till have little better arranged own be ashamed of quite ashamed of being so nervous so overcome by such trifle so be required long application of solitude reflection to recover chapter x other opportunity of making observation must not fail to occur anne have soon be in company with four together often enough to have opinion though too wise to acknowledge a much at home where knew must have satisfied husband wife for while considered louisa to be rather favourite must not think a far a might dare to judge from memory experience captain wentworth be not in love with be more in love with yet there be not love be little fever of admiration might probably must end in love with charles hayter seemed aware of being slighted yet henrietta have sometimes air of being divided between anne longed for power of representing to what be about of pointing out of evil be exposing to did not attribute guile to be highest satisfaction to to believe captain wentworth not in least aware of pain be occasioning there be triumph pitiful triumph in manner have probably never heard never thought of claim of charles hayter be only wrong in accepting attention for accepting must be word of two young woman at once after short struggle however charles hayter seemed to quit field three day have passed without coming once to uppercross most decided change have even refused one regular invitation to dinner having be found on occasion by mr musgrove with large book before mr mr musgrove be sure must not be right talked with grave face of studying to death be mary hope belief that have received positive dismissal from henrietta husband lived under constant dependence of seeing to morrow anne must only feel that charles hayter be wise one morning about time charles musgrove captain wentworth being gone shooting together a sister in cottage be sitting quietly at work be visited at window by sister from mansion house be very fine november day miss musgroves came through little ground stopped for other purpose than to say that be going to take long walk therefore concluded mary must not like to go with when mary immediately replied with jealousy at not being supposed good walker oh yes must like to join very much be very fond of long walk anne felt persuaded by look of two girl that be precisely what did not wish admired again sort of necessity family habit seemed to produce of everything being to be communicated everything being to be done together however undesired inconvenient tried to dissuade mary from going in vain that being case thought best to accept miss musgroves much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise a might be useful in turning back with sister lessening interference in plan of own can not imagine why must suppose must not like long walk said mary a went up stair everybody be always supposing that be not good walker yet must not have be pleased if have refused to join when people come in manner on purpose to ask how can one say just a be setting off gentleman returned have taken out young dog who have spoilt sport sent back early time strength spirit be therefore exactly ready for walk entered into with pleasure must anne have foreseen such junction must have staid at home from feeling of interest curiosity fancied now that be too late to retract whole six set forward together in direction chosen by miss musgroves who evidently considered walk a under guidance anne object be not to be in way of anybody where narrow path across field made many separation necessary to keep with brother sister pleasure in walk must arise from exercise day from view of last smile of year upon tawny leaf withered hedge from repeating to herself few of thousand poetical description extant of autumn that season of peculiar inexhaustible influence on mind of taste tenderness that season have drawn from poet worthy of being read attempt at description line of feeling occupied mind a much a possible in such like musing quotation be not possible that when within reach of captain wentworths conversation with of miss musgroves must not try to hear yet caught little very remarkable be mere lively chat such a young person on intimate footing might fall into be more engaged with louisa than with henrietta louisa certainly put more forward for notice than sister distinction appeared to increase there be one speech of louisas struck after one of many praise of day be continually bursting forth captain wentworth added what glorious weather for admiral sister meant to take long drive morning perhaps may hail from of hill talked of coming into side of country wonder whereabouts will upset to day oh doe happen very often assure sister make nothing of must a lieve be tossed out a not ah make most of know cried louisa if be really so must do just same in place if loved man a love admiral must always be with nothing must ever separate must rather be overturned by than driven safely by anybody else be spoken with enthusiasm have cried catching same tone honour there be silence between for little while anne must not immediately fall into quotation again sweet scene of autumn be for while put by unless tender sonnet fraught with apt analogy of declining year with declining happiness image of youth hope spring gone together blessed memory roused to say a struck by order into path be not one of way to winthrop nobody heard at least nobody answered winthrop however environsfor young men be sometimes to be met with strolling about near destination after half mile of gradual ascent through large enclosure where plough at work fresh made path spoke farmer counteracting sweet of poetical despondence meaning to have spring again gained summit of most considerable hill parted uppercross winthrop soon commanded full view of latter at foot of hill on other side winthrop without beauty without dignity be stretched before indifferent house standing low hemmed in by barn building of farm yard mary exclaimed bless here be winthrop declare have idea well now think have better turn back be excessively tired henrietta conscious ashamed seeing cousin charles walking along path leaning against gate be ready to do a mary wished said charles musgrove cried louisa more eagerly taking sister aside seemed to be arguing matter warmly charles in meanwhile be very decidedly declaring resolution of calling on aunt now that be so near very evidently though more fearfully trying to induce wife to go too be one of point on lady shewed strength when recommended advantage of resting quarter of hour at winthrop a felt so tired resolutely answered oh indeed walking up hill again must do more harm than sitting down must do good in short look manner declared that go must not after little succession of sort of debate consultation be settled between charles two sister that henrietta must just run down for few minute to see aunt cousin while rest of party waited for at top of hill louisa seemed principal arranger of plan a went little way with down hill still talking to henrietta mary took opportunity of looking scornfully around saying to captain wentworth be very unpleasant having such connexion assure have never be in house above twice in life received other answer than artificial assenting smile followed by contemptuous glance a turned away anne perfectly knew meaning of brow of hill where remained be cheerful spot louisa returned mary finding comfortable seat for herself on step of stile be very well satisfied so long a others stood about when louisa drew captain wentworth away to try for gleaning of nut in adjoining hedge row be gone by degree quite out of sight sound mary be happy no longer quarrelled with own seat be sure louisa have got much better somewhere nothing must prevent from going to look for better also turned through same gate must not see anne found nice seat for on dry sunny bank under hedge row in have doubt of still being in spot other mary sat down for moment must not do be sure louisa have found better seat somewhere else must go on till overtook anne really tired be glad to sit down very soon heard captain wentworth louisa in hedge row behind a if making way back along rough wild sort of channel down centre be speaking a drew near louisas voice be first distinguished seemed to be in middle of eager speech what anne first heard be so made go must not bear that must be frightened from visit by such nonsense what must be turned back from doing thing have determined to do that knew to be right by air interference of person of person may say have idea of being so easily persuaded when have made up mind have made henrietta seemed entirely to have made up hers to call at winthrop to day yet be a near giving up out of nonsensical complaisance must have turned back then for must indeed be almost ashamed to say happy for to have mind a yours at hand after hint gave just now did confirm own observation last time be in company with need not affect to have comprehension of what be going on see that more than mere dutiful morning visit to aunt be in question woe betide too when come to thing of consequence when be placed in circumstance requiring fortitude strength of mind if have not resolution enough to resist idle interference in such trifle a sister be amiable creature yours be character of decision firmness see if value conduct happiness infuse a much of own spirit into a can doubt have be always doing be worst evil of too yielding indecisive character influence over can be depended on be never sure of good impression being durable everybody may sway let who must be happy be firm here be nut said catching one down from upper bough to exemplify beautiful glossy nut blessed with original strength have outlived storm of autumn not puncture not weak spot anywhere nut continued with playful solemnity while so many of brother have fallen be trodden under foot be still in possession of happiness that hazel nut can be supposed capable of then returning to former earnest tonemy first wish for whom be interested in be that must be firm if louisa musgrove must be beautiful happy in november of life will cherish present power of mind have done be unanswered must have surprised anne if louisa must have readily answered speech word of such interest spoken with such serious warmth must imagine what louisa be feeling for feared to move lest must be seen while remained bush of low rambling holly protected be moving on before be beyond hearing however louisa spoke again mary be good natured enough in many respect said doe sometimes provoke excessively by nonsense pridethe elliot pride have great deal too much of elliot pride do so wish that charles have married anne instead suppose know wanted to marry anne after moment pause captain wentworth said do mean that refused oh yes certainly when did that happen exactly know for henrietta be at school at time believe about year before married mary wish have accepted must have liked great deal better papa mamma always think be great friend lady russell doing that did not think charles might not be learned bookish enough to please lady russell that therefore persuaded anne to refuse sound be retreating anne distinguished more own emotion still kept fixed have much to recover from before must move listener proverbial fate be not absolutely hers have heard evil of herself have heard great deal of very painful import saw how own character be considered by captain wentworth there have be just degree of feeling curiosity about in manner must give extreme agitation a soon a must went after mary having found walked back with to former station by stile felt comfort in whole party being immediately afterwards collected once more in motion together spirit wanted solitude silence only number must give charles henrietta returned bringing a may be conjectured charles hayter with minutia of business anne must not attempt to understand even captain wentworth did not seem admitted to perfect confidence here that there have be withdrawing on gentleman side relenting on lady that be now very glad to be together again did not admit doubt henrietta looked little ashamed very well pleasedcharles hayter exceedingly happy be devoted to other almost from first instant of setting forward for uppercross everything now marked out louisa for captain wentworth nothing must be plainer where many division be necessary even where be not walked side by side nearly a much a other two in long strip of meadow land where there be ample space for be thus divided forming three distinct party to party of three boasted least animation least complaisance anne necessarily belonged joined charles mary be tired enough to be very glad of charles other arm charles though in very good humour with be out of temper with wife mary have shewn disobliging to be now to reap consequence consequence be dropping arm almost moment to cut off head of nettle in hedge with switch when mary began to complain of lament being ill used according to custom in being on hedge side while anne be never incommoded on other dropped arm of to hunt after weasel have momentary glance of must hardly get along at long meadow bordered lane footpath at end of be to cross when party have reached gate of exit carriage advancing in same direction have be time heard be

onlytrue true surgeon instant be darting away when anne eagerly suggested captain benwick must not be better for captain benwick know where surgeon be to be found one capable of thinking felt advantage of idea in moment be done in rapid moment captain benwick have resigned poor corpse like figure entirely to brother care be off for town with utmost rapidity a to wretched party left behind must scarcely be said of three who be completely rational be suffering most captain wentworth anne charles who really very affectionate brother hung over louisa with sob of grief must only turn eye from one sister to see other in state a insensible to witness hysterical agitation of wife calling on for help must not give anne attending with strength zeal thought instinct supplied to henrietta still tried at interval to suggest comfort to others tried to quiet mary to animate charles to assuage feeling of captain wentworth seemed to look to for direction anne anne cried charles what be to be done next what in heaven name be to be done next captain wentworths eye be also turned towards have not better be carried to inn yes be sure carry gently to inn yes yes to inn repeated captain

partially revived be quite helpless in manner anne walking by side charles attending to wife set forward treading back with feeling unutterable ground so lately so very lately so light of heart have passed along be not off cobb before harvilles met captain benwick have be seen flying by house with countenance showed something to be wrong have set off immediately informed directed a passed towards spot shocked a captain harville be brought sens nerve must be instantly useful look between wife decided what be to be done must be taken to house must go to house await surgeon arrival there must not listen to scruple be obeyed be beneath roof while louisa under mr harvilles direction be conveyed up stair given possession of own bed assistance cordial restorative be supplied by husband to who needed louisa have once opened eye soon closed again without apparent consciousness have be proof of life however of service to sister henrietta though perfectly incapable of being in same room with louisa be kept by agitation of hope fear from return of own insensibility mary too be growing calmer surgeon be with almost before have seemed possible be sick with horror while examined be not head have received severe contusion have seen greater injury recovered from be by mean hopeless spoke cheerfully that did not regard a desperate case that did not say few hour must end be at first felt beyond hope of most ecstasy of such reprieve rejoicing deep silent after few fervent ejaculation of gratitude to heaven have be offered may be conceived tone look with thank god be uttered by captain wentworth anne be sure must never be forgotten by sight of afterwards a sat near table leaning over with folded arm face concealed a if overpowered by various feeling of soul trying by prayer reflection to calm louisas limb have escaped there be injury to head now became necessary for party to consider what be best to be done a to general situation be now able to speak to other consult that louisa must remain where be however distressing to friend to be involving harvilles in such trouble did not admit doubt removal be impossible harvilles silenced scruple a much a must gratitude have looked forward arranged everything before others began to reflect captain benwick must give up room to get bed elsewhere whole be settled be only concerned that house must accommodate more yet perhaps by putting child away in maid room swinging cot somewhere must hardly bear to think of not finding room for two three besides supposing might wish to stay though with regard to attendance on miss musgrove there need not be least uneasiness in leaving to mr harvilles care entirely mr harville be very experienced nurse nursery maid who have lived with long gone about with everywhere be just such between two must want possible attendance by day night be said with truth sincerity of feeling irresistible charles henrietta captain be three in consultation for little while be only interchange of perplexity terror uppercross necessity of one going to uppercross news to be conveyed how must be broken to mr mr musgrove lateness of morning hour already gone since ought to have be off impossibility of being in tolerable time at first be capable of nothing more to purpose than such exclamation after while captain wentworth exerting said must be decided without loss of minute minute be valuable one must resolve on being off for uppercross instantly musgrove must go charles agreed declared resolution of not going away must be a little incumbrance a possible to captain mr harville a to leaving sister in such state ought must so far be decided henrietta at first declared same however be soon persuaded to think differently usefulness of staying who have not be able to remain in louisas room to look at without suffering made worse than helpless be forced to acknowledge that must do good yet be still unwilling to be away till touched by thought of father mother gave up consented be anxious to be at home plan have reached point when anne coming quietly down from louisas room must not hear followed for parlour door be open then be settled musgrove cried captain wentworth that stay take care of sister home a to rest a to others if one stay to assist mr harville think need be only one mr charles musgrove will of course wish to get back to child if anne will stay one so proper so capable a anne paused moment to recover from emotion of hearing so spoken of other two warmly agreed with what said then appeared will stay be sure will stay nurse cried turning to speaking with glow yet gentleness seemed almost restoring past coloured deeply recollected moved away expressed most willing ready happy to remain be what have be thinking of wishing to be allowed to do bed on floor in louisas room must be sufficient for if mr harville must think so one thing more seemed arranged though be rather desirable that mr mr musgrove must be previously alarmed by share of delay yet time required by uppercross horse to take back must be dreadful extension of suspense captain wentworth proposed charles musgrove agreed that must be much better for to take chaise from inn leave mr musgroves carriage horse to be sent home next morning early when there must be farther advantage of sending account of louisas night captain wentworth now hurried off to get everything ready on part to be soon followed by two lady when plan be made known to mary however there be end of peace in be so wretched so vehement complained so much of injustice in being expected to go away instead of anne anne who be nothing to louisa while be sister have best right to stay in henriettas stead why be not to be a useful a anne to go home without charles too without husband be too unkind in short said more than husband must long withstand a none of others must oppose when gave way there be help for change of mary for anne be inevitable anne have never submitted more reluctantly to jealous ill judging claim of mary so must be set off for town charles taking care of sister captain benwick attending to gave moment recollection a hurried along to little circumstance same spot have

up in welfare captain benwick be most considerately attentive to united a seemed by distress of day felt increasing degree of good will towards pleasure even in thinking that might perhaps be occasion of continuing acquaintance captain wentworth be on watch for chaise four in waiting stationed for convenience in lowest part of street evident surprise vexation at substitution of one sister for other change in countenance astonishment expression begun suppressed with charles be listened to made mortifying reception of anne must at least convince that be valued only a must be useful to louisa

suppose must shrink unnecessarily from office of friend in meanwhile be in carriage have handed in placed between in manner under circumstance full of astonishment emotion to anne quitted lyme how long stage must pas how be to affect manner what be to be sort of intercourse must not foresee be quite natural however be devoted to henrietta always turning towards when spoke at always with view of supporting hope raising spirit in general voice manner be studiously calm to spare henrietta from agitation seemed governing principle once only when have be grieving over last ill judged ill fated walk to cobb bitterly lamenting that ever have be thought of burst forth a if wholly overcome dont talk of dont talk of cried oh god have not given way to at fatal moment have done a ought so eager so resolute dear sweet louisa anne wondered whether ever occurred to now to question justness of own previous opinion a to universal felicity advantage of firmness of character whether might not strike that like other quality of mind must have proportion limit thought must scarcely escape to feel that persuadable temper might sometimes be a much in favour of happiness a very resolute character got on fast anne be astonished to recognise same hill same object so soon actual speed heightened by dread of conclusion made road appear half a long a on day before be growing quite dusk however before be in neighbourhood of uppercross there have be total silence among for time henrietta leaning back in corner with shawl over face giving hope of having cried to sleep when a be going up last hill

steady matter of fact a may call have really curiosity to see person who can give occasion to such directly opposite notion wish may be induced to call here when doe mary may depend upon hearing opinion be determined not to judge beforehand will not like will answer for lady russell began talking of something else mary spoke with animation of meeting with rather missing mr elliot so extraordinarily be man said lady russell whom have wish to see declining to be on cordial term with head of family have left very strong impression in disfavour with decision checked mary eagerness stopped short in midst of elliot countenance with regard to captain wentworth though anne hazarded enquiry there be voluntary communication sufficient spirit have be greatly recovering lately a might be expected a louisa improved have improved be now quite different creature from what have be first week have not seen louisa be so extremely fearful of ill consequence to from interview that did not press for at on contrary seemed to have plan of going away for week ten day till head be stronger have talked of going down to plymouth for week wanted to persuade captain benwick to go with a charles maintained to last captain benwick seemed much more disposed to ride over to kellynch there can be doubt that lady russell anne be occasionally thinking of captain benwick from time lady russell must not hear door bell without feeling that might be herald must anne return from stroll of solitary indulgence in father ground visit of charity in village without wondering whether might see hear of captain benwick came not however be either le disposed for than charles have imagined be too shy after giving week indulgence lady russell determined to be unworthy of interest have be beginning to excite musgroves came back to receive happy boy girl from school bringing with mr harvilles little child to improve noise of uppercross lessen that of lyme henrietta remained with louisa rest of family be again in usual quarter lady russell anne paid compliment to once when anne must not feel that uppercross be already quite alive again though henrietta louisa charles hayter captain wentworth be there room presented a strong contrast a must be wished to last state have seen in immediately surrounding mr be little harvilles whom be sedulously guarding from tyranny of two child from cottage expressly arrived to amuse on one side be table occupied by chattering girl cutting up silk gold paper on other be tressels tray bending under weight of brawn cold pie where riotous boy be holding high revel whole completed by roaring christmas fire seemed determined to be heard in spite of noise of others charles mary also came in of course during visit mr musgrove made point of paying respect to lady russell sat down close to for ten minute talking with very raised voice from clamour of child on knee generally in vain be fine family piece anne judging from own temperament must have deemed domestic hurricane bad restorative of nerve louisas illness must have so greatly shaken mr musgrove who got anne near on purpose to thank most cordially again again for attention to concluded short recapitulation of what have suffered by observing with happy glance round room that after have gone through nothing be so likely to do good a little quiet cheerfulness at home louisa be now recovering apace mother must even think of being able to join party at home before brother sister went to school again harvilles have promised to come with stay at uppercross whenever returned captain wentworth be gone for present to see brother in shropshire hope will remember in future said lady russell a soon a be reseated in carriage not to call at uppercross in christmas holiday everybody have taste in noise a well a in other matter sound be quite innoxious most distressing by sort rather than quantity when lady russell not long afterwards be entering bath on wet afternoon driving through long course of street from old bridge to camden place amidst dash of other carriage heavy rumble of cart dray bawling of newspaperman muffin men milkman ceaseless clink of patten made complaint no be noise belonged to winter pleasure spirit rose under influence like mr musgrove be feeling though not saying that after being long in country nothing must be so good for a little quiet cheerfulness anne did not share feeling persisted in very determined though very silent disinclination for bath caught first dim view of extensive building smoking in rain without wish of seeing better felt progress through street to be however disagreeable yet too rapid for who must be glad to see when arrived looked back with fond regret to bustle of uppercross seclusion of kellynch elizabeth last letter have communicated piece of news of interest mr elliot be in bath have called in camden place have called second time third have be pointedly attentive if elizabeth father did not deceive have be taking much pain to seek acquaintance proclaim value of connection a have formerly taken pain to shew neglect be very wonderful if be true lady russell be in state of very agreeable curiosity perplexity about mr elliot already recanting sentiment have so lately expressed to mary of being man whom have wish to see have great wish to see if really sought to reconcile like dutiful branch must be forgiven for having dismembered from paternal tree anne be not animated to equal pitch by circumstance felt that must rather see mr elliot again than not be more than must say for many other person in bath be put down in camden place lady russell then drove to own lodging in river street chapter xv sir walter have taken very good house in camden place lofty dignified situation such a becomes man of consequence elizabeth be settled there much to satisfaction anne entered with sinking heart anticipating imprisonment of many month anxiously saying to herself oh when will leave again degree of unexpected cordiality however in welcome received did good father sister be glad to see for sake of shewing house furniture met with kindness making fourth when sat down to dinner be noticed a advantage mr clay be very pleasant very smiling courtesy smile be more matter of course anne have always felt that must pretend what be proper on arrival complaisance of others be unlooked for be evidently in excellent spirit be soon to listen to cause have inclination to listen to after laying out for compliment of being deeply regretted in old neighbourhood anne must not pay have only few faint enquiry to make before talk must be own uppercross excited interest kellynch very little be bath have pleasure of assuring bath more than answered expectation in respect house be undoubtedly best in camden place drawing room have many decided advantage over others have seen heard of superiority be not le in style of fitting up taste of furniture acquaintance be exceedingly sought after everybody be wanting to visit have drawn back from many introduction still be perpetually having card left by people of whom knew nothing here be fund of enjoyment must anne wonder that father sister be happy might not wonder must sigh that father must feel degradation in change must see nothing to regret in duty dignity of resident landholder must find so much to be vain of in littleness of town must sigh smile wonder too a elizabeth threw open folding door walked with exultation from one drawing room to other boasting of space at possibility of woman who have be mistress of kellynch hall finding extent to be proud of between two wall perhaps thirty foot asunder be not have to make happy have mr elliot too anne have great deal to hear of mr elliot be not only pardoned be delighted with have be in bath about fortnight have passed through bath in november in way to london when intelligence of sir walter being settled there have of course reached though only twenty four hour in place have not be able to avail of have now be fortnight in bath first object on arriving have be to leave card in camden place following up by such assiduous endeavour to meet when did meet by such great openness of conduct such readiness to apologize for past such solicitude to be received a relation again that former good understanding be completely re established have not fault to find in have explained away appearance of neglect on own side have originated in misapprehension entirely have never have idea of throwing off have feared that be thrown off knew not why delicacy have kept silent upon hint of having spoken disrespectfully carelessly of family family honour be quite indignant who have ever boasted of being elliot whose feeling a to connection be only too strict to suit unfeudal tone of present day be astonished indeed character general conduct must refute must refer sir walter to who knew certainly pain have be taking on first opportunity of reconciliation to be restored to footing of relation heir presumptive be strong proof of opinion on subject circumstance of marriage too be found to admit of much extenuation be article not to be entered on by very intimate friend of colonel wallis highly respectable man perfectly gentleman not ill looking man sir walter added who be living in very good style in marlborough building have at own particular request be admitted to acquaintance through mr elliot have mentioned one two thing relative to marriage made material difference in discredit of colonel wallis have known mr elliot long have be well acquainted also with wife have perfectly understood whole story be certainly not woman of family well educated accomplished rich excessively in love with friend there have be charm have sought without attraction not money must have tempted elliot sir walter be moreover assured of having be very fine woman here be great deal to soften business very fine woman with large fortune in love with sir walter seemed to admit a complete apology though elizabeth must not see circumstance in quite so favourable light allowed be great extenuation mr elliot have called repeatedly have dined with once evidently delighted by distinction of being asked for gave dinner in general delighted in short by proof of cousinly notice placing whole happiness in being on intimate term in camden place anne listened without quite understanding allowance large allowance knew must be made for idea of who spoke heard under embellishment sounded extravagant irrational in progress of reconciliation might have origin in language of relators still however have sensation of there being something more than immediately appeared in mr elliots wishing after interval of so many year to be well received by in worldly view have nothing to gain by being on term with sir walter nothing to risk by state of variance in probability be already richer of two kellynch estate must a surely be hereafter a title sensible man have looked like very sensible man why must be object to must only offer one solution be perhaps for elizabeth sake there might really have be liking formerly though convenience accident have drawn different way now that must afford to please might mean to pay address to elizabeth be certainly very handsome with well bred elegant manner character might never have be penetrated by mr elliot knowing in public when very young how temper understanding might bear investigation of present keener time of life be concern rather fearful one most earnestly did wish that might not be too nice too observant if elizabeth be object that elizabeth be disposed to believe so that friend mr clay be encouraging idea seemed apparent by glance two between while mr elliots frequent visit be talked of anne mentioned glimpse have have of at lyme without being much attended to oh yes perhaps have be mr elliot did not know might be perhaps must not listen to description of be describing sir walter especially did justice to very gentlemanlike appearance air of elegance fashion good shaped face sensible eye at same time must lament being very much under hung defect time seemed to have increased must pretend to say that ten year have not altered almost feature for worse mr elliot appeared to think that sir walter be looking exactly a have done when last parted sir walter have not be able to return compliment entirely have embarrassed did not mean to complain however mr elliot be better to look at than most men have objection to being seen with anywhere mr elliot friend in marlborough building be talked of whole evening colonel wallis have be so impatient to be introduced to mr elliot so anxious that must there be mr wallis at present known only to by description a be in daily expectation of confinement mr elliot spoke of a most charming woman quite worthy of being known in camden place a soon a recovered be to be acquainted sir walter thought much of mr wallis be said to be excessively pretty woman beautiful longed to see hoped might make amends for many very plain face be continually passing in street worst of bath be number of plain woman did not mean to say that there be pretty woman number of plain be out of proportion have frequently observed a walked that one handsome face must be followed by thirty five thirty fright once a have stood in shop on bond street have counted eighty seven woman go by one after without there being tolerable face among have be frosty morning to be sure sharp frost hardly one woman in thousand must stand test of still there certainly be dreadful multitude of ugly woman in bath a for men be infinitely worse such scarecrow a street be full of be evident how little woman be used to sight of anything tolerable by effect man of decent appearance produced have never walked anywhere arm in arm with colonel wallis who be fine military figure though sandy haired without observing woman eye be upon woman eye be sure to be upon colonel wallis modest sir walter be not allowed to escape however daughter mr clay united in hinting that colonel walliss companion might have a good figure a colonel wallis certainly be not sandy haired how be mary looking said sir walter in height of good humour last time saw have red nose hope may not happen day oh must have be quite accidental in general have be in very good health very good look since michaelmas if thought must not tempt to go out in sharp wind grow coarse must send new hat pelisse anne be considering whether must venture to suggest that gown cap must not be liable to such misuse when knock at door suspended everything knock at door so late be ten oclock must be mr elliot knew be to dine in lansdown crescent be possible that might stop in way home to ask how did must think of one else mr clay decidedly thought mr elliots knock mr clay be right with state butler foot boy must give mr elliot be ushered into room be same very same man with difference of dress anne drew little back while others received compliment sister apology for calling at so unusual hour must not be so near without wishing to know that friend have taken cold day before c c be a politely done a politely taken a possible part must follow then sir walter talked of youngest daughter mr elliot must give leave to present to youngest daughter there be occasion for remembering mary anne smiling blushing very becomingly shewed to mr elliot pretty feature have by mean forgotten instantly saw with amusement at little start of surprise that have not be at aware of who be looked completely astonished not more astonished than pleased eye brightened with most perfect alacrity welcomed relationship alluded to past entreated to be received a acquaintance already be quite a good looking a have appeared at lyme countenance improved by speaking manner be so exactly what ought to be so polished so easy so particularly agreeable that must compare in excellence to only one person manner be not same be perhaps equally good sat down with improved conversation very much there must be doubt of being sensible man ten minute be enough to certify that tone expression choice of subject knowing where to stop be operation of sensible discerning mind a soon a must began to talk to of lyme wanting to compare opinion respecting place especially wanting to speak of circumstance of happening to be guest in same inn at same time to give own route understand something of hers regret that must have lost opportunity of paying respect to gave short account of party business at lyme regret increased a listened have spent whole solitary evening in room adjoining have heard voice mirth continually thought must be most delightful set of people longed to be with certainly without smallest suspicion of possessing shadow of right to introduce if have asked who party be name of musgrove must have told enough well must serve to cure of absurd practice of never asking question at inn have adopted when quite young man on principal of being very ungenteel to be curious notion of young man of one two twenty said a to what be necessary in manner to make quite thing be more absurd believe than of other set of being in world folly of mean often employ be only to be equalled by folly of what have in view must not be addressing reflection to anne alone knew be soon diffused again among others be only at interval that must return to lyme enquiry however produced at length account of scene have be engaged in there soon after leaving place having alluded to accident must hear whole when questioned sir walter elizabeth began to question also difference in manner of doing must not be unfelt must only compare mr elliot to lady russell in wish of really comprehending what have passed in degree of concern for what must have suffered in witnessing staid hour with elegant little clock on mantel piece have struck eleven with silver sound watchman be beginning to be heard at distance telling same tale before mr elliot of seemed to feel that have be there long anne must not have supposed possible that first evening in camden place must have passed so well chapter xvi there be one point anne on returning to family must have be more thankful to ascertain even than mr elliots being in love with elizabeth be father not being in love with mr clay be very far from easy about when have be at home few hour on going down to breakfast next morning found there have just be decent pretence on lady side of meaning to leave must imagine mr clay to have said that now miss anne be come must not suppose at wanted for elizabeth be replying in sort of whisper must not be reason indeed assure feel none be nothing to compared with be in full time to hear father say dear madam must not be a yet have seen nothing of bath have be here only to be useful must not run away from now must stay to be acquainted with mr wallis beautiful mr wallis to fine mind well know sight of beauty be real gratification spoke looked so much in earnest that anne be not surprised to see mr clay stealing glance at elizabeth countenance perhaps might express watchfulness praise of fine mind did not appear to excite thought in sister lady must not yield to such joint entreaty promise to stay in course of same morning anne father chancing to be alone together began to compliment on improved look thought le thin in person in cheek skin complexion greatly improved clearer fresher have be using thing in particular nothing merely gowland supposed nothing at have be surprised at added certainly can not do better than to continue a be can not be better than well must recommend gowland constant use of gowland during spring month mr clay have be using at recommendation see what have done for see how have carried away freckle if elizabeth must have heard such personal praise might have struck especially a did not appear to anne that freckle be at lessened everything must take chance evil of marriage must be much diminished if elizabeth be also to marry a for might always command home with lady russell lady russell composed mind polite manner be put to trial on point in intercourse in camden place sight of mr clay in such favour of anne so overlooked be perpetual provocation to there vexed a much when be away a person in bath who drink water get new publication have very large acquaintance have time to be vexed a mr elliot became known to grew more charitable more indifferent towards others manner be immediate recommendation on conversing with found solid so fully supporting superficial that be at first a told anne almost ready to exclaim can be mr elliot must not seriously picture to herself more agreeable estimable man everything united in good understanding correct opinion knowledge of world warm heart have strong feeling of family attachment family honour without pride weakness lived with liberality of man of fortune without display judged for in everything essential without defying public opinion in point of worldly decorum be steady observant moderate candid never run away with by spirit by selfishness fancied strong feeling yet with sensibility to what be amiable lovely value for felicity of domestic life character of fancied enthusiasm violent agitation seldom really posse be sure that have not be happy in marriage colonel wallis said lady russell saw have be no unhappiness to sour mind began pretty soon to suspect to prevent thinking of second choice satisfaction in mr elliot outweighed plague of mr clay be now year since anne have begun to learn that excellent friend must sometimes think differently did not surprise therefore that lady russell must see nothing suspicious inconsistent nothing to require more motif than appeared in mr elliots great desire of reconciliation in lady russell view be perfectly natural that mr elliot at mature time of life must feel most desirable object must very generally recommend among sensible people to be on good term with head of family simplest process in world of time upon head naturally clear only erring in heyday of youth anne presumed however still to smile about at last to mention elizabeth lady russell listened looked made only cautious replyelizabeth very well time will explain be reference to future anne after little observation felt must submit to must determine nothing at present in house elizabeth must be first be in habit of such general observance a miss elliot that particularity of attention seemed almost impossible mr elliot too must be remembered have not be widower seven month little delay on side might be very excusable in fact anne must never see crape round hat without fearing that be inexcusable one in attributing to such imagination for though marriage have not be very happy still have existed so many year that must not comprehend very rapid recovery from awful impression of being dissolved however might end be without question pleasantest acquaintance in bath saw nobody equal to be great indulgence now then to talk to about lyme seemed to have a lively wish to see again to see more of a herself went through particular of first meeting great many time gave to understand that have looked at with earnestness knew well remembered person look also did not always think alike value for rank connexion perceived be greater than hers be not merely complaisance must be liking to cause made enter warmly into father sister solicitude on subject thought unworthy to excite bath paper one morning announced arrival of dowager viscountess dalrymple daughter honourable miss carteret comfort of camden place be swept away for many day for dalrymples in anne opinion most unfortunately be cousin of elliots agony be how to introduce properly anne have never seen father sister before in contact with nobility must acknowledge disappointed have hoped better thing from high idea of own situation in life be reduced to form wish have never foreseen wish that have more pride for cousin lady dalrymple miss carteret cousin dalrymples sounded in ear day long sir walter have once be in company with late viscount have never seen of rest of family difficulty of case arose from there having be suspension of intercourse by letter of ceremony ever since death of said late viscount when in consequence of dangerous illness of sir walter at same time there have be unlucky omission at kellynch letter of condolence have be sent to ireland neglect have be visited on head of sinner for when poor lady elliot died letter of condolence be received at kellynch consequently there be too much reason to apprehend that dalrymples considered relationship a closed how to have anxious business set to right be admitted a cousin again be question be question in more rational manner lady russell mr elliot thought unimportant family connexion be always worth preserving good company always worth seeking lady dalrymple have taken house for three month in laura place must be living in style have be at bath year before lady russell have heard spoken of a charming woman be very desirable that connexion must be renewed if must be done without compromise of propriety on side of elliots sir walter however must choose own mean at last wrote very fine letter of ample explanation regret entreaty to right honourable cousin lady russell mr elliot must admire letter did be wanted in bringing three line of scrawl from dowager viscountess be very much honoured must be happy in acquaintance toil of business be over sweet began visited in laura

london perhaps in present quiet style of living might be a say in bath sir walter elliot family will always be worth knowing always acceptable a acquaintance well said anne certainly be proud too proud to enjoy welcome depends so entirely upon place love indignation said be very natural here be in bath object be to be established here with credit dignity ought to belong to sir walter elliot

cousin continued speaking lower though there be one else in room in one point be sure must feel alike must feel that addition to father society among equal superior may be of use in diverting thought from who be beneath looked a spoke to seat mr clay have be lately occupying sufficient explanation of what particularly meant though anne must not believe in having same sort of pride be pleased with for not liking mr clay conscience admitted that wishing to promote father getting great acquaintance be more than excusable in view of defeating chapter xvii while sir walter elizabeth be assiduously

helpless widow receiving visit of former protegee a favour be uncomfortable in meeting have soon passed away left only interesting charm of remembering former partiality talking over old time anne found in mr smith good sense agreeable manner have almost ventured to depend on disposition to converse be cheerful beyond expectation dissipation of pastand have lived very much in worldnor restriction of present sickness sorrow seemed to have closed heart ruined spirit in course of second visit talked with great openness anne astonishment increased must scarcely imagine more cheerless

that elasticity of mind disposition to be comforted power of turning readily from evil to good of finding employment carried out of herself be from nature alone be choicest gift of heaven anne viewed friend a one of instance in by merciful appointment seems designed to counterbalance almost other want there have be time mr smith told when spirit have nearly failed must not call invalid now

something make one know one specie better one like to hear what be going on to be au fait a to newest mode of being trifling silly to who live so much alone conversation assure be treat anne far from wishing to cavil at pleasure replied can easily believe woman of class have great opportunity if be intelligent may be well worth listening to such variety of human nature a be in habit of witnessing be not merely in folly that be well read for see occasionally under circumstance can be most interesting affecting what instance must pas before of ardent disinterested self denying attachment of heroism fortitude patience resignation of conflict sacrifice ennoble most sick chamber may often furnish worth of volume yes said mr smith more doubtingly sometimes may though fear lesson be not often in elevated style describe here there human nature may be great in time of trial generally speaking be weakness not strength that appears in sick chamber be selfishness impatience rather than generosity fortitude that one hears of there be so little real friendship in world unfortunately speaking low tremulously there be so many who forget to think seriously till be almost too late anne saw misery of such feeling husband have not be what ought wife have be led among part of mankind made think worse of world than hoped deserved be passing emotion however with mr smith shook off soon added in different tone suppose situation friend mr rooke be in at present will furnish much to interest edify be only nursing mr wallis of marlborough building mere pretty silly expensive fashionable

several time on friend before existence of person be known in camden place at last became necessary to speak of sir walter elizabeth mr clay returned one morning from laura place with sudden invitation from lady dalrymple for same evening anne be already engaged to spend evening in westgate building be not sorry for excuse be only asked be sure because lady dalrymple being kept at home by bad cold be glad to make use of relationship have be so pressed on declined on own account with great alacrityshe be engaged to spend evening with old schoolfellow be not much interested in anything relative to anne still there be question enough asked to make understood what old schoolfellow be elizabeth be disdainful sir walter severe westgate building said who be miss anne elliot to be visiting in westgate building mr smith widow mr smith who be husband one of five thousand mr smith whose name be to be met with everywhere what be attraction that be old sickly upon word miss anne elliot have most extraordinary taste everything revolt other people low company paltry room foul air disgusting association be inviting to surely may put off old lady till to morrow be not so near end presume that may hope to see day what be age forty sir be not one thirty think can put off engagement because be only evening for time will at once suit go into warm bath to morrow for rest of week know be engaged what doe lady russell think of acquaintance asked elizabeth see nothing to blame in replied anne on contrary approves have generally taken when have called on mr smith westgate building must have be rather surprised by appearance of carriage drawn up near pavement observed sir walter sir henry russell widow indeed have honour to distinguish arm still be handsome equipage doubt be well known to convey miss elliot widow mr smith lodging in westgate building poor widow barely able to live between thirty forty mere mr smith day mr smith of people name in world to be chosen friend of miss anne elliot to be preferred by to own family connection among nobility of england ireland mr smith name mr clay who have be present while passed now thought advisable to leave room anne must have said much did long to say little in defence of friend not very dissimilar claim to theirs sense of personal respect to father prevented made reply left to to recollect mr smith be not only widow in bath between thirty forty with little to live on surname of dignity anne kept appointment others kept theirs of course heard next morning that have have delightful evening have be only one of set absent for sir walter elizabeth have not only be quite at ladyship service have actually be happy to be employed by in collecting others have be at trouble of inviting lady russell mr elliot mr elliot have made point of leaving colonel wallis early lady russell have fresh arranged evening engagement in order to wait on anne have whole history of evening must supply from lady russell to greatest interest must be in having be very much talked of between friend mr elliot in having be wished for regretted at same time honoured for staying away in such cause kind compassionate visit to old schoolfellow sick reduced seemed to have quite delighted mr elliot thought most extraordinary young woman in temper manner mind model of female excellence must meet even lady russell in discussion of merit anne must not be given to understand so much by friend must not know to be so highly rated by sensible man without many of agreeable sensation friend meant to create lady russell be now perfectly decided in opinion of mr elliot be a much convinced of meaning to gain anne in time a of deserving be beginning to calculate number of week must free from remaining restraint of widowhood leave at liberty to exert most open power of pleasing must not speak to anne with certainty felt on subject must venture on little more than hint of what might be hereafter of possible attachment on side of desirableness of alliance supposing such attachment to be real returned anne heard made violent exclamation only smiled blushed gently shook head be match maker a well know said lady russell being much too well aware of uncertainty of human event calculation only mean that if mr elliot must time hence pay address to if must be disposed to accept think there must be possibility of being happy together most suitable connection everybody must consider think might be very happy one mr elliot be exceedingly agreeable man in many respect think highly of said anne must not suit lady russell let pas only said in rejoinder own to be able to regard a future mistress of kellynch future lady elliot to look forward see occupying dear mother place succeeding to right popularity a well a to virtue must be highest possible gratification to be mother self in countenance disposition if might be allowed to fancy such a be in situation name home presiding blessing in same spot only superior to in being more highly valued dearest anne must give more delight than be often felt at time of life anne be obliged to turn away to rise to walk to distant table leaning there in pretended employment try to subdue feeling picture excited for few moment imagination heart be bewitched idea of becoming what mother have be of having precious name of lady elliot first revived in herself of being restored to kellynch calling home again home for ever be charm must not immediately resist lady russell said not word willing to leave matter to own operation believing must mr elliot at moment with propriety have spoken for himselfshe believed in short what anne did not believe same image of mr elliot speaking for brought anne to composure again charm of kellynch of lady elliot faded away never must accept be not only that feeling be still adverse to man save one judgement on serious consideration of possibility of such case be against mr elliot though have now be acquainted month must not be satisfied that really knew character that be sensible man agreeable man that talked well professed good opinion seemed to judge properly a man of principle be clear enough certainly knew what be right must fix on one article of moral duty evidently transgressed yet must have be afraid to answer for conduct distrusted past if not present name occasionally dropt of former associate allusion to former practice pursuit suggested suspicion not favourable of what have be saw that there have be bad habit that sunday travelling have be common thing that there have be period of life probably not short one when have be at least careless in serious matter though might now think very differently who must answer for true sentiment of clever cautious man grown old enough to appreciate fair character how must ever be ascertained that mind be truly cleansed mr elliot be rational discreet polished be not open there be never burst of feeling warmth of indignation delight at evil good of others to anne be decided imperfection early impression be incurable prized frank open hearted eager character beyond others warmth enthusiasm did captivate still felt that must so much more depend upon sincerity of who sometimes looked said careless hasty thing than of whose presence of mind never varied whose tongue never slipped mr elliot be too generally agreeable various a be temper in father house pleased endured too well stood too well with body have spoken to with degree of openness of mr clay have appeared completely to see what mr clay be about to hold in contempt yet mr clay found a agreeable a body lady russell saw either le more than young friend for saw nothing to excite distrust must not imagine man more exactly what ought to be than mr elliot did ever enjoy sweeter feeling than hope of seeing receive hand of beloved anne in kellynch church in course of following autumn chapter xviii be beginning of february anne having be month in bath be growing very eager for news from uppercross lyme wanted to hear much more than mary have communicated be three week since have heard at only knew that henrietta be at home again that louisa though considered to be recovering fast be still in lyme be thinking of very intently one evening when thicker letter than usual from mary be delivered to to quicken pleasure surprise with admiral mr croft compliment croft must be in bath circumstance to interest be people whom heart turned to very naturally what be cried sir walter croft have arrived in bath croft who rent kellynch what have brought letter from uppercross cottage sir oh letter be convenient passport secure introduction must have visited admiral croft however at rate know what be due to tenant anne must listen no longer must not even have told how poor admiral complexion escaped letter engrossed have be begun several day back february st dear anne make apology for silence because know how little people think of letter in such place a bath must be great deal too happy to care for uppercross a well know affords little to write about have have very dull christmas mr mr musgrove have not have one dinner party holiday reckon hayters a anybody holiday however be over at last believe child ever have such long one be sure have not house be cleared yesterday except of little harvilles will be surprised to hear have never gone home mr harville must be odd mother to part with so long understand be not at nice child in opinion mr musgrove seems to like quite a well if not better than grandchild what dreadful weather have have may not be felt in bath with nice pavement in country be of consequence have not have creature call on since second week in january except charles hayter who have be calling much oftener than be welcome between think great pity henrietta did not remain at lyme a long a louisa must have kept little out of way carriage be gone to day to bring louisa harvilles to morrow be not asked to dine with however till day after mr musgrove be so afraid of being fatigued by journey be not very likely considering care will be taken of must be much more convenient to to dine there to morrow be glad find mr elliot so agreeable wish must be acquainted with too have usual luck be always out of way when thing desirable be going on always last of family to be noticed what immense time mr clay have be staying with elizabeth doe never mean to go away perhaps if be to leave room vacant might not be invited let know what think of expect child to be asked know can leave at great house very well for month six week have moment heard that croft be going to bath almost immediately think admiral gouty charles heard quite by chance have not have civility to give notice of offering to take anything think improve at a neighbour see nothing of be really instance of gross inattention charles join in love everything proper yours affectionately mary m be sorry to say that be very far from well jemima have just told that butcher say there be bad sore throat very much about dare say will catch sore throat know be always worse than anybodys so ended first part have be afterwards put into envelope containing nearly a much more kept letter open might send word how louisa bore journey now be extremely glad did having great deal to add in first place have note from mr croft yesterday offering to convey anything to very kind friendly note indeed addressed to just a ought will therefore be able to make letter a long a like admiral doe not seem very ill sincerely hope bath will do all good want will be truly glad to have back again neighbourhood can not spare such pleasant family now for louisa have something to communicate will astonish not little harvilles came on tuesday very safely in evening went to ask how did when be rather surprised not to find captain benwick of party for have be invited a well a harvilles what do think be reason more le than being in love with louisa not choosing to venture to uppercross till have have answer from mr musgrove for be settled between before came away have written to father by captain harville true upon honour be not astonished will be surprised at least if ever received hint of for never did mr musgrove protest solemnly that knew nothing of matter be very well pleased however for though be not equal to marrying captain wentworth be infinitely better than charles hayter mr musgrove have written consent captain benwick be expected to day mr harville say husband feel good deal on poor sister account however louisa be great favourite with indeed mr harville quite agree that love better for having nursed charles wonder what captain wentworth will say if remember never thought attached to louisa never must see anything of be end see of captain benwicks being supposed to be admirer of yours how charles must take thing into head be always incomprehensible to hope will be more agreeable now certainly not great match for louisa musgrove million time better than marrying among hayters mary need not have feared sister being in degree prepared for news have never in life be more astonished captain benwick louisa musgrove be almost too wonderful for belief be with greatest effort that must remain in room preserve air of calmness answer common question of moment happily for be not many sir walter wanted to know whether croft travelled with four horse whether be likely to be situated in such part of bath a might suit miss elliot to visit in have little curiosity beyond how be mary said elizabeth without waiting for answer pray brings croft to bath come on admiral account be thought to be gouty gout decrepitude said sir walter poor old gentleman have acquaintance here asked elizabeth know can hardly suppose at admiral croft time of life in profession must not have many acquaintance in place a suspect said sir walter coolly that admiral croft will be best known in bath a renter of kellynch hall elizabeth may venture to present wife in laura place oh think not situated a be with lady dalrymple cousin ought to be very careful not to embarrass with acquaintance might not approve if be not related must not signify a cousin must feel scrupulous a to proposal of ours have better leave croft to find own level there be several odd looking men walking about here who be told be sailor croft will associate with be sir walter elizabeth share of interest in letter when mr clay have paid tribute of more decent attention in enquiry after mr charles musgrove fine little boy anne be at liberty in own room tried to comprehend well might charles wonder how captain wentworth must feel perhaps have quitted field have given louisa up have ceased to love have found did not love must not endure idea of treachery levity anything akin to ill usage between friend must not endure that friendship a theirs must be severed unfairly captain benwick louisa musgrove high spirited joyous talking louisa musgrove dejected thinking feeling reading captain benwick seemed of everything must not suit other mind most dissimilar where must have be attraction answer soon presented have be in situation have be thrown together several week have be living in same small family party since henriettas coming away must have be depending almost entirely on other louisa just recovering from illness have be in interesting state captain benwick be not inconsolable that be point anne have not be able to avoid suspecting before instead of drawing same conclusion a mary from present course of event served only to confirm idea of having felt dawning of tenderness toward did not mean however to derive much more from to gratify vanity than mary might have allowed be persuaded that tolerably pleasing young woman who have listened seemed to feel for must have received same compliment have affectionate heart must love somebody saw reason against being happy louisa have fine naval fervour to begin with must soon grow more alike must gain cheerfulness must learn to be enthusiast for scott lord byron nay be probably learnt already of course have fallen in love over poetry idea of louisa musgrove turned into person of literary taste sentimental reflection be amusing have doubt of being so day at fall from cobb might influence health nerve courage character to end of life a thoroughly a appeared to have influenced fate conclusion of whole be that if woman who have be sensible of captain wentworths merit must be allowed to prefer man there be nothing in engagement to excite lasting wonder if captain wentworth lost friend by certainly nothing to be regretted be not regret made anne heart beat in spite of herself brought colour into cheek when thought of captain wentworth unshackled free have feeling be ashamed to investigate be too much like joy senseless joy longed to see croft when meeting took place be evident that rumour of news have yet reached visit of ceremony be paid returned louisa musgrove be mentioned captain benwick too without even smile croft have placed in lodging in gay street perfectly to sir walter satisfaction be not at ashamed of acquaintance did in fact think talk great deal more about admiral than admiral ever thought talked about croft knew quite a many people in bath a wished for considered intercourse with elliots a mere matter of form not in least likely to afford pleasure brought with country habit of being almost always together be ordered to walk to keep off gout mr croft seemed to go share with in everything to walk for life to do good anne saw wherever went lady russell took out in carriage almost morning never failed to think of never failed to see knowing feeling a did be most attractive picture of happiness to always watched a long a must delighted to fancy understood what might be talking of a walked along in happy independence equally delighted to see admiral hearty shake of hand when encountered old friend observe eagerness of conversation when occasionally forming into little knot of navy mr croft looking a intelligent keen a of officer around anne be too much engaged with lady russell to be often walking so happened that one morning about week ten day after croft arrival suited best to leave friend friend carriage in lower part of town return alone to camden place in walking up milsom street have good fortune to meet with admiral be standing by at printshop window with hand behind in earnest contemplation of print not only might have passed unseen be obliged to touch a well a address before must catch notice when did perceive acknowledge however be done with usual frankness good humour have be thank thank be treating like friend here be see staring at picture can never get by shop without stopping what thing here be by way of boat do look at did ever see like what queer fellow fine painter must be to think that anybody must venture life in such shapeless old cockleshell a yet here be two gentleman stuck up in mightily at ease looking about at rock mountain a if be not to be upset next moment certainly must be wonder where boat be built laughing heartily must not venture over horsepond in well turning away now where be bound can go anywhere for with can be of use none thank unless will give pleasure of company little way road lie together be going home will

stare to see anybody with wife poor soul be tied by leg have blister on one of heel a large a three shilling piece if look across street will see admiral brand coming down brother shabby fellow of be glad be not on side of way sophy can not bear played pitiful trick once got away with of best men will tell whole story time there come old sir archibald drew grandson look see kiss hand to take for wife ah peace have come too soon for younker poor old sir archibald how do like bath miss elliot suit very well be always meeting with old friend other street full of morning sure to have plenty of chat then get away from shut ourselves in lodging draw in chair be a snug a if be at kellynch ay a used to be even at north yarmouth deal like lodging here worse can tell for putting in mind of first have at north yarmouth wind blow through one of cupboard just in same way when be got little farther anne ventured to press again for what have to communicate hoped when clear of milsom street to have curiosity gratified be still obliged to wait for admiral have made up mind not to begin till have gained greater space quiet of belmont a be not really mr croft must let have own way a soon a be fairly ascending belmont began well now will hear something will surprise first of must tell name of young lady be going to talk about young lady know that have be so concerned for miss musgrove that have be happening to christian name always forget christian name anne have be ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon a really did now must safely suggest name of louisa ay ay miss louisa musgrove be name wish young lady have not such number of fine christian name must never be out if be sophys something of sort well miss louisa thought know be to marry frederick be courting week after week only wonder be what must be waiting for till business at lyme came then indeed be clear enough that must wait till brain be set to right even then there be something odd in way of going on instead of staying at lyme went off to plymouth then went off to see edward when came back from minehead be gone down to edward there have be ever since have seen nothing of since november even sophy must not understand now matter have taken strangest turn of for young lady same miss musgrove instead of being to marry frederick be to marry james benwick know james benwick little be little acquainted with captain benwick well be to marry nay most likely be married already for know what must wait for thought captain benwick very pleasing young man said anne understand that bear excellent character oh yes yes there be not word to be said against james benwick be only commander be true made last summer be bad time for getting on have not fault that know of excellent good hearted fellow assure very active zealous officer too be more than must think for perhaps for soft sort of manner doe not do justice indeed be mistaken there sir must never augur want of spirit from captain benwicks manner thought particularly pleasing will answer for must generally please well well lady be best judge james benwick be rather too piano for though very likely be partiality sophy can not help thinking frederick manner better than there be something about frederick more to taste anne be caught have only meant to oppose too common idea of spirit gentleness being incompatible with other not at to represent captain benwicks manner a very best must possibly be after little hesitation be beginning to say be not entering into comparison of two friend admiral interrupted with thing be certainly true be not mere bit of gossip have from frederick sister have letter from yesterday in tell of have just have in letter from harville written upon spot from uppercross fancy be at uppercross be opportunity anne must not resist said therefore hope admiral hope there be nothing in style of captain wentworths letter to make mr croft particularly uneasy did seem last autumn a if there be attachment between louisa musgrove hope may be understood to have worn out on side equally without violence hope letter doe not breathe spirit of ill used man not at not at there be not oath murmur from beginning to end anne looked down to hide smile frederick be not man to whine complain have too much spirit for if girl like man better be very fit must have certainly what mean be that hope there be nothing in captain wentworths manner of writing to make suppose think ill used by friend might appear know without being absolutely said must be very sorry that friendship a have subsisted between captain benwick must be destroyed even wounded by circumstance of sort yes yes understand there be nothing at of nature in letter doe not give least fling at benwick doe not so much a say wonder at have reason of own for wondering at must not guess from way of writing that have ever thought of miss whats name for very handsomely hope will be happy together there be nothing very unforgiving in think anne did not receive perfect conviction admiral meant to convey must have be useless to press enquiry farther therefore satisfied herself with common place remark quiet attention admiral have own way poor frederick said at last now must begin over again with somebody else think must get to bath sophy must write beg to come to bath here be pretty girl enough be sure must be of use to go to uppercross again for other miss musgrove find be bespoke by cousin young parson think miss elliot have better try to get to bath chapter xix while admiral croft be taking walk with anne expressing wish of getting captain wentworth to bath captain wentworth be already on way thither before mr croft have written be arrived very next time anne walked out saw mr elliot be attending two cousin mr clay be in milsom street began to rain not much enough to make shelter desirable for woman quite enough to make very desirable for miss elliot to have advantage of being conveyed home in lady dalrymples carriage be seen waiting at little distance anne mr clay therefore turned into mollands while mr elliot stepped to lady dalrymple to request assistance soon joined again successful of course lady dalrymple must be most happy to take home must call for in few minute ladyship carriage be barouche did not hold more than four with comfort miss carteret be with mother consequently be not reasonable to expect accommodation for three camden place lady there must be no doubt a to miss elliot suffered inconvenience must suffer none occupied little time to settle point of civility between other two rain be mere trifle anne be most sincere in preferring walk with mr elliot rain be also mere trifle to mr clay must hardly allow even to drop at boot be so thick much thicker than miss anne in short civility rendered quite a anxious to be left to walk with mr elliot a anne must be be discussed between with generosity so polite so determined that others be obliged to settle for miss elliot maintaining mr clay have little cold already mr elliot deciding on appeal that cousin anne boot be rather thickest be fixed accordingly that mr clay must be of party in carriage have just reached point when anne a sat near window descried most decidedly distinctly captain wentworth walking down street start be perceptible only to herself instantly felt that be greatest simpleton in world most unaccountable absurd for few minute saw nothing before be confusion be lost when have scolded back sens found others still waiting for carriage mr elliot always obliging just setting off for union street on commission of mr clay now felt great inclination to go to outer door wanted to see if rained why be to suspect herself of motive captain wentworth must be out of sight left seat must go one half of must not be always so much wiser than other half always suspecting other of being worse than be must see if rained be sent back however in moment by entrance of captain wentworth among party of gentleman lady evidently acquaintance whom must have joined little below milsom street be more obviously struck confused by sight of than have ever observed before looked quite red for first time since renewed acquaintance felt that be betraying least sensibility of two have advantage of in preparation of last few moment overpowering blinding bewildering first effect of strong surprise be over with still however have enough to feel be agitation pain pleasure something between delight misery spoke to then turned away character of manner be embarrassment must not have called cold friendly anything so certainly a embarrassed after short interval however came towards spoke again mutual enquiry on common subject passed of probably much wiser for what heard anne continuing fully sensible of being le at ease than formerly have by dint of being so very much together got to speak to other with considerable portion of apparent indifference calmness must not do now time have changed louisa have changed there be consciousness of sort other looked very well not a if have be suffering in health spirit talked of uppercross of musgroves nay even of louisa have even momentary look of own arch significance a named yet be captain wentworth not comfortable not easy not able to feign that be did not surprise grieved anne to observe elizabeth must not know saw that saw that elizabeth saw that there be complete internal recognition on side be convinced that be ready to be acknowledged a acquaintance expecting have pain of seeing sister turn away with unalterable coldness lady dalrymples carriage for miss elliot be growing very impatient now drew up servant came in to announce be beginning to rain again altogether there be delay bustle talking must make little crowd in shop understand lady dalrymple be calling to convey miss elliot at last miss elliot friend unattended by servant for there be cousin returned be walking off captain wentworth watching turned again to anne by manner rather than word be offering service to be much obliged to be answer be not going with carriage must not accommodate so many walk prefer walking rain oh very little nothing regard after moment pause said though came only yesterday have equipped properly for bath already see pointing to new umbrella wish must make use of if be determined to walk though think must be more prudent to let get chair be very much obliged to declined repeating conviction that rain must come to nothing at present adding be only waiting for mr elliot will be here in moment be sure have hardly spoken word when mr elliot walked in captain wentworth recollected perfectly there be difference between man who have stood on step at lyme admiring anne a passed except in air look manner of privileged relation friend came in with eagerness appeared to see think only of apologised for stay be grieved to have kept waiting anxious to get away without further loss of time before rain increased in moment walked off together arm under gentle embarrassed glance good morning to being that have time for a passed away a soon a be out of sight lady of captain wentworths party began talking of mr elliot doe not dislike cousin fancy oh be clear enough one can guess what will happen there be always with life in family believe what very good looking man yes miss atkinson who dined with once at

entertainment of evening be just occupation enough have feeling for tender spirit for gay attention for scientific patience for wearisome have never liked concert better at least during first act towards close of in interval succeeding italian song explained word of song to mr elliot have concert bill between said be nearly sense rather meaning of word for certainly sense of italian love song must not be talked of be a nearly meaning a can give for pretend to understand language be very poor italian scholar yes yes see be see know nothing of matter have only knowledge enough of language to translate at sight inverted transposed curtailed italian line into clear comprehensible elegant english need not say anything more of ignorance here be complete proof will not oppose such kind politeness must be sorry to be examined by real proficient have not have pleasure of visiting in camden place so long replied without knowing something of miss anne elliot do regard a one who be too modest for world in general to be aware of half accomplishment too highly accomplished for modesty to be natural in other woman for shame for shame be too much flattery forget what be to have next turning to bill perhaps said mr elliot speaking low have have longer acquaintance with character than be aware of indeed how so can have be acquainted with only since came to bath excepting a might hear previously spoken of in own family knew by report long before came to bath have heard described by who knew intimately have be acquainted with by character many year person disposition accomplishment manner be present to mr elliot be not disappointed in interest hoped to raise one can withstand charm of such mystery to have be described long ago to recent acquaintance by nameless people be irresistible anne be curiosity wondered questioned eagerly in vain delighted in being asked must not tell time other perhaps not now must mention name now such must assure have be fact have many year ago received such description of miss anne elliot a have inspired with highest idea of merit excited warmest curiosity to know anne must think of one so likely to have spoken with partiality of many year ago a mr wentworth of monkford captain wentworths brother might have be in mr elliots company have not courage to ask question name of anne elliot said have long have interesting sound to very long have possessed charm over fancy if dared must breathe wish that name might never change such believed be word scarcely have received sound than attention be caught by other sound immediately behind rendered thing else trivial father lady dalrymple be speaking well looking man said sir walter very well looking man very fine young man indeed said lady dalrymple more air than one often see in bath irish dare say just know name bowing acquaintance wentworth captain wentworth of navy sister married tenant in somersetshire croft who rent kellynch before sir walter have reached point anne eye have caught right direction distinguished captain wentworth standing among cluster of men at little distance a eye fell on seemed to be withdrawn from have that appearance seemed a if have be one moment too late a long a dared observe did not look again performance be recommencing be forced to seem to restore attention to orchestra look straight forward when must give glance have moved away must not have come nearer to if must be so surrounded shut in must rather have caught eye mr elliots speech too distressed have no longer inclination to talk to wished not so near first act be over now hoped for beneficial change after period of nothing saying amongst party of did decide on going in quest of tea anne be one of few who did not choose to move remained in seat so did lady russell have pleasure of getting rid of mr elliot did not mean might feel on lady russell account to shrink from conversation with captain wentworth if gave opportunity be persuaded by lady russell countenance that have seen did not come however anne sometimes fancied discerned at distance never came anxious interval wore away unproductively others returned room filled again bench be reclaimed repossessed hour of pleasure of penance be to be sat out hour of music be to give delight gape a real affected taste for prevailed to anne chiefly wore prospect of hour of agitation must not quit that room in peace without seeing captain wentworth once more without interchange of one friendly look in re settling there be now many change result of be favourable for colonel wallis declined sitting down again mr elliot be invited by elizabeth miss carteret in manner not to be refused to sit between by other removal little scheming of own anne be enabled to place much nearer end of bench than have be before much more within reach of passer by must not do so without comparing with miss larolles inimitable miss larolles still did not with much happier effect though by what seemed prosperity in shape of early abdication in next neighbour found at very end of bench before concert closed such be situation with vacant space at hand when captain wentworth be again in sight saw not far off saw too yet looked grave seemed irresolute only by very slow degree came at last near enough to speak to felt that something must be matter change be indubitable difference between present air what have be in octagon room be strikingly great why be thought of father of lady russell must there have be unpleasant glance began by speaking of concert gravely more like captain wentworth of uppercross owned disappointed have expected singing in short must confess that must not be sorry when be over anne replied spoke in defence of performance so well yet in allowance for feeling so pleasantly that countenance improved replied again with almost smile talked for few minute more improvement held even looked down towards bench a if saw place on well worth occupying when at moment touch on shoulder obliged anne to turn round came from mr elliot begged pardon must be applied to to explain italian again miss carteret be very anxious to have general idea of what be next to be sung anne must not refuse never have sacrificed to politeness with more suffering spirit few minute though a few a possible be inevitably consumed when own mistress again when able to turn look a have done before found accosted by captain wentworth in reserved yet hurried sort of farewell must wish good night be going must get home a fast a must be not song worth staying for said anne suddenly struck by idea made yet more anxious to be encouraging replied impressively there be nothing worth staying for be gone directly jealousy of mr elliot be only intelligible motive captain wentworth jealous of affection must have believed week ago three hour ago for moment gratification be exquisite ala there be very different thought to succeed how be such jealousy to be quieted how be truth to reach how in peculiar disadvantage of respective situation must ever learn of real sentiment be misery to think of mr elliots attention evil be incalculable chapter xxi anne recollected with pleasure next morning promise of going to mr smith meaning that must engage from home at time when mr elliot must be most likely to call for to avoid mr elliot be almost first object felt great deal of good will towards in spite of mischief of attention owed gratitude regard perhaps compassion must not help thinking much of extraordinary circumstance attending acquaintance of right seemed to have to interest by everything in situation by own sentiment by early prepossession be altogether very extraordinary flattering painful there be much to regret how might have felt have there be captain wentworth in case be not worth enquiry for there be captain wentworth be conclusion of present suspense good bad affection must be for ever union believed must not divide more from other men than final separation prettier musing of high wrought love eternal constancy must never have passed along street of bath than anne be sporting with from camden place to westgate building be almost enough to spread purification perfume way be sure of pleasant reception friend seemed morning particularly obliged to for coming seemed hardly to have expected though have be appointment account of concert be immediately claimed anne recollection of concert be quite happy enough to animate feature make rejoice to talk of that must tell told most gladly be little for one who have be there unsatisfactory for such enquirer a mr smith who have already heard through short cut of laundress waiter rather more of general success produce of evening than anne must relate who now asked in vain for several particular of company everybody of consequence notoriety in bath be well know by name to mr little durands be there conclude said with mouth open to catch music like unfledged sparrow ready to be fed never miss concert yes did not see heard mr elliot say be in room ibbotsons be there two new beauty with tall irish officer who be talked of for one of know think be old lady mary maclean need not ask after never miss know must have seen must have be in own circle for a went with lady dalrymple be in seat of grandeur round orchestra of course be what dreaded must have be very unpleasant to in respect happily lady dalrymple always chooses to be farther off be exceedingly well placed be for hearing must not say for seeing because appear to have seen very little oh saw enough for own amusement can understand there be sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in crowd have be large party in yourselves wanted nothing beyond ought to have looked about more said anne conscious while spoke that there have in fact be want of looking about that object only have be deficient be better employed need not tell that have pleasant evening see in eye perfectly see how hour passed that have always something agreeable to listen to in interval of concert be conversation anne half smiled said do see that in eye yes do countenance perfectly informs that be in company last night with person whom think most agreeable in world person who interest at present time more than rest of world put together blush overspread anne cheek must say nothing such being case continued mr smith after short pause hope believe that do know how to value kindness in coming to morning be really very good of to come sit with when must have so many pleasanter demand upon time anne heard nothing of be still in astonishment confusion excited by friend penetration unable to imagine how report of captain wentworth must have reached after short silence pray said mr smith be mr elliot aware of acquaintance with doe know be in bath mr elliot repeated anne looking up surprised moment reflection shewed mistake have be under caught instantaneously recovering courage with feeling of safety soon added more composedly be acquainted with mr elliot have be good deal acquainted with replied mr smith gravely seems worn out now be great while since met be not at aware of never mentioned before have known must have have pleasure of talking to about to confess truth said mr smith assuming usual air of cheerfulness be exactly pleasure want to have want to talk about to mr elliot want interest with can be of essential service to if must have goodness dear miss elliot to make object to yourself of course be done must be extremely happy hope can not doubt willingness to be of even slightest use to replied anne suspect that be considering a having higher claim on mr elliot greater right to influence than be really case be sure have somehow other imbibed such notion must consider only a mr elliots relation if in light there be anything suppose cousin might fairly ask of beg must not hesitate to employ mr smith gave penetrating glance then smiling said have be little premature perceive beg pardon ought to have waited for official information now dear miss elliot a old friend do give hint a to when may speak next week to be sure by next week may be allowed to think settled build own selfish scheme on mr elliots good fortune replied anne next week next next assure that nothing of sort be thinking of will be settled week be not going to marry mr elliot must like to know why imagine be mr smith looked at again looked earnestly smiled shook head exclaimed now how do wish understood how do wish knew what be at have great idea that design to be cruel when right moment occurs till doe come know woman never mean to have anybody be thing of course among man be refused till offer why must be cruel let plead for mypresent friend can not call for former friend where can look for more suitable match where must expect more gentlemanlike agreeable man let recommend mr elliot be sure hear nothing good of from colonel wallis who can know better than colonel wallis dear mr smith mr elliots wife have not be dead much above year ought not to be supposed to be paying address to one oh if be only objection cried mr smith archly mr elliot be safe will give more trouble about forget when be married thats let know to be friend of yours then will think little of trouble required be very natural for now with so many affair engagement of own to avoid get rid of a can very natural perhaps ninety nine out of hundred must do same of course can not be aware of importance to well dear miss elliot hope trust will be very happy mr elliot have sense to understand value of such woman peace will not be shipwrecked a mine have be be safe in worldly matter safe in character will not be led astray will not be misled by others to ruin said anne can readily believe that of cousin seems to have calm decided temper not at open to dangerous impression consider with great respect have reason from thing have fallen within observation to do otherwise have not known long be not man think to be known intimately soon will not manner of speaking of mr smith convince that be nothing to surely must be calm enough upon word be nothing to must ever propose to have very little reason to imagine have thought of doing will not accept assure will not assure mr elliot have not share have be supposing in pleasure concert of last night might afford not mr elliot be not mr elliot that stopped regretting with deep blush that have implied so much le must hardly have be sufficient mr smith must hardly have believed so soon in mr elliots failure from perception of there being somebody else a be instantly submitted with semblance of seeing nothing beyond anne eager to escape farther notice be impatient to know why mr smith must have fancied be to marry mr elliot where must have received idea from whom must have heard do tell how first came into head first came into head replied mr smith upon finding how much be together feeling to be most probable thing in world to be wished for by everybody belonging to of may depend upon that acquaintance have disposed of in same way never heard spoken of till two day ago have indeed be spoken of did observe woman who opened door to when called yesterday be not mr speed a usual maid observed one in particular be friend mr rooke nurse rooke who by bye have great curiosity to see be delighted to be in way to let in came away from marlborough building only on sunday be who told be to marry mr elliot have have from mr wallis did not seem bad authority sat hour with on monday evening gave whole history whole history repeated anne laughing must not make very long history think of one such little article of unfounded news mr smith said nothing continued anne presently though there be truth in having claim on mr elliot must be extremely happy to be of use to in way must will mention to being in bath will take message thank certainly not in warmth of moment under mistaken impression might perhaps have endeavoured to interest in circumstance not now thank have nothing to trouble with think spoke of having known mr elliot many year did not before be married suppose yes be not married when knew first andwere much acquainted intimately indeed then do tell what be at time of life have great curiosity to know what mr elliot be a very young man be at such a appears now have not seen mr elliot three year be mr smith answer given so gravely that be impossible to pursue subject farther anne felt that have gained nothing increase of curiosity be silent mr smith very thoughtful at last beg pardon dear miss elliot cried in natural tone of cordiality beg pardon for short answer have be giving have be uncertain what ought to do have be doubting considering a to what ought to tell there be many thing to be taken into account one hate to be officious to be giving bad impression making mischief even smooth surface of family union seems worth preserving though there may be nothing durable beneath however have determined think be right think ought to be made acquainted with mr elliots real character though fully believe that at present have not smallest intention of accepting there be saying what may happen might time other be differently affected towards hear truth therefore now while be unprejudiced mr elliot be man without heart conscience designing wary cold blooded being who think only of whom for own interest ease must be guilty of cruelty treachery must be perpetrated without risk of general character have feeling for others whom have be chief cause of leading into ruin can neglect desert without smallest compunction be totally beyond reach of sentiment of justice compassion oh be black at heart hollow black anne astonished air exclamation of wonder made pause in calmer manner added expression startle must allow for injured angry woman will try to command will not abuse will only tell have found fact will speak be intimate friend of dear husband who trusted loved thought a good a intimacy have be formed before marriage found most intimate friend too became excessively pleased with mr elliot entertained highest opinion of at nineteen know one doe not think very seriously mr elliot appeared to quite a good a others much more agreeable than most others be almost always together be principally in town living in very good style be then inferior in circumstance be then poor one have chamber in temple be a much a must do to support appearance of gentleman have always home with whenever chose be always welcome be like brother poor charles who have finest most generous spirit in world must have divided last farthing with know that purse be open to know that often assisted must have be about very period of mr elliots life said anne have always excited particular curiosity must have be about same time that became known to father sister never knew only heard of there be something in conduct then with regard to father sister afterwards in circumstance of marriage never must quite reconcile with present time seemed to announce different sort of man know know cried mr smith have be introduced to sir walter sister before be acquainted with heard speak of for ever know be invited encouraged know did not choose to go can satisfy perhaps on point must little expect a to marriage knew about at time be privy to fors againsts be friend to whom confided hope plan though did not know wife previously inferior situation in society indeed rendered that impossible yet knew life afterwards at least till within last two year of life can answer question may wish to put nay said anne have particular enquiry to make about have always understood be not happy couple must like to know why at time of life must slight father acquaintance a did father be certainly disposed to take very kind proper notice of why did mr elliot draw back mr elliot replied mr smith at period of life have one object in view to make fortune by rather quicker process than law be determined to make by marriage be determined at least not to mar by imprudent marriage know be belief whether justly not of course can not decide that father sister in civility invitation be designing match between heir young lady be impossible that match must have answered idea of wealth independence be motive for drawing back can assure told whole story have concealment with be curious that having just left behind in bath first principal acquaintance on marrying must be cousin that through must be continually hearing of father sister described one miss elliot thought very affectionately of other perhaps cried anne struck by sudden idea sometimes spoke of to mr elliot to be sure did very often used to boast of own anne elliot vouch for being very different creature from checked just in time account for something mr elliot said last night cried anne explains found have be used to hear of must not comprehend how what wild imagination one form where dear self be concerned how sure to be mistaken beg pardon have interrupted mr elliot married then completely for money circumstance probably first opened eye to character mr smith hesitated little here oh thing be too common when one life in world man woman marrying for money be too common to strike one a ought be very young associated only with young be thoughtless gay set without strict rule of conduct lived for enjoyment think differently now time sickness sorrow have given other notion at period must own saw nothing reprehensible in what mr elliot be doing to do best for passed a duty be not very low woman yes objected to must not regard money money be that wanted father be grazier grandfather have be butcher be nothing be fine woman have have decent education be brought forward by cousin thrown by chance into mr elliots company fell in love with not difficulty scruple be there on side with respect to birth caution be spent in being secured of real amount of fortune before committed depend upon esteem mr elliot may have for own situation in life now a young man have not smallest value for chance for kellynch estate be something honour of family held a cheap a dirt have often heard declare that if baronetcy be saleable anybody must have for fifty pound arm motto name livery included will not pretend to repeat half used to hear say on subject must not be fair yet ought to have proof for what be assertion will have proof indeed dear mr smith want none cried anne have asserted nothing contradictory to what mr elliot appeared to be year ago be in confirmation rather of what used to hear believe be more curious to know why must be so different now for satisfaction if will have goodness to ring for mary stay be sure will have still greater goodness of going into bedroom bringing small inlaid box will find on upper shelf of closet anne seeing friend to be earnestly bent on did a be desired box be brought placed before mr smith sighing over a unlocked said be full of paper belonging to to husband small portion only of what have to look over when lost letter be looking for be one written by mr elliot to before marriage happened to be saved why one can hardly imagine be careless immethodical like other men about thing when came to examine paper found with others still more trivial from different people scattered here there while many letter memorandum of real importance have be destroyed here be must not burn because being even then very little satisfied with mr elliot be determined to preserve document of former intimacy have now motive for being glad can produce be letter directed to charles smith esq tunbridge well dated from london a far back a july dear smith have received yours kindness almost overpowers wish nature have made such heart a yours more common have lived three twenty year in world have seen none like at present believe have need of service being in cash again give joy have got rid of sir walter miss be gone back to kellynch almost made swear to visit summer first visit to kellynch will be with surveyor to tell how to bring with best advantage to hammer baronet nevertheless be not unlikely to marry again be quite fool enough if doe however will leave in peace may be decent equivalent for reversion be worse than last year wish have name elliot be sick of name of walter can drop thank god desire will never insult with second w again meaning for rest of life to be only yours truly wm elliot such letter must not be read without putting anne in glow mr smith observing high colour in face said language know be highly disrespectful though have forgot exact term have perfect impression of general meaning show man mark profession to poor husband can thing be stronger anne must not immediately get over shock mortification of finding such word applied to father be obliged to recollect that seeing letter be violation of law of honour that one ought to be judged to be known by such testimony that private correspondence must bear eye of others before must recover calmness enough to return letter have be meditating over say thank be full proof undoubtedly proof of thing be saying why be acquainted with now can explain too cried mr smith smiling can really yes have shewn mr elliot a be dozen year ago will shew a be now can not produce written proof again can give a authentic oral testimony a can desire of what be now wanting what be now doing be hypocrite now truly want to marry present attention to family be very sincere quite from heart will give authority friend colonel wallis colonel wallis be acquainted with doe not come to in quite so direct line a that take bend two nothing of consequence stream be a good a at first little rubbish collect in turning be easily moved away mr elliot talk unreservedly to colonel wallis of view on said colonel wallis imagine to be in sensible careful discerning sort of character colonel wallis have very pretty silly wife to whom tell thing have better not repeat to in overflowing spirit of recovery repeat to nurse nurse knowing acquaintance with very naturally brings to on monday evening good friend mr rooke let thus much into secret of marlborough building when talked of whole history therefore see be not romancing so much a supposed dear mr smith authority be deficient will not do mr elliots having view on will not in least account for effort made towards reconciliation with father be prior to coming to bath found on most friendly term when arrived know did know perfectly indeed mr smith must not expect to get real information in such line fact opinion be to pas through hand of so many to be misconceived by folly in one ignorance in can hardly have much truth left only give hearing will soon be able to judge of general credit due by listening to particular can yourself immediately contradict confirm nobody supposes that be first inducement have seen indeed before came to bath admired without knowing to be so say historian at least be true did see last summer autumn somewhere down in west to use own word without knowing to be certainly did so far be very true at lyme happened to be at lyme well continued mr smith triumphantly grant friend credit due to establishment of first point asserted saw then at lyme liked so well a to be exceedingly pleased to meet with again in camden place a miss anne elliot from moment have doubt have double motive in visit there there be earlier will now explain if there be anything in story know to be either false improbable stop account state that sister friend lady now staying with whom have heard mention came to bath with miss elliot sir walter a long ago a september in short when first came have be staying there ever since be clever insinuating handsome woman poor plausible altogether such in situation manner a to give general idea among sir walter acquaintance of meaning to be lady elliot a general surprise miss elliot must be apparently blind to danger here mr smith paused moment anne have not word to say continued be light in appeared to who knew family long before returned to colonel wallis have eye upon father enough to be sensible of though did not then visit in camden place regard for mr elliot gave interest in watching be going on there when mr elliot came to bath for day two a happened to do little before christmas colonel wallis made acquainted with appearance of thing report beginning to prevail now be to understand time have worked very material change in mr elliots opinion a to value of baronetcy upon point of blood connexion be completely altered man having long have a much money a must spend nothing to wish for on side of avarice indulgence have be gradually learning to pin happiness upon consequence be heir to thought coming on before acquaintance ceased be now confirmed feeling can not bear idea of not being sir william may guess therefore that news heard from friend must not be very agreeable may guess what produced resolution of coming back to bath a soon a possible of fixing here for time with view of renewing former acquaintance recovering such footing in family a might give mean of ascertaining degree of danger of circumventing lady if found material be agreed upon between two friend a only thing to be done colonel wallis be to assist in way that must be to be introduced mr wallis be to be introduced everybody be to be introduced mr elliot came

did move quietly to window be just in time to ascertain that really be mr elliot have never believed before disappeared on one side a mr clay walked quickly off on other checking surprise must not feel at appearance of friendly conference between two person of totally opposite interest calmly said yes be mr elliot certainly have changed hour of going suppose be may be mistaken might not attend

charles be not one of who neglect reigning power to bow to rising sun if must not go for sake of father must think scandalous to go for sake of heir what be mr elliot to careless expression be life to anne who saw that captain wentworth be attention looking listening with whole soul that last word brought enquiring eye from charles to herself charles mary still talked on in same style half serious half jesting maintaining scheme for play invariably serious most warmly opposing not omitting to make known that however determined to go to camden place must not think very well used if went to play without mr musgrove interposed have better put off charles have much better go back change box for tuesday must be pity to be divided must be losing miss anne too if there be party at father be sure henrietta must care at for play if miss anne must not be with anne felt truly obliged to for such kindness quite a much so for opportunity gave of decidedly saying if depended only on inclination maam party at home excepting on mary account must not be smallest impediment have pleasure in sort of meeting must be too happy to change for play with have better not be attempted perhaps have spoken trembled when be done conscious that word be listened to daring not even to try to observe effect be soon generally agreed that tuesday must be day charles only reserving advantage of still teasing wife by persisting that must go to play to morrow if nobody else must captain wentworth left seat walked to fire place probably for sake of walking away from soon afterwards taking station with le bare faced design by anne have not be long enough in bath said to enjoy evening party of place oh usual character of have nothing for be card player be not formerly know did not use to like card time make many change be not yet so much changed cried anne stopped fearing hardly knew what misconstruction after waiting few moment said a if be result of immediate feeling be period indeed eight year

to make use of present leisure for getting out calling on companion to lose time lest somebody else must come in be obliged to move anne talked of being perfectly ready tried to look felt must henrietta have known regret reluctance of heart in quitting chair in preparing to quit room must have found in own sensation for cousin in very security of affection wherewith to pity preparation however be stopped short alarming sound be heard other visitor approached door be thrown open for sir walter miss elliot whose entrance seemed to give general chill anne felt instant oppression wherever looked saw symptom of same comfort freedom gaiety of room be over hushed into cold composure determined silence insipid talk to meet heartless elegance of father sister how mortifying to feel that be so jealous eye be satisfied in one particular captain wentworth be acknowledged again by by elizabeth more graciously than before even addressed once looked at more than once elizabeth be in fact revolving great measure sequel explained after waste of few minute in saying proper nothing began to give invitation be to comprise remaining due of musgroves to morrow evening to meet few friend formal party be said very gracefully card with have provided miss elliot at home be laid on table with courteous comprehensive smile to one smile one card more decidedly for captain wentworth truth be that elizabeth have be long enough in bath to understand importance of man of such air appearance a past be nothing present be that captain wentworth must move about well in drawing room card be pointedly given sir walter elizabeth arose disappeared interruption have be short though severe ease animation returned to most of left a door shut out not to anne must think only of invitation have with such astonishment witnessed of manner in have be received manner of doubtful meaning of surprise rather than gratification of polite acknowledgement rather than acceptance knew saw disdain in eye must not venture to believe that have determined to accept offering a atonement for insolence of past spirit sank held card in hand after be gone a if deeply considering only think of elizabeth including everybody whispered mary very audibly wonder captain wentworth be delighted see can not put card out of hand anne caught eye saw cheek glow mouth form into momentary expression of contempt turned away that might neither see hear more to vex party separated gentleman have own pursuit lady proceeded on own business met more while anne belonged to be earnestly begged to return dine give rest of day spirit have be so long exerted that at present felt unequal to more fit only for home where might be sure of being a silent a chose promising to be with whole of following morning therefore closed fatigue of present by toilsome walk to camden place there to spend evening chiefly in listening to busy arrangement of elizabeth mr clay for morrow party frequent enumeration of person invited continually improving detail of embellishment be to make most completely elegant of kind in bath while harassing with never ending question of whether captain wentworth must come not be reckoning a certain with be gnawing solicitude never appeased for five minute together generally thought must come because generally thought ought be case must not so shape into positive act of duty discretion a inevitably to defy suggestion of very opposite feeling only roused from brooding of restless agitation to let mr clay know that have be seen with mr elliot three hour after being supposed to be out of bath for having watched in vain for intimation of interview from lady determined to mention seemed to there be guilt in mr clay face a listened be transient cleared away in instant anne must imagine read there consciousness of having by complication of mutual trick overbearing authority of be obliged to attend perhaps for hour to lecture restriction on design on sir walter exclaimed however with very tolerable imitation of nature oh dear very true only think miss elliot to great surprise met with mr elliot in bath street be never more astonished turned back walked with to pump yard have be prevented setting off for thornberry really forget by what for be in hurry must not much attend can only answer for being determined not to be delayed in return wanted to know how early

chapter xxiii one day only have passed since anne conversation with mr smith keener interest have succeeded be now so little touched by mr elliots conduct except by effect in one quarter that became matter of course next morning still to defer explanatory visit in river street have promised to be with musgroves from breakfast to dinner faith be plighted mr elliots character like sultaness scheherazades head must live day must not keep appointment punctually however weather be unfavourable have grieved over rain on friend account felt very much on own before be able to attempt walk when reached white hart made way to proper apartment found arriving quite in time first to arrive party before be mr musgrove talking to mr croft captain harville to captain wentworth immediately heard that mary henrietta too impatient to wait have gone out moment have cleared must be back again soon that strictest injunction have be left with mr musgrove to keep there till returned have only to submit sit down be outwardly composed feel plunged at once in agitation have merely laid account of tasting little before morning closed there be delay waste of time be deep in happiness of such misery misery of such happiness instantly two minute after entering room captain wentworth said will write letter be talking of harville now if will give material material be at hand on separate table went to nearly turning back to be engrossed by writing mr musgrove be giving mr croft history of eldest daughter engagement just in inconvenient tone of voice be perfectly audible while pretended to be whisper anne felt that did not belong to conversation yet a captain harville seemed thoughtful not disposed to talk must not avoid hearing many undesirable particular such a how mr musgrove brother hayter have met again again to talk over what brother hayter have said one day what mr musgrove have proposed next what have occurred to sister hayter what young people have wished what said at first never must consent to be afterwards persuaded to think might do very well great deal in same style of open hearted communication minutia even with advantage of taste delicacy good mr musgrove must not give must be properly interesting only to principal mr croft be attending with great good humour whenever spoke at be very sensibly anne hoped gentleman might be too much self occupied to hear so maam

near a bad so thought have better marry at once make best of a many others have done before at rate said will be better than long engagement be precisely what be going to observe cried mr croft must rather have young people settle on small income at once have to struggle with few difficulty together than be involved in long engagement always think that mutual oh dear mr croft cried mr musgrove unable to let finish speech there be nothing so abominate for young people a long engagement be what always protested against for child be very well used to say for young people to be engaged if there be certainty of being able to marry in six month even in twelve long engagement yes dear maam said mr croft uncertain engagement engagement may be long to begin without knowing at time there will be mean of marrying hold to be very unsafe unwise what think parent must prevent a far a can anne found unexpected interest here felt application to felt in nervous thrill over at same moment that eye instinctively glanced towards distant table captain wentworths pen ceased to move head be raised pausing listening turned round next instant to give look one quick conscious look at two lady continued to talk to re urge same admitted truth enforce with such example of ill effect of contrary practice a have fallen within observation anne heard nothing distinctly be only buzz of word in ear mind be in confusion captain harville who have in truth be hearing none of now left seat moved to window anne seeming to watch though be from thorough absence of mind became gradually sensible that be

from thinking bad match for on contrary when saw more of captain wentworth saw repeatedly by daylight eyed well be very much struck by personal claim felt that superiority of appearance might be not

propriety correctness general politeness suavity have be too quick in receiving a certain result of most correct opinion well regulated mind there be nothing le for lady russell to do than to admit that have be pretty completely wrong to take up new set of opinion of hope there be quickness of perception in nicety in discernment of character natural penetration in short experience in others can equal lady russell have be le gifted in part of understanding than young friend be very good woman if second object be to be sensible well judging first be to see anne happy loved anne better than
