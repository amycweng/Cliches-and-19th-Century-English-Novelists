madame d'arblay forerunner if not model of miss austen be sentence at first sight suggests relationship to name of book in present series inaugurated miss austen novel whole of unfortunate business ' say certain didactic dr lyster talking in capital towards end of volume three of cecilia be result of pride prejudice ' looking to admitted familiarity of miss austen with madame d'arblay work have be concluded that miss austen borrowed from cecilia title of second novel here come in little problem to have referred pride prejudice be true be written finished before sense sensibility original title for several year being first impression then in author fell to work upon older essay in letter la richardson called elinor marianne re christened sense sensibility a know be first published book may be connection between title of pride prejudice passage in cecilia there be obvious connection between title of pride prejudice title of sense sensibility if miss austen re christened elinor marianne before changed title of first impression a well may have be extremely unlikely that name of pride prejudice have anything to do with cecilia besides have be published at least twenty year before upon whole therefore be most likely that passage in madame d'arblay be mere coincidence in sense sensibility a well a in novel succeeded in publication miss austen after fashion of old morality play simply substituted leading characteristic of principal personage for name indeed in sense sensibility sense of elinor sensibility rather sensiblerie of marianne be markedly emphasised in opening page of book

about recasting elinor marianne then composed in form of letter have sooner accomplished task than began northanger abbey must be interesting to know to what extent remodelled sense sensibility in for be told that previous to publication in again devoted considerable time to preparation for press be clear that doe not mean correction of proof alone also preliminary revision of m especially must be

occasion of visit to brother in london in spring of mr t egerton of beilitary library whitehall dawned upon horizon a practicable publisher by time sense sensibility left press miss austen be again domiciled at chawton cottage for accustomed to swarming review of day with babel of notice may seem strange that there must be record of effect produced seeing that a already stated book sold well enough to enable putter forth to hand over to author what mr gargery in great expectation must have described a ' cool ' surely mr egerton who have visited miss austen at sloane street must have later conveyed to intelligence of way in work have be welcomed by public if did be no longer discoverable mr austen leigh first best biographer must find account either of publication of author feeling

with pride prejudice in leading character be also two sister that ass depress merit elinor marianne of sense sensibility be only inferior when be contrasted with elizabeth jane of pride prejudice even then be probably because personally like handsome amiable jane bennet rather better than obsolete survival of sentimental novel represented by marianne dashwood darcy bingley again be much more 'likeable ' to use lady queensberry word than colourless edward ferrars stiff jointed colonel brandon yet might not unfairly be contended that there be more fidelity to what mr thomas hardy have termed 'life little irony in miss austen disposal of two miss dashwoods than there be in disposal of heroine of pride prejudice one doe not get bingley darcy with park good many sensible girl like elinor pair off contentedly with poor creature like edward ferrars while not few enthusiast like marianne decline at last upon middle aged colonel with flannel waistcoat george eliot fancy must have

not killed in civil war because 'he be sent out of field upon private message day before battle of worcester ' of local colouring there be a little in sense sensibility a in pride prejudice be not unlikely that memory of steventon may survive in norland may be noted that there be actually barton place to north of exeter not far from lord iddesleigh well known seat of upton pynes be scarcely

recommended with strength urgency illness must command interest of mother in law sister mr john dashwood have not strong feeling of rest of family be affected by recommendation of such nature at time promised to do thing in power to make comfortable father be rendered easy by such assurance mr john dashwood have then leisure to consider how much there might prudently be in power to do for illustration son son child of four year old be not ill disposed young man unless to be rather cold hearted rather selfish be to be ill disposed be in general well respected for conducted with propriety in discharge of ordinary duty have married more amiable woman might have be made still more respectable than be might even have be made amiable for be very young when married very fond of wife mr john dashwood be strong caricature of more narrow minded selfish when gave promise to father meditated within to increase fortune of sister by present of thousand pound piece then really thought equal to prospect of four thousand year in addition to present income besides remaining half of own mother fortune warmed heart made feel capable of generosity yes must give three thousand pound must be liberal handsome must be enough to make completely easy three thousand pound must spare so considerable sum with little inconvenience thought of day long for many day successively did not repent sooner be father funeral over than mr john dashwood without sending notice of intention to mother in law arrived with child attendant one must dispute right to come house be husband from moment of father decease indelicacy of conduct be so much greater to woman in mr dashwood situation with only common feeling must have be highly unpleasing in mind there be sense of honor so keen generosity so romantic that offence of kind by whomsoever given received be to source of immovable disgust mr john dashwood have never be favourite with of husband family have have opportunity till present of showing with how little attention to comfort of other people must act when occasion required so acutely did mr dashwood feel ungracious behaviour so earnestly did despise daughter in law for on arrival of latter must have quitted house for ever have not entreaty of eldest girl induced first to reflect on propriety of going own tender love for three child determined afterwards to stay for sake avoid breach with brother elinor eldest daughter whose advice be so effectual possessed strength of understanding coolness of judgment qualified though only nineteen to be counsellor of mother enabled frequently to counteract to advantage of that eagerness of mind in mr dashwood must generally have led to imprudence have excellent heart disposition be affectionate feeling be strong knew how to govern be knowledge mother have yet to learn one of sister have resolved never to be taught marianne ability be in many respect quite equal to elinor be sensible clever eager in everything sorrow joy must have moderation be generous amiable interesting be everything prudent resemblance between mother be strikingly great elinor saw with concern excess of sister sensibility by mr dashwood be valued cherished encouraged other now in violence of affliction agony of grief overpowered at first be voluntarily renewed be sought for be created again again gave up wholly to sorrow seeking increase of wretchedness in reflection must afford resolved against ever admitting consolation in future elinor too be deeply afflicted still must struggle must exert must consult with brother must receive sister in law on arrival treat with proper attention must strive to rouse mother to similar exertion encourage to similar forbearance margaret other sister be good humored well disposed girl a have already imbibed good deal of marianne romance without having much of sense did not at thirteen bid fair to equal sister at more advanced period of life chapter ii mr john dashwood now installed mistress of norland mother sister in law be degraded to condition of visitor a such however be treated by with quiet civility by husband with a much kindness a must feel towards anybody beyond wife child really pressed with earnestness to consider norland a home a plan appeared so eligible to mr dashwood a remaining there till must accommodate with house in neighbourhood invitation be accepted continuance in place where everything reminded of former delight be exactly what suited mind in season of cheerfulness temper must be more cheerful than hers posse in greater degree that sanguine expectation of happiness be happiness in sorrow must be equally carried away by fancy a far beyond consolation a in pleasure be beyond alloy mr john dashwood did not at approve of what husband intended to do for sister to take three thousand pound from fortune of dear little boy must be impoverishing to most dreadful degree begged to think again on subject how must answer to to rob child only child too of so large sum what possible claim must miss dashwoods who be related to only by half blood considered a relationship at have on generosity to so large amount be very well known that affection be ever supposed to exist between child of man by different marriage why be to ruin poor little harry by giving away money to half sister be father last request to replied husband must assist widow daughter did not know what be talking of dare say ten to one be light headed at time have be in right sens must not have thought of such thing a begging to give away fortune from own child did not stipulate for particular sum dear fanny only requested in general term to assist make situation more comfortable than be in power to do perhaps must have be a well if have left wholly to myself must hardly suppose must neglect a required promise must not do le than give at least thought so at time promise therefore be given must be performed something must be done for whenever leave settle in new home well then let something be done for that something need not be three thousand pound consider added that when money be once parted with never can return sister will marry will be gone for ever if indeed must be restored to poor little boy why to be sure said husband very gravely that must make great difference time may come when harry will regret that so large sum be parted with if must have numerous family for instance must be very convenient addition to be sure must perhaps then must be better for party if sum be diminished one half five hundred pound must be prodigious increase to fortune oh beyond anything great what brother on earth must do half so much for sister even if really sister a be only half blood have generous spirit must not wish to do thing mean replied one have rather on such occasion do too much than too little one at least can think have not done enough for even can hardly expect more there be knowing what may expect said lady be not to think of expectation question be what can afford to do certainly think may afford to give five hundred pound piece a be without addition of mine will have about three thousand pound on mother death very comfortable fortune for young woman to be sure be indeed strike that can want addition at will have ten thousand pound divided amongst if marry will be sure of doing well if may live very comfortably together on interest of ten thousand pound be very true therefore know whether upon whole must not be more advisable to do something for mother while life rather than for something of annuity kind mean sister must feel good effect of a well a hundred year must make perfectly comfortable wife hesitated little however in giving consent to plan to be sure said be better than parting with fifteen hundred pound at once then if mr dashwood must live fifteen year will be completely taken in fifteen year dear fanny life can not be worth half purchase certainly not if observe people always live for ever when there be annuity to be paid be very stout healthy hardly forty annuity be very serious business come over over year there be getting rid of be not aware of what be doing have known great deal of trouble of annuity for mother be clogged with payment of three to old superannuated servant by father will be amazing how disagreeable found twice year annuity be to be paid then there be trouble of getting to then one of be said to have died afterwards turned out to be such thing mother be quite sick of income be not own said with such perpetual claim on be more unkind in father because otherwise money must have be entirely at mother disposal without restriction whatever have given such abhorrence of annuity be sure must not pin down to payment of one for world be certainly unpleasant thing replied mr dashwood to have kind of yearly drain on one income one fortune a mother justly say be not one own to be tied down to regular payment of such sum on rent day be by mean desirable take away one independence undoubtedly after have thanks for think secure do more than what be expected raise gratitude at if be did must be done at own discretion entirely must not bind to allow thing yearly may be very inconvenient year to spare hundred even fifty pound from own expense believe be right love will be better that there must be annuity in case may give occasionally will be of far greater assistance than yearly allowance because must only enlarge style of living if felt sure of larger income must not be sixpence richer for at end of year will certainly be much best way present of fifty pound now then will prevent ever being distressed for money will think be amply discharging promise to father to be sure will indeed to say truth be convinced within that father have idea of giving money at assistance thought of dare say be only such a might be reasonably expected of for instance such a looking out for comfortable small house for helping to move thing sending present of fish game so forth whenever be in season will lay life that meant nothing farther indeed must be very strange unreasonable if did do consider dear mr dashwood how excessively comfortable mother in law daughter may live on interest of seven thousand pound besides thousand pound belonging to of girl brings in fifty pound year piece of course will pay mother for board out of altogether will have five hundred year amongst what on earth can four woman want for more than that will live so cheap housekeeping will be nothing at will have carriage horse hardly servant will keep company can have expense of kind only conceive how comfortable will be five hundred year be sure can not imagine how will spend half of a to giving more be quite absurd to think of will be much more able to give something upon word said mr dashwood believe be perfectly right father certainly must mean nothing more by request to than what say clearly understand now will strictly fulfil engagement by such act of assistance kindness to a have described when mother remove into house service will be readily given to accommodate a far a can little present of furniture too may be acceptable then certainly returned mr john dashwood however one thing must be considered when father mother moved to norland though furniture of stanhill be sold china plate linen be saved be now left to mother house will therefore be almost completely fitted up a soon a take be material consideration undoubtedly valuable legacy indeed yet of plate must have be very pleasant addition to own stock here yes set of breakfast china be twice a handsome a what belongs to house great deal too handsome in opinion for place can ever afford to live in however so be father thought only of must say owe particular gratitude to attention to wish for very well know that if must must have left almost everything in world to argument be irresistible gave to intention of decision be wanting before finally resolved that must be absolutely unnecessary if not highly indecorous to do more for widow child of father than such kind of neighbourly act a own wife pointed out chapter iii mr dashwood remained at norland several month not from disinclination to move when sight of well known spot ceased to raise violent emotion produced for while for when spirit began to revive mind became capable of other exertion than of heightening affliction by melancholy remembrance be impatient to be gone indefatigable in inquiry for suitable dwelling in neighbourhood of norland for to remove far from beloved spot be impossible must hear of situation at once answered notion of comfort ease suited prudence of eldest daughter whose steadier judgment rejected several house a too large for income mother must have approved illustration can not imagine how will spend half of mr dashwood have be informed by husband of solemn promise on part of son in favour gave comfort to last earthly reflection doubted sincerity of assurance no more than have doubted thought of for daughter sake with satisfaction though a for herself be persuaded that much smaller provision than l must support in affluence for brother sake too for sake of own heart rejoiced reproached for being unjust to merit before in believing incapable of generosity attentive behaviour to herself sister convinced that welfare be dear to for long time firmly relied on liberality of intention contempt have very early in acquaintance felt for daughter in law be very much increased by farther knowledge of character year residence in family afforded perhaps in spite of consideration of politeness maternal affection on side of former two lady might have found impossible to have lived together so long have not particular circumstance occurred to give still greater eligibility according to opinion of mr dashwood to daughter continuance at norland circumstance be growing attachment between eldest girl brother of mr john dashwood gentlemanlike pleasing young man who be introduced to acquaintance soon after sister establishment at norland who have since spent greatest part of time there mother might have encouraged intimacy from motif of interest for edward ferrars be eldest son of man who have died very rich might have repressed from motif of prudence for except trifling sum whole of fortune depended on will of mother mr dashwood be alike uninfluenced by consideration be enough for that appeared to be amiable that loved daughter that elinor returned partiality be contrary to doctrine of difference of fortune must keep couple asunder who be attracted by resemblance of disposition that elinor merit must not be acknowledged by one who knew be to comprehension impossible edward ferrars be not recommended to good opinion by peculiar grace of person address be not handsome manner required intimacy to make pleasing be too diffident to do justice to when natural shyness be overcome behaviour gave indication of open affectionate heart understanding be good education have given solid improvement be neither fitted by ability disposition to answer wish of mother sister who longed to see distinguished a hardly knew what wanted to make fine figure in world in manner other mother wished to interest in political concern to get into parliament to see connected with of great men of day mr john dashwood wished likewise in mean while till one of superior blessing must be attained must have quieted ambition to see driving barouche edward have turn for great men barouche wish centered in domestic comfort quiet of private life fortunately have younger brother who be more promising edward have be staying several week in house before engaged much of mr dashwood attention for be at time in such affliction a rendered careless of surrounding object saw only that be quiet unobtrusive liked for did not disturb wretchedness of mind by ill timed conversation be first called to observe approve farther by reflection elinor chanced one day to make on difference between sister be contrast recommended most forcibly to mother be enough said to say that be unlike fanny be enough implies everything amiable love already think will like said elinor when know more of like replied mother with smile feel sentiment of approbation inferior to love may esteem have never yet known what be to separate esteem love mr dashwood now took pain to get acquainted with manner be attaching soon banished reserve speedily comprehended merit persuasion of regard for elinor perhaps assisted penetration really felt assured of worth even quietness of manner militated against established idea of what young man address ought to be be longer uninteresting when knew heart to be warm temper affectionate sooner did perceive symptom of love in behaviour to elinor than considered serious attachment a certain looked forward to marriage a rapidly approaching in few month dear marianne said elinor will in probability be settled for life will miss will be happy oh mamma how will do without love will be scarcely separation will live within few mile of other will meet day of life will gain brother real affectionate brother have highest opinion in world of edward heart look grave marianne do disapprove sister choice perhaps said marianne may consider with surprise edward be very amiable love tenderly yet be not kind of young man there be something wanting figure be not striking have none of grace must expect in man who must seriously attach sister eye want spirit that fire at once announce virtue intelligence besides be afraid mamma have real taste music seems scarcely to attract though admires elinor drawing very much be not admiration of person who can understand worth be evident in spite of frequent attention to while draw that in fact know nothing of matter admires a lover not a connoisseur to satisfy character must be united must not be happy with man whose taste did not in point coincide with own must enter into feeling same book same music must charm oh mama how spiritless how tame be edward manner in reading to last night felt for sister most severely yet bore with so much composure seemed scarcely to notice must hardly keep seat to hear beautiful line have frequently almost driven wild pronounced with such impenetrable calmness such dreadful indifference must certainly have done more justice to simple elegant prose thought so at time must give cowper nay mamma if be not to be animated by cowper must allow for difference of taste elinor have not feeling therefore may overlook be happy with must have broke heart have loved to hear read with so little sensibility mama more know of world more be convinced that will never see man whom can really love require so much must have edward virtue person manner must ornament goodness with possible charm remember love that be not seventeen be yet too early in life to despair of such happiness why must be le fortunate than mother in one circumstance only marianne may destiny be different from chapter iv what pity be elinor said marianne that edward must have taste for drawing taste for drawing replied elinor why must think so doe not draw indeed have great pleasure in seeing performance of other people assure be by mean deficient in natural taste though have not have opportunity of improving have ever be in way of learning think must have drawn very well distrust own judgment in such matter so much that be always unwilling to give opinion on picture have innate propriety simplicity of taste in general direct perfectly right marianne be afraid of offending said more on subject kind of approbation elinor described a excited in by drawing of other people be very far from rapturous delight in opinion must alone be called taste yet though smiling within at mistake honoured sister for blind partiality to edward produced hope marianne continued elinor consider a deficient in general taste indeed think may say that can not for behaviour to be perfectly cordial if be opinion be sure must never be civil to marianne hardly knew what to say must not wound feeling of sister on account yet to say what did not believe be impossible at length replied be offended elinor if praise of be not in thing equal to sense of merit have not have so many opportunity of estimating minuter propensity of mind inclination taste a have have highest opinion in world of goodness sense think thing be worthy amiable be sure replied elinor with smile that dearest friend must not be dissatisfied with such commendation a perceive how must express more warmly marianne be rejoiced to find sister so easily pleased of sense goodness continued elinor one can think be in doubt who have seen often enough to engage in unreserved conversation excellence of understanding principle can be concealed only by shyness too often keep silent know enough of to do justice to solid worth of minuter propensity a call have from peculiar circumstance be kept more ignorant than have be at time thrown good deal together while have be wholly engrossed on most affectionate principle by mother have seen great deal of have studied sentiment heard opinion on subject of literature taste upon whole venture to pronounce that mind be well informed enjoyment of book exceedingly great imagination lively observation just correct taste delicate pure ability in respect improve a much upon acquaintance a manner person at first sight address be certainly not striking person can hardly be called handsome till expression of eye be uncommonly good general sweetness of countenance be perceived at present know so well that think really handsome at least almost so what say marianne will very soon think handsome elinor if now when tell to love a brother will no more see imperfection in face than now do in heart elinor started at declaration be sorry for warmth have be betrayed into in speaking of felt that edward stood very high in opinion believed regard to be mutual required greater certainty of to make marianne conviction of attachment agreeable to knew that what marianne mother conjectured one moment believed next that with to wish be to hope to hope be to expect tried to explain real state of case to sister attempt to deny said that think very highly of greatly esteem that like marianne here burst forth with indignation esteem like cold hearted elinor oh worse than cold hearted ashamed of being otherwise use word again will leave room moment elinor must not help laughing excuse said be assured that meant offence to by speaking in so quiet way of own feeling believe to be stronger than have declared believe in short to be such a merit suspicion hope of affection for may warrant without imprudence folly farther than must not believe be by mean assured of regard for there be moment when extent of seems doubtful till sentiment be fully known can not wonder at wishing to avoid encouragement of own partiality by believing calling more than be in heart feel little scarcely doubt of preference there be other point to be considered besides inclination be very far from being independent what mother really be can not know from fanny occasional mention of conduct opinion have never be disposed to think amiable be very much mistaken if edward be not aware that there must be many difficulty in way if be to wish to marry woman who have not either great fortune high rank marianne be astonished to find how much imagination of mother have outstripped truth really be not engaged to said yet certainly soon will happen two advantage will proceed from delay will not lose so soon edward will have greater opportunity of improving that natural taste for favourite pursuit must be so indispensably necessary to future felicity oh if must be so far stimulated by genius a to learn to draw how delightful must be elinor have given real opinion to sister must not consider partiality for edward in so prosperous state a marianne have believed there be at time want of spirit about if did not denote indifference spoke of something almost a unpromising doubt of regard supposing to feel need not give more than inquietude must not be likely to produce dejection of mind frequently attended more reasonable cause might be found in dependent situation forbade indulgence of affection knew that mother neither behaved to so a to make home comfortable at present to give assurance that might form home for without strictly attending to view for aggrandizement with knowledge a be impossible for elinor to feel easy on subject be far from depending on result of preference of mother sister still considered a certain nay longer be together more doubtful seemed nature of regard sometimes for few painful minute believed to be no more than friendship might really be limit be enough when perceived by sister to make uneasy at same time be still more common to make uncivil took first opportunity of affronting mother in law on occasion talking to so expressively of brother great expectation of mr ferrars resolution that son must marry well of danger attending young woman who attempted to draw in mr dashwood must neither pretend to be unconscious endeavor to be calm gave answer marked contempt instantly left room resolving that might be inconvenience expense of so sudden removal beloved elinor must not be exposed week to such insinuation in state of spirit letter be delivered to from post contained proposal particularly well timed be offer of small house on very easy term belonging to relation of own gentleman of consequence property in devonshire letter be from gentleman written in true spirit of friendly accommodation understood that be in need of dwelling though house now offered be merely cottage assured that everything must be done to might think necessary if situation pleased earnestly pressed after giving particular of house garden to come with daughter to barton park place of own residence from whence might judge whether barton cottage for house be in same parish must by alteration be made comfortable to seemed really anxious to accommodate whole of letter be written in so friendly style a must not fail of giving pleasure to cousin more especially at moment when be suffering under cold unfeeling behaviour of nearer connection needed time for deliberation inquiry resolution be formed a read situation of barton in county so far distant from sussex a devonshire few hour before must have be sufficient objection to outweigh possible advantage belonging to place be now first recommendation to quit neighbourhood of norland be no longer evil be object of desire be blessing in comparison of misery of continuing daughter in law guest to remove for ever from beloved place must be le painful than to inhabit visit while woman be mistress instantly wrote sir john middleton acknowledgment of kindness acceptance of proposal then hastened to show letter to daughter that might be secure of approbation before answer be sent elinor have always thought must be more prudent for to settle at distance from norland than immediately

however be not unpleasing in spite of being in opinion of marianne margaret absolute old bachelor for be on wrong side of five thirty though face be not handsome countenance be sensible address be particularly gentlemanlike there be nothing in of party must recommend a companion to dashwoods cold insipidity of lady middleton be so particularly repulsive that in comparison of gravity of colonel

colonel brandon alone of party heard without being in rapture paid only compliment of attention felt respect for on occasion others have reasonably forfeited by shameless want of taste pleasure in music though amounted not to ecstatic delight alone must sympathize with own be estimable when contrasted against horrible insensibility of others be reasonable enough to allow that man of five thirty might well have outlived acuteness of feeling exquisite power of enjoyment be perfectly disposed to make allowance for colonel advanced state of life humanity required chapter viii mr jennings be widow with ample jointure have only two daughter of whom have lived to see respectably married have now therefore nothing to do to marry rest of world in promotion of object be zealously active a far a ability reached missed opportunity of projecting wedding among young people of acquaintance be remarkably quick in discovery of attachment have enjoyed advantage of raising blush vanity of many

must be so be perfectly convinced of must be excellent match for be rich be handsome mr jennings have be anxious to see colonel brandon well married ever since connection with sir john first brought to knowledge be always anxious to get good husband for pretty girl immediate advantage to herself be by mean inconsiderable for supplied with endless joke against at park laughed at colonel in cottage at marianne to former raillery be probably a far a regarded only perfectly indifferent to latter be at first incomprehensible when object be understood hardly knew whether most to laugh at absurdity censure impertinence for considered a unfeeling reflection on colonel advanced year on forlorn condition a old bachelor mr dashwood who must not think man five year younger than so exceedingly ancient a appeared to youthful fancy of daughter ventured to clear mr jennings from probability of wishing to throw ridicule on age at least mamma can not deny absurdity of accusation though may not think intentionally ill natured colonel brandon be certainly younger than mr jennings be old enough to be father if be ever animated enough to be in love must have long outlived sensation of kind be too ridiculous when be man to be safe from such wit if age infirmity will not protect infirmity said elinor do call colonel brandon infirm can easily suppose that age may appear much greater to than to mother can hardly deceive a to having use of limb did not hear complain of rheumatism be not that commonest infirmity of declining life dearest child said mother laughing at rate must be in continual terror of decay must seem to miracle that life have be extended to advanced age of forty mamma be not doing justice know very well that colonel brandon be not old enough to make friend yet apprehensive of losing in course of nature may live twenty year longer thirty five have nothing to do with matrimony perhaps said elinor thirty five seventeen have better not have thing to do with matrimony together if there must by chance happen to be woman who be single at seven twenty must not think colonel brandon being thirty five objection to marrying woman of seven twenty said marianne after pausing moment can never hope to feel inspire affection again if home be uncomfortable fortune small can suppose that might bring to submit to office of nurse for sake of provision security of wife in marrying woman therefore there must be nothing unsuitable must be compact of convenience world must be satisfied in eye must be marriage at must be nothing to must seem only commercial exchange in wished to be benefited at expense of other must be impossible know replied elinor to convince that woman of seven twenty must feel for man of thirty five anything near enough to love to

attachment only wished that be le openly shown once twice did venture to suggest propriety of self command to marianne marianne abhorred concealment where real disgrace must attend unreserve to aim at

disappointed love have already be known to suspicion be given by word accidentally dropped from one evening at park when be sitting down together by mutual consent while others be dancing eye be fixed on marianne after silence of minute said with faint smile sister understand doe not approve of second attachment replied elinor opinion be romantic rather a believe considers impossible to exist believe doe how contrives without reflecting on character of own father who have two wife know not few year however will settle opinion on reasonable basis of common sense observation then may be more easy to define to justify than now be by body will probably be case replied yet there be something so amiable in prejudice of young mind that one be sorry to see give way to reception of more general opinion can not agree with there said elinor there be inconvenience attending such feeling a marianne charm of enthusiasm ignorance of world can not atone for system have unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought better acquaintance with world be what look forward to a greatest possible advantage after short pause resumed conversation by saying doe sister make distinction in objection against second attachment be equally criminal in body be who have be disappointed in first choice whether from inconstancy of object perverseness of circumstance to be equally indifferent during rest of life upon word be not acquainted with minuti of principle only know never yet heard admit instance of second attachment being pardonable said can not hold change total change of sentiment desire for when romantic refinement of young mind be obliged to give way how frequently be succeeded by such opinion a be too common too dangerous speak from experience once knew lady who in temper mind greatly resembled sister who thought judged like who from enforced change from series of unfortunate circumstance here stopped suddenly appeared to think that have said too much by countenance gave rise to conjecture might not otherwise have entered elinor head lady must probably have passed without suspicion have not convinced miss dashwood that what concerned ought not to escape lip a be required slight effort of fancy to connect emotion with tender recollection of past regard elinor attempted more marianne in place must not have done so little whole story must have be speedily formed under active imagination thing established in most melancholy order of disastrous love chapter xii a elinor marianne be walking together next morning latter communicated piece of news to sister in spite of that knew before of marianne imprudence want of thought surprised by extravagant testimony of marianne told with greatest delight willoughby have given horse one have bred on estate in somersetshire be exactly calculated to carry woman without considering that be not in mother plan to keep horse that if be to alter resolution in favour of gift must buy for servant keep servant to ride after build stable to receive have accepted present without hesitation told sister of in rapture intends to send groom into somersetshire immediately for added when arrives will ride day will share use with imagine to yourself dear elinor delight of gallop on of down most unwilling be to awaken from such dream of felicity to comprehend unhappy truth attended affair for time refused to submit to a to additional servant expense must be trifle mamma be sure must never object to horse must do for might always get one at park a to stable merest shed must be sufficient elinor then ventured to doubt propriety of receiving present from man so little at least so lately known to be too much be mistaken elinor said warmly in supposing know very little of willoughby have not known long indeed be much better acquainted with than be with other creature in world except mama be not time opportunity be to determine intimacy be disposition alone seven year must be insufficient to make people acquainted with other seven day be more than enough for others must hold guilty of greater impropriety in accepting horse from brother than from willoughby of john know very little though have lived together for year of willoughby judgment have long be formed elinor thought wisest to touch point more knew sister temper opposition on so tender subject must only attach more to own opinion by appeal to affection for mother by representing inconvenience indulgent mother must draw on if a must probably be case consented to increase of establishment marianne be shortly subdued promised not to tempt mother to such imprudent kindness by mentioning offer to tell willoughby when saw next that must be declined be faithful to word when willoughby called at cottage same day elinor heard express disappointment to in low voice on being obliged to forego acceptance of present reason for alteration be at same time related be such a to make further entreaty on side impossible concern however be very apparent after expressing with earnestness added in same low voice marianne horse be still yours though can not use now will keep only till can claim when leave barton to form own establishment in more lasting home queen mab will receive be overheard by miss dashwood in whole of sentence in manner of pronouncing in addressing sister by christian name alone instantly saw intimacy so decided meaning so direct a marked perfect agreement between from moment doubted not of being engaged to other belief of created other surprise than of friend must be left by temper so frank to discover by accident margaret related something to next day placed matter in still clearer light willoughby have spent preceding evening with margaret by being left time in parlour with only marianne have have opportunity for observation with most important face communicated to eldest sister when be next by oh elinor cried have secret to tell about marianne be sure will be married to mr

sure be for saw cut off last night after tea when mama went out of room be whispering talking together a fast a must be seemed to be begging something of presently took up scissors cut off long lock of hair for be tumbled down back kissed folded up in piece of white paper put into pocket book for such particular stated on such authority elinor must not withhold credit be disposed to for circumstance be in perfect unison with what have heard seen be sagacity be not always displayed in way so satisfactory to sister when mr jennings attacked one evening at park to give name of young man who be elinor particular favourite have be long matter of great curiosity to margaret answered by looking at sister saying must not tell may elinor of course made body laugh elinor tried to laugh too effort be painful be convinced that margaret have fixed on person whose name must not bear with composure to become standing joke with mr jennings illustration cut off long lock of hair marianne felt for most sincerely did more harm than good to cause by turning very red saying in angry manner to margaret remember that conjecture may be have right to repeat never have conjecture about replied margaret be who told of increased mirth of company margaret be eagerly pressed to say something more oh pray miss margaret let know about said mr jennings what be gentleman name must not tell ma'be know very well what be know where be too yes yes can guess where be at own house at norland to be sure be curate of parish dare say that be not be of profession at margaret said marianne with great warmth know that be invention of own that there be such person in existence well then be lately dead marianne for be sure there be such man once name begin with f most grateful did elinor feel to lady middleton for observing at moment that rained very hard though believed interruption to proceed le from attention to than from ladyship great dislike of such inelegant subject of raillery a delighted husband mother idea however started by be immediately pursued by colonel brandon who be on occasion mindful of feeling of others much be said on subject of rain by of opened piano forte asked marianne to sit down to thus amidst various endeavour of different people to quit topic fell to ground not so easily did elinor recover from alarm into have thrown party be formed evening for going on following day to see very fine place about twelve mile from barton belonging to brother in law of colonel brandon without whose interest must not be seen a proprietor who be then abroad have left strict order on head ground be declared to be highly beautiful sir john who be particularly warm in praise might be allowed to be tolerable judge for have formed party to visit at least twice summer for last ten year contained noble piece of water sail on be to form great part of morning amusement cold provision be to be taken open carriage only to be employed thing conducted in usual style of complete party of pleasure to few of company appeared rather bold undertaking considering time of year that have rained day for last fortnight mr dashwood who have already cold be persuaded by elinor to stay at home chapter xiii intended excursion to whitwell turned out very different from what elinor have expected be prepared to be wet through fatigued frightened event be still more unfortunate for did not go at by ten o'clock whole party be assembled at park where be to breakfast morning be rather favourable though have rained all night a cloud be then dispersing across sky sun frequently appeared be in high spirit good humour eager to be happy determined to submit to greatest inconvenience hardship rather than be otherwise while be at breakfast letter be brought in among rest there be one for colonel brandon took looked at direction changed colour immediately left room what be matter with brandon said sir john nobody must tell hope have have bad news said lady middleton must be

fear presence be necessary to gain admittance at whitwell what blow upon be if write note to housekeeper mr brandon said marianne eagerly will not be sufficient shook head must go said sir john will not be put off when be so near can not go to town till tomorrow brandon be wish must be so easily settled be not in power to delay journey for one day if must let know what business be said mr jennings might see whether must be put off not must not be six hour later said willoughby if be to defer journey till return can not afford to lose one hour elinor then heard willoughby say in low voice to marianne there be people who can not bear party of pleasure brandon be one of be afraid of catching cold dare say invented trick for getting out of must lay fifty guinea letter be of own writing have doubt of replied marianne there be persuading to change mind brandon know of old said sir john when once be determined on anything however hope will think better of consider here be two miss careys come over from newton three miss dashwoods walked up from cottage mr willoughby got up two hour before usual time on purpose to go to whitwell colonel brandon again repeated sorrow at being cause of disappointing party at same time declared to be unavoidable well then when will come back again hope will see at barton added ladyship a soon a can conveniently leave town must put off party to whitwell till return be very obliging be so uncertain when may have in power to return dare not engage for at oh must will come back cried sir john if be not here by end of week will go after ay so do sir john cried mr jennings then perhaps may find out what business be want to pry into other men concern suppose be something be ashamed of colonel brandon horse be announced go to town on horseback do added sir john only to honiton will then go post well a be resolved to go wish good journey have better change mind assure be not in power then took leave of whole party be there chance of seeing sister in town winter miss dashwood be afraid none at then must bid farewell for longer time than must wish to do to marianne merely bowed said nothing come colonel said mr jennings before go do let know what be going about wished good morning attended by sir john left room complaint lamentation politeness have hitherto restrained now burst forth universally agreed again again how provoking be to be so disappointed can guess what business be however said mr jennings exultingly can ma'be said almost body yes be about miss williams be sure who be miss williams asked marianne what know who miss williams be be sure must have heard of before be relation of colonel dear very near relation will not say how near for fear of shocking young lady then lowering voice little said to elinor be natural daughter indeed oh yes a like a can stare dare say colonel will leave fortune when sir john returned joined most heartily in general regret on so unfortunate event concluding however by observing that a be got together must do something by way of being happy after consultation be agreed that although happiness must only be enjoyed at whitwell might procure tolerable composure of mind by driving about country carriage be then ordered willoughby be first marianne never looked happier than when got into drove through park very fast be soon out of sight nothing more of be seen till return did not happen till after return of rest seemed delighted with drive said only in general term that have kept in lane while others went on down be settled that there must be dance in evening that body must be extremely merry day long more of careys came to dinner have pleasure of sitting down nearly twenty to table sir john observed with great contentment willoughby took usual place between two elder miss dashwoods mr jennings sat on elinor right hand have not be long seated before leant behind willoughby said to marianne loud enough for to hear have found out in spite of trick know where spent morning marianne coloured replied very hastily where pray did not know said willoughby that have be out in curricle yes yes mr impudence know very well be determined to find out where have be to hope like house miss marianne be very large one know when come to see hope will have new furnished for wanted very much when be there six year ago marianne turned away in great confusion mr jennings laughed heartily elinor found that in resolution to know where have be have actually made own woman enquire of mr willoughby groom that have by method be informed that have gone to allenham spent considerable time there in walking about garden going over house elinor must hardly believe to be true a seemed very unlikely that willoughby must propose marianne consent to enter house while mr smith be in with whom marianne have not smallest acquaintance a soon a left dining room elinor enquired of about great be surprise when found that circumstance related by mr jennings be perfectly true marianne be quite angry with for doubting why must imagine elinor that did not go there that did not see house be not what have often wished to do yes marianne must not go while mr smith be there with other companion than mr willoughby illustration have found out in spite of trick mr willoughby however be only person who can have right to show house a went in open carriage be impossible to have other companion never spent pleasanter morning in life be afraid replied elinor that pleasantness of employment doe not always evince propriety on contrary nothing can be stronger proof of elinor for if there have be real impropriety in what did must have be sensible of at time for always know when be acting wrong with such conviction must have have pleasure dear marianne a have already exposed to very impertinent remark do not now begin to doubt discretion of own conduct if impertinent remark of mr jennings be to be proof of impropriety in conduct be offending moment of life value not censure more than must do commendation be not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking over mr smith ground in seeing house will one day be mr willoughby if be one day to be own marianne must not be justified in what have done blushed at hint be even visibly gratifying to after ten minute interval of earnest thought came to sister again said with great good humour perhaps elinor be rather ill judged in to go to allenham mr willoughby wanted particularly to show place be charming house assure there be one remarkably pretty sitting room up stair of nice comfortable size for constant use with modern furniture must be delightful be corner room have window on two side on one side look across bowling green behind house to beautiful hanging wood on other have view of church village beyond of fine bold hill that have so often admired did not see to advantage for nothing must be more forlorn than furniture if be newly fitted up couple of hundred pound willoughby say must make one of pleasantest summer room in england must elinor have listened to without interruption from others must have described room in house with equal delight chapter xiv sudden termination of colonel brandon visit at park with steadiness in concealing cause filled mind raised wonder of mr jennings for two three day be great wonderer a one must be who take very lively interest in coming going of acquaintance wondered with little intermission what must be reason of be sure there must be bad news thought over kind of distress must have befallen with fixed determination that must not escape something very melancholy must be matter be sure said must see in face poor man be afraid circumstance may be bad estate at delaford be never reckoned more than two thousand year brother left everything sadly involved do think must have be sent for about money matter for what else can be wonder whether be so must give anything to know truth of perhaps be about miss williams by bye dare say be because looked so conscious when mentioned may be be ill in town nothing in world more likely for have notion be always rather sickly must lay wager be about miss williams be not so very likely must be distressed in circumstance now for be very prudent man to be sure must have cleared estate by time wonder what can be may be sister be worse at avignon have sent for over setting off in such hurry seems very like well wish out of trouble with heart good wife into bargain so wondered so talked mr jennings opinion varying with fresh conjecture seeming equally probable a arose elinor though felt really interested in welfare of colonel brandon must not bestow wonder on going so suddenly away mr jennings be desirous of feeling for besides that circumstance did not in opinion justify such lasting amazement variety of speculation wonder be otherwise disposed of be engrossed by extraordinary silence of sister willoughby on subject must know to be peculiarly interesting to a silence continued day made appear more strange more incompatible with disposition of why must not openly acknowledge to mother what constant behaviour to other declared to have taken place elinor must not imagine must easily conceive marriage might not be immediately in power for though willoughby be independent there be reason to believe rich estate have be rated by sir john at about six seven hundred year lived at expense to income must hardly be equal have often complained of poverty for strange kind of secrecy maintained by relative to engagement in fact concealed nothing at must not account be so wholly contradictory to general opinion practice that doubt sometimes entered mind of being really engaged doubt be enough to prevent making inquiry of marianne nothing must be more expressive of attachment to than willoughby behaviour to marianne have distinguishing tenderness lover heart must give to rest of family be affectionate attention of son brother cottage seemed to be considered loved by a home many more of hour be spent there than at allenham if general engagement collected at park exercise called out in morning be almost certain of ending there where rest of day be spent by at side of marianne by favourite pointer at foot one evening in particular about week after colonel brandon left country heart seemed more than usually open to feeling of attachment to object around on mr dashwood happening to mention design of improving cottage in spring warmly opposed alteration of place affection have established a perfect with what exclaimed improve dear cottage will never consent to not stone must be added to wall not inch to size if feeling be regarded be alarmed said miss dashwood nothing of kind will be done for mother will never have money enough to attempt be heartily glad of cried may always be poor if can employ rich better thank willoughby may be assured must not sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment of yours of one whom loved for improvement in world depend upon that unemployed sum may remain when make up account in spring must even rather lay uselessly by than dispose of in manner so painful to be really so attached to place a to see defect in be said to be faultless nay more consider a only form of building in happiness be attainable be rich enough must instantly pull combe down build up again in exact plan of cottage with dark narrow stair kitchen smoke suppose said elinor yes cried in same eager tone with thing belonging to in one convenience inconvenience about must least variation be perceptible then then only under roof might perhaps be a happy at combe a have be at barton flatter replied elinor that even under disadvantage of better room broader staircase will hereafter find own house a faultless a now do there certainly be circumstance said willoughby might greatly endear to place will always have one claim of affection other can possibly share mr dashwood looked with pleasure at marianne whose fine eye be fixed so expressively on willoughby a plainly denoted how well understood how often did wish added when be at allenham time twelvemonth that barton cottage be inhabited never passed within view of without admiring situation grieving that one must live in how little did then think that very first news must hear from mr smith when next came into country must be that barton cottage be taken felt immediate satisfaction interest in event nothing kind of prescience of what happiness must experience from can account for must not have be so marianne speaking to in lowered voice then continuing former tone said yet house must spoil mr dashwood must rob of simplicity by imaginary improvement dear parlour in acquaintance first began in so many happy hour have be since spent by together must degrade to condition of common entrance body must be eager to pas through room have hitherto contained within more real accommodation comfort than other apartment of handsomest dimension in world must possibly afford mr dashwood again assured that alteration of kind must be attempted be good woman warmly replied promise make easy extend little farther will make happy tell that not only house will remain same that will ever find yours a unchanged a dwelling that will always consider with kindness have made everything belonging to so dear to promise be readily given be behaviour during whole of evening declared at once affection happiness will see tomorrow to dinner said mr dashwood when be leaving ask to come in morning for must walk to park to call on lady middleton engaged to be with by four o'clock chapter xv mr dashwood visit to lady middleton took place next day two of daughter went with marianne excused from being of party under trifling pretext of employment mother who concluded that promise have be made by willoughby night before of calling on while be absent be perfectly satisfied with remaining at home on return from park found willoughby curricle servant in waiting at cottage mr dashwood be convinced that conjecture have be just so far be all a have foreseen on entering house beheld what foresight have taught to expect be sooner in passage than marianne came hastily out of parlour apparently in violent affliction with handkerchief at eye without noticing ran up stair surprised alarmed proceeded directly into room have just quitted where found only willoughby who be leaning against mantelpiece with back towards turned round on coming in countenance showed that strongly partook of emotion overpowered marianne be anything matter with cried mr dashwood a entered be ill hope not replied trying to look cheerful with forced smile presently added be who may rather expect to be ill for be now suffering under very heavy disappointment disappointment yes for be unable to keep engagement with mr smith have morning exercised privilege of rich upon poor dependent cousin by sending on business to london have just received dispatch taken farewell of allenham by way of exhilaration be now come to take farewell of to london be going morning almost moment illustration apparently in violent affliction be very unfortunate mr smith must be obliged business will not detain from long hope coloured a replied be very kind have idea of returning into devonshire immediately visit to mr smith be never repeated within twelvemonth be mr smith only friend be allenham only house in neighbourhood to will be welcome for shame willoughby can wait for invitation here colour increased with eye fixed on ground only replied be too good mr dashwood looked at elinor with surprise elinor felt equal amazement for few moment one be silent mr dashwood first spoke have only to add dear willoughby at barton cottage will always be welcome for will not press to return here immediately because only can judge how far might be pleasing to mr smith on head will be no more disposed to question judgment than to doubt inclination engagement at present replied willoughby confusedly be of such nature dare not flatter stopped mr dashwood be too much astonished to speak pause succeeded be broken by willoughby who said with faint smile be folly to linger in manner will not torment longer by remaining among friend whose society be impossible for now to enjoy then hastily took leave of left room saw step into carriage in minute be out of sight mr dashwood felt too much for speech instantly quitted parlour to give way in solitude to concern alarm sudden departure occasioned elinor uneasiness be at least equal to mother thought of what have just passed with anxiety distrust willoughby behaviour in taking leave of embarrassment affectation of cheerfulness above unwillingness to accept mother invitation backwardness so unlike lover so unlike greatly disturbed one moment feared that serious design have ever be formed on side next that unfortunate quarrel have taken place between sister distress in marianne have quitted room be such a serious quarrel must most reasonably account for though when considered what marianne love for be quarrel seemed almost impossible might be particular of separation sister affliction be indubitable thought with tenderest compassion of violent sorrow marianne be in probability not merely giving way to a relief feeding encouraging a duty in about hour mother returned though eye be red countenance be not uncheerful dear willoughby be now mile from barton elinor said a sat down to work with how heavy heart doe travel be very strange so suddenly to be gone seems work of moment last night be with so happy so cheerful so affectionate now after only ten minute notice gone too without intending to return something more than what owned to must have happened did not speak did not behave like must have seen difference a well a what can be can have quarrelled why else must have shown such unwillingness to accept invitation here be not inclination that wanted elinor must plainly see that have not power of accepting have thought over assure can perfectly account for thing at first seemed strange to a well a to can indeed yes have explained to myself in most satisfactory way elinor who love to doubt where can will not satisfy know will not talk out of trust in be persuaded that mr smith suspect regard for marianne disapproves of perhaps because have other view for on account be eager to get away that business sends off to transact be invented a excuse to dismiss be what believe to have happened be moreover aware that doe disapprove connection dare not therefore at present confess to engagement with marianne feel obliged from dependent situation to give into scheme absent from devonshire for while will tell know that may may not have happened will listen to cavil unless can point out other method of understanding affair a satisfactory at now elinor what have to say nothing for have anticipated answer then must have told that might might not have happened oh elinor how incomprehensible be feeling have rather take evil upon credit than good have rather look out for misery for marianne guilt for poor willoughby than apology for latter be resolved to think blamable because took leave of with le affection than usual behaviour have shown be allowance to be made for inadvertence for spirit depressed by recent disappointment be probability to be accepted merely because be not certainty be nothing due to man whom have such reason to love reason in world to think ill of to possibility of motif unanswerable in though unavoidably secret for while after what be suspect of can hardly tell suspicion of something unpleasant be inevitable consequence of such alteration a just witnessed in there be great truth however in what have now urged of allowance ought to be made for be wish to be candid in judgment of body willoughby may undoubtedly have very sufficient reason for conduct will hope that have must have be more like willoughby to acknowledge at once secrecy may be advisable still can not help wondering at being practiced by blame however for departing from character where deviation be necessary really do admit justice of what have said in defence be happy be acquitted not entirely may be proper to conceal engagement if be engaged from mr smith if be case must be highly expedient for willoughby to be little in devonshire at present be excuse for concealing from concealing from dear child do accuse willoughby marianne of concealment be strange indeed when eye have be reproaching day for incautiousness want proof of affection said elinor of engagement do be perfectly satisfied of yet not syllable have be said to on subject by of have not wanted syllable where action have spoken so plainly have not behaviour to marianne to of for at least last fortnight declared that loved considered a future wife that felt for attachment of nearest relation have not perfectly understood other have not consent be daily asked by look manner attentive affectionate respect elinor be possible to doubt engagement how must such thought occur to how be to be supposed that willoughby persuaded a must be of sister love must leave leave perhaps for month without telling of affection that must part without mutual exchange of confidence confess replied elinor that circumstance except one be in favour of engagement that one be total silence of on subject with almost outweighs other how strange be must think wretchedly indeed of willoughby if after have openly passed between can doubt nature of term on be together have be acting part in behaviour to sister time do suppose really indifferent to can not think that must doe love be sure with strange kind of tenderness if can leave with such indifference such carelessness of future a attribute to must remember dear mother have never considered matter a certain have have doubt confess be fainter than be may soon be entirely done away if find correspond fear of mine will be removed mighty concession indeed if be to see at altar must suppose be going to be married ungracious girl require such proof nothing in opinion have ever passed to justify doubt secrecy have be attempted have be uniformly open unreserved can not doubt sister wish must be willoughby therefore whom suspect why be not man of honour feeling have there be inconsistency on side to create alarm can be deceitful hope not believe not cried elinor love willoughby sincerely love suspicion of integrity can not be more painful to than to have be involuntary will not encourage be startled confess by alteration in manner morning did not speak like did not return kindness with cordiality may be explained by such situation of affair a have supposed have just parted from sister have seen leave in greatest affliction if felt obliged from fear of offending mr smith to resist temptation of returning here soon yet aware that by declining invitation by saying that be going away for time must seem to act ungenerous suspicious part by family might well be embarrassed disturbed in such case plain open avowal of difficulty must have be more to honour think a well a more consistent with general character will not raise objection against one conduct on so illiberal foundation a difference in judgment from deviation from what may think right consistent speak very properly willoughby certainly doe not deserve to be suspected though have not known long be stranger in part of world who have ever spoken to disadvantage have be in situation to act independently marry immediately might have be odd that must leave without acknowledging everything to at once be not case be engagement in respect not prosperously begun for marriage must be at very uncertain distance even secrecy a far a can be observed may now be very advisable be interrupted by entrance of margaret elinor be then at liberty to think over representation of mother to acknowledge probability of many hope for justice of saw nothing of marianne till dinner time when entered room took place at table without saying word eye be red swollen seemed a if tear be even then restrained with difficulty avoided look of must neither eat speak after time on mother silently pressing hand with tender compassion small degree of fortitude be quite overcome burst into tear left room violent oppression of spirit continued whole evening be without power because be without desire of command over slightest mention of anything relative to willoughby overpowered in instant though family be most anxiously attentive to comfort be impossible for if spoke at to keep clear of subject feeling connected with chapter xvi marianne must have thought very inexcusable have be able to sleep at first night after parting from willoughby must have be ashamed to look family in face next morning have not risen from bed in more need of repose than when lay down in feeling made such composure disgrace left in danger of incurring be awake whole night wept greatest part of got up with headache be unable to talk unwilling to take nourishment giving pain moment to mother sister forbidding attempt at consolation from sensibility be potent enough when breakfast be over walked out by wandered about village of allenham indulging recollection of past enjoyment cry over present reverse for chief of morning evening passed off in equal indulgence of feeling played over favourite song that have be used to play to willoughby air in voice have be oftenest joined sat at instrument gazing on line of music that have written out for till heart be so heavy that farther sadness must be gained nourishment of grief be day applied spent whole hour at pianoforte alternately singing cry voice often totally suspended by tear in book too a well a in music courted misery contrast between past present be certain of giving read nothing what have be used to read together such violence of affliction indeed must not be supported for ever sunk within few day into calmer melancholy employment to daily recurred solitary walk silent meditation still produced occasional effusion of sorrow a lively a ever letter from willoughby came none seemed expected by marianne mother be surprised elinor again became uneasy mr dashwood must find explanation whenever wanted at least satisfied remember elinor said how very often sir john fetch letter from post carry to have already agreed that secrecy may be necessary must acknowledge that must not be maintained if correspondence be to pas through sir john hand elinor must not deny truth of tried to find in motive sufficient for silence there be one method so direct so simple in opinion so eligible of knowing real state of affair of instantly removing mystery that must not help suggesting to mother why do not ask marianne at once said whether be be not engaged to willoughby from mother so kind so indulgent mother question must not give offence must be natural result of affection for used to be unreserve to more especially must not ask such question for world supposing possible that be not engaged what distress must not such enquiry inflict at rate must be most ungenerous must never deserve confidence again after forcing from confession of what be meant at present to be unacknowledged to one know marianne heart know that dearly love that will not be last to whom affair be made known when circumstance make revealment of eligible must not attempt to force confidence of one of child much le because sense of duty must prevent denial wish might direct elinor thought generosity overstrained considering sister youth urged matter farther in vain common sense common care common prudence be sunk in mr dashwood romantic delicacy be several day before willoughby name be mentioned before marianne by of family sir john mr jennings indeed be not so nice witticism added pain to many painful hour one evening mr dashwood accidentally taking up volume of shakespeare exclaimed have never finished hamlet marianne dear willoughby went away before must get through will put by when come again may be month perhaps before happens month cried marianne with strong surprise many week mr dashwood be sorry for what have said gave elinor pleasure a produced reply from marianne so expressive of confidence in willoughby knowledge of intention one morning about week after leaving country marianne be prevailed on to join sister in usual walk instead of wandering away by hitherto have carefully avoided companion in ramble if sister intended to walk on down directly stole away towards lane if talked of valley be a speedy in climbing hill must never be found when others set off at length be secured by exertion of elinor who greatly disapproved such continual seclusion walked along road through valley chiefly in silence for marianne mind must not be controlled elinor satisfied with gaining one point must not then attempt more beyond entrance of valley where country though still rich be le wild more open long stretch of road have travelled on first coming to barton lay before on reaching point stopped to look around examine prospect formed distance of view from cottage from spot have never happened to reach in of walk before amongst object in scene soon discovered animated one be man on horseback riding towards in few minute must distinguish to be gentleman in moment afterwards marianne rapturously exclaimed be be indeed know be be hastening to meet when elinor cried out indeed marianne think be mistaken be not willoughby person be not tall enough for have not air have have cried marianne be sure have air coat horse knew how soon must come walked eagerly on a spoke elinor to screen marianne from particularity a felt almost certain of not being willoughby quickened pace kept up with be soon within thirty yard of gentleman marianne looked again heart sunk within abruptly turning round be hurrying back when voice of sister be raised to detain third almost a well known a willoughby joined in begging to stop turned round with surprise to see welcome edward ferrars illustration begging to stop be only person in world who must at moment be forgiven for not being willoughby only one who must have gained smile from dispersed tear to smile on in sister happiness forgot for time own disappointment dismounted giving horse to servant walked back with to barton whither be purposely coming to visit be welcomed by with great cordiality especially by marianne who showed more warmth of regard in reception of than even elinor to marianne indeed meeting between edward sister be continuation of unaccountable coldness have often observed at norland in mutual behaviour on edward side more particularly there be deficiency of that lover ought to look say on such occasion be confused seemed scarcely sensible of pleasure in seeing looked neither rapturous gay said little what be forced from by question distinguished elinor by mark of affection marianne saw

kind still be not in spirit whole family perceived mr dashwood attributing to want of liberality in mother sat down to table indignant against selfish parent what be mr ferrars view for at present edward said when dinner be over have drawn round fire be still to be great orator in spite of hope mother be now convinced that have more talent than inclination for public life how be fame to be

reason to hope never will thank heaven can not be forced into genius eloquence have ambition well know wish be moderate a moderate a of rest of world believe wish a well a body else to be perfectly happy like body else must be in own way greatness will not make so strange that must cried marianne what have wealth grandeur to do with happiness grandeur have little said elinor wealth have much to do with elinor for shame said marianne money can only give happiness where there be nothing else to give beyond competence can afford real satisfaction a far a mere self be concerned perhaps said elinor smiling may come to same point competence wealth be very much alike dare say without a world go now will agree that kind of external comfort must be wanting idea be only more noble than mine come what be competence about eighteen hundred two thousand year not more than elinor laughed two thousand year one be wealth guessed how must end yet two thousand year be very moderate income said family can not well be maintained on smaller be sure be not extravagant in demand proper establishment of servant carriage perhaps two hunter can not be supported on le elinor smiled again to hear sister describing so accurately future expense at combe magna hunter repeated edward why must have hunter body doe not hunt marianne coloured a replied most people do wish said margaret striking out novel thought that somebody must give large fortune piece oh that must cried marianne eye sparkling with animation cheek glowing with delight of such imaginary happiness be unanimous in wish suppose said elinor in spite of insufficiency of wealth oh dear cried margaret how happy must be wonder what must do with marianne looked a if have doubt on point must be puzzled to spend so large fortune said mr dashwood if child be to be rich without help must begin improvement on house observed elinor difficulty will soon vanish what magnificent order must travel from family to london said edward in such event what happy day for bookseller music seller print shop miss dashwood must give general commission for new print of merit to be sent a for marianne know greatness of soul there must not be music enough in london to content book thomson cowper scott must buy over over again must buy up copy believe to prevent falling into unworthy hand must have book tell how to admire old twisted tree must not marianne forgive if be very saucy be willing to show have not forgot old dispute love to be reminded of past edward whether be melancholy gay love to recall will never offend by talking of former time be very right in supposing how money must be spent of at least loose cash must certainly be employed in improving collection of music book bulk of fortune must be laid out in annuity on author heir edward must have something else to do with perhaps then must bestow a reward on person who wrote ablest defence of favourite maxim that one can ever be in love more than once in life for opinion on point be unchanged presume undoubtedly at time of life opinion be tolerably fixed be not likely that must now see hear thing to change marianne be a steadfast a ever see said elinor be not at altered be only grown little more grave than be nay edward said marianne need not reproach be not very gay why must think so replied with sigh gaiety never be part of character do think part of marianne said elinor must hardly call lively girl be very earnest very eager in doe sometimes talk great deal always with animation be not often really merry believe be right replied yet have always set down a lively girl have frequently detected in such kind of mistake said elinor in total misapprehension of character in point other fancying people so much more gay grave ingenious stupid than really be can hardly tell why in what deception originated sometimes one be guided by what say of very frequently by what other people say of without giving time to deliberate judge thought be right elinor said marianne to be guided wholly by opinion of other people thought judgment be given merely to be subservient to of neighbour have always be doctrine be sure marianne never doctrine have never aimed at subjection of understanding have ever attempted to influence have be behaviour must not confound meaning be guilty confess of having often wished to treat acquaintance in general with greater attention when have advised to adopt sentiment to conform to judgment in serious matter have not be able to bring sister over to plan of general civility said edward to elinor do gain ground quite contrary replied elinor looking expressively at marianne judgment returned be on side of question be afraid practice be much more on sister never wish to offend be so foolishly shy often seem negligent when be only kept back by natural awkwardness have frequently thought that must have be intended by nature to be fond of low company be so little at ease among stranger of gentility marianne have not shyness to excuse inattention of hers said elinor know own worth too well for false shame replied edward shyness be only effect of sense of inferiority in way other if must persuade that manner be perfectly easy graceful must not be shy must still be reserved said marianne be worse edward started reserved be reserved marianne yes very understand replied colouring reserved how in what manner what be to tell what can suppose elinor looked surprised at emotion trying to laugh off subject said to know sister well enough to understand what mean know call one reserved who doe not talk a fast admire what admires a rapturously a edward made answer gravity thoughtfulness returned on in fullest extent sat for time silent dull chapter xviii elinor saw with great uneasiness low spirit of friend visit afforded very partial satisfaction while own enjoyment in appeared so imperfect be evident that be unhappy wished be equally evident that still distinguished by same affection once have felt doubt of inspiring continuance of preference seemed very uncertain reservedness of manner towards contradicted one moment what more animated look have intimated preceding one joined marianne in breakfast room next morning before others be down marianne who be always eager to promote happiness a far a must soon left to before be half way upstairs heard parlour door open turning round be astonished to see edward come out be going into village to see horse said a be not yet ready for breakfast will be back again presently edward returned to with fresh admiration of surrounding country in walk to village have seen many part of valley to advantage village in much higher situation than cottage afforded general view of whole have exceedingly pleased be subject ensured marianne attention be beginning to describe own admiration of scene to question more minutely on object have particularly struck when edward interrupted by saying must not enquire too far marianne remember have knowledge in picturesque will offend by ignorance want of taste if come to particular will call hill steep ought to be bold surface strange uncouth ought to be irregular rugged distant object out of sight ought only to be indistinct through soft medium of hazy atmosphere must be satisfied with such admiration a can honestly give call very fine country hill be steep wood seem full of fine timber valley look comfortable snug with rich meadow several neat farm house scattered here there exactly answer idea of fine country because unites beauty with utility dare say be picturesque one too because admire can easily believe to be full of rock promontory grey moss brush wood be lost on know nothing of picturesque be afraid be too true said marianne why must boast of suspect said elinor that to avoid one kind of affectation edward here fall into because belief many people pretend to more admiration of beauty of nature than really feel be disgusted with such pretension affect greater indifference le discrimination in viewing than posse be fastidious will have affectation of own be very true said marianne that admiration of landscape scenery be become mere jargon body pretend to feel try to describe with taste elegance of who first defined what picturesque beauty be detest jargon of kind sometimes have kept feeling to myself because must find language to describe in what be worn hackneyed out of sense meaning be convinced said edward that really feel delight in fine prospect profess to feel in return sister must allow to feel no more than profess like fine prospect not on picturesque principle like crooked twisted blasted tree admire much more if be tall straight flourishing like ruined tattered cottage be not fond of nettle thistle heath blossom have more pleasure in snug farm house than watch tower troop of tidy happy village please better than finest bandit in world marianne looked with amazement at edward with compassion at sister elinor only laughed subject be continued farther marianne remained thoughtfully silent till new object suddenly engaged attention be sitting by edward in taking tea from mr dashwood hand passed so directly before a to make ring with plait of hair in centre very conspicuous on one of finger never saw wear ring before edward cried be that fanny hair remember promising to give must have thought hair have be darker marianne spoke inconsiderately what really felt when saw how much have pained edward own vexation at want of thought must not be surpassed by coloured very deeply giving momentary glance at elinor replied yes be sister hair setting always cast different shade on know elinor have met eye looked conscious likewise that hair be own instantaneously felt a well satisfied a marianne only difference in conclusion be that what marianne considered a free gift from sister elinor be conscious must have be procured by theft contrivance unknown to herself be not in humour however to regard a affront affecting to take notice of what passed by instantly talking of something else internally resolved henceforward to catch opportunity of eyeing hair of satisfying beyond doubt that be exactly shade of own edward embarrassment lasted time ended in absence of mind still more settled be particularly grave whole morning marianne severely censured for what have said own forgiveness might have be more speedy have known how little offence have given sister before middle of day be visited by sir john mr jennings who having heard of arrival of gentleman at cottage came to take survey of guest with assistance of mother in law sir john be not long in discovering that name of ferrars began with f prepared future mine of raillery against devoted elinor nothing newness of acquaintance with edward must have prevented from being immediately sprung a be only learned from very significant look how far penetration founded on margaret instruction extended sir john never came to dashwoods without inviting to dine at park next day to drink tea with evening on present occasion for better entertainment of visitor towards whose amusement felt bound to contribute wished to engage for must drink tea with to night said for will be quite alone tomorrow must absolutely dine with for will be large party mr jennings enforced necessity who know may raise dance said will tempt miss marianne dance cried marianne impossible who be to dance illustration came to take survey of guest who why yourselves careys whitakers to be sure what thought nobody must dance because certain person that will be nameless be gone wish with soul cried sir john willoughby be among again marianne blushing gave new suspicion to edward who be willoughby said in low voice to miss dashwood by whom be sitting gave brief reply marianne countenance be more communicative edward saw enough to comprehend not only meaning of others such of marianne expression a have puzzled before when visitor left went immediately round said in whisper have be guessing will tell guess what do mean will tell certainly well then guess that mr willoughby hunt marianne be surprised confused yet must not help smiling at quiet archness of manner after moment silence said oh edward how can time will come hope be sure will like doubt replied rather astonished at earnestness warmth for have not imagined to be joke for good of acquaintance in general founded only on something nothing between mr willoughby must not have ventured to mention chapter xix edward remained week at cottage be earnestly pressed by mr dashwood to stay longer a if be bent only on self mortification seemed resolved to be gone when enjoyment among friend be at height spirit during last two three day though still very unequal be greatly improved grew more more partial to house environs never spoke of going away without sigh declared time to be wholly disengaged even doubted to what place must go when left still go must never have week passed so quickly must hardly believe to be gone said so repeatedly other thing said too marked turn of feeling gave lie to action have pleasure at norland detested being in town to norland london must go valued kindness beyond thing greatest happiness be in being with yet must leave at end of week in spite of wish own without restraint on time elinor placed be astonishing in way of acting to mother account be happy for that have mother whose character be so imperfectly known to a to be general excuse for thing strange on part of son disappointed however vexed a be sometimes displeased with uncertain behaviour to herself be very well disposed on whole to regard action with candid allowance generous qualification have be rather more painfully extorted from for willoughby service by mother want of spirit of openness of consistency be most usually attributed to want of independence better knowledge of mr ferrars disposition design shortness of visit steadiness of purpose in leaving originated in same fettered inclination same inevitable necessity of temporizing with mother old well established grievance of duty against will parent against child be cause of must have be glad to know when difficulty be to cease opposition be to yield when mr ferrars must be reformed son be at liberty to be happy from such vain wish be forced to turn for comfort to renewal of confidence in edward affection to remembrance of mark of regard in look word fell from while at barton above to flattering proof of constantly wore round finger think edward said mr dashwood a be at breakfast last morning must be happier man if have profession to engage time give interest to plan action inconvenience to friend indeed might result from must not be able to give so much of time with smile must be materially benefited in one particular at least must know where to go when left do assure replied that have long thought on point a think now have be be probably will always be heavy misfortune to have have necessary business to engage profession to give employment afford thing like independence unfortunately own nicety nicety of friend have made what be idle helpless being never must agree in choice of profession always preferred church a still do be not smart enough for family recommended army be great deal too smart for law be allowed to be genteel enough many young men who have chamber in temple made very good appearance in first circle drove about town in very knowing gig have inclination for law even in le abstruse study of family approved a for navy have fashion on side be too old when subject be first started to enter at length a there be necessity for having profession at a might be a dashing expensive without red coat on back a with one idleness be pronounced on whole to be most advantageous honourable young man of eighteen be not in general so earnestly bent on being busy a to resist solicitation of friend to hing be therefore entered at oxford have be properly idle ever since consequence of suppose will be said mr dashwood since leisure have not promoted own happiness that son will be brought up to a many pursuit employment profession trade a columella will be brought up said in serious accent to be a unlike a be possible in feeling in action in condition in thing come come be effusion of immediate want of spirit edward be in melancholy humour fancy that one unlike must be happy remember that pain of parting from friend will be felt by body at time be education state know own happiness want nothing patience give more fascinating name call hope mother will secure to in time that independence be so anxious for be duty will must ere long become happiness to prevent whole youth from being wasted in discontent how much may not few month do think replied edward may defy many month to produce good to desponding turn of mind though must not be communicated to mr dashwood gave additional pain to in parting shortly took place left uncomfortable impression on elinor feeling especially required trouble time to subdue a be determination to subdue to prevent from appearing to suffer more than what family suffered on going away did not adopt method so judiciously employed by marianne on similar occasion to augment fix sorrow by seeking silence solitude idleness mean be a different a object equally suited to advancement of elinor sat down to drawing table a soon a be out of house busily employed whole day sought avoided mention of name appeared to interest almost a much a ever in general concern of family if by conduct did not lessen own grief be at least prevented from unnecessary increase mother sister be spared much solicitude on account such behaviour a so exactly reverse of own appeared more meritorious to marianne than own have seemed faulty to business of self command settled very easily with strong affection be impossible with calm one must have merit that sister affection be calm dared not deny though blushed to acknowledge of strength of own gave very striking proof by still loving respecting that sister in spite of mortifying conviction without shutting up from family leaving house in determined solitude to avoid lying awake whole night to indulge meditation elinor found day afforded leisure enough to think of edward of edward behaviour in possible variety different state of spirit at different time must produce with tenderness pity approbation censure doubt there be moment in abundance when if not by absence of mother sister at least by nature of employment conversation be forbidden among effect of solitude be produced mind be inevitably at liberty thought must not be chained elsewhere past future on subject so interesting must be before must force attention engross memory reflection fancy from reverie of kind a sat at drawing table be roused one morning soon after edward leaving by arrival of company happened to be quite alone closing of little gate at entrance of green court in front of house drew eye to window saw large party walking up to door amongst be sir john lady middleton mr jennings there be two others gentleman lady who be quite unknown to be sitting near window a soon a

get nicest house in world for next door to ours in hanover square must come indeed be sure will be very happy to chaperon at time till be confined if mr dashwood must not like to go into public thanked be obliged to resist entreaty oh love cried mr palmer to husband who just then entered room must help to persuade miss dashwoods to go to town winter love made answer after slightly bowing to lady began complaining of weather how horrid be said such weather make thing body disgusting dullness be a much produced within door a without by rain make one detest one acquaintance what devil doe sir john mean by not having billiard room in house how few people know what comfort be sir john be a stupid a weather rest of company soon dropt in be afraid miss marianne said sir john have not be able to take usual walk to allenham today marianne looked very grave said nothing oh be so sly before said mr palmer for know about assure admire taste very much for think be extremely handsome live great way from in country know not above ten mile dare say much nearer thirty said husband ah well there be not much difference never be at house say be sweet pretty place a vile spot a ever saw in

seated in dining room sir john observed with regret that be only eight together dear said to lady be very provoking that must be so few why did not ask gilbert to come to today did not tell sir john when spoke to about before that must not be done dined with last sir john said mr jennings must not stand upon such ceremony then must be very ill bred cried mr palmer love contradict body said wife with usual laugh do know that be quite rude did not know contradicted body in calling mother ill bred ay may abuse a please said good natured old lady have taken charlotte off hand can not give back again so there have whip hand of charlotte laughed heartily to think that husband must not get rid of exultingly said did not care how cross be to a must live together be impossible for one to be more thoroughly good natured more determined to be happy than mr palmer studied indifference insolence discontent of husband gave pain when scolded abused be highly diverted mr palmer be so droll said in whisper to elinor be always out of humour elinor be not inclined after little observation to give credit for being so genuinely unaffectedly ill natured ill bred a wished to appear temper might perhaps be little soured by finding like many others of sex that through unaccountable bias in favour of beauty be husband of very silly woman knew that kind of blunder be too common for sensible man to be lastingly hurt by be rather wish of distinction believed produced contemptuous treatment of body general abuse of thing before be desire of appearing superior to other people motive be too common to be wondered at mean however might succeed by establishing superiority in ill breeding be not likely to attach one to except wife oh dear miss dashwood said mr palmer soon afterwards have got favour to ask of sister will come spend time at cleveland christmas now pray do come while weston be with can not think how happy will be will be quite delightful love applying to husband long to have miss dashwoods come to cleveland certainly replied with sneer came into devonshire with other view there now said lady see mr palmer expects so can not refuse to come eagerly resolutely declined

whether did not like mr palmer excessively certainly said elinor seems very agreeable well be so glad do thought must be so pleasant mr palmer be excessively pleased with sister can tell ca think how disappointed will be if come to cleveland ca imagine why must object to elinor be again obliged to decline invitation by changing subject put stop to entreaty thought probable that a lived in same county mr palmer might be able to give more particular account of willoughby general character than must be gathered from middleton partial acquaintance with be eager to gain from one confirmation of merit a might remove possibility of fear from marianne began by inquiring if saw much of mr willoughby at cleveland whether be intimately acquainted with oh dear yes know extremely well replied mr palmer not that ever spoke to indeed have seen for ever in town somehow other never happened to be staying at barton while be at allenham mama saw here once before be with uncle at weymouth however dare say must have seen great deal of in somersetshire if have not happened very unluckily that must never have be in country together be very little at combe believe if be ever so much there think mr palmer must visit for be in opposition know besides be such way off know why inquire about very well sister be to marry be monstrous glad of for then will have for neighbour know upon word replied

brandon be very well hope oh yes quite well so full of praise did nothing say fine thing of be flattered by commendation seems excellent man think uncommonly pleasing so do be such charming man that be quite pity must be so grave so dull mamma say be in love with sister too assure be great compliment if be for hardly ever fall in love with body be mr willoughby much known in part of somersetshire said elinor oh yes extremely well be believe many people be acquainted with because combe magna be so far off think extremely agreeable assure nobody be more liked than mr willoughby wherever go so may tell sister be monstrous lucky girl to get upon honour not that be much more lucky in getting because be so very handsome agreeable that nothing can be good enough for however think hardly at handsomer than assure for think excessively pretty so doe mr palmer too be sure though must not get to own last night mr palmer information respecting willoughby be not very material testimony in favour however small be pleasing to be so glad be got acquainted at last continued charlotte now hope will always be great friend ca think how much longed to see be so delightful that must live at cottage nothing can be like to be sure be so glad sister be going to be well married hope will be great deal at combe magna be sweet place by account have be long acquainted with colonel brandon have

not think match good enough for otherwise sir john must have mentioned to colonel must have be married immediately did not colonel brandon know of sir john proposal to mother before be made have never owned affection to yourself oh if mama have not objected to dare say must have liked of thing have not seen then above twice for be before left school however be much happier a be mr palmer be kind of man like chapter xxi palmer returned to cleveland next day two family at barton be again left to entertain other did not last long elinor have hardly got last visitor out of head have hardly done wondering at charlotte being so happy without cause at mr palmer acting so simply with good ability at strange unsuitableness often existed between husband wife before sir john mr jennings active zeal in cause of society procured other new acquaintance to see observe in morning excursion to exeter have met with two young lady whom mr jennings have satisfaction of discovering to be relation be enough for sir john to invite directly to park a soon a present engagement at exeter be over engagement at exeter instantly gave way before such invitation lady middleton be thrown into little alarm on return of sir john by hearing that be very soon to receive visit from two girl whom have never seen in life of whose elegance whose tolerable gentility even must have proof for assurance of husband mother on subject went for nothing at being relation too made so much worse mr jennings attempt at consolation be therefore unfortunately founded when advised daughter not to care about being so fashionable because be cousin must put up with one a be impossible however now to prevent coming lady middleton resigned to idea of with philosophy of well bred woman contenting with merely giving husband gentle reprimand on subject five six time day young lady arrived appearance be by mean ungenteel unfashionable dress be very smart manner very civil be delighted with house in rapture with furniture happened to be so doatingly fond of child lady middleton good opinion be engaged in favour before have be hour at park declared to be very agreeable girl indeed for ladyship be enthusiastic admiration sir john confidence in own judgment rose with animated praise set off directly for cottage to tell miss dashwoods of miss steele arrival to assure of being sweetest girl in world from such commendation a however there be not much to be learned elinor well knew that sweetest girl in world be to be met with in part of england under possible variation of form face temper understanding sir john wanted whole family to walk to park directly look at guest benevolent philanthropic man be painful to even to keep third cousin to do come now said pray come must come declare will come ca think how will like lucy be monstrous pretty so good humoured agreeable child be hanging about already a if be old acquaintance long to see of thing for have heard at exeter that be most beautiful creature in world have told be very true great deal more will be delighted with be sure have brought whole coach full of plaything for child how can be so cross a not to come why be cousin know after fashion be cousin be wife so must be related sir john must not prevail must only obtain promise of calling at park within day two then left in amazement at indifference to walk home boast anew of attraction to miss steele a have be already boasting of miss steele to when promised visit to park consequent introduction to young lady took place found in appearance of eldest who be nearly thirty with very plain not sensible face nothing to admire in other who be not more than two three twenty acknowledged considerable beauty feature be pretty have sharp quick eye smartness of air though did not give

earnestly entreated by mother to stay behind four young lady be left in quietness room have not known for many hour poor little creature said miss steele a soon a be gone might have be very sad accident yet hardly know how cried marianne unless have be under totally different circumstance be usual way of heightening alarm where there be nothing to be alarmed at in reality what sweet woman lady middleton be said lucy steele marianne be silent be impossible for to say what did not feel however trivial occasion upon elinor therefore whole task of telling lie when politeness required always fell did best when thus called on by speaking of lady middleton with more warmth than felt though with far le than miss lucy sir john too cried elder sister what charming man be here too miss dashwood commendation being only simple just came in without clat merely observed that be perfectly good humoured friendly what charming little family have never saw such fine child in life declare quite doat upon already indeed be always distractedly fond of child must guess so said elinor with smile from what have witnessed morning have notion said lucy think little middleton rather too much indulged perhaps may be outside of enough be so natural in lady middleton for part love to see child full of life spirit can not bear if be tame quiet confess replied elinor that while be at barton park never think of tame quiet child with abhorrence short pause succeeded speech be first broken by miss steele who seemed very much disposed for conversation who now said rather abruptly how do like devonshire miss dashwood suppose be very sorry to leave sussex in surprise at familiarity of question at least of manner in be spoken elinor replied that be norland be prodigious beautiful place be not added miss steele have heard sir john admire excessively said lucy who seemed to think apology necessary for freedom of sister think one must admire replied elinor who ever saw place though be not to be supposed that one can estimate beauty a do have great many smart beau there suppose have not so many in part of world for part think be vast addition always why must think said lucy looking ashamed of sister that there be not a many genteel young men in devonshire a sussex nay dear be sure pretend to say that there be sure there be vast many smart beau in exeter know how must tell what smart beau there might be about norland be only afraid miss dashwoods might find dull at barton if have not so many a used to have perhaps young lady may not care about beau have a lief be without a with for part think be vastly agreeable provided dress smart behave civil ca bear to see dirty nasty now there be mr rose at exeter prodigious smart young man beau clerk to mr simpson know yet if do meet of morning be not fit to be seen suppose brother be quite beau miss dashwood before married a be so rich upon word replied elinor can not tell for perfectly comprehend meaning of word can say that if ever be beau before married be one still for there be not smallest alteration in oh dear one never think of married men being beau have something else to do lord anne cried sister can talk of nothing beau will make miss dashwood believe think of nothing else then to turn discourse began admiring house furniture specimen of miss steele be enough vulgar freedom folly of eldest left recommendation a elinor be not blinded by beauty shrewd look of youngest to want of real elegance artlessness left house without wish of knowing better not so miss steele came from exeter well provided with admiration for use of sir john middleton family relation niggardly proportion be now dealt out to fair cousin whom declared to be most beautiful elegant accomplished agreeable girl have ever beheld with whom be particularly anxious to be better acquainted to be better acquainted therefore elinor soon found be inevitable lot for a sir john be entirely on side of miss steele party must be too strong for opposition that kind of intimacy must be submitted to consists of sitting hour two together in same room almost day sir john must do more did not know that more be required to be together be in opinion to be intimate while continual scheme for meeting be effectual have not doubt of being established friend to do justice did thing in power to promote unreserve by making miss steele acquainted with whatever knew supposed of cousin situation in most delicate particular elinor have not seen more than twice before eldest of wished joy on sister having be so lucky a to make conquest of very smart beau since came to barton 'twill be fine thing to have married so young to be sure said hear be quite beau prodigious handsome hope may have a good luck soon perhaps may have friend in corner already elinor must not suppose that sir john must be more nice in proclaiming suspicion of regard for edward than have be with respect to marianne indeed be rather favourite joke of two a being somewhat newer more conjectural since edward visit have never dined together without drinking to best affection with so much significancy so many nod wink a to excite general attention letter f have be likewise invariably brought forward found productive of such countless joke that character a wittiest letter in alphabet have be long established with miss steele a expected have now benefit of joke in eldest of raised curiosity to know name of gentleman alluded to though often impertinently expressed be perfectly of piece with general inquisitiveness into concern of family sir john did not sport long with curiosity delighted to raise for have at least a much pleasure in telling name a miss steele have in hearing name be ferrars said in very audible whisper pray tell for be great secret illustration drinking to best affection ferrars repeated miss steele mr ferrars be happy man be what sister in law brother miss dashwood very agreeable young man to be sure know very well how can say so anne cried lucy who generally made amendment to sister assertion though have seen once twice at uncle be rather too much to pretend to know very well elinor heard with attention surprise who be uncle where did live how came acquainted wished very much to have subject continued though did not choose to join in nothing more of be said for first time in life thought mr jennings deficient either in curiosity after petty information in disposition to communicate manner in miss steele have spoken of edward increased curiosity for struck a being rather ill natured suggested suspicion of lady knowing fancying to know something to disadvantage curiosity be unavailing for farther notice be taken of mr ferrars name by miss steele when alluded to even openly mentioned by sir john chapter xxii marianne who have never much toleration for thing like impertinence vulgarity inferiority of part even difference of taste from herself be at time particularly ill disposed from state of spirit to be pleased with miss steele to encourage advance to invariable coldness of behaviour towards checked endeavour at intimacy on side elinor principally attributed that preference of herself soon became evident in manner of especially of lucy who missed opportunity of engaging in conversation of striving to improve acquaintance by easy frank communication of sentiment lucy be naturally clever remark be often just amusing a companion for hour elinor frequently found agreeable power have received no aid from education be ignorant illiterate deficiency of mental improvement want of information in most common particular must not be concealed from miss dashwood in spite of constant endeavour to appear to advantage elinor saw pitied for neglect of ability education might have rendered so respectable saw with le tenderness of feeling thorough want of delicacy of rectitude integrity of mind attention assiduity flattery at park betrayed must have lasting satisfaction in company of person who joined insincerity with ignorance whose want of instruction prevented meeting in conversation on term of equality whose conduct toward others made show of attention deference towards perfectly valueless will think question odd one dare say said lucy to one day a be walking together from park to cottage pray be personally acquainted with sister in law mother mr ferrars elinor did think question very odd one countenance expressed a answered that have never seen mr ferrars indeed replied lucy wonder at for thought must have seen at norland sometimes then perhaps can not tell what sort of woman be returned elinor cautious of giving real opinion of edward mother not very desirous of satisfying what seemed impertinent curiosity know nothing of be sure think very strange for enquiring about in such way said lucy eyeing elinor attentively a spoke perhaps there may be reason wish might venture however hope will do justice of believing mean to be impertinent elinor made civil reply walked on for few minute in silence be broken by lucy who renewed subject again by saying with hesitation can not bear to have think impertinently curious be sure must rather do thing in world than be thought so by person whose good opinion be so well worth having a yours be sure must not have smallest fear of trusting indeed must be very glad of advice how to manage in such uncomfortable situation a be however there be occasion to trouble be sorry happen to know mr ferrars be sorry said elinor in great astonishment if must be of use to to know opinion of really never understood that be at connected with family therefore be little surprised confess at so serious inquiry into character dare say be be sure at wonder at if dared tell must not be so much surprised mr ferrars be certainly nothing to at present time may come how soon will come must depend upon when may be very intimately connected looked down a said amiably bashful with only one side glance at companion to observe effect on good heaven cried elinor what do mean be acquainted with mr robert ferrars can be did not feel much delighted with idea of such sister in law replied lucy not to mr robert ferrars never saw in life fixing eye upon elinor to eldest brother what felt elinor at moment astonishment must have be a painful a be strong have not immediate disbelief of assertion attended turned towards lucy in silent amazement unable to divine reason object of declaration though complexion varied stood firm in incredulity felt in danger of hysterical fit swoon may well be surprised continued lucy for to be sure must have have idea of before for dare say never dropped smallest hint of to of family because be always meant to be great secret be sure have be faithfully kept so by to hour not soul of relation know of anne never must have mentioned to if have not felt greatest dependence in world upon secrecy really thought behaviour in asking so many question about mr ferrars must seem so odd that ought to be explained think mr ferrars can be displeased when know have trusted because know have highest opinion in world of family look upon other miss dashwoods quite a own sister paused illustration amiably bashful elinor for few moment remained silent astonishment at what heard be at first too great for word at length forcing to speak to speak cautiously said with calmness of manner tolerably well concealed surprise solicitude may ask if engagement be of long standing have be engaged four year four year yes elinor though greatly shocked still felt unable to believe did not know said that be even acquainted till other day acquaintance however be of many year date be under uncle care know considerable while uncle yes mr pratt did never hear talk of mr pratt think have replied elinor with exertion of spirit increased with increase of emotion be four year with uncle who life at longstaple near plymouth be there acquaintance begun for sister be often staying with uncle be there engagement be formed though not till year after have quitted a pupil be almost always with afterwards be very unwilling to enter into a may imagine without knowledge approbation of mother be too young loved too well to be so prudent a ought to have be though know so well a miss dashwood must have seen enough of to be sensible be very capable of making woman sincerely attached to certainly answered elinor without knowing what said after moment reflection added with revived security of edward honour love companion falsehood engaged to mr edward ferrars confess so totally surprised at what tell that really beg pardon surely there must be mistake of person name can not mean same mr ferrars can mean other cried lucy smiling mr edward ferrars eldest son of mr ferrars of park street brother of sister in law mr john dashwood be person mean must allow be not likely to be deceived a to name of man on who happiness depends be strange replied elinor in most painful perplexity must never have heard even mention name considering situation be not strange first care have be to keep matter secret knew nothing of family therefore there must be occasion for ever mentioning name to a be always particularly afraid of sister suspecting thing be reason enough for not mentioning be silent elinor security sunk self command did not sink with four year have be engaged said with firm voice yes heaven know how much longer may have to wait poor edward put quite out of heart then taking small miniature from pocket added to prevent possibility of mistake be so good a to look at face doe not do justice to be sure yet think can not be deceived a to person be drew for have have above three year put into hand a spoke when elinor saw painting other doubt fear of too hasty decision wish of detecting falsehood might suffer to linger in mind must have none of being edward face returned almost instantly acknowledging likeness have never be able continued lucy to give picture in return be very much vexed at for have be always so anxious to get be determined to set for very first opportunity be quite in right replied elinor calmly then proceeded few pace in silence lucy spoke first be sure said have doubt in world of faithfully keeping secret because must know of what importance be to not to have reach mother for must never approve of dare say will have fortune fancy be exceeding proud woman certainly did not seek confidence said elinor do more than justice in imagining may be depended on secret be safe with pardon if surprise at so unnecessary communication must at least have felt that being acquainted with must not add to safety a said looked earnestly at lucy hoping to discover something in countenance perhaps falsehood of greatest part of what have be saying lucy countenance suffered change be afraid must think be taking great liberty with said in telling have not known long to be sure personally at least have known family by description great while a soon a saw felt almost a if be old acquaintance besides in present case really thought explanation be due to after making such particular inquiry about edward mother be so unfortunate have not creature whose advice can ask anne be only person know of have judgment at indeed doe great deal more harm than good for be in constant fear of betraying doe not know how to hold tongue a must perceive be sure be in greatest fright in world t'other day when edward name be mentioned by sir john lest must out with ca think how much go through in mind from altogether only wonder that be alive after what have suffered for edward sake last four year thing in such suspense uncertainty seeing so seldom can hardly meet above twice year be sure wonder heart be not quite broke here took out handkerchief elinor did not feel very compassionate sometimes continued lucy after wiping eye think whether must not be better for to break off matter entirely a said looked directly at companion then at other time have not resolution enough for can not bear thought of making so miserable a know very mention of such thing must do on own account too so dear a be to think must be equal to what must advise to do in case miss dashwood what must do pardon replied elinor startled by question can give advice under such circumstance own judgment must direct to be sure continued lucy after few minute silence on side mother must provide for sometime other poor edward be so cast down by did not think dreadful low spirited when be at barton be so miserable when left at longstaple to go to be afraid must think quite ill did come from uncle then when visited oh yes have be staying fortnight with did think came directly from town replied elinor most feelingly sensible of fresh circumstance in favour of lucy veracity remember told that have be staying fortnight with friend near plymouth remembered too own surprise at time at mentioning nothing farther of friend at total silence with respect even to name did not think sadly out of spirit repeated lucy did indeed particularly so when first arrived begged to exert for fear must suspect what be matter made so melancholy not being able to stay more than fortnight with seeing so much affected poor fellow be afraid be just same with now for writes in wretched spirit heard from just before left exeter taking letter from pocket carelessly showing direction to elinor know hand dare say charming one be be not written so well a usual be tired dare say for have just filled sheet to a full a possible elinor saw that be hand must doubt no longer picture have allowed to believe might have be accidentally obtained might not have be edward gift correspondence between by letter must subsist only under positive engagement must be authorised by nothing else for few moment be almost overcome heart sunk within must hardly stand exertion be indispensably necessary struggled so resolutely against oppression of feeling that success be speedy for time complete writing to other said lucy returning letter into pocket be only comfort have in such long separation yes have one other comfort in picture poor edward have not even that if have picture say must be easy gave lock of hair set in ring when be at longstaple last be comfort to said not equal to picture perhaps might notice ring when saw did said elinor with composure of voice under be concealed emotion distress beyond thing have ever felt before be mortified shocked confounded fortunately for have now reached cottage conversation must be continued farther after sitting with few minute miss steele returned to park elinor be then at liberty to think be wretched chapter xxiii however small elinor general dependence on lucy veracity might be be impossible for on serious reflection to suspect in present case where temptation must be answerable to folly of inventing falsehood of such description what lucy have asserted to be true therefore elinor must not dared not longer doubt supported a be too on side by such probability proof contradicted by nothing own wish opportunity of acquaintance in house of mr pratt be foundation for rest at once indisputable alarming edward visit near plymouth melancholy state of mind dissatisfaction at own prospect uncertain behaviour towards intimate knowledge of miss steele a to norland family connection have often surprised picture letter ring formed altogether such body of evidence a overcame fear of condemning unfairly established a fact partiality must set aside ill treatment of resentment of such behaviour indignation at having be dupe for short time made feel only for other idea other consideration soon arose have edward be intentionally deceiving have feigned regard for did not feel be engagement to lucy engagement of heart might once have be must not believe such at present affection be own must not be deceived in mother sister fanny have be conscious of regard for at norland be not illusion of own vanity certainly loved what softener of heart be persuasion how much must not tempt to forgive have be blamable highly blamable in remaining at norland after first felt influence over to be more than ought to be in must not be defended if have injured how much more have injured if case be pitiable be hopeless imprudence have made miserable for while seemed to have deprived of chance of ever being otherwise might in time regain tranquillity have to look forward to must ever be tolerably happy with lucy steele must be affection for out of question with integrity delicacy well informed mind be satisfied with wife like illiterate artful selfish youthful infatuation of nineteen must naturally blind to thing beauty good nature four succeeding year year if rationally spent give such improvement to understanding must have opened eye to defect of education while same period of time spent on side in inferior society more frivolous pursuit have perhaps robbed of simplicity might once have given interesting character to beauty if in supposition of seeking to marry difficulty from mother have seemed great how much greater be now likely to be when object of engagement be undoubtedly inferior in connection probably inferior in fortune to herself difficulty indeed with heart so alienated from lucy might not press very hard upon patience melancholy be state of person by whom expectation of family opposition unkindness must be felt a relief a consideration occurred to in painful succession wept for more than for herself supported by conviction of having done nothing to merit present unhappiness consoled by belief that edward have done nothing to forfeit esteem thought must even now under first smart of heavy blow command enough to guard suspicion of truth from mother sister so well be able to answer own expectation that when joined at dinner only two hour after have first suffered extinction of dearest hope one must have supposed from appearance of sister elinor be mourning in secret over obstacle must divide for ever from object of love that marianne be internally dwelling on perfection of man of whose whole heart felt thoroughly possessed whom expected to see in carriage drove near house necessity of concealing from mother marianne what have be entrusted in confidence to though obliged to unceasing exertion be aggravation of elinor distress on contrary be relief to to be spared communication of what must give such affliction to to be saved likewise from hearing condemnation of edward must probably flow from excess of partial affection for herself be more than felt equal to support from counsel conversation knew must receive assistance tenderness sorrow must add to distress while self command must neither receive encouragement from example from praise be stronger alone own good sense so well supported that firmness be a unshaken appearance of cheerfulness a invariable a with regret so poignant so fresh be possible for to be much a have suffered from first conversation with lucy on subject soon felt earnest wish of renewing for more reason than one wanted to hear many particular of engagement repeated again wanted more clearly to understand what lucy really felt for edward whether there be sincerity in declaration of tender regard for particularly wanted to convince lucy by readiness to enter on matter again calmness in conversing on that be otherwise interested in than a friend very much feared involuntary agitation in morning discourse must have left at least doubtful that lucy be disposed to be jealous of appeared very probable be plain that edward have always spoken highly in praise not merely from lucy assertion from venturing to trust on so short personal acquaintance with secret so confessedly evidently important even sir john joking intelligence must have have weight indeed while elinor remained so well assured within herself of being really beloved by edward required other consideration of probability to make natural that lucy must be jealous that be so very confidence be proof what other reason for disclosure of affair must there be elinor might be informed by of lucy superior claim on edward be taught to avoid in future have little difficulty in understanding thus much of rival intention while be firmly resolved to act by a principle of honour honesty directed to combat own affection for edward to see a little a possible must not deny comfort of endeavouring to convince lucy that heart be unwounded a must now have nothing more painful to hear on subject than have already be told did not mistrust own ability of going through repetition of particular with composure be not immediately that opportunity of doing so must be commanded though lucy be a well disposed a to take advantage of occurred for weather be not often fine enough to allow of joining in walk where might most easily separate from others though met at least other evening at park cottage chiefly at former must not be supposed to meet for sake of conversation thought must never enter sir john lady middleton head therefore very little leisure be ever given for general chat none at for particular discourse met for sake of eating drinking laughing together playing at card consequence other game be sufficiently noisy one two meeting of kind have taken place without affording elinor chance of engaging lucy in private when sir john called at cottage one morning to beg in name of charity that must dine with lady middleton day a be obliged to attend club at exeter must otherwise be quite alone except mother two miss steele elinor who foresaw fairer opening for point have in view in party a be likely to be more at liberty among under tranquil well bred direction of lady middleton than when husband united together in one noisy purpose immediately accepted invitation margaret with mother permission be equally compliant marianne though always unwilling to join of party be persuaded by mother who must not bear to have seclude from chance of amusement to go likewise young lady went lady middleton be happily preserved from frightful solitude have threatened insipidity of meeting be exactly such a elinor have expected produced not one novelty of thought expression nothing must be le interesting than whole of discourse in dining parlour drawing room to latter child accompanied while remained there be too well convinced of impossibility of engaging lucy attention to attempt quitted only with removal of tea thing card table be then placed elinor began to wonder at for having ever entertained hope of finding time for conversation at park rose up in preparation for round game be glad said lady middleton to lucy be not going to finish poor little annamaria basket evening for be sure must hurt eye to work filigree by candlelight will make dear little love amends for disappointment to morrow then hope will not much mind hint be enough lucy recollected instantly replied indeed be very much mistaken lady middleton be only waiting to know whether can make party without must have be at filigree already must not disappoint little angel for world if want at card table now be resolved to finish basket after supper be very good hope wo hurt eye will ring bell for working candle poor little girl must be sadly disappointed know if basket be not finished tomorrow for though told certainly must not be sure depends upon having done lucy directly drew work table near reseated with alacrity cheerfulness seemed to infer that must taste greater delight than in making filigree basket for spoilt child lady middleton proposed rubber of casino to others one made objection marianne who with usual inattention to form of general civility exclaimed ladyship will have goodness to excuse know detest card will go to piano forte have not touched since be tuned without farther ceremony turned away walked to instrument lady middleton looked a if thanked heaven that have never made so rude speech marianne can never keep long from instrument know ma'be said elinor endeavouring to smooth away offence much wonder at for be very best toned piano forte ever heard remaining five be now to draw card perhaps continued elinor if must happen to cut out may be of use to miss lucy steele in rolling paper for there be so much still to be done to basket that must be impossible think for labour singly to finish evening must like work exceedingly if must allow share in indeed will be very much obliged to for help cried lucy for find there be more to be done to than thought there be must be shocking thing to disappoint dear annamaria after oh must be terrible indeed said miss steele dear little soul how do love be very kind said lady middleton to elinor a really like work perhaps will be a well pleased not to cut in till rubber will take chance now elinor joyfully profited by first of proposal thus by little of address marianne must never condescend to practise gained own end pleased lady middleton at same time lucy made room for with ready attention two fair rival be thus seated side by side at same table with utmost harmony engaged in forwarding same work pianoforte at marianne wrapped up in own music own thought have by time forgotten that body be in room besides herself be luckily so near miss dashwood now judged might safely under shelter of noise introduce interesting subject without risk of being heard at card table chapter xxiv in firm though cautious tone elinor thus began must be undeserving of confidence have honoured with if felt desire for continuance farther curiosity on subject will not apologize therefore for bringing forward again thank cried lucy warmly for breaking ice have set heart at ease by for be somehow other afraid have offended by what told that monday offended how must suppose so believe elinor spoke with truest sincerity nothing must be farther from intention than to give idea must have motive for trust be not honourable flattering to yet do assure replied lucy little sharp eye full of meaning there seemed to to be coldness displeasure in manner that made quite uncomfortable felt sure that be angry with have be quarrelling with ever since for having took liberty a to trouble with affair be very glad to find be only own fancy that really blame if knew what consolation be to to relieve heart speaking to of what be always thinking of moment of life compassion must make overlook thing else be sure indeed can easily believe that be very great relief to to acknowledge situation to be assured that will never have reason to repent case be very unfortunate one seem to to be surrounded with difficulty will have need of mutual affection to support under mr ferrars believe be entirely dependent on mother have only two thousand pound of own must be madness to marry upon though for own part must give up prospect of more without sigh have be always used to very small income must struggle with poverty for love too well to be selfish mean of robbing perhaps of that mother might give if married to please must wait may be for many year with almost other man in world must be alarming prospect edward affection constancy nothing can deprive of know conviction must be thing to be undoubtedly supported by same trust in if strength of reciprocal attachment have failed a between many people under many circumstance naturally must during four year engagement situation must have be pitiable indeed lucy here looked up elinor be careful in guarding countenance from expression must give word suspicious tendency edward love for said lucy have be pretty well put to test by long very long absence since be first engaged have stood trial so well must be unpardonable to doubt now can safely say that have never gave one moment alarm on account from first elinor hardly knew whether to smile sigh at assertion lucy went on be rather of jealous temper too by nature from different situation in life from being so much more in world than continual separation be enough inclined for suspicion to have found out truth in instant if there have be slightest alteration in behaviour to when met lowness of spirit must not account for if have talked more of one lady than seemed in respect le happy at longstaple than used to be mean to say that be particularly observant quick sighted in general in such case be sure must not be deceived thought elinor be very pretty can impose upon of what said after short silence be view have none that of waiting for mr ferrars death be melancholy shocking extremity be son determined to submit to to tediousness of many year of suspense in may involve rather than run risk of displeasure for while by owning truth if must be certain that must be only for while mr ferrars be very headstrong proud woman in first fit of anger upon hearing must very likely secure thing to robert idea of for edward sake frightens away inclination for hasty measure for own sake too be carrying disinterestedness beyond reason lucy looked at elinor again be silent do know mr robert ferrars asked elinor not at never saw fancy be very unlike brother silly great coxcomb great coxcomb repeated miss steele whose ear have caught word by sudden pause in marianne music oh be talking of favourite beau dare say sister cried lucy be mistaken there favourite beau be not great coxcomb can answer for miss dashwood be not said mr jennings laughing heartily for be one of modestest prettiest behaved young men ever saw a for lucy be such sly little creature there be finding out who like illustration can answer for said mr jennings oh cried miss steele looking significantly round at dare say lucy beau be quite a modest pretty behaved a miss dashwood elinor blushed in spite of lucy bit lip looked angrily at sister mutual silence took place for time lucy first put end to by saying in lower tone though marianne be then giving powerful protection of very magnificent concerto will honestly tell of one scheme have lately come into head for bringing matter to bear indeed be bound to let into secret for be party concerned dare say have seen enough of edward to know that must prefer church to other profession now plan be that must take order a soon a can then through interest be sure must be kind enough to use out of friendship for hope out of regard to brother might be persuaded to give norland living understand be very good one present incumbent not likely to live great while must be enough for to marry upon might trust to time chance for rest must always be happy replied elinor to show mark of esteem friendship for mr ferrars do not perceive that interest on occasion must be perfectly unnecessary be brother to mr john dashwood must be recommendation enough to husband mr john dashwood must not much approve of edward going into order then rather suspect that interest must do very little be again silent for many minute at length lucy exclaimed with deep sigh believe must be wisest way to put end to business at once by dissolving engagement seem so beset with difficulty on side that though must make miserable for time must be happier perhaps in end will not give advice miss dashwood answered elinor with smile concealed very agitated feeling on subject certainly will not know very well that opinion must have weight with unless be on side of wish indeed wrong replied lucy with great solemnity know nobody of whose judgment think so highly a do of yours do really believe that if be to say to ' advise by mean to put end to engagement with edward ferrars will be more for happiness of of ' must resolve upon doing immediately elinor blushed for insincerity of edward future wife replied compliment must effectually frighten from giving opinion on subject have formed one raise influence much too high power of dividing two people so tenderly attached be too much for indifferent person 't be because be indifferent person said lucy with pique laying particular stress on word judgment might justly have such weight with if must be supposed to be biased in respect by own feeling opinion must not be worth having elinor thought wisest to make answer to lest might provoke other to unsuitable increase of ease unreserve be even partly determined never to mention subject again pause therefore of many minute duration succeeded speech lucy be still first to end will be in town winter miss dashwood said with accustomary complacency certainly not be sorry for returned other while eye brightened at information must have gave such pleasure to meet there dare say will go for to be sure brother sister will ask to come to will not be in power to accept invitation if do how unlucky be have quite depended upon meeting there anne be to go latter end of january to relation who have be wanting to visit several year only go for sake of seeing edward will be there in february otherwise london must have charm for have not spirit for be soon called to card table by conclusion of first rubber confidential discourse of two lady be therefore at end to of submitted without reluctance for nothing have be said on side to make dislike other le than have done before elinor sat down to card table with melancholy persuasion that edward be not only without affection for person who be to be wife that have not even chance of being tolerably happy in marriage sincere affection on side must have given for self interest alone must induce woman to keep man to engagement of seemed so thoroughly aware that be weary from time subject be never revived by elinor when entered on by lucy who seldom missed opportunity of introducing be particularly careful to inform confidante of happiness whenever received letter from edward be treated by former with calmness caution dismissed a soon a civility must allow for felt such conversation to be indulgence lucy did not deserve be dangerous to herself visit of miss steele at barton park be lengthened far beyond what first invitation implied favour increased must not be spared sir john must not hear of going in spite of numerous long arranged engagement in exeter in spite of absolute necessity of returning to fulfill immediately be in full force at end of week be prevailed on to stay nearly two month at park to assist in due celebration of festival requires more than ordinary share of private ball large dinner to proclaim importance chapter xxv though mr jennings be in habit of spending large portion of year at house of child friend be not without settled habitation of own since death of husband who have traded with success in le elegant part of town have resided winter in house in one of street near portman square towards home began on approach of january to turn thought thither one day abruptly very unexpectedly by asked elder miss dashwood to accompany elinor without observing varying complexion of sister animated look spoke indifference to plan immediately gave grateful absolute denial for in believed to be speaking united inclination reason alleged be determined resolution of not leaving mother at time of year mr jennings received refusal with surprise repeated invitation immediately oh lord be sure mother can spare very well do beg will favour with company for have quite set heart upon fancy that will be inconvenience to for sha put at out of way for will only be sending betty by coach hope can afford that three will be able to go very well in chaise when be in town if like to go wherever do well good may always go with one of daughter be sure mother will not object to for have have such good luck in getting own child off hand that will think very fit person to have charge of if get one of at least well married before have done with will not be fault will speak good word for to young men may depend upon have notion said sir john miss marianne must not object to scheme if elder sister must come into be very hard indeed that must not have little pleasure because miss dashwood doe not wish so must advise two to set off for town when be tired of barton without saying word to miss dashwood about nay cried mr jennings be sure will be monstrous glad of miss marianne company whether miss dashwood will go not only more merrier say thought must be more comfortable for to be together because if got tired of might talk to one laugh at

if miss dashwood will change mind by bye why so much better thank ma'be sincerely thank said marianne with warmth invitation have insured gratitude for ever must give such happiness yes almost greatest happiness be capable of to be able to accept mother dearest kindest mother feel justice of what elinor have urged if be to be made le happy le comfortable by absence oh nothing must tempt to leave must not must not be struggle mr jennings repeated assurance that mr dashwood must spare perfectly well elinor who now understood sister saw to what indifference to almost thing else be carried by eagerness to be with willoughby again made farther direct opposition to plan merely referred to mother decision from whom however scarcely expected to receive support in endeavour to prevent visit must not approve of for marianne on own account have particular reason to avoid marianne be desirous of mother must be eager to promote must not expect to influence latter to cautiousness of conduct in affair respecting have never be able to inspire with distrust dared not explain motive of own disinclination for going to london marianne fastidious a be thoroughly acquainted with mr jennings manner invariably disgusted by must overlook inconvenience of kind must disregard must be most wounding to irritable feeling in pursuit of one object be such proof so strong so full of importance of object to a elinor in spite of have passed be not prepared to witness on being informed of invitation mr dashwood persuaded that excursion must be productive of much amusement to daughter perceiving through affectionate attention to herself how much heart of marianne be in must not hear of declining offer upon account insisted on accepting directly then began to foresee with usual cheerfulness variety of advantage must accrue to from separation be delighted with plan cried be exactly what must wish margaret will be a much benefited by a yourselves when middleton be gone will go on so quietly happily together with book music will find margaret so improved when come back again have little plan of alteration for bedroom too may now be performed without inconvenience to one be very right that must go to town must have young woman of condition in life acquainted with manner amusement of london will be under care of motherly good sort of woman of whose kindness to can have doubt in probability will see brother may be fault fault of wife when consider whose son be can not bear to have so wholly estranged from other though with usual anxiety for happiness said elinor have be obviating impediment to present scheme occurred to there be still one objection in opinion can not be so easily removed marianne countenance sunk what said mr dashwood be dear prudent elinor going to suggest what formidable obstacle be now to bring forward let hear word about expense of objection be though think very well of mr jennings heart be not woman whose society can afford pleasure whose protection will give consequence be very true replied mother of society separately from of other people will scarcely have thing at will almost always appear in public with lady middleton if elinor be frightened away by dislike of mr jennings said marianne at least need not prevent accepting invitation have such scruple be sure must put up with unpleasantness of kind with very little effort elinor must not help smiling at display of indifference towards manner of person to whom have often have difficulty in persuading marianne to behave with tolerable politeness resolved within that if sister persisted in going must go likewise a did not think proper that marianne must be left to sole guidance of own judgment that mr jennings must be abandoned to mercy of marianne for comfort of domestic hour to determination be more easily reconciled by recollecting edward ferrars by lucy account be not to be in town before february visit without unreasonable abridgement might be previously finished will have go said mr dashwood objection be nonsensical will have much pleasure in being in london especially in being together if elinor must ever condescend to anticipate enjoyment must foresee there from variety of source must perhaps expect from improving acquaintance with sister in law family elinor have often wished for opportunity of attempting to weaken mother dependence on attachment of edward that shock might be le when whole truth be revealed now on attack though almost hopeless of success forced to begin design by saying a calmly a must like edward ferrars very much will always be glad to see a to rest of family be matter of perfect indifference to whether be ever known to not mr dashwood smiled said nothing marianne lifted up eye in astonishment elinor conjectured that might a well have held tongue after very little farther discourse be finally settled that invitation must be fully accepted mr jennings received information with great deal of joy many assurance of kindness care be matter of pleasure merely to sir john be delighted for to man whose prevailing anxiety be dread of being alone acquisition of two to number of inhabitant in london be something even lady middleton took trouble of being delighted be putting rather out of way a for miss steele especially lucy have never be so happy in life a intelligence made elinor submitted to arrangement counteracted wish with le reluctance than have expected to feel with regard to herself be now matter of unconcern whether went to town not when saw mother so thoroughly pleased with plan sister exhilarated by in look voice manner restored to usual animation elevated to more than usual gaiety must not be dissatisfied with cause must hardly allow to distrust consequence marianne joy be almost degree beyond happiness so great be perturbation of spirit impatience to be gone unwillingness to quit mother be only restorative to calmness at moment of parting grief on score be excessive mother affliction be

situation so short have acquaintance with lady be so wholly unsuited be in age disposition so many have be objection against measure only few day before objection have with happy ardour of youth marianne mother equally shared be overcome overlooked elinor in spite of occasional doubt of willoughby constancy must not witness rapture of delightful expectation filled whole soul beamed in eye of marianne without feeling how blank be own prospect how cheerless own state of mind in comparison how gladly must engage in solicitude of marianne situation to have same animating object in view same possibility of hope short very short time however must now decide what willoughby intention be in probability be already in town marianne eagerness to be gone declared dependence on finding there elinor be resolved not only upon gaining new light a to character own observation intelligence of others must give likewise upon watching behaviour to sister with such zealous attention a to ascertain what be what meant before many meeting have taken place must result of observation be unfavourable be determined at event to open eye of sister must be otherwise exertion must be of different nature must then learn to avoid selfish comparison banish regret might lessen satisfaction in happiness of marianne be three day on journey marianne behaviour a travelled be happy specimen of what future complaisance companionableness to mr jennings might be expected to be sat in silence almost way wrapt in own meditation scarcely ever voluntarily speaking except when object of picturesque beauty

than have be before mr jennings must not prevail on to stay long other visitor appeared that evening lady be unanimous in agreeing to go early to bed marianne rose next morning with recovered spirit happy look disappointment of evening before seemed forgotten in expectation of what be to happen day have not long finished breakfast before mr palmer barouche stopped at door in few minute came laughing into room so delighted to see that be hard to say whether received most pleasure from meeting mother miss dashwoods again so surprised at coming to town though be what have rather expected all along so angry at accepting mother invitation after having declined own though at same time must never have forgiven if have not come mr palmer will be so happy to see said what do think said when heard of coming with mamma forget what be now be something so droll after hour two spent in what mother called comfortable chat in other word in variety of inquiry concerning acquaintance on mr jennings side in laughter without cause on mr palmer be proposed by latter that must accompany to shop where have business that morning to mr jennings elinor readily consented a having likewise purchase to make marianne though declining at first be induced to go likewise wherever went be evidently always on watch in bond street especially where much of business lay eye be in constant inquiry in shop party be engaged mind be equally abstracted from thing actually before from interested occupied others restless dissatisfied where sister must never obtain opinion of article of purchase however might equally concern received pleasure from anything be only impatient to be at home again must with difficulty govern vexation at tediousness of mr palmer whose eye be caught by thing pretty expensive new who be wild to buy must determine on none dawdled away time in rapture indecision be late in morning before returned home sooner have entered house than marianne flew eagerly up stair when elinor followed found turning from table with sorrowful countenance declared that willoughby have be there have letter be left here for since went out said to footman who then entered with parcel be answered in negative be quite sure of replied be certain that servant porter have left letter note man replied that none have how very odd said in low disappointed voice a turned away to window how odd indeed repeated elinor within regarding sister with uneasiness if have not known to be in town must not have written to a did must have written to combe magna if be in town how odd that must come write oh dear mother must be wrong in permitting engagement between daughter so young man so little known to be carried on in so doubtful so mysterious manner long to inquire how will interference be borne determined after consideration that if appearance continued many day longer a unpleasant a now be must represent in strongest manner to mother necessity of serious enquiry into affair mr palmer two elderly lady of mr jennings intimate acquaintance whom have met invited in morning dined with former left soon after tea to fulfill evening engagement elinor be obliged to assist in making whist table for others marianne be of use on occasion a must never learn game though time be therefore at own disposal evening be by mean more productive of pleasure to than to elinor for be spent in anxiety of expectation pain of disappointment sometimes endeavoured for few minute to read book be soon thrown aside returned to more interesting employment of walking backwards forward across room pausing for moment whenever came to window in hope of distinguishing long expected rap chapter xxvii if open weather hold much longer said mr jennings when met at breakfast following morning sir john will not like leaving barton next week 't be sad thing for sportsman to lose day pleasure poor soul always pity when do seem to take so much to heart be true cried marianne in cheerful voice walking to window a spoke to examine day have not thought of that weather will keep many sportsman in country be lucky recollection good spirit be restored by be charming weather for indeed continued a sat down to breakfast table with happy countenance how much must enjoy with little return of anxiety can not be expected to last long at time of year after such series of rain will certainly have very little more of frost will soon set in in probability with severity in day two perhaps extreme mildness can hardly last longer nay perhaps may freeze tonight at rate said elinor wishing to prevent mr jennings from seeing sister thought a clearly a did dare say will have sir john lady middleton in town by end of next week ay dear will warrant do mary always have own way now silently conjectured elinor will write to combe by day post if did letter be written sent away with privacy eluded watchfulness to ascertain fact whatever truth of might be far a elinor be from feeling thorough contentment about yet while saw marianne in spirit must not be very uncomfortable herself marianne be in spirit happy in mildness of weather still happier in expectation of frost morning be chiefly spent in leaving card at house of mr jennings acquaintance to inform of being in town marianne be time busy in observing direction of wind watching variation of sky imagining alteration in air find colder than be in morning elinor there seems to very decided difference can hardly keep hand warm even in muff be not so yesterday think cloud seem parting too sun will be out in moment will have clear afternoon elinor be alternately diverted pained marianne persevered saw night in brightness of fire morning in appearance of atmosphere certain symptom of approaching frost miss dashwoods have greater reason to be dissatisfied with mr jennings style of living set of acquaintance than with behaviour to be invariably kind thing in household arrangement be conducted on most liberal plan excepting few old city friend whom to lady middleton regret have never dropped visited one to whom introduction must at discompose feeling of young companion pleased to find more comfortably situated in particular than have expected elinor be very willing to compound for want of much real enjoyment from of evening party whether at home abroad formed only for card must have little to amuse colonel brandon who have general invitation to house be with almost day came to look at marianne talk to elinor who often derived more satisfaction from conversing with than from other daily occurrence who saw at same time with much concern continued regard for sister feared be strengthening regard grieved to see earnestness with often watched marianne spirit be certainly worse than when at barton about week after arrival became certain that willoughby be also arrived card be on table when came in from morning drive good god cried marianne have be here while be out elinor rejoiced to be assured of being in london now ventured to say depend upon will call again tomorrow marianne seemed hardly to hear on mr jennings entrance escaped with precious card event while raised spirit of elinor restored to of sister more than former agitation from moment mind be never quiet expectation of seeing hour of day made unfit for thing insisted on being left behind next morning when others went out elinor thought be full of what might be passing in berkeley street during absence moment glance at sister when returned be enough to inform that willoughby have paid no second visit there note be just then brought in laid on table for cried marianne stepping hastily forward ma'be for mistress marianne not convinced took instantly up be indeed for mr jennings how provoking be expecting letter then said elinor unable to be longer silent yes little not much after short pause have confidence in marianne nay elinor reproach from who have confidence in one returned elinor in confusion indeed marianne have nothing to tell answered marianne with energy situation then be alike have of thing to tell because communicate because conceal nothing elinor distressed by charge of reserve in herself be not at liberty to do away knew not how under such circumstance to press for greater openness in marianne mr jennings soon appeared note being given read aloud be from lady middleton announcing arrival in conduit street night before requesting company of mother cousin following evening business on sir john part violent cold on own prevented calling in berkeley street invitation be accepted when hour of appointment drew near necessary a be in common civility to mr jennings that must attend on visit elinor have difficulty in persuading sister to go for still have seen nothing of willoughby therefore be not more indisposed for amusement abroad than unwilling to run risk of calling again in absence elinor found when evening be over disposition be not materially altered by change of abode for although scarcely settled in town sir john have contrived to collect around nearly twenty young people to amuse with ball be affair however of lady middleton did not approve in country unpremeditated dance be very allowable in london where reputation of elegance be more important le easily attained be risking too much for gratification of few girl to have known that lady middleton have given small dance of eight nine couple with two violin mere side board collation mr mr palmer be of party from former whom have not seen before since arrival in town a be careful to avoid appearance of attention to mother in law therefore never came near received mark of recognition on entrance looked at slightly without seeming to know who be merely nodded to mr jennings from other side of room marianne gave one glance round apartment a entered be enough be not there sat down equally ill disposed to receive communicate pleasure after have be assembled about hour mr palmer sauntered towards miss dashwoods to express surprise on seeing in town though colonel brandon have be first informed of arrival at house have said something very droll on hearing that be to come thought be in devonshire said did replied elinor when do go back again know thus ended discourse never have marianne be so unwilling to dance in life a be that evening never so much fatigued by exercise complained of a returned to berkeley street aye aye said mr jennings know reason of very well if certain person who will be nameless have be there must not have be bit tired to say truth be not very pretty of not to give meeting when be invited invited cried marianne so daughter middleton told for seems sir john met somewhere in street morning marianne said more looked exceedingly hurt impatient in situation to be doing something might lead to sister relief elinor resolved to write next morning to mother hoped by awakening fear for health of marianne to procure inquiry have be so long delayed be still more eagerly bent on measure by perceiving after breakfast on morrow that marianne be again writing to willoughby for must not suppose to be to other person about middle of day mr jennings went out by on business elinor began letter directly while marianne too restless for employment too anxious for conversation walked from one window to other sat down by fire in melancholy meditation elinor be very earnest in application to mother relating have passed suspicion of willoughby inconstancy urging by plea of duty affection to demand from marianne account of real situation with respect to letter be scarcely finished when rap foretold visitor colonel brandon be announced marianne who have seen from window who hated company of kind left room before entered looked more than usually grave though expressing satisfaction at finding miss dashwood alone a if have somewhat in particular to tell sat for time without saying word elinor persuaded that have communication to make in sister be concerned impatiently expected opening be not first time of feeling same kind of conviction for more than once before beginning with observation of sister look unwell to day sister seems out of spirit have appeared on point of disclosing of inquiring something particular about after pause of several minute silence be broken by asking in voice of agitation when be to congratulate on acquisition of brother elinor be not prepared for such question having answer ready be obliged to adopt simple common expedient of asking what meant tried to smile a replied sister engagement to mr willoughby be very generally known can not be generally known returned elinor for own family know looked surprised said beg pardon be afraid inquiry have be impertinent have not supposed secrecy intended a openly correspond marriage be universally talked of how can that be by whom can have heard mentioned by many by of whom know nothing by others with whom be most intimate mr jennings mr palmer middleton still might not have believed for where mind be perhaps rather unwilling to be convinced will always find something to support doubt if have not when servant let in today accidentally seen letter in hand directed to mr willoughby in sister writing came to inquire be convinced before must ask question be thing finally settled be impossible to have right must have chance of succeeding excuse miss dashwood believe have be wrong in saying so much hardly know what to do on prudence have strongest dependence tell that be absolutely resolved on attempt that in short concealment if concealment be possible be remains word conveyed to elinor direct avowal of love for sister affected very much be not immediately able to say anything even when spirit be recovered debated for short time on answer must be most proper to give real state of thing between willoughby sister be so little known to herself that in endeavouring to explain might be a liable to say too much a too little yet a be convinced that marianne affection for willoughby must leave hope of colonel brandon success whatever event of affection might be at same time wished to shield conduct from censure thought most prudent kind after consideration to say more than really knew believed acknowledged therefore that though have never be informed by of term on stood with other of mutual affection have doubt of correspondence be not astonished to hear listened to with silent attention on ceasing to speak rose directly from seat after saying in voice of emotion to sister wish imaginable happiness to willoughby that may endeavour to deserve took leave went away elinor derived comfortable feeling from conversation to lessen uneasiness of mind on other point be left on contrary with melancholy impression of colonel brandon unhappiness be prevented even from wishing removed by anxiety for very event that must confirm chapter xxviii nothing occurred during next three four day to make elinor regret what have done in applying to mother for willoughby came wrote be engaged about end of time to attend lady middleton to party from mr jennings be kept away by indisposition of youngest daughter for party marianne wholly dispirited careless of appearance seeming equally indifferent whether went staid prepared without one look of hope one expression of pleasure sat by drawing room fire after tea till moment of lady middleton arrival without once stirring from seat altering attitude lost in own thought insensible of sister presence when at last be told that lady middleton waited for at door started a if have forgotten that one be expected arrived in due time at place of destination a soon a string of carriage before must allow alighted ascended stair heard name announced from one landing place to in audible voice entered room splendidly lit up quite full of company insufferably hot when have paid tribute of politeness by curtsying to lady of house be permitted to mingle in crowd take share of heat inconvenience to arrival must necessarily add after time spent in saying little doing le lady middleton sat down to cassino a marianne be not in spirit for moving about elinor luckily succeeding to chair placed at great distance from table have not remained in manner long before elinor perceived willoughby standing within few yard of in earnest conversation with very fashionable looking young woman soon caught eye immediately bowed without attempting to speak to to approach marianne though must not see then continued discourse with same lady elinor turned involuntarily to marianne to see whether must be unobserved by at moment first perceived whole countenance glowing with sudden delight must have moved towards instantly have not sister caught hold of good heaven exclaimed be there be there oh why doe not look at why can not speak to pray pray be composed cried elinor betray what feel to body present perhaps have not observed yet however be more than must believe to be composed at moment be not only beyond reach of marianne be beyond wish sat in agony of impatience affected feature illustration at moment first perceived at last turned round again regarded started up pronouncing name in tone of affection held out hand to approached addressing rather to elinor than marianne a if wishing to avoid eye determined not to observe attitude inquired in hurried manner after mr dashwood asked how long have be in town elinor be robbed of presence of mind by such address be unable to say word feeling of sister be instantly expressed face be crimsoned over exclaimed in voice of greatest emotion good god willoughby what be meaning of have not received letter will not shake hand with must not then avoid touch seemed painful to held hand only for moment during time be evidently struggling for composure elinor watched countenance saw expression becoming more tranquil after moment pause spoke with calmness did honour of calling in berkeley street last tuesday very much regretted be not fortunate enough to find yourselves mr jennings at home card be not lost hope have not received note cried marianne in wildest anxiety here be mistake be sure dreadful mistake what can be meaning of tell willoughby for heaven sake tell be matter made reply complexion changed embarrassment returned a if on catching eye of young lady with whom have be previously talking felt necessity of instant exertion recovered again after saying yes have pleasure of receiving information of arrival in town be so good a to send turned hastily away with slight bow joined friend marianne now looking dreadfully white unable to stand sunk into chair elinor expecting moment to see faint tried to screen from observation of others while reviving with lavender water go to elinor cried a soon a must speak force to come to tell must see again must speak to instantly can not rest will not have moment peace till be explained dreadful misapprehension other oh go to moment how can that be done dearest marianne must wait be not place for explanation wait only till tomorrow with difficulty however must prevent from following to persuade to check agitation to wait at least with appearance of composure till might speak to with more privacy more effect be impossible for marianne continued incessantly to give way in low voice to misery of feeling by exclamation of wretchedness in short time elinor saw willoughby quit room by door towards staircase telling marianne that be gone urged impossibility of speaking to again that evening a fresh argument for to be calm instantly begged sister must entreat lady middleton to take home a be too miserable to stay minute longer lady middleton though in middle of rubber on being informed that marianne be unwell be too polite to object for moment to wish of going away making over card to friend departed a soon a carriage must be found scarcely word be spoken during return to berkeley street marianne be in silent agony too much oppressed even for tear a mr jennings be luckily not come home must go directly to own room where hartshorn restored little to herself be soon undressed in bed a seemed desirous of being alone sister then left while waited return of mr jennings have leisure enough for thinking over past that kind of engagement have subsisted between willoughby marianne must not doubt that willoughby be weary of seemed equally clear for however marianne might still feed own wish must not attribute such behaviour to mistake misapprehension of kind nothing thorough change of sentiment must account for indignation must have be still stronger than be have not witnessed that embarrassment seemed to speak consciousness of own misconduct prevented from believing so unprincipled a to have be sporting with affection of sister from first without design must bear investigation absence might have weakened regard convenience might have determined to overcome that regard have formerly existed must not bring to doubt a for marianne on pang so unhappy meeting must already have given on still more severe might await in probable consequence must not reflect without deepest concern own situation gained in comparison for while must esteem edward a much a ever however might be divided in future mind might be always supported circumstance must embitter evil seemed uniting to heighten misery of marianne in final separation from willoughby in immediate irreconcilable rupture with chapter xxix before housemaid have lit fire next day sun gained power over cold gloomy morning in january marianne only half dressed be kneeling against one of window seat for sake of little light must command from writing a fast a continual flow of tear must permit in situation elinor roused from sleep by agitation sob first perceived after observing for few moment with silent anxiety said in tone of most considerate gentleness marianne may ask elinor replied ask nothing will soon know sort of desperate calmness with be said lasted no longer than while spoke be immediately followed by return of same excessive affliction be minute before must go on with letter frequent burst of grief still obliged at interval to withhold pen be proof enough of feeling how more than probable be that be writing for last time to willoughby elinor paid quiet unobtrusive attention in power must have tried to sooth tranquilize still more have not marianne entreated with eagerness of most nervous irritability not to speak to for world in such circumstance be better for that must not be long together restless state of marianne mind not only prevented from remaining in room moment after be dressed requiring at once solitude continual change of place made wander about house till breakfast time avoiding sight of body at breakfast ate attempted to eat thing elinor attention be then employed not in urging not in pitying in appearing to regard in endeavouring to engage mr jennings notice entirely to herself a be favourite meal with mr jennings lasted considerable time be just setting after round common working table when letter be delivered to marianne eagerly caught from servant turning of death like paleness instantly ran out of room elinor who saw a plainly by a if have seen direction that must come from willoughby felt immediately such sickness at heart a made hardly able to hold up head sat in such general tremor a made fear impossible to escape mr jennings notice that good lady however saw only that marianne have received letter from willoughby appeared to very good joke treated accordingly by hoping with laugh that must find to liking of elinor distress be too busily employed in measuring length of worsted for rug to see thing at calmly continuing talk a soon a marianne disappeared said upon word never saw young woman so desperately in love in life girl be nothing to yet used to be foolish enough a for miss marianne be quite altered creature hope from bottom of heart wo keep waiting much longer for be quite grievous to see look so ill forlorn pray when be to be married elinor though never le disposed to speak than at moment obliged to answer attack a therefore trying to smile replied have really ma'be talked into persuasion of sister being engaged to mr willoughby thought have be only joke so serious question seems to imply more must beg therefore will not deceive longer do assure that nothing must surprise more than to hear of being going to be married for shame for shame miss dashwood how can talk so know that must be match that be over head ear in love with other from first moment met did not see together in devonshire day day long did not know that sister came to town with on purpose to buy wedding clothes come come wo do because be so sly about think nobody else have sens be such thing can tell for have be known over town ever so long tell body of so doe charlotte indeed ma'be said elinor very seriously be mistaken indeed be doing very unkind thing in spreading report will find that have though will not believe now mr jennings laughed again elinor have not spirit to say more eager at event to know what willoughby have written hurried away to room where on opening door saw marianne stretched on bed almost choked by grief one letter in hand two three others laying by elinor drew near without saying word seating on bed took hand kissed affectionately several time then gave way to burst of tear at first be scarcely le violent than marianne latter though unable to speak seemed to feel tenderness of behaviour after time thus spent in joint affliction put letter into elinor hand then covering face with handkerchief almost screamed with agony elinor who knew that such grief shocking a be to witness must have course watched by till excess of suffering have somewhat spent then turning eagerly to willoughby letter read a follows bond street january dear madam have just have honour of receiving letter for beg to return sincere acknowledgment be much concerned to find there be anything in behaviour last night did not meet approbation though be quite at loss to discover in what point must be so unfortunate a to offend entreat forgiveness of what can assure to have be perfectly unintentional will never reflect on former acquaintance with family in devonshire without most grateful pleasure flatter will not be broken by mistake misapprehension of action esteem for whole family be very sincere if have be so unfortunate a to give rise to belief of more than felt meant to express will reproach for not having be more guarded in profession of esteem must ever have meant more will allow to be impossible when understand that affection have be long engaged elsewhere will not be many week believe before engagement be fulfilled be with great regret that obey command in returning letter with have be honoured from lock of hair so obligingly bestowed on be dear madam most obedient humble servant john willoughby with what indignation letter a must be read by miss dashwood may be imagined though aware before began that must bring confession of inconstancy confirm separation for ever be not aware that such language must be suffered to announce must have supposed willoughby capable of departing so far from appearance of honourable delicate feeling so far from common decorum of gentleman a to send letter so impudently cruel letter instead of bringing with desire of release profession of regret acknowledged breach of faith denied peculiar affection whatever letter of line be insult proclaimed writer to be deep in hardened villainy paused over for time with indignant astonishment then read again again perusal only served to increase abhorrence of man so bitter be feeling against that dared not trust to speak lest might wound marianne still deeper by treating disengagement not a loss to of possible good a escape from worst most irremediable of evil connection for life with unprincipled man a deliverance most real blessing most important in earnest meditation on content of letter on depravity of mind must dictate probably on very different mind of very different person who have other connection with affair than what heart gave with thing passed elinor forgot immediate distress of sister forgot that have three letter on lap yet unread so entirely forgot how long have

stayed in shop till be gone be mr ellison that a have be since informed be name of miss grey guardian be have likewise heard that miss grey have fifty thousand pound in if in thing may find explanation may be so willoughby be capable at least think stopped moment then added in voice seemed to distrust sister how did suffering have be very severe have only to hope that may be proportionately short have be be most cruel affliction till yesterday believe never doubted regard even now perhaps be almost convinced that never be really attached to have be very deceitful in point there seems hardness of heart about ah said colonel brandon there be indeed sister doe not think said so doe not consider quite a do know disposition may believe how eagerly must still justify if must made answer soon afterwards by removal of tea thing arrangement of card party subject be necessarily dropped mr jennings who have watched with pleasure while be talking who expected to see effect of miss dashwood communication in such instantaneous gaiety on colonel brandon side a might have become man in bloom of youth of hope happiness saw with amazement remain whole evening more serious thoughtful than usual chapter xxxi from night of more sleep than have expected marianne awoke next morning to same consciousness of misery in have closed eye elinor encouraged a much a possible to talk of what felt before breakfast be ready have gone through subject again again with same steady conviction affectionate counsel on elinor side same impetuous feeling varying opinion on marianne a before sometimes must believe willoughby to be a unfortunate a innocent a herself at others lost consolation in impossibility of acquitting at one moment be absolutely indifferent to observation of world at must seclude from for ever at third must resist with energy in one thing however be uniform when came to point in avoiding where be possible presence of mr jennings in determined silence when obliged to endure heart be hardened against belief of mr jennings entering into sorrow with compassion can not be cried can not feel kindness be not sympathy good nature be not tenderness that want be gossip only like now because supply elinor have not needed to be assured of injustice to sister be often led in opinion of others by irritable refinement of own mind too great importance placed by on delicacy of strong sensibility grace of polished manner like rest of world if more than half there be be clever good marianne with excellent ability excellent disposition be reasonable candid expected from other people same opinion feeling a own judged of motif by immediate effect of action on thus circumstance occurred while sister be together in own room after breakfast sunk heart of mr jennings still lower in estimation because through own weakness chanced to prove source of fresh pain to herself though mr jennings be governed in by impulse of utmost good will with letter in outstretched hand countenance gaily smiling from persuasion of bringing comfort entered room saying now dear bring something be sure will do good marianne heard enough in one moment imagination placed before letter from willoughby full of tenderness contrition explanatory of have passed satisfactory convincing instantly followed by willoughby rushing eagerly into room to enforce at foot by eloquence of eye assurance of letter work of one moment be destroyed by next hand writing of mother never till then unwelcome be before in acuteness of disappointment followed ecstasy of more than hope felt a if till instant have never suffered cruelty of mr jennings language within reach in moment of happiest eloquence must have expressed now must reproach only by tear streamed from eye with passionate violence reproach however so entirely lost on object that after many expression of pity withdrew still referring to letter of comfort letter when be calm enough to read brought little comfort willoughby filled page mother still confident of engagement relying a warmly a ever on constancy have only be roused by elinor application to entreat from marianne greater openness towards with such tenderness towards such affection for willoughby conviction of future happiness in other that wept with agony through whole of impatience to be at home again now returned mother be dearer to than ever dearer through very excess of mistaken confidence in willoughby be wildly urgent to be gone elinor unable herself to determine whether be better for marianne to be in london at barton offered counsel of own except of patience till mother wish must be known at length obtained sister consent to wait for knowledge mr jennings left earlier than usual for must not be easy till middleton palmer be able to grieve a much a herself positively refusing elinor offered attendance went out alone for rest of morning elinor with very heavy heart aware of pain be going to communicate perceiving by marianne letter how ill have succeeded in laying foundation for then sat down to write mother account of what have passed entreat direction for future while marianne who came into drawing room on mr jennings going away remained fixed at table where elinor wrote watching advancement of pen grieving over for hardship of such task grieving still more fondly over effect on mother in manner have continued about quarter of hour when marianne whose nerve must not then bear sudden noise be startled by rap at door who can be cried so early too thought have be safe marianne moved to window be colonel brandon said with vexation be never safe from will not come in a mr jennings be from home will not trust to retreating to own room man who have nothing to do with own time have conscience in intrusion on of others event proved conjecture right though be founded on injustice error for colonel brandon did come in elinor who be convinced that solicitude for marianne brought thither who saw solicitude in disturbed melancholy look in anxious though brief inquiry after must not forgive sister for esteeming so lightly met mr jennings in bond street said after first salutation encouraged to come on be more easily encouraged because thought probable might find alone be very desirous of doing object wish sole wish in desiring hope believe be be to be mean of giving comfort must not say comfort not present comfort conviction lasting conviction to sister mind regard for for yourself for mother will allow to prove by relating circumstance nothing very sincere regard nothing earnest desire of being useful think be justified though where so many hour have be spent in convincing that be right be there not reason to fear may be wrong stopped understand said elinor have something to tell of mr

distress with creditable home help friend ignorant of address have left promising to return neither returned wrote relieved be beyond thing exclaimed elinor character be now before expensive dissipated worse than knowing a have now known many week guess what must have felt on seeing sister a fond of a ever on being assured that be to marry guess what must have felt for sake when came to last week found alone came determined to know truth though irresolute what to do when be known behaviour must have seemed strange to then now will comprehend to suffer to be so deceived to see sister what must do have hope of interfering with success sometimes thought sister influence might yet reclaim now after such dishonorable usage who can tell what be design on whatever may have be however may now hereafter doubtless will turn with gratitude towards own condition when compare with of poor eliza when considers wretched hopeless situation of poor girl picture to herself with affection for so strong still a strong a own with mind tormented by self reproach must attend through life surely comparison must have use with will feel own suffering to be nothing proceed from misconduct can bring disgrace on contrary friend must be made still more friend by concern for unhappiness respect for fortitude under must strengthen attachment use own discretion however in communicating to what have told must know best what will be effect have not seriously from heart believed might be of service might lessen regret must not have suffered to trouble with account of family affliction with recital may seem to have be intended to raise at expense of others elinor thanks followed speech with grateful earnestness attended too with assurance of expecting material advantage to marianne from communication of what have passed have be more pained said by endeavor to acquit than by rest for irritates mind more than most perfect conviction of unworthiness can do now though at first will suffer much be sure will soon become easier have continued after short silence ever seen mr willoughby since left at barton yes replied gravely once have one meeting be unavoidable elinor startled by manner looked at anxiously saying what have met to must meet other way eliza have confessed to though most reluctantly name of lover when returned to town be within fortnight after met by appointment to defend to punish conduct returned unwounded meeting therefore never got abroad elinor sighed over fancied necessity of to man soldier presumed not to censure such said colonel brandon after pause have be unhappy resemblance between fate of mother daughter so imperfectly have discharged trust be still in town no a soon a recovered from lying in for found near delivery removed child into country there remains recollecting soon afterwards that be probably dividing elinor from sister put end to visit receiving from again same grateful acknowledgment leaving full of compassion esteem for chapter xxxii when particular of conversation be repeated by miss dashwood to sister a very soon be effect on be not entirely such a former have hoped to see not that marianne appeared to distrust truth of part of for listened to with most steady submissive attention made objection remark attempted vindication of willoughby seemed to show by tear that felt to be impossible though behaviour assured that conviction of guilt be carried home to mind though saw with satisfaction effect of in no longer avoiding colonel brandon when called in speaking to even voluntarily speaking with kind of compassionate respect though saw spirit le violently irritated than before did not see le wretched mind did become settled be settled in gloomy dejection felt loss of willoughby character yet more heavily than have felt loss of heart seduction desertion of miss williams misery of poor girl doubt of what design might once have be on preyed altogether so much on spirit that must not bring to speak of what felt even to elinor brooding over sorrow in silence gave more pain to sister than must have be communicated by most open most frequent confession of to give feeling language of mr dashwood on receiving answering elinor letter must be only to give repetition of what daughter have already felt said of disappointment hardly le painful than marianne indignation even greater than elinor long letter from quickly succeeding other arrived to tell that suffered thought to express anxious solicitude for marianne entreat must bear up with fortitude under misfortune bad indeed must nature of marianne affliction be when mother must talk of fortitude mortifying humiliating must be origin of regret must wish not to indulge against interest of own individual comfort mr dashwood have determined that must be better for marianne to be where at time than at barton where thing within view must be bringing back past in strongest most afflicting manner by constantly placing willoughby before such a have always seen there recommended to daughter therefore by mean not to shorten visit to mr jennings length of though never exactly fixed have be expected by to comprise at least five six week variety of occupation of object of company must not be procured at barton must be inevitable there might yet hoped cheat marianne at time into interest beyond even into amusement much a idea of might now be spurned by from danger of seeing willoughby again mother considered to be at least equally safe in town a in country since acquaintance must now be dropped by who called friend design must never bring in other way negligence must never leave exposed to surprise chance have le in favour in crowd of london than even in retirement of barton where might force before while paying that visit at allenham on marriage mr dashwood from foreseeing at first a probable event have brought to expect a certain one have yet reason for wishing child to remain where be letter from son in law have told that wife be to be in town before middle of february judged right that must sometimes see brother marianne have promised to be guided by mother opinion submitted to therefore without opposition though proved perfectly different from what wished expected though felt to be entirely wrong formed on mistaken ground that by requiring longer continuance in london deprived of only possible alleviation of wretchedness personal sympathy of mother doomed to such society such scene a must prevent ever knowing moment rest be matter of great consolation to that what brought evil to herself must bring good to sister elinor on other hand suspecting that must not be in power to avoid edward entirely comforted herself by thinking that though longer stay must therefore militate against own happiness must be better for marianne than immediate return into devonshire carefulness in guarding sister from ever hearing willoughby name mentioned be not thrown away marianne though without knowing reaped advantage

gentlemanlike man think elinor may congratulate on prospect of very respectable establishment in life brother what do mean like observed narrowly be convinced of be amount of fortune believe about two thousand year two thousand year then working up to pitch of enthusiastic generosity added elinor wish with heart be twice a much for sake indeed believe replied elinor be very sure that colonel brandon have not smallest wish of marrying be mistaken elinor be very much mistaken very little trouble on side secures perhaps just at present may be undecided smallness of fortune may make hang back friend may advise against of little attention encouragement lady can so easily give will fix in spite of there can be reason why must not try for be not to be supposed that prior attachment on side in short know a to attachment of kind be quite out of question objection be insurmountable have too much sense not to see colonel brandon must be man civility will be wanting on part to make pleased with family be match must give universal satisfaction in short be kind of thing that lowering voice to important whisper will be exceedingly welcome to party recollecting however added that be mean to say friend be truly anxious to see well settled fanny particularly for have interest very much at heart assure mother too mr ferrars very good natured woman be sure must give great pleasure said a much other day elinor must not vouchsafe answer must be something remarkable now continued something droll if fanny must have brother sister settling at same time yet be not very unlikely be mr edward ferrars said elinor with resolution going to be married be not actually settled there be such thing in agitation have most excellent mother mr ferrars with utmost liberality will come forward settle on thousand year if match take place lady be hon miss morton only daughter of late lord morton with thirty thousand pound very desirable connection on side have not doubt of taking place in time thousand year be great deal for mother to give away to make over for ever mr ferrars have noble spirit to give instance of liberality other day a soon a came to town aware that money must not be very plenty with just now put bank note into fanny hand to amount of two hundred pound extremely acceptable be for must live at great expense while be here paused for assent compassion forced to say expense in town country must certainly be considerable income be large one not so large dare say a many people suppose mean to complain however be undoubtedly comfortable one hope will in time be better enclosure of norland common now carrying on be most serious drain then have made little purchase within half year east kingham farm must remember place where old gibson used to live land be so very desirable for in respect so immediately adjoining own property felt duty to buy must not have answered to conscience to let fall into other hand man must pay for convenience have cost vast deal of money more than think really intrinsically worth why hope not that might have sold again next day for more than gave with regard to purchase money might have be very unfortunate indeed for stock be at time so low that if have not happened to have necessary sum in banker hand must have sold out to very great loss elinor must only smile other great inevitable expense too have have on first coming to norland respected father a well know bequeathed stanhill effect remained at norland very valuable be to mother far be from to repine at doing so have undoubted right to dispose of own property a chose in consequence of have be obliged to make large purchase of linen china c to supply place of what be taken away may guess after expense how very far must be from being rich how acceptable mr ferrars kindness be certainly said elinor assisted by liberality hope may yet live to be in easy circumstance year two may do much towards gravely replied however there be still great deal to be done there be not stone laid of fanny green house nothing plan of flower garden marked out where be green house to be upon knoll behind house old walnut tree be come down to make room for will be very fine object from many part of park flower garden will slope down just before be exceedingly pretty have cleared away old thorn grew in patch over brow elinor kept concern censure to herself be very thankful that marianne be not present to share provocation having now said enough to make poverty clear to do away necessity of buying pair of ear ring for of sister in next visit at gray thought took cheerfuller turn began to congratulate elinor on having such friend a mr jennings seems most valuable woman indeed house style of living bespeak exceeding good income be acquaintance have not only be of great use to hitherto in end may prove materially advantageous inviting to town be certainly vast thing in favour indeed speaks altogether so great regard for that in probability when dy will not be forgotten must have great deal to leave nothing at must rather suppose for have only jointure will descend to child be not to be imagined that life up to income few people of common prudence will do save will be able to dispose of do not think more likely that must leave to daughter than to daughter be exceedingly well married therefore can not perceive necessity of remembering farther whereas in opinion by taking so much notice of treating in kind of way have given sort of claim on future consideration conscientious woman must not disregard nothing can be kinder than behaviour can hardly do without being aware of expectation raise raise none in most concerned indeed brother anxiety for welfare prosperity carry too far why to be sure said seeming to recollect people have little have very little in power dear elinor what be matter with marianne look very unwell have lost colour be grown quite thin be ill be not well have have nervous complaint on for several week be sorry for at time of life thing of illness destroys bloom for ever have be very short one be a handsome girl last september a ever saw a likely to attract man there be something in style of beauty to please particularly remember fanny used to say that must marry sooner better than did not what be exceedingly fond of so happened to strike will be mistaken however question whether marianne now will marry man worth more than five six hundred year at utmost be very much deceived if do better dorsetshire know very little of dorsetshire dear elinor will be exceedingly glad to know more of think can answer for having fanny among earliest best pleased of visitor elinor tried very seriously to convince that there be likelihood of marrying colonel brandon be expectation of too much pleasure to to be relinquished be really resolved on seeking intimacy with gentleman promoting marriage by possible attention have just compunction enough for having done nothing for sister to be exceedingly anxious that everybody else must do great deal offer from colonel brandon legacy from mr jennings be easiest mean of atoning for own neglect be lucky enough to find lady middleton at home sir john came in before visit ended abundance of civility passed on side sir john be ready to like anybody though mr dashwood did not seem to know much about horse soon set down a very good natured fellow while lady middleton saw enough of fashion in appearance to think acquaintance worth having mr dashwood went away delighted with will have charming account to carry to fanny said a walked back with sister lady middleton be really most elegant woman woman a be sure fanny will be glad to know mr jennings too exceedingly well behaved woman though not so elegant a daughter sister need not have scruple even of visiting to say truth have be little case very naturally for only knew that mr jennings be widow of man who have got money in low way fanny mr ferrars be strongly prepossessed that daughter be such kind of woman a fanny must like to associate with now can carry most satisfactory account of chapter xxxiv mr john dashwood have so much confidence in husband judgment that waited very next day on mr jennings daughter confidence be rewarded by finding even former even woman with whom sister be staying by mean unworthy notice a for lady middleton found one of most charming woman in world lady middleton be equally pleased with mr dashwood there be kind of cold hearted selfishness on side mutually attracted sympathised with other in insipid propriety of demeanor general want of understanding same manner however recommended mr john dashwood to good opinion of lady middleton did not suit fancy of mr jennings to appeared nothing more than little proud looking woman of uncordial address who met husband sister without affection almost without having anything to say to for of quarter of hour bestowed on berkeley street sat at least seven minute half in silence elinor wanted very much to know though did not choose to ask whether edward be then in town nothing must have induced fanny voluntarily to mention name before till able to tell that marriage with miss morton be resolved on till husband expectation on colonel brandon be answered because believed still so very much attached to other that must not be too sedulously divided in word deed on occasion intelligence however must not give soon flowed from quarter lucy came very shortly to claim elinor compassion on being unable to see edward though have arrived in town with mr mr dashwood dared not come to bartlett building for fear of detection though mutual impatience to meet be not to be told must hing at present write edward assured of being in town within very short time by twice calling in berkeley street twice be card found on table when returned from morning engagement be pleased that have called still more pleased that have missed dashwoods be so prodigiously delighted with middleton though not much in habit of giving anything determined to give dinner soon after acquaintance began invited to dine in harley street where have taken very good house for three month sister mr jennings be invited likewise john dashwood be careful to secure colonel brandon who always glad to be where miss dashwoods be received eager civility with surprise much more pleasure be to meet mr ferrars elinor must not learn whether son be to be of party expectation of seeing however be enough to make interested in engagement for though must now meet edward mother without strong anxiety have once promised to attend such introduction though must now see with perfect indifference a to opinion of desire of being in company with mr ferrars curiosity to know what be like be a lively a ever interest with thus anticipated party be soon afterwards increased more powerfully than pleasantly by hearing that miss steele be also to be at so well have recommended to lady middleton so agreeable have assiduity made to that though lucy be certainly not so elegant sister not even genteel be a ready a sir john to ask to spend week two in conduit street happened to be particularly convenient to miss steele a soon a dashwoods invitation be known that visit must begin few day before party took place claim to notice of mr john dashwood a niece of gentleman who for many year have have care of brother might not have done much however towards procuring seat at table a lady middleton guest must be welcome lucy who have long wanted to be personally known to family to have nearer view of character own difficulty to have opportunity of endeavouring to please have seldom be happier in life than be on receiving mr john dashwood card on effect be very different began immediately to determine edward who lived with mother must be asked a mother be to party given by sister to see for first time after passed in company of lucy hardly knew how must bear apprehension perhaps be not founded entirely on reason certainly not at on truth be relieved however not by own recollection by good will of lucy who believed to be inflicting severe disappointment when told that edward certainly must not be in harley street on tuesday even hoped to be carrying pain still farther by persuading that be kept away by extreme affection for herself must not conceal when be together important tuesday came be to introduce two young lady to formidable mother in law pity dear miss dashwood said lucy a walked up stair together for middleton arrived so directly after mr jennings that followed servant at same time there be nobody here can feel for declare can hardly stand good gracious in moment will see person that happiness depends on be to be mother elinor must have given immediate relief by suggesting possibility of being miss morton mother rather than own whom be about to behold instead of doing that assured with great sincerity that did pity her to utter amazement of lucy who though really uncomfortable hoped at least to be object of irrepressible envy to elinor mr ferrars be little thin woman upright even to formality in figure serious even to sourness in aspect complexion be sallow feature small without beauty naturally without expression lucky contraction of brow have rescued countenance from disgrace of insipidity by giving strong character of pride ill nature be not woman of many word for unlike people in general proportioned to number of idea of few syllable did escape not one fell to share of miss dashwood whom eyed with spirited determination of disliking at event elinor must not now be made unhappy by behaviour few month ago must have hurt exceedingly be not in mr ferrars power to distress by now difference of manner to miss steele difference seemed purposely made to humble more only amused must not smile to see graciousness of mother daughter towards very person for lucy be particularly distinguished whom of others have known a much a did must have be most anxious to mortify while who have comparatively power to wound sat pointedly slighted by while smiled at graciousness so misapplied must not reflect on mean spirited folly from sprung observe studied attention with miss

grand one servant be numerous thing bespoke mistress inclination for show master ability to support in spite of improvement addition be making to norland estate in spite of owner having once be within thousand pound of being obliged to sell out at loss nothing gave symptom of indigence have tried to infer from poverty of kind except of conversation appeared there deficiency be considerable john dashwood have not much to say for be worth hearing wife have still le there be peculiar disgrace in for be very much case with chief of visitor who almost laboured under one other of disqualification for being agreeable want of sense natural improved want of elegance want of spirit want of temper when lady withdrew to drawing room after dinner poverty be particularly evident for gentleman have supplied discourse with variety variety of politics inclosing land breaking horse then be over one subject only engaged lady till coffee came in be comparative height of harry dashwood lady middleton second son william who be nearly of same age have child be there affair might have be determined too easily by measuring at once a harry only be present be conjectural assertion on side body have right to be equally positive in opinion to repeat over over again a often a liked party stood thus two mother though really convinced that own son be tallest politely decided in favour of other two grandmother with not le partiality more sincerity be equally earnest in support of own descendant lucy who be hardly le anxious to please one parent than other thought boy be remarkably tall for age must not conceive that there must be smallest difference in world between miss steele with yet greater address gave a fast a must in favour of elinor having once delivered opinion on william side by offended mr ferrars fanny still more did not see necessity of enforcing by farther assertion marianne when called on for offended by declaring that have opinion to give a have never thought about before removing from norland elinor have painted very pretty pair of screen for sister in law being now just mounted brought home ornamented present drawing room screen catching eye of john dashwood on following other gentleman into room be officiously handed by to colonel brandon for admiration be done by eldest sister said a man of taste will dare say be pleased with know whether have ever happened to see of performance before be in general reckoned to draw extremely well colonel though disclaiming pretension to connoisseurship warmly admired screen a must have done thing painted by miss dashwood on curiosity of others being of course excited be handed round for general inspection mr ferrars not aware of being elinor work particularly requested to look at after have received gratifying testimony of lady middleton approbation fanny presented to mother considerately informing at same time that be done by miss dashwood hum said mr ferrars very pretty without regarding at returned to daughter perhaps fanny thought for moment that mother have be quite rude enough for colouring little immediately said be very pretty ma'be then again dread of having be too civil too encouraging probably came over for presently added do not think be something in miss morton style of painting ma'be doe paint most delightfully how beautifully last landscape be done beautifully indeed doe thing well marianne must not bear be already greatly displeased with mr ferrars such ill timed praise of at elinor expense though have not notion of what be principally meant by provoked immediately to say with warmth be admiration of very particular kind what be miss morton to who know who care for be elinor of whom think speak so saying took screen out of sister in law hand to admire a ought to be admired illustration mr ferrars mr ferrars looked exceedingly angry drawing up more stiffly than ever pronounced in retort bitter philippic miss morton be lord morton daughter fanny looked very angry too husband be in fright at sister audacity elinor be much more hurt by marianne warmth than have be by what produced colonel brandon eye a be fixed on marianne declared that noticed only what be amiable in affectionate heart must not bear to see sister slighted in smallest point marianne feeling did not stop here cold insolence of mr ferrars general behaviour to sister seemed to to foretell such difficulty distress to elinor a own wounded heart taught to think of with horror urged by strong impulse of affectionate sensibility moved after moment to sister chair putting one arm round neck one cheek close to hers said in low eager voice dear dear elinor mind let make unhappy must say no more spirit be quite overcome hiding face on elinor shoulder burst into tear body attention be called almost body be concerned colonel brandon rose up went to without knowing what did mr jennings with very intelligent ah poor dear immediately gave salt sir john felt so desperately enraged against author of nervous distress that instantly changed seat to one close by lucy steele gave in whisper brief account of whole shocking affair in few minute however marianne be recovered enough to put end to bustle sit down among rest though spirit retained impression of what have passed whole evening poor marianne said brother to colonel brandon in low voice a soon a must secure attention have not such good health a sister be very nervous have not elinor constitution one must allow that there be something very trying to young woman who have be beauty in loss of personal attraction must not think perhaps marianne be remarkably handsome few month ago quite a handsome a elinor now see be gone chapter xxxv elinor curiosity to see mr ferrars be satisfied have found in thing must tend to make farther connection between family undesirable have seen enough of pride meanness determined prejudice against to comprehend difficulty must have perplexed engagement retarded marriage of edward have be otherwise free have seen almost enough to be thankful for own sake one greater obstacle preserved from suffering under other of mr ferrars creation preserved from dependence upon caprice solicitude for good opinion at least if did not bring quite to rejoice in edward being fettered to lucy determined that have be more amiable ought to have rejoiced wondered that lucy spirit must be so very much elevated by civility of mr ferrars that interest vanity must so very much blind a to make attention seemed only paid because be not elinor appear compliment to herself to allow to derive encouragement from preference only given because real situation be unknown that be so have not only be declared by lucy eye at time be declared over again next morning more openly for at particular desire lady middleton set down in berkeley street on chance of seeing elinor alone to tell how happy be chance proved lucky one for message from mr palmer soon after arrived carried mr jennings away dear friend cried a soon a be by come to talk to of happiness must anything be so flattering a mr ferrars way of treating yesterday so exceeding affable a be know how dreaded thought of seeing very moment be introduced there be such affability in behaviour a really must seem to say have quite took fancy to now be not so saw be not quite struck with be certainly very civil to civil did see nothing only civility saw vast deal more such kindness a fell to share of nobody pride hauteur sister just same sweetness affability elinor wished to talk of something else lucy still pressed to own that have reason for happiness elinor be obliged to go on undoubtedly if have known engagement said nothing must be more flattering than treatment of a be not case guessed must say so replied lucy quickly there be reason in world why mr ferrars must seem to like if did not liking be thing sha talk out of satisfaction be sure will end well there will be difficulty at to what used to think mr ferrars be charming woman so be sister be delightful woman indeed wonder must never hear say how agreeable mr dashwood be to elinor have answer to make did not attempt be ill miss dashwood seem low speak sure well never be in better health be glad of with heart really did not look must be sorry to have ill have be greatest comfort to in world heaven know what must have done without friendship elinor tried to make civil answer though doubting own success seemed to satisfy lucy for directly replied indeed be perfectly convinced of regard for next to edward love be greatest comfort have poor edward now there be one good thing will be able to meet meet pretty often for lady middleton delighted with mr dashwood so will be good deal in harley street dare say edward spends time with sister besides lady middleton mr ferrars will visit now mr ferrars sister be so good to say more than once must always be glad to see be such charming woman be sure if ever tell sister what think of can not speak too high elinor must not give encouragement to hope that must tell sister lucy continued be sure must have seen in moment if mr ferrars have took dislike to if have only made formal courtesy for instance without saying word never after have took notice of never looked at in pleasant way know what mean if have be treated in forbidding sort of way must have gave up in despair must not have stood for where doe dislike know be most violent elinor be prevented from making reply to civil triumph by door being thrown open servant announcing mr ferrars edward immediately walking in be very awkward moment countenance of showed that be so looked exceedingly foolish edward seemed to have a great inclination to walk out of room again a to advance farther into very circumstance in unpleasantest form must have be most anxious to avoid have fallen on be not only all three together be together without relief of other person lady recovered first be not lucy business to put forward appearance of secrecy must still be kept up must therefore only look tenderness after slightly addressing said more elinor have more to do so anxious be for sake own to do well that forced after moment recollection to welcome with look manner be almost easy almost open struggle effort still improved must not allow presence of lucy consciousness of injustice towards to deter from saying that be happy to see that have very much regretted being from home when called before in berkeley street must not be frightened from paying attention a friend almost relation be due by observant eye of lucy though soon perceived to be narrowly watching manner gave re assurance to edward have courage enough to sit down embarrassment still exceeded that of lady in proportion case rendered reasonable though sex might make rare for heart have not indifference of lucy must conscience have ease of elinor lucy with demure settled air seemed determined to make contribution to comfort of others must not say word almost thing be said proceeded from elinor who be obliged to volunteer information about mother health coming to town c edward ought to have inquired about never did exertion did not stop here for soon afterwards felt so heroically disposed a to determine under pretence of fetching marianne to leave others by really did that in handsomest manner for loitered away several minute on landing place with most high minded fortitude before went to sister when be once done however be time for rapture of edward to cease for marianne joy hurried into drawing room immediately pleasure in seeing be like other of feeling strong in strongly spoken met with hand must be taken voice expressed affection of sister dear edward cried be moment of great happiness must almost make amends for thing edward tried to return kindness a deserved before such witness dared not say half what really felt again sat down for moment two be silent while marianne be looking with most speaking tenderness sometimes at edward sometimes at elinor regretting only that delight in other must be checked by lucy unwelcome presence edward be first to speak be to notice marianne altered look express fear of not finding london agree with oh think of replied with spirited earnestness though eye be filled with tear a spoke think of health elinor be well see must be enough for remark be not calculated to make edward elinor more easy to conciliate good will of lucy who looked up at marianne with very benignant expression do like london said edward willing to say thing might introduce subject not at all expected much pleasure in have found none sight of edward be only comfort have afforded thank heaven be what always be paused spoke think elinor presently added must employ edward to take care of in return to barton in week two suppose will be going trust edward will not be very unwilling to accept charge poor edward muttered something what be nobody knew not even marianne who saw agitation must easily trace to whatever cause best pleased be perfectly satisfied soon talked of something else spent such day edward in harley street yesterday so dull so wretchedly dull have much to say to on head can not be said now with admirable discretion did defer assurance of finding mutual relative more disagreeable than ever of being particularly disgusted with mother till be more in private why be not there edward why did not come be engaged elsewhere engaged what be when such friend be to be met perhaps miss marianne cried lucy eager to take revenge on think young men never stand upon engagement if have mind to keep little a well a great elinor be very angry marianne seemed entirely insensible of sting for calmly replied not so indeed for seriously speaking be very sure that conscience only kept edward from harley street really believe have most delicate conscience in world most scrupulous in performing engagement however minute however may make against interest pleasure be most fearful of giving pain of wounding expectation most incapable of being selfish of body ever saw edward be so will say be never to hear praised then must be friend of mine for who will accept of love esteem must submit to open commendation nature of commendation in present case however happened to be particularly ill suited to feeling of two third of auditor be so very unexhilarating to edward that very soon got up to go away going so soon said marianne dear edward must not be drawing little aside whispered persuasion that lucy must not stay much longer even encouragement failed for must go lucy who must have outstayed have visit lasted two hour soon afterwards went away what can bring here so often said marianne on leaving must not see that wanted gone how teasing to edward why so be friend lucy have be longest known to of be natural that must like to see a well a ourselves marianne looked at steadily said know elinor that be kind of talking can not bear if only hope to have assertion contradicted a must suppose to be case ought to recollect be last person in world to do can not descend to be tricked out of assurance be not really wanted then left room elinor dared not follow to

twisted head into bow assured a plainly a word must have done that be exactly coxcomb have heard described to be by lucy happy have be for if regard for edward have depended le on own merit than on merit of nearest relation for then brother bow must have given finishing stroke to what ill humour of mother sister must have begun while wondered at difference of two young men did not find that emptiness conceit of one put out of charity with modesty worth of other why be different robert explained to in course of quarter of hour conversation for talking of brother lamenting extreme gaucherie really believed kept from mixing in proper society candidly generously attributed much le to natural deficiency than to misfortune of private education while though probably without particular material superiority by nature merely from advantage of public school be a well fitted to mix in world a other man upon soul added believe be nothing more so often tell mother when be grieving about bey dear madam always say to 'you must make easy evil be now irremediable have be entirely own doing why must be persuaded by uncle sir robert against own judgment to place edward under

convinced of error elinor must not oppose opinion because might be general estimation of advantage of public school must not think of edward abode in mr pratt family with satisfaction reside in

in cottage a in most spacious dwelling elinor agreed to for did not think deserved compliment of rational opposition a john dashwood have more pleasure in music than eldest sister mind be equally at liberty to fix on thing else thought struck during evening communicated to wife for approbation when got home consideration of mr dennison mistake in supposing sister guest have suggested propriety of being really invited to become such while mr jennings engagement kept from home expense must be nothing inconvenience not more be altogether attention delicacy of conscience pointed out to be requisite to complete enfranchisement from promise to father fanny be startled at proposal see how can be done said without affronting lady middleton for spend day with otherwise must be exceedingly glad to do know be always ready to pay attention in power a taking out evening show be lady middleton visitor how can ask away from husband with great humility did not see force of objection have already spent week in manner in conduit street lady middleton must not be displeased at giving same number of day to such near relation fanny paused moment then with fresh vigor said love must ask with heart if be in power have just settled within to ask miss steele to spend few day with be very well behaved good kind of girl think attention be due to a uncle did so very well by edward can ask sister other year know miss steele may not be in town more be sure will like indeed do like know very much already so doe mother be such favourite with harry mr dashwood be convinced saw necessity of inviting miss steele immediately conscience be pacified by resolution of inviting sister year at same time however slyly suspecting that year must make invitation needle by bringing elinor to town a colonel brandon wife marianne a visitor fanny rejoicing in escape proud of ready wit have procured wrote next morning to lucy to request company sister for day in harley street a soon a lady middleton must spare be enough to make lucy really reasonably happy mr dashwood seemed actually working for herself cherishing hope promoting view such opportunity of being with edward family be above thing most material to interest invitation most gratifying to feeling be advantage must not be too gratefully acknowledged too speedily made use of visit to lady middleton have not before have precise limit be instantly discovered to have be always meant to end in two day time when note be shown to elinor a be within ten minute after arrival gave for first time share in expectation of lucy for mark of uncommon kindness vouchsafed on so short acquaintance seemed to declare that good will towards arose from something more than merely malice against might be brought by time address to do thing lucy wished flattery have already subdued pride of lady middleton made entry into close heart of mr john dashwood be effect laid open probability of greater miss steele removed to harley street reached elinor of influence there strengthened expectation of event sir john who called on more than once brought home such account of favour be in a must be universally striking mr dashwood have never be so much pleased with young woman in life a be with have given of needle book made by emigrant called lucy by christian name did not know whether must ever be able to part with chapter xxxvii mr palmer be so well at end of fortnight that mother felt no longer necessary to give up whole of time to contenting with visiting once twice day returned from period to own home own habit in found miss dashwoods very ready to resume former share about third fourth morning after being thus resettled in berkeley street mr jennings on returning from ordinary visit to mr palmer entered drawing room where elinor be sitting by with air of such hurrying importance a prepared to hear something wonderful giving time only to form idea began directly to justify by saying lord dear miss dashwood have heard news ma'be what be something so strange will hear when got to mr palmer found charlotte quite in fuss about child be sure be very ill cried fretted be over pimple so looked at directly 'lord dear ' say 'it be nothing in world red gum nurse said just same charlotte must not be satisfied so mr donavan be sent for luckily happened to just come in from harley street so stepped over directly a soon a ever saw child said just a did that be nothing in world red gum then charlotte be easy so just a be going away again came into head be sure know how happened to think of came into head to ask if there be news so upon that smirked simpered looked grave seemed to know something other at last said in whisper 'for fear unpleasant report must reach young lady under care a to sister indisposition think advisable to say that believe there be great reason for alarm hope mr dashwood will do very well what be fanny ill illustration in whisper be exactly what said dear 'lord say 'be mr dashwood ill ' so then came out long short of matter by can learn seems to be mr edward ferrars very young man used to joke with about however a turn out be monstrous glad there be never thing in mr edward ferrars seems have be engaged above twelvemonth to cousin lucy there be for dear not creature knowing syllable of matter except nancy must have believed thing possible there be great wonder in liking one that matter must be brought so forward between nobody suspect be strange never happened to see together be sure must have found out directly well so be kept great secret for fear of mr ferrars brother sister suspected word of matter till very morning poor nancy who know be well meaning creature conjurer popt out 'lord think to herself 'they be so fond of lucy to be sure will make difficulty about ' so away went to sister who be sitting alone at carpet work little suspecting what be to come for have just be saying to brother only five minute before thought to make match between edward lord daughter other forget who so may think what blow be to vanity pride fell into violent hysteric immediately with such scream a reached brother ear a be sitting in own dressing room down stair thinking about writing letter to steward in country so up flew directly terrible scene took place for lucy be come to by time little dreaming what be going on poor soul pity must say think be used very hardly for sister scolded like fury soon drove into fainting fit nancy fell upon knee cried bitterly brother walked about room said did not know what to do mr dashwood declared must not stay minute longer in house brother be forced to go down upon knee too to persuade to let stay till have packed up clothes then fell into hysteric again be so frightened that must send for mr donavan mr donavan found house in uproar carriage be at door ready to take poor cousin away be just stepping in a came off poor lucy in such condition say must hardly walk nancy be almost a bad declare have patience with sister hope with heart will be match in spite of lord what taking poor mr edward will be in when hears of to have love used so scornfully for say be monstrous fond of a well may must not wonder if be to be in greatest passion mr donavan think just same have great deal of talk about best of be that be gone back again to harley street that may be within call when mr ferrars be told of for be sent for a soon a ever cousin left house for sister be sure must be in hysteric too so may for what care have pity for of have notion of people making such to do about money greatness there be reason on earth why mr edward lucy must not marry for be sure mr ferrars may afford to do very well by son though lucy have next to nothing know better than body how to make most of thing dare say if mr ferrars must only allow five hundred year must make a good appearance with a body else must with eight lord how snug might live in such cottage a yours little bigger with two maid two men believe must help to housemaid for betty have sister out of place must fit exactly here mr jennings ceased a elinor have have time enough to collect thought be able to give such answer make such observation a subject might naturally be supposed to produce happy to find that be not suspected of extraordinary interest in that mr jennings a have of late often hoped might be case have ceased to imagine at attached to edward happy above rest in absence of marianne felt very well able to speak of affair without embarrassment to give judgment a believed with impartiality on conduct of one concerned in must hardly determine what own expectation of event really be though earnestly tried to drive away notion of being possible to end otherwise at last than in marriage of edward lucy what mr ferrars must say do though there must not be doubt of nature be anxious to hear still more anxious to know how edward must conduct for felt much compassion for lucy very little cost pain to procure little for rest of party none at a mr jennings must talk on other subject elinor soon saw necessity of preparing marianne for discussion time be to be lost in undeceiving in making acquainted with real truth in endeavouring to bring to hear talked of by others without betraying that felt uneasiness for sister resentment against edward elinor office be painful one be going to remove what really believed to be sister chief consolation to give such particular of edward a feared must ruin for ever in good opinion to make marianne by resemblance in situation to fancy must seem strong feel own disappointment over again unwelcome a such task must be be necessary to be done elinor therefore hastened to perform be very far from wishing to dwell on own feeling to represent a suffering much otherwise than a self command have practised since first knowledge of edward engagement might suggest hint of what be practicable to marianne narration be clear simple though must not be given without emotion be not accompanied by violent agitation impetuous grief belonged rather to hearer for marianne listened with horror cried excessively elinor be to be comforter of others in own distress le than in theirs comfort must be given by assurance of own composure of mind very earnest vindication of edward from charge of imprudence be readily offered marianne for time must give credit to edward seemed second willoughby acknowledging a elinor did that have loved most sincerely must feel le than a for lucy steele considered so totally unamiable so absolutely incapable of attaching sensible man that must not be persuaded at first to believe afterwards to pardon former affection of edward for must not even admit to have be natural elinor left to be convinced that be so by only must convince better knowledge of mankind first communication have reached no farther than to state fact of engagement length of time have existed marianne feeling have then broken in put end to regularity of detail for time must be done be to soothe distress lessen alarm combat resentment first question on side led to farther particular be how long have be known to elinor have written to have known four month when lucy first came to barton park last november told in confidence of engagement at word marianne eye expressed astonishment lip must not utter after pause of wonder exclaimed four month have known of four month elinor confirmed what while attending in misery have be on heart have reproached for being happy be not fit that must then know how much be reverse four month cried marianne again so calm so cheerful how have be supported by feeling be doing duty promise to lucy obliged to be secret owed to therefore to avoid giving hint of truth owed to family friend not to create in solicitude about must not be in power to satisfy marianne seemed much struck have very often wished to undeceive mother added elinor once twice have attempted without betraying trust never must have convinced four month yet loved yes did not love only while comfort of others be dear to be glad to spare from knowing how much felt now can think speak of with little emotion must not have suffer on account for assure no longer suffer materially have many thing to support be not conscious of having provoked disappointment by imprudence of own have borne a much a possible without spreading farther acquit edward of essential misconduct wish very happy be so sure of always doing duty that though now may harbour regret in end must become so lucy doe not want sense be foundation on thing good may be built after marianne after be bewitching in idea of single constant attachment can be said of one happiness depending entirely on particular person be not meant be not fit be not possible that must be so edward will marry lucy will marry woman superior in person understanding to half sex time habit will teach to forget that ever thought superior to if such be way of thinking said marianne if loss of what be most valued be so easily to be made up by something else resolution self command be perhaps little le to be wondered at be brought more within comprehension understand suppose have ever felt much for four month marianne have have hanging on mind without being at liberty to speak of to single creature knowing that must make mother most unhappy whenever be explained to yet unable to prepare for in least be told be in manner forced on by very person whose prior engagement ruined prospect told a thought with triumph person suspicion therefore have have to oppose by endeavouring to appear indifferent where have be most deeply interested have not be only once have have hope exultation to listen to again again have known to be divided from edward for ever without hearing one circumstance must make le desire connection nothing have proved unworthy have anything declared indifferent to have have to contend against unkindness of sister insolence of mother have suffered punishment of attachment without enjoying advantage have be going on at time when a know too well have not be only unhappiness if can think capable of ever feeling surely may suppose have suffered now composure of mind with have brought at present to consider matter consolation have be willing to admit have be effect of constant painful exertion did not spring up of did not occur to relieve spirit at first marianne then if have not be bound to silence perhaps nothing must have kept entirely not even what owed to dearest friend from openly showing be very unhappy marianne be quite subdued oh elinor cried have made hate for ever how barbarous have be to who have be only comfort who have borne with in misery who have seemed to be only suffering for be gratitude be only return can make because merit cry out upon myself have be trying to do away tenderest caress followed confession in such frame of mind a be now in elinor have difficulty in obtaining from promise required at request marianne engaged never to speak of affair to one with least appearance of bitterness to meet lucy without betraying smallest increase of dislike to even to see edward if chance must bring together without diminution of usual cordiality be great concession where marianne felt that have injured reparation must be too much for to make performed promise of being discreet to admiration attended to mr jennings have to say upon subject with unchanging complexion dissented from in nothing be heard three time to say yes ma'be listened to praise of lucy with only moving from one chair to when mr jennings talked of edward affection cost only spasm in throat such advance towards heroism in sister made elinor feel equal to thing next morning brought farther trial of in visit from brother who came with most serious aspect to talk over dreadful affair bring news of wife have heard suppose said with great solemnity a soon a be seated of very shocking discovery took place under roof yesterday looked assent seemed too awful moment for speech illustration have heard suppose sister continued have suffered dreadfully mr ferrars too in short have be scene of such complicated distress will hope that storm may be weathered without being of quite overcome poor fanny be in hysteric yesterday must not alarm too much donavan say there be nothing materially to be apprehended constitution be good one resolution equal to thing have borne with fortitude of angel say never will think well of anybody again one can not wonder at after being so deceived meeting with such ingratitude where so much kindness have be shown so much confidence have be placed be quite out of benevolence of heart that have asked young woman to house merely because thought deserved attention be harmless well behaved girl must be pleasant companion for otherwise wished very much to have invited marianne to be with while kind friend there be attending daughter now to be so rewarded ' wish with heart ' say poor fanny in affectionate way 'that have asked sister instead of ' here stopped to be thanked being done went on what poor mr ferrars suffered when first fanny broke to be not to be described while with truest affection have be planning most eligible connection for be to be supposed that must be time secretly engaged to person suspicion must never have entered head if suspected prepossession elsewhere must not be in quarter 'there to be sure said ' might have thought safe ' be quite in agony consulted together however a to what must be done at last determined to send for edward came be sorry to relate what ensued that mr ferrars must say to make put end to engagement assisted too a may well suppose by argument fanny entreaty be of avail duty affection thing be disregarded never thought edward so stubborn so unfeeling before mother explained to liberal design in case of marrying miss morton told must settle on norfolk estate clear of land tax brings in good thousand year offered even when matter grew desperate to make twelve hundred in opposition to if still persisted in low connection represented to certain penury must attend match own two thousand pound protested must be must never see again so far must be from affording smallest assistance that if be to enter into profession with view of better support must do in power to prevent advancing in here marianne in ecstasy of indignation clapped hand together cried gracious god can be possible well may wonder marianne replied brother at obstinacy must resist such argument a exclamation be very natural marianne be going to retort remembered promise forbore however continued be urged in vain edward said very little what did say be in most determined manner nothing must prevail on to give up engagement must stand to cost what might then cried mr jennings with blunt sincerity no longer able to be silent have acted like honest man beg pardon mr dashwood if have done otherwise must have thought rascal have little concern in business a well a for lucy steele be cousin believe there be not better kind of girl in world one who more deserves good husband john dashwood be greatly astonished nature be calm not open to provocation never wished to offend anybody especially anybody of good fortune therefore replied without resentment must by mean speak disrespectfully of relation of yours madam miss lucy steele be dare say very deserving young woman in present case know connection must be impossible to have entered into secret engagement with young man under uncle care son of woman especially of such very large fortune a mr ferrars be perhaps altogether little extraordinary in short mean to reflect upon behaviour of person whom have regard for mr jennings wish extremely happy mr ferrars conduct throughout whole have be such a conscientious good mother in like circumstance must adopt have be dignified liberal edward have drawn own lot fear will be bad one marianne sighed out similar apprehension elinor heart wrung for feeling of edward while braving mother threat for woman who must not reward well sir said mr jennings how did end be sorry to say ma'be in most unhappy rupture edward be dismissed for ever from mother notice left house yesterday where be gone whether be still in town know for of course can make inquiry poor young man what be to become of what indeed ma'be be melancholy consideration born to prospect of such affluence can not conceive situation more deplorable interest of two thousand pound how can man live on when to be added recollection that might for own folly within three month have be in receipt of two thousand five hundred year for miss morton have thirty thousand pound can not picture to myself more wretched condition must feel for more so because be totally out of power to assist poor young man cried mr jennings be sure must be very welcome to bed board at house so must tell if must see be not fit that must be living about at own charge now at lodging tavern elinor heart thanked for such kindness towards edward though must not forbear smiling at form of if must only have done a well by said john dashwood a friend be disposed to do by might now have be in proper situation must have wanted for nothing a be must be out of anybody power to assist there be one thing more preparing against must be worse than mother have determined with very natural kind of spirit to settle estate upon robert immediately might have be edward on proper condition left morning with lawyer talking over business illustration talking over business well said mr jennings be revenge everybody have way of own think must be to make one son independent because have plagued marianne got up walked about room can anything be more galling to spirit of man continued john than to see younger brother in possession of estate might have be own poor edward feel for sincerely few minute more spent in same kind of effusion concluded visit with repeated assurance to sister that really believed there be material danger in fanny indisposition that need not therefore be very uneasy about went away leaving three lady unanimous in sentiment on present occasion a far at least a regarded mr ferrars conduct dashwoods edward marianne indignation burst forth a soon a quitted room a vehemence made reserve impossible in elinor unnecessary in mr jennings joined in very spirited critique upon party chapter xxxviii mr jennings be very warm in praise of edward conduct only elinor marianne understood true merit only knew how little have have to tempt to be disobedient how small be consolation beyond consciousness of doing right must remain to in loss of friend fortune elinor gloried in integrity marianne forgave offence in compassion for punishment though confidence between be by public discovery restored to proper state be not subject on of be fond of dwelling when alone elinor avoided upon principle a tending to fix still more upon thought by too warm too positive assurance of marianne that belief of edward continued affection for herself rather wished to do away be courage soon failed in trying to converse upon topic always left more dissatisfied with than ever by comparison necessarily produced between elinor conduct own felt force of comparison not a sister have hoped to urge to exertion now felt with pain of continual self reproach regretted most bitterly that have never exerted before brought only torture of penitence without hope of amendment mind be so much weakened that still fancied present exertion impossible therefore only dispirited more nothing new be heard by for day two afterwards of affair in harley street bartlett building though so much of matter be known to already that mr jennings might have have enough to do in spreading that knowledge farther without seeking after more have resolved from first to pay visit of comfort inquiry to cousin a soon a must nothing hindrance of more visitor than

jennings elinor be of number marianne who knew that willoughbys be again in town have constant dread of meeting chose rather to stay at home than venture into so public place intimate acquaintance of mr jennings joined soon after entered garden elinor be not sorry that by continuing with engaging mr jennings conversation be left to quiet reflection saw nothing of willoughbys nothing of edward for time nothing of anybody who must by chance whether grave gay be interesting to at last found with surprise accosted by miss steele who though looking rather shy expressed great satisfaction in meeting on receiving encouragement from particular kindness of mr jennings left own party for short time to join mr jennings immediately whispered to elinor get out of dear will tell thing if ask see can not

increased day sighed for air liberty quiet of country fancied that if place must give ease barton must do elinor be hardly le anxious than for removal only so much le bent on being effected immediately a be conscious of difficulty of so long journey marianne must not be brought to acknowledge began however seriously to turn thought towards accomplishment have already mentioned wish to kind hostess who resisted with eloquence of good will when plan be suggested though detaining from home yet few week longer appeared to elinor altogether much more eligible than other palmer be to remove to cleveland about end of march for easter holiday mr jennings with friend received very warm invitation from charlotte to go with must not in have be sufficient for delicacy of miss dashwood be enforced with so much real politeness by mr palmer a joined to very great amendment of manner towards since sister have be known to be unhappy induced to accept with pleasure when told marianne what have done however first reply be not very auspicious cleveland cried with great agitation can not go to cleveland forget said elinor gently that situation be not that be not in neighbourhood of be in somersetshire can not go into somersetshire there where looked forward to going elinor can not expect to go there elinor must not argue upon propriety of overcoming such feeling only endeavoured to counteract by working on others represented therefore a measure must fix time of returning to dear mother whom so much wished to see in more eligible more comfortable manner than other plan must do perhaps without greater delay from cleveland be within few mile of bristol distance to barton be not beyond one day though long day journey mother servant might easily come there to attend down a there must be occasion of staying above week at cleveland might now be at home in little more than three week time a marianne affection for mother be sincere must triumph with little difficulty over imaginary evil have started mr jennings be so far from being weary of guest that pressed very earnestly to return with again from cleveland elinor be grateful for attention must not alter design mother concurrence being readily gained thing relative to return be arranged a far a must be marianne found relief in drawing up statement of hour be yet to divide from barton ah colonel know what will do without miss dashwoods be mr jennings address to when first called on after leaving be settled for be quite resolved upon going home from palmer how forlorn will be when come back lord will sit gape at one a dull a two cat perhaps mr jennings be in hope by vigorous sketch of future ennui to provoke to make offer might give escape from if so have soon afterwards good reason to think object gained for on elinor moving to window to take more expeditiously dimension of print be going to copy for friend followed to with look of particular meaning conversed with there for several minute effect of discourse on lady too must not escape observation for though be too honorable to listen have even changed seat on purpose that might not hear to one close by piano forte on marianne be playing must not keep from seeing that elinor changed colour attended with agitation be too intent on what said to pursue employment still farther in confirmation of hope in interval of marianne turning from one lesson to word of colonel inevitably reached ear in seemed to be apologising for badness of house set matter beyond doubt wondered indeed at thinking necessary to do so supposed to be proper etiquette what elinor said in reply must not distinguish judged from motion of lip that did not think that material objection mr jennings commended in heart for being so honest then talked on for few minute longer without catching syllable when lucky stop in marianne performance brought word in colonel calm voice be afraid can not take place very soon astonished shocked at so unlover like speech be almost ready to cry out lord what must hinder checking desire confined to silent ejaculation be very strange sure need not wait to be older delay on colonel side however did not seem to offend mortify fair companion in least for on breaking up conference soon afterwards moving different way mr jennings very plainly heard elinor say with voice showed to feel what said will always think very much obliged to mr jennings be delighted with gratitude only wondered that after hearing sentence colonel must be able to take leave of a immediately did with utmost sang froid go away without making reply have not thought old friend must have made so indifferent suitor have really passed between be to effect have heard said with great compassion of injustice friend mr ferrars have suffered from family for if understand matter right have be entirely cast off by for persevering in engagement with very deserving young woman have be rightly informed be so elinor told that be cruelty impolitic cruelty replied with great feeling of dividing attempting to divide two young people long attached to other be terrible mr ferrars doe not know what may be doing what may drive son to have seen mr ferrars two three time in harley street be much pleased with be not young man with whom one can be intimately acquainted in short time have seen enough of to wish well for own sake a friend of yours wish still more understand that intends to take order will be so good a to tell that living of delaford now just vacant a be informed by day post be if think worth acceptance that perhaps so unfortunately circumstanced a be now may be nonsense to appear to doubt only wish be more valuable be rectory small one late incumbent believe did not make more than l per annum though be certainly capable of improvement fear not to amount a to afford very comfortable income such a be however pleasure in presenting to will be very great pray assure of elinor astonishment at commission must hardly have be greater have colonel be really making offer of hand preferment only two day before have considered a hopeless for edward be already provided to enable to marry of people in world be fixed on to bestow emotion be such a mr jennings have attributed to very different cause minor feeling le pure le pleasing might have share in emotion esteem for general benevolence gratitude for particular friendship together prompted colonel brandon to act be strongly felt warmly expressed thanked for with heart spoke of edward principle disposition with praise knew to deserve promised to undertake commission with pleasure if be really wish to put off so agreeable office to at same time must not help thinking that one must so well perform a be office in short from unwilling to give edward pain of receiving obligation from must have be very glad to be spared colonel brandon on motif of equal delicacy declining likewise still seemed so desirous of being given through mean that must not on account make farther opposition edward believed be still in town fortunately have heard address from miss steele must undertake therefore to inform of in course of day after have be settled colonel brandon began to talk of own advantage in securing so respectable agreeable neighbour then be that mentioned with regret that house be small indifferent evil elinor a mr jennings have supposed to do made very light of at least a far a regarded size smallness of house said can not imagine inconvenience to for will be in proportion to family income by colonel be surprised to find that be considering mr ferrars marriage a certain consequence of presentation for did not suppose possible that delaford living must supply such income a anybody in style of life must venture to settle on said so little rectory can do more than make mr ferrars comfortable a bachelor can not enable to marry be sorry to say that patronage end with interest be hardly more extensive if however by unforeseen chance must be in power to serve farther must think very differently of from what now do if be not a ready to be useful to then a sincerely wish must be at present what be now doing indeed seems nothing at since can advance so little towards what must be principal only object of happiness marriage must still be distant good at least be afraid can not take place very soon such be sentence when misunderstood so justly offended delicate feeling of mr jennings after narration of what really passed between colonel brandon elinor while stood at window gratitude expressed by latter on parting may perhaps appear in general not le reasonably excited le properly worded than if have arisen from offer of marriage chapter xl well miss dashwood said mr jennings sagaciously smiling a soon a gentleman have withdrawn ask what colonel have be saying to for though upon honour tried to keep out of hearing must not help catching enough to understand business assure never be better pleased in life wish joy of with heart thank ma'be said elinor be matter of great joy to feel goodness of colonel brandon most sensibly there be not many men who must act a have done few people who have so compassionate heart never be more astonished in life lord dear be very modest least astonished at in world for have often thought of late there be nothing more likely to happen judged from knowledge of colonel general benevolence at least must not foresee that opportunity must so very soon occur opportunity repeated mr jennings oh a to when man have once made up mind to thing somehow other will soon find opportunity well dear wish joy of again again if ever there be happy couple in world think will soon know where to look for mean to go to delaford after suppose said elinor with faint smile aye dear do indeed a to house being bad one know what colonel must be at for be a good one a ever saw spoke of being out of repair well whose fault be that why repair who must do be interrupted by servant coming in to announce carriage being at door mr jennings immediately preparing to go said well dear must be gone before have have half talk out however may have over in evening for will be quite alone ask to go with for dare say mind be too full of matter to care for company besides must long to tell sister about marianne have left room before conversation began certainly ma'be will tell marianne of will not mention at present to body else oh very well said mr jennings rather disappointed then must not have tell to lucy for think of going a far a holborn to day ma'be not even lucy if please one day delay will not be very material till have written to mr ferrars think ought not to be mentioned to body else will do directly be of importance that time must be lost with for will of course have much to do relative to ordination speech at first puzzled mr jennings exceedingly why mr ferrars be to have be written to about in hurry must not immediately comprehend few moment reflection however produced very happy idea exclaimed oh ho understand mr ferrars be to be man well so much better for ay to be sure must be ordained in readiness be very glad to find thing be so forward between dear be not rather out of character must not colonel write sure be proper person elinor did not quite understand beginning of mr jennings speech did think worth inquiring into therefore only replied to conclusion colonel brandon be so delicate man that rather wished one to announce intention to mr ferrars than so be forced to do well be odd kind of delicacy however will not disturb seeing preparing to write know own concern best so good bye dear have not heard of thing to please so well since charlotte be brought to bed away went returning again in moment have just be thinking of betty sister dear must be very glad to get so good mistress whether must do for lady maid be sure ca tell be excellent housemaid work very well at needle however will think of at leisure certainly ma'be replied elinor not hearing much of what said more anxious to be alone than to be mistress of subject how must begin how must express in note to edward be now concern particular circumstance between made difficulty of to other person must have be easiest thing in world equally feared to say too much too little sat deliberating over paper with pen in hand till broken in on by entrance of edward have met mr jennings at door in way to carriage a came to leave farewell card after apologising for not returning have obliged to enter by saying that miss dashwood be above wanted to speak with on very particular business elinor have just be congratulating in midst of perplexity that however difficult might be to express properly by letter be at least preferable to giving information by word of mouth when visitor entered to force upon greatest exertion of astonishment confusion be very great on so sudden appearance have not seen before since engagement became public therefore not since knowing to be acquainted with with consciousness of what have be thinking of what have to tell made feel particularly uncomfortable for minute too be much distressed sat down together in most promising state of embarrassment whether have asked pardon for intrusion on first coming into room must not recollect determining to be on safe side made apology in form a soon a must say thing after taking chair mr jennings told said that wished to speak with at least understood so certainly must not have intruded on in manner though at same time must have be extremely sorry to leave london without seeing sister especially a will most likely be time be not probable must soon have pleasure of meeting again go to oxford tomorrow must not have gone however said elinor recovering determined to get over what so much dreaded a soon a possible without receiving good wish even if have not be able to give in person mr jennings be quite right in what said have something of consequence to inform of be on point of communicating by paper be charged with most agreeable office breathing rather faster than usual a spoke colonel brandon who be here only ten minute ago have desired to say that understanding mean to take order have great pleasure in offering living of delaford now just vacant only wish be more valuable allow to congratulate on having so respectable well judging friend to join in wish that living be about two hundred year be much more considerable such a might better enable to a might be more than temporary accommodation to yourself such in short a might establish view of happiness what edward felt a must not say can not be expected that one else must say for looked astonishment such unexpected such unthought of information must not fail of exciting said only two word colonel brandon yes continued elinor gathering more resolution a of worst be over colonel brandon mean a testimony of concern for what have lately passed for cruel situation in unjustifiable conduct of family have placed concern be sure marianne friend must share likewise a proof of high esteem for general character particular approbation of behaviour on present occasion colonel brandon give living can be possible unkindness of own relation have made astonished to find friendship where replied be with sudden consciousness not to find in for can not be ignorant that to to goodness owe feel must express if must a well know be orator be very much mistaken do assure that owe entirely at least almost entirely to own merit colonel brandon discernment of have have hand in did not even know till understood design that living be vacant have ever occurred to that might have have living in gift a friend of mine of family may perhaps indeed know have still greater pleasure in bestowing upon word owe nothing to solicitation truth obliged to acknowledge small share in action be at same time so unwilling to appear a benefactress of edward that acknowledged with hesitation probably contributed to fix suspicion in mind have recently entered for short time sat deep in thought after elinor have ceased to speak at last a if be rather effort said colonel brandon seems man of great worth respectability have always heard spoken of a such brother know esteem highly be undoubtedly sensible man in manner perfectly gentleman indeed replied elinor believe that will find on farther acquaintance that have heard to be a will be such very near neighbour for understand parsonage be almost close to mansion house be particularly important that must be edward made answer when have turned away head gave look so serious so earnest so uncheerful a seemed to say that might hereafter wish distance between parsonage mansion house much greater colonel brandon think lodge in st james street said soon afterwards rising from chair elinor told number of house must hurry away then to give thanks will not allow to give to assure that have made very exceedingly happy man elinor did not offer to detain parted with very earnest assurance on side of unceasing good wish for happiness in change of situation might befall on with rather attempt to return same good will than power of expressing when see again said elinor to herself a door shut out will see husband of lucy with pleasing anticipation sat down to reconsider past recall word endeavour to comprehend feeling of edward of course to reflect on own with discontent when mr jennings came home though returned from seeing people whom have never seen before of whom therefore must have great deal to say mind be so much more occupied by important secret in possession than by anything else that reverted to again a soon a elinor appeared well dear cried sent up young man did not do right suppose have great difficulty did not find very unwilling to accept proposal ma'be be not very likely well how soon will be ready for seems to depend upon really said elinor know so little of kind of form can hardly even conjecture a to time preparation necessary suppose two three month will complete ordination two three month cried mr jennings lord dear how calmly talk of can colonel wait two three month lord bless be sure must put quite out of patience though one must be very glad to do kindness by poor mr ferrars do think be not worth while to wait two three month for sure somebody else might be found must do a well somebody be in order already dear ma'be said elinor what can be thinking of why colonel brandon only object be to be of use to mr ferrars lord bless dear sure mean to persuade that colonel only marries for sake of giving ten guinea to mr ferrars illustration gained considerable amusement deception must not continue after explanation immediately took place by gained considerable amusement for moment without material loss of happiness to for mr jennings only exchanged one form of delight for still without forfeiting expectation of first aye aye parsonage be small one said after first ebullition of surprise satisfaction be over very likely may be out of repair to hear man apologising a thought for house that to knowledge have five sitting room on ground floor think housekeeper told must make up fifteen bed to too have be used to live in barton cottage seems quite ridiculous dear must touch up colonel to do thing to parsonage make comfortable for before lucy go to colonel brandon doe not seem to have idea of living being enough to allow to marry colonel be ninny dear because have two thousand year think that nobody else can marry on le take word for that if be alive will be paying visit at delaford parsonage before michaelmas be sure sha go if lucy there elinor be quite of opinion a to probability of not waiting for thing more chapter xli edward having carried thanks to colonel brandon proceeded with happiness to lucy such be excess of by time reached bartlett building that be able to assure mr jennings who called on again next day with congratulation that have never seen in such spirit before in life own happiness own spirit be at least very certain joined mr jennings most heartily in expectation of being comfortably together in delaford parsonage before michaelmas so far be at same time from backwardness to give elinor that credit edward must give that spoke of friendship for with most grateful warmth be ready to own obligation to openly declared that exertion for good on miss dashwood part present future must ever surprise for believed capable of doing thing in world for really valued a for colonel brandon be not only ready to worship a saint be moreover truly anxious that must be treated a one in worldly concern anxious that tithe must be raised to utmost secretly resolved to avail at delaford a far a possibly must of servant carriage cow poultry be now above week since john dashwood have called in berkeley street a since time notice have be taken by of wife indisposition beyond one verbal enquiry elinor began to feel necessary to pay visit be obligation however not only opposed own inclination have not assistance of encouragement from companion marianne not contented with absolutely refusing to go be very urgent to prevent sister going at mr jennings though carriage be always at elinor service so very much disliked mr john dashwood that not even curiosity to see how looked after late discovery strong desire to affront by taking edward part must overcome unwillingness to be in company again consequence be that elinor set out by to pay visit for one must really have le inclination to run risk of tte tte with woman whom of others have so much reason to dislike mr dashwood be denied before carriage must turn from house husband accidentally came out expressed great pleasure in meeting elinor told that have be just going to call in berkeley street assuring that fanny must be very glad to see invited to come in walked up stair in to drawing room nobody be there fanny be in own room suppose said will go to presently for be sure will not have least objection in world to seeing very far from indeed now especially there can not be however marianne be always great favourite why must not marianne come elinor made what excuse must for be not sorry to see alone replied for have good deal to say to living of colonel brandon can be true have really given to edward heard yesterday by chance be coming to on purpose to enquire farther about be perfectly true colonel brandon have given living of delaford to edward really well be very astonishing relationship connection between now that living fetch price be value of about two hundred year very well for next presentation to living of value supposing late incumbent to have be old sickly likely to vacate soon might have got dare say fourteen hundred pound how came not to have settled matter before person death now indeed must be too late to sell man of colonel brandon sense wonder must be so improvident in point of such common such natural concern well be convinced that there be vast deal of inconsistency in almost human character suppose however on recollection that case may probably be edward be only to hold living till person to whom colonel have really sold presentation be old enough to take aye aye be fact depend upon elinor contradicted however very positively by relating that have be employed in conveying offer from colonel brandon to edward therefore must understand term on be given obliged to submit to authority be truly astonishing cried after hearing what said what must be colonel motive very simple one to be of use to mr ferrars well well colonel brandon may be edward be very lucky man will not mention matter to fanny however for though have broke to bear vastly well will not like to hear much talked of elinor have difficulty here to refrain from observing that thought fanny might have borne with composure acquisition of wealth to brother by child must be possibly impoverished mr ferrars added lowering voice to tone becoming so important subject know nothing about at present believe will be best to keep entirely concealed from a long a may be when marriage take place fear must hear of why must such precaution be used though be not to be supposed that mr ferrars can have smallest satisfaction in knowing that son have money enough to live upon for must be quite out of question yet why upon late behaviour be supposed to feel at have done with son cast off for ever have made over whom have influence cast off likewise surely after doing so can not be imagined liable to impression of sorrow of joy on account can not be interested in thing befalls must not be so weak a to throw away comfort of child yet retain anxiety of parent ah elinor said john reasoning be very good be founded on ignorance of human nature when edward unhappy match take place depend upon mother will feel a much a if have never discarded therefore circumstance may accelerate dreadful event must be concealed from a much a possible mr ferrars can never forget edward be son surprise must think must nearly have escaped memory by time wrong exceedingly mr ferrars be one of most affectionate mother in world elinor be silent think now said mr dashwood after short pause of robert marrying miss morton elinor smiling at grave decisive importance of brother tone calmly replied lady suppose have choice in affair choice how do mean only mean that suppose from manner of speaking must be same to miss morton whether marry edward robert certainly there can be difference for robert will now to intent purpose be considered a eldest son a to thing else be very agreeable young men know that one be superior to other elinor said more john be also for short time silent reflection ended thus of one thing dear sister kindly taking hand speaking in awful whisper may assure will do because know must gratify have good reason to think indeed have from best authority must not repeat for otherwise must be very wrong to say thing about have from very best authority not that ever precisely heard mr ferrars say daughter did have from that in short whatever objection there might be against certain certain connection understand must have be far preferable to must not have given vexation that doe be exceedingly pleased to hear that mr ferrars considered in light very gratifying circumstance know to 'it must have be beyond comparison ' said 'the least evil of two must be glad to compound now for nothing worse ' however be quite out of question not to be thought of mentioned a to attachment know never must be be gone by thought must just tell of because knew how much must please not that have reason to regret dear elinor there be doubt of doing exceedingly well quite a well better perhaps thing considered have colonel brandon be with lately elinor have heard enough if not to gratify vanity raise self importance to agitate nerve fill mind be therefore glad to be spared from necessity of saying much in reply from danger of hearing thing more from brother by entrance of mr robert ferrars after few moment chat john dashwood recollecting that fanny be yet uninformed of sister being there quitted room in quest of elinor be left to improve acquaintance with robert who by gay unconcern happy self complacency of manner while enjoying so unfair division of mother love liberality to prejudice of banished brother earned only by own dissipated course of life that brother integrity be confirming most unfavourable opinion of head heart illustration of one thing may assure have scarcely be two minute by before began to speak of edward for too have heard of living be very inquisitive on subject elinor repeated particular of a have given to john effect on robert though very different be not le striking than have be on laughed most immoderately idea of edward being clergyman living in small parsonage house diverted beyond measure when to be added fanciful imagery of edward reading prayer in white surplice publishing banns of marriage between john smith mary brown must conceive nothing more ridiculous elinor while waited in silence immovable gravity conclusion of such folly must not restrain eye from being fixed on with look spoke contempt excited be look however very well bestowed for relieved own feeling gave intelligence to be recalled from wit to wisdom not by reproof of by own sensibility may treat a joke said at last recovering from affected laugh have considerably lengthened out genuine gaiety of moment upon soul be most serious business poor edward be ruined for ever be extremely sorry for for know to be very good hearted creature a well meaning fellow perhaps a in world must not judge of miss dashwood from slight acquaintance poor edward manner be certainly not happiest in nature be not born know with same power same address poor fellow to see in circle of stranger to be sure be pitiable enough upon soul believe have a good heart a in kingdom declare protest to never be so shocked in life a when burst forth must not believe mother be first person who told of feeling called on to act with resolution immediately said to bey dear madam know what may intend to do on occasion a for must say that if edward doe marry young woman never will see again ' be what said immediately be most uncommonly shocked indeed poor edward have done for completely shut out for ever from decent society a directly said to mother be not in least surprised at from style of education be always to be expected poor mother be half frantic have ever seen lady yes once while be staying in house happened to drop in for ten minute saw quite enough of merest awkward country girl without style elegance almost without beauty remember perfectly just kind of girl must suppose likely to captivate poor edward offered immediately a soon a mother related affair to to talk to dissuade from match be too late then found to do thing for unluckily be not in way at first knew nothing of till after breach have taken place when be not for know to interfere have be informed of few hour earlier think be most probable that something might have be hit on certainly must have represented to edward in very strong light dear fellow must have said 'consider what be doing be making most disgraceful connection one a family be unanimous in disapproving ' can not help thinking in short mean might have be found now be all too late must be starved know be certain absolutely starved have just settled point with great composure when entrance of mr john dashwood put end to subject though never spoke of out of own family elinor must see influence on mind in something like confusion of countenance with entered attempt at cordiality in behaviour to herself even proceeded so far a to be concerned to find elinor sister be so soon to leave town a have hoped to see more of exertion in husband who attended into room hung enamoured over accent seemed to distinguish thing be most affectionate graceful chapter xlii one other short call in harley street in elinor received brother congratulation on travelling so far towards barton without expense on colonel brandon being to follow to cleveland in day two completed intercourse of brother sister in town faint invitation from fanny to come to norland whenever must happen to be in way of thing be most unlikely to occur with more warm though le public assurance from john to elinor of promptitude with must come to see at delaford be that foretold meeting in country amused to observe that friend seemed determined to send to delaford place in of others must now least choose to visit wish to reside for not only be considered a future home by brother mr

removal be more positive have such object for lingering thought to fix on left creature behind from whom must give moment regret to be divided for ever be pleased to be free from persecution of lucy

within wall while others be busily helping charlotte to show child to housekeeper quitted again stealing away through winding shrubbery now just beginning to be in beauty to gain distant eminence where from grecian temple eye wandering over wide tract of country to south east must fondly rest on farthest ridge of hill in horizon fancy that from summit combe magna might be seen in such moment of precious invaluable misery rejoiced in tear of agony to be at cleveland a returned by different circuit to house feeling happy privilege of country liberty of wandering from place to place in free luxurious solitude resolved to spend almost hour of day while remained with palmer in indulgence of such solitary ramble illustration showing child to housekeeper returned just in time to join others a quitted house on excursion through more immediate premise rest of morning be easily whiled away in lounging round kitchen garden examining bloom upon wall listening to gardener lamentation upon blight in dawdling through green house where loss of favourite plant unwarily exposed nipped by lingering frost raised laughter of charlotte in visiting poultry yard where in disappointed hope of dairy maid by hen forsaking nest being stolen by fox in rapid decrease of promising young brood found fresh source of merriment morning be fine dry marianne in plan of employment abroad have not calculated for change of weather during stay at cleveland with great surprise therefore did find prevented by settled rain from going out again after dinner have depended on twilight walk to grecian

palmer have child mr jennings carpet work talked of friend have left behind arranged lady middleton engagement wondered whether mr palmer colonel brandon must get farther than reading night elinor however little concerned in joined in discourse marianne who have knack of finding way in house to library however might be avoided by family in general soon procured book nothing be wanting on mr palmer side that constant friendly good humour must do to make feel welcome openness heartiness of manner more than atoned for want of recollection elegance made often deficient in form of politeness kindness recommended by so pretty face be engaging folly though evident be not disgusting because be not conceited elinor must have forgiven thing laugh illustration gardener lamentation two gentleman arrived next day to very late dinner affording pleasant enlargement of party very welcome variety to conversation long morning of same continued rain have reduced very low elinor have seen so little of mr palmer in little have seen so much variety in address to sister that knew not what to expect to find in own family found however perfectly gentleman in behaviour to visitor only occasionally rude to wife mother found very capable of being pleasant companion only prevented from being so always by too great aptitude to fancy a much superior to people in general a must feel to be to mr

observation of epicurism selfishness conceit to rest with complacency on remembrance of edward generous temper simple taste diffident feeling of edward at least of of concern now received intelligence from colonel brandon who have be into dorsetshire lately who treating at once a disinterested friend of mr ferrars kind confidante of talked to great deal of parsonage at delaford described deficiency

ailment on concern of body notice of herself prescription poured in from quarter a usual be declined though heavy feverish with pain in limb cough sore throat good night rest be to cure entirely be with difficulty elinor prevailed on when went to bed to try one two of simplest of remedy chapter xliii marianne got up next morning at usual time to inquiry replied that be better tried to prove so by engaging in accustomary employment day spent in sitting shivering over fire with book in hand be unable to read in lying weary languid on sofa did not speak much in favour of amendment when at last went early to bed more more indisposed colonel brandon be only astonished at sister composure who though attending nursing whole day against marianne inclination forcing proper medicine on at night trusted like marianne to certainty efficacy of sleep felt real alarm very restless feverish night however disappointed expectation of when marianne after persisting in rising confessed unable to sit up returned voluntarily to bed elinor be very ready to adopt mr jennings advice of sending for palmer apothecary came examined patient though encouraging miss dashwood to expect that very few day must restore sister to health yet by pronouncing disorder to have putrid tendency allowing word infection to pas lip gave instant alarm to mr palmer on baby account mr jennings who have be inclined from first to think marianne complaint more serious than elinor now looked very grave on mr harris report confirming charlotte fear caution urged necessity of immediate removal with infant mr palmer though treating apprehension a idle found anxiety importunity of wife too great to be withstood departure therefore be fixed on within hour after mr harris arrival set off with little boy nurse for house of near relation of mr palmer who lived few mile on other side of bath husband promised at earnest entreaty to join in day two whither be almost equally urgent with mother to accompany mr jennings however with kindness of heart made elinor really love declared resolution of not stirring from cleveland a long a marianne remained ill of endeavouring by own attentive care to supply to place of mother have taken from elinor found on occasion most willing active helpmate desirous to share in fatigue often by better experience in nursing of material use poor marianne languid low from nature of malady feeling universally ill must no longer hope that tomorrow must find recovered idea of what tomorrow must have produced for unlucky illness made ailment severe for on day be to have begun journey home attended whole way by servant of mr jennings be to have taken mother by surprise on following forenoon little said be in lamentation of inevitable delay though elinor tried to raise spirit make believe a then really believed that must be very short one next day produced little alteration in state of patient certainly be not better except that there be amendment did not appear worse party be now farther reduced for mr palmer though very unwilling to go a well from real humanity good nature a from dislike of appearing to be frightened away by wife be persuaded at last by colonel brandon to perform promise of following while be preparing to go colonel brandon with much greater exertion began to talk of going likewise here however kindness of mr jennings interposed most acceptably for to send colonel away while love be in so much uneasiness on sister account must be to deprive thought of comfort therefore telling at once that stay at cleveland be necessary to herself that must want to play at piquet of evening while miss dashwood be above with sister c urged so strongly to remain that who be gratifying first wish of own heart by compliance must not long even affect to demur especially a mr jennings entreaty be warmly seconded by mr palmer who seemed to feel relief to in leaving behind person so well able to assist advise miss dashwood in emergence marianne be of course kept in ignorance of arrangement knew not that have be mean of sending owner of cleveland away in about seven day from time of arrival gave surprise that saw nothing of mr palmer a gave likewise concern never mentioned name two day passed away from time of mr palmer departure situation continued with little variation same mr harris who attended day still talked boldly of speedy recovery miss dashwood be equally sanguine expectation of others be by mean so cheerful mr jennings have determined very early in seizure marianne must never get over colonel brandon who be chiefly of use in listening to mr jennings foreboding be not in state of mind to resist influence tried to reason out of fear different judgment of apothecary seemed to render absurd many hour of day in be left entirely alone be too favourable for admission of melancholy idea must not expel from mind persuasion that must see marianne more on morning of third day however gloomy anticipation of be almost done away for when mr harris arrived declared patient materially better pulse be much stronger symptom more favourable than on preceding visit elinor confirmed in pleasant hope be cheerfulness rejoicing that in letter to mother have pursued own judgment rather than friend in making very light of indisposition delayed at cleveland almost fixing on time when marianne must be able to travel day did not close so auspiciously a began towards evening marianne became ill again growing more heavy restless uncomfortable than before sister however still sanguine be willing to attribute change to nothing more than fatigue of having sat up to have bed made carefully administering cordial prescribed saw with satisfaction sink at last into slumber from expected most beneficial effect sleep though not so quiet a elinor wished to see lasted considerable time anxious to observe result of resolved to sit with during whole of mr jennings knowing nothing of change in patient went unusually early to bed maid who be one of principal nurse be recreating in housekeeper room elinor remained alone with repose of latter became more more disturbed sister who watched with unremitting attention continual change of posture heard frequent inarticulate sound of complaint passed lip be almost wishing to rouse from so painful slumber when marianne suddenly awakened by accidental noise in house started hastily up with feverish wildness cried out be mama coming not yet cried other concealing terror assisting marianne to lie down again will be here hope before be long be great way know from hence to barton must not go round by london cried marianne in same hurried manner will never see if go by london elinor perceived with alarm that be not quite while attempting to soothe eagerly felt pulse be lower quicker than ever marianne still talking wildly of mama alarm increased so rapidly a to determine on sending instantly for mr harris despatching messenger to barton for mother to consult with colonel brandon on best mean of effecting latter be thought immediately followed resolution of performance a soon have rung up maid to take place by sister hastened down to drawing room where knew be generally to be found at much later hour than present be time for hesitation fear difficulty be immediately before fear have courage confidence to attempt removal of listened to in silent despondence difficulty be instantly obviated for with readiness seemed to speak occasion service pre arranged in mind offered a messenger who must fetch mr dashwood elinor made resistance be not easily overcome thanked with brief though fervent gratitude while went to hurry off servant with message to mr harris order for post horse directly wrote few line to mother comfort of such friend at moment a colonel brandon companion for mother how gratefully be felt companion whose judgment must guide whose attendance must relieve whose friendship might soothe a far a shock of such summons must be lessened to presence manner assistance must lessen meanwhile whatever might feel acted with firmness of collected mind made necessary arrangement with utmost despatch calculated with exactness time in might look for return not moment be lost in delay of kind horse arrived even before be expected colonel brandon only pressing hand with look of solemnity few word spoken too low to reach ear hurried into carriage be then about twelve o'clock returned to sister apartment to wait for arrival of apothecary to watch by rest of night be night of almost equal suffering to hour after hour passed away in sleepless pain delirium on marianne side in most cruel anxiety on elinor before mr harris appeared apprehension once raised paid by excess for former security servant who sat up with for must not allow mr jennings to be called only tortured more by hint of what mistress have always thought marianne idea be still at interval fixed incoherently on mother whenever mentioned name gave pang to heart of poor elinor who reproaching for having trifled with so many day of illness wretched for immediate relief fancied that relief might soon be in vain that thing have be delayed too long pictured to herself suffering mother arriving too late to see darling child to see rational be on point of sending again for mr harris if must not come for other advice when former not till after five o'clock arrived opinion however made little amends for delay for though acknowledging very unexpected unpleasant alteration in patient must not allow danger to be material talked of relief fresh mode of treatment must procure with confidence in lesser degree be communicated to elinor promised to call again in course of three four hour left patient anxious attendant more composed than have found with strong concern with many reproach for not being called to aid did mr jennings hear in morning of what have passed former apprehension now with greater reason restored left doubt of event though trying to speak comfort to elinor conviction of sister danger must not allow to offer comfort of hope heart be really grieved rapid decay early death of girl so young so lovely a marianne must have struck le interested person with concern on mr jennings compassion have other claim have be for three month companion be still under care be known to have be greatly injured long unhappy distress of sister too particularly favourite be before a for mother when mr jennings considered that marianne might probably be to what charlotte be to herself sympathy in suffering be very sincere mr harris be punctual in second visit came to be disappointed in hope of what last must produce medicine have failed fever be unabated marianne only more quiet not more remained in heavy stupor elinor catching more than fear in moment proposed to call in further advice judged unnecessary have still something more to try more fresh application of whose success be a confident a last visit concluded with encouraging assurance reached ear must not enter heart of miss dashwood be calm except when thought of mother be almost hopeless in state continued till noon scarcely stirring from sister bed thought wandering from one image of grief one suffering friend to spirit oppressed to utmost by conversation of mr jennings who scrupled not to attribute severity danger of attack to many week of previous indisposition marianne disappointment have brought on elinor felt reasonableness of idea gave fresh misery to reflection about noon however began with caution dread of disappointment for time kept silent even to friend to fancy to hope must perceive slight amendment in sister pulse waited watched examined again again at last with agitation more difficult to bury under exterior calmness than foregoing distress ventured to communicate hope mr jennings though forced on examination to acknowledge temporary revival tried to keep young friend from indulging thought of continuance elinor conning over injunction of distrust told likewise not to hope be too late hope have already entered feeling anxious flutter bent over sister to watch hardly knew for what hour passed away favourable symptom yet blessed others even arose to confirm breath skin lip flattered elinor with sign of amendment marianne fixed eye on with rational though languid gaze anxiety hope now oppressed in equal degree left moment of tranquillity till arrival of mr harris at four o'clock when assurance felicitation on recovery in sister even surpassing expectation gave confidence comfort tear of joy marianne be in respect materially better declared entirely out of danger mr jennings perhaps satisfied with partial justification of foreboding have be found in late alarm allowed to trust in judgment admitted with unfeigned joy soon with unequivocal cheerfulness probability of entire recovery elinor must not be cheerful joy be of different kind led to thing rather than to gaiety marianne restored to life health friend to doting mother be idea to fill heart with sensation of exquisite comfort expand in fervent gratitude led to outward demonstration of joy word smile within elinor breast be satisfaction silent strong continued by side of sister with little intermission whole afternoon calming fear satisfying inquiry of enfeebled spirit supplying succour watching almost look breath possibility of relapse must of course in moment occur to remind of what anxiety be when saw on frequent minute examination symptom of recovery continued saw marianne at six o'clock sink into quiet steady to appearance comfortable sleep silenced doubt time be now drawing on when colonel brandon might be expected back at ten o'clock trusted at least not much later mother must be relieved from dreadful suspense in must now be travelling towards colonel too perhaps scarcely le object of pity oh how slow be progress of time yet kept in ignorance at seven o'clock leaving marianne still sweetly asleep joined mr jennings in drawing room to tea of breakfast have be kept by fear of dinner by sudden reverse from eating much present refreshment therefore with such feeling of content a brought to be particularly welcome mr jennings must have persuaded at conclusion to take rest before mother arrival allow to take place by marianne elinor have sense of fatigue capability of sleep at moment about be not to be kept away from sister unnecessary instant mr jennings therefore attending up stair into sick chamber to satisfy that continued right left there again to charge thought retired to own room to write letter sleep night be cold stormy wind roared round house rain beat against window elinor happiness within regarded not marianne slept through blast traveller have rich reward in store for present inconvenience clock struck eight have be ten elinor must have be convinced that at moment heard carriage driving up to house so strong be persuasion that did in spite of almost impossibility of being already come that moved into adjoining dressing closet opened window shutter to be satisfied of truth instantly saw that ear have not deceived flaring lamp of carriage be immediately in view by uncertain light thought must discern to be drawn by four horse while told excess of poor mother alarm gave explanation to such unexpected rapidity never in life have elinor found so difficult to be calm a at moment knowledge of what mother must be feeling a carriage stopped door of doubt dread perhaps despair of what have to tell with such knowledge be impossible to be calm remained to be done be to be speedy therefore staying only till must leave mr jennings maid with sister hurried down stair bustle in vestibule a passed along inner lobby assured that be already in house rushed to drawing room entered saw only willoughby illustration opened window shutter chapter xliv elinor starting back with look of horror at sight of obeyed first impulse of heart in turning instantly to quit room hand be already on lock when action be suspended by hastily advancing saying in voice rather of command than supplication miss dashwood for hour for ten minute entreat to stay sir replied with firmness will not stay business can not be with servant suppose forgot to tell that mr palmer be not in house have told cried with vehemence mr palmer relation be at devil must not have turned from door business be with only with in utmost amazement well sir be quick if can le violent sit down will be hesitated knew not what to do possibility of colonel brandon arriving finding there came across have promised to hear curiosity no le than honor be engaged after moment recollection therefore concluding that prudence required dispatch that acquiescence must best promote walked silently towards table sat down took opposite chair for minute not word be said by pray be quick sir said elinor impatiently have time to spare be sitting in attitude of deep meditation seemed not to hear sister said with abruptness moment afterwards be out of danger heard from servant god be praised be true be really true elinor must not speak repeated inquiry with yet greater eagerness for god sake tell be out of danger be not illustration entreat to stay hope be rose up walked across room have known a much hour ago since be here speaking with forced vivacity a returned to seat what doe signify for once miss dashwood will be last time perhaps let be cheerful together be in fine mood for gaiety tell honestly deeper glow overspreading cheek do think most knave fool elinor looked at with greater astonishment than ever began to think that must be in strangeness of such visit of such manner seemed otherwise intelligible with impression immediately rose saying mr willoughby advise at present to return to combe be not at leisure to remain with longer whatever business may be with will be better recollected explained to morrow understand replied with expressive smile voice perfectly calm yes be very drunk pint of porter with cold beef at marlborough be enough to over set at marlborough cried more more at loss to understand what must be at yes left london morning at eight o'clock only ten minute have spent out of chaise since time procured nuncheon at marlborough steadiness of manner intelligence of eye a spoke convincing elinor that other unpardonable folly might bring to cleveland be not brought there by intoxication said after moment recollection mr willoughby ought to feel certainly do after what have passed coming here in manner forcing upon notice requires very particular excuse what be that mean by mean said with serious energy if can to make hate one degree le than do now mean to offer kind of explanation kind of apology for past to open whole heart to by convincing that though have be always blockhead have not be always rascal to obtain something like forgiveness from ma from sister be real reason of coming upon soul be be answer with warmth brought former willoughby to remembrance in spite of herself made think sincere if be may be satisfied already for marianne doe have long forgiven have cried in same eager tone then have forgiven before ought to have done will forgive again on more reasonable ground now will listen to elinor bowed assent know said after pause of expectation on side thoughtfulness on own how may have accounted for behaviour to sister what diabolical motive may have imputed to perhaps will hardly think better of be worth trial however will hear thing when first became intimate in family have other intention other view in acquaintance than to pas time pleasantly while be obliged to remain in devonshire more pleasantly than have ever done before sister lovely person interesting manner must not please behaviour to almost from first be of kind be astonishing when reflect on what be what be that heart must have be so insensible at first must confess vanity only be elevated by careless of happiness thinking only of own amusement giving way to feeling have always be too much in habit of indulging endeavoured by mean in power to make pleasing to without design of returning affection miss dashwood at point turning eye on with most angry contempt stopped by saying be hardly worth while mr willoughby for to relate for to listen longer such beginning a can not be followed by thing let be pained by hearing thing more on subject insist on hearing whole of replied fortune be never large have always be expensive always in habit of associating with people of better income than year since coming of age even before believe have added to debt though death of old cousin mr smith be to set free yet event being uncertain possibly far distant have be for time intention to re establish circumstance by marrying woman of fortune to attach to sister therefore be not thing to be thought of with meanness selfishness cruelty indignant contemptuous look even of yours miss dashwood can ever reprobate too much be acting in manner trying to engage regard without thought of returning one thing may be said for even in horrid state of selfish vanity did not know extent of injury meditated because did not then know what be to love have ever known well may be doubted for have really loved must have sacrificed feeling to vanity to avarice what be more must have sacrificed hers have done to avoid comparative poverty affection society must have deprived of horror have by raising to affluence lost thing must make blessing did then said elinor little softened believe at one time attached to to have resisted such attraction to have withstood such tenderness be there man on earth who must have done yes found by insensible degree sincerely fond of happiest hour of life be what spent with when felt intention be strictly honourable feeling blameless even then however when fully determined on paying address to allowed most improperly to put off from day to day moment of doing from unwillingness to enter into engagement while circumstance be so greatly embarrassed will not reason here will stop for to expatiate on absurdity worse than absurdity of scrupling to engage faith where honour be already bound event have proved be cunning fool providing with great circumspection for possible opportunity of making contemptible wretched for ever at last however resolution be taken have determined a soon a must engage alone to justify attention have so invariably paid openly assure of affection have already taken such pain to display in interim in interim of very few hour be to pas before must have opportunity of speaking with in private circumstance occurred unlucky circumstance to ruin resolution with comfort discovery took place here hesitated looked down mr smith have somehow other be informed imagine by distant relation whose interest be to deprive of favour of affair connection need not explain farther added looking at with heightened colour enquiring eye particular intimacy have probably heard whole story long ago have returned elinor colouring likewise hardening heart anew against compassion for have heard how will explain away part of guilt in dreadful business confess be beyond comprehension remember cried willoughby from whom received account must be impartial one acknowledge that situation character ought to have be respected by mean to justify at same time can not leave to suppose have nothing to urge that because be injured be irreproachable because be libertine must be saint if violence of passion weakness of understanding mean however to defend affection for deserved better treatment often with great self reproach recall tenderness for very short time have power of creating return wish heartily wish have never be have injured more than have injured one whose affection for may say be scarcely le warm than hers whose mind oh how infinitely superior indifference however towards that unfortunate girl must say unpleasant to a discussion of such subject may well be indifference be apology for cruel neglect of think excused by weakness natural defect of understanding on side in wanton cruelty so evident on yours must have known that while be enjoying in devonshire pursuing fresh scheme always gay always happy be reduced to extremest indigence upon soul did not know warmly replied did not recollect that have omitted to give direction common sense might have told how to find out well sir what said mr smith taxed with offence at once confusion may be guessed purity of life formality of notion ignorance of world thing be against matter must not deny vain be endeavour to soften be previously disposed believe to doubt morality of conduct in general be moreover discontented with very little attention very little portion of time have bestowed on in present visit in short ended in total breach by one measure might have saved in height of morality good woman offered to forgive past if must marry eliza must not be be formally dismissed from favour house night following affair be to go next morning be spent by in deliberating on what future conduct must be struggle be great ended too soon affection for marianne thorough conviction of attachment to be insufficient to outweigh dread of poverty get better of false idea of necessity of rich be naturally inclined to feel expensive society have increased have reason to believe secure of present wife if chose to address persuaded to think that nothing else in common prudence remained for to do heavy scene however awaited before must leave devonshire be engaged to dine with on very day apology be therefore necessary for breaking engagement whether must write apology deliver in person be point of long debate to see marianne felt must be dreadful even doubted whether must see again

walked from cottage to allenham satisfied with delighted with body in last interview of friendship approached with sense of guilt that almost took from power of dissembling sorrow disappointment deep regret when told be obliged to leave devonshire so immediately never will forget united too with such reliance such confidence in oh god what hard hearted rascal be be silent for few moment elinor first spoke did tell that must soon return know what told replied impatiently le than be due to past beyond doubt in likelihood much more than be justified by future can not think of wo do then came dear mother to torture farther with kindness confidence thank heaven did torture be miserable miss dashwood can not have idea of comfort give to look back on own misery owe grudge to myself for stupid rascally folly of own heart that past suffering under be only triumph exultation to now well went left loved went to to whom at best be only indifferent journey to town travelling with own horse

must not have heard vindication for world now blamed now acquitted herself for having judged so harshly before promise of relating to sister be invariably painful dreaded performance of dreaded what effect on marianne might be doubted whether after such explanation must ever be happy with for moment wished willoughby widower then remembering colonel brandon reproved felt that to suffering constancy far more than to rival reward of sister be due wished thing rather than mr willoughby death shock of colonel brandon errand at barton have be much softened to mr dashwood by own previous alarm for so great be uneasiness about marianne that have already determined to set out for cleveland on very day without waiting for further intelligence have so far settled journey before arrival that careys be then expected moment to fetch margaret away a mother be unwilling to take where there might be infection marianne continued to mend day brilliant cheerfulness of mr dashwood look spirit proved to be a repeatedly declared one of happiest woman in world elinor must not hear declaration witness proof without sometimes wondering whether mother ever recollected edward mr dashwood trusting to temperate account of own disappointment elinor have sent be led away by exuberance of joy to think only of what must increase be restored to from danger in a now began to feel own mistaken judgment in encouraging unfortunate attachment to willoughby have contributed to place in recovery have yet source of joy unthought of by elinor be thus imparted to a soon a opportunity of private conference between occurred at last be alone elinor yet know happiness colonel brandon love marianne have told so daughter feeling by turn pleased pained surprised not surprised be silent attention be never like dear elinor must wonder at composure now have sat down to wish for possible good to family must have fixed on colonel brandon marrying one of a object most desirable believe marianne will be most happy with of two elinor be half inclined to ask reason for thinking so because satisfied that none founded on impartial consideration of age character feeling must be given mother must always be carried away by imagination on interesting subject therefore instead of inquiry passed off with smile opened whole heart to yesterday a travelled came out quite unawares quite undesignedly may well believe must talk of nothing child must not conceal distress saw that equalled own perhaps thinking that mere friendship a world now go must not justify so warm sympathy rather not thinking at suppose giving way to irresistible feeling made acquainted with earnest tender constant affection for marianne have loved elinor ever since first moment of seeing here however elinor perceived not language not profession of colonel brandon natural embellishment of mother active fancy fashioned thing delightful to a chose regard for infinitely surpassing anything willoughby ever felt feigned a much more warm a more sincere constant ever be to call have subsisted through knowledge of dear marianne unhappy prepossession for worthless young man without selfishness without encouraging hope must have seen happy with such noble mind such openness such sincerity one can be deceived in colonel brandon character said elinor a excellent man be well established know be replied mother seriously after such warning must be last to encourage such affection even to be pleased by coming for a did with such active such ready friendship be enough to prove one of worthiest of men character however answered elinor doe not rest on one act of kindness to affection for marianne be humanity out of case must have prompted to mr jennings to middleton have be long intimately known equally love respect even own knowledge of though lately acquired be very considerable so highly do value esteem that if marianne can be happy with will be a ready a to think connection greatest blessing to in world what answer did give did allow to hope oh love must not then talk of hope to to marianne might at moment be dying did not ask for hope encouragement be involuntary confidence irrepressible effusion to soothing friend not application to parent yet after time did say for at first be quite overcome that if lived a trusted might greatest happiness must lie in promoting marriage since arrival since delightful security have repeated to more fully have given encouragement in power time very little time tell will do everything marianne heart be not to be wasted for ever on man a willoughby own merit must soon secure to judge from colonel spirit however have not yet made equally sanguine think marianne affection too deeply rooted for change in under great length of time even supposing heart again free be too diffident of to believe that with difference of age disposition must ever attach there however be quite mistaken age be only so much beyond hers a to be advantage a to make character principle fixed disposition be well convinced be exactly very one to make sister happy person manner too be in favour partiality doe not blind certainly be not so handsome a willoughby at same time there be something much more pleasing in countenance there be always something if remember in willoughby eye at time did not like elinor must not remember mother without waiting for assent continued manner colonel manner be not only more pleasing to than willoughby ever be be of kind well know to be more solidly attaching to marianne gentleness genuine attention to other people manly unstudied simplicity be much more accordant with real disposition than liveliness often artificial often ill timed of other be very sure have willoughby turned out a really amiable a have proved contrary marianne must yet never have be so happy with a will be with colonel brandon paused daughter must not quite agree with dissent be not heard therefore gave offence at delaford will be within easy distance of added mr dashwood even if remain at barton in probability for hear be large village indeed there certainly must be small house cottage close by must suit quite a well a present situation poor elinor here be new scheme for getting to delaford spirit be stubborn fortune too for at time of life know everybody care about though neither know desire to know what really be be sure must be good one here be interrupted by entrance of third person elinor withdrew to think over in private to wish success to friend yet in wishing to feel pang for willoughby chapter xlvi marianne illness though weakening in kind have not be long enough to make recovery slow with youth natural strength mother presence in aid proceeded so smoothly a to enable to remove within four day after arrival of latter into mr palmer dressing room when there at own particular request for be impatient to pour forth thanks to for fetching mother colonel brandon be invited to visit emotion on entering room in seeing altered look in receiving pale hand immediately held out to be such a in elinor conjecture must arise from something more than affection for marianne consciousness of being known to others soon discovered in melancholy eye varying complexion a looked at sister probable recurrence of many past scene of misery to mind brought back by resemblance between marianne eliza already acknowledged now strengthened by hollow eye sickly skin posture of reclining weakness warm acknowledgment of peculiar obligation mr dashwood not le watchful of what passed than daughter with mind very differently influenced therefore watching to very different effect saw nothing in colonel behaviour what arose from most simple self evident sensation while in action word of marianne persuaded to think that something more than gratitude already dawned at end of day two marianne growing visibly stronger twelve hour mr dashwood urged equally by own daughter wish began to talk of removing to barton on measure depended of two friend mr jennings must not quit cleveland during dashwoods stay colonel brandon be soon brought by united request to consider own abode there a equally determinate if not equally indispensable at mr jennings united request in return mr dashwood be prevailed on to accept use of carriage on journey back for better accommodation of sick child colonel at joint invitation of mr dashwood mr jennings whose active good nature made friendly hospitable for other people a well a herself engaged with pleasure to redeem by visit at cottage in course of few week day of separation departure arrived marianne after taking so particular lengthened leave of mr jennings one so earnestly grateful so full of respect kind wish a seemed due to own heart from secret acknowledgment of past inattention bidding colonel brandon farewell with cordiality of friend be carefully assisted by into carriage of seemed anxious that must engross at least half mr dashwood elinor then followed others be left by to talk of traveller feel own dullness till mr jennings be summoned to chaise to take comfort in gossip of maid for loss of two young companion colonel brandon immediately afterwards took solitary way to delaford dashwoods be two day on road marianne bore journey on without essential fatigue thing that most zealous affection most solicitous care must do to render comfortable be office of watchful companion found reward in bodily ease calmness of spirit to elinor observation of latter be particularly grateful who have seen week after week so constantly suffering oppressed by anguish of heart have courage to speak of fortitude to conceal now saw with joy other must equally share apparent composure of mind in being result a trusted of serious reflection must eventually lead to contentment cheerfulness a approached barton indeed entered on scene of field tree brought peculiar painful recollection grew silent thoughtful turning away face from notice sat earnestly gazing through window here elinor must neither wonder blame when saw a assisted marianne from carriage that have be cry saw only emotion too natural in to raise thing le tender than pity in unobtrusiveness entitled to praise in whole of subsequent manner traced direction of mind awakened to reasonable exertion for sooner have entered common sitting room than marianne turned eye around with look of resolute firmness a if determined at once to accustom to sight of object with remembrance of willoughby must be connected said little sentence aimed at cheerfulness though sigh sometimes escaped never passed away without atonement of smile after dinner must try piano forte went to music on eye first rested be opera procured for by willoughby containing of

worth reading at park there be others of more modern production know can borrow of colonel brandon by reading only six hour day will gain in course of twelvemonth great deal of instruction now feel to want elinor honoured for plan originated so nobly a though smiling to see same eager fancy have be leading to extreme of languid indolence selfish repining now at work in introducing excess into scheme of such rational employment virtuous self control smile however changed to sigh when remembered that promise to willoughby be yet unfulfilled feared have that to communicate might again unsettle mind of marianne ruin at least for time fair prospect of busy tranquillity willing therefore to delay evil hour resolved to wait till sister health be more secure before appointed resolution be made only to be broken illustration see how child go on marianne have be two three day at home before weather be fine enough for invalid like to venture out at last soft genial morning appeared such a might tempt daughter wish mother confidence marianne leaning on elinor arm be authorised to walk a long a must without fatigue in lane before house sister set out at pace slow a feebleness of marianne in exercise hitherto untried since illness required have advanced only so far beyond house a to admit full view of hill important hill behind when pausing with eye turned towards marianne calmly said there exactly there pointing with one hand on projecting mound there fell there first saw willoughby voice sunk with word presently reviving added be thankful to find can look with so little pain on spot will ever talk on subject elinor hesitatingly be said will be wrong can talk of now hope a ought to do elinor tenderly invited to be open a for regret said marianne have done with a far a be concerned mean to talk to of what feeling have be for what be now at present if must be satisfied on one point if must be allowed to think that be not always acting part not always deceiving above if must be assured that never be so very wicked a fear have sometimes fancied since story of unfortunate girl stopped elinor joyfully treasured word a answered if must be assured of think must be easy yes peace of mind be doubly involved in for not only be horrible to suspect person who have be what have be to of such design what must make appear to myself what in situation like mine most shamefully unguarded affection must expose to how then asked sister must account for behaviour must suppose oh how gladly must suppose only fickle very very fickle elinor said more be debating within on eligibility of beginning story directly postponing till marianne be in stronger health crept on for few minute in silence be not wishing too much good said marianne at last with sigh when wish secret reflection may be more unpleasant than own will suffer enough in do compare conduct with compare with what ought to have be compare with situation have borne little resemblance have borne more than conduct dearest elinor let kindness defend what know judgment must censure illness have made think have given leisure calmness for serious recollection long before be enough recovered to talk be perfectly able to reflect considered past saw in own behaviour since beginning of acquaintance with last autumn nothing series of imprudence towards want of kindness to others saw that own feeling have prepared suffering want of fortitude under have almost led to grave illness well knew have be entirely brought on by by such negligence of own health a have felt even at time to be wrong have died must have be self destruction did not know danger till danger be removed with such feeling a reflection gave wonder at recovery wonder that very eagerness of desire to live to have time for atonement to god to did not kill at once have died in what peculiar misery must have left nurse friend sister who have seen fretful selfishness of latter day who have known murmuring of heart how must have lived in remembrance mother too how must have consoled can not express own abhorrence of whenever looked towards past saw duty neglected failing indulged body seemed injured by kindness unceasing kindness of mr jennings have repaid with ungrateful contempt to middleton to palmer steele to common acquaintance even have be insolent unjust with heart hardened against merit temper irritated by very attention to john to fanny yes even to little a deserve have given le than due above above mother have be wronged by only knew heart sorrow yet to what did influence not to compassion must benefit myself example be before to what avail be more considerate of comfort did imitate forbearance lessen restraint by taking part in office of general complaisance particular gratitude have hitherto be left to discharge alone not le when knew to be unhappy than when have believed at ease did turn away from exertion of duty friendship scarcely allowing sorrow to exist with regretting only that heart have deserted wronged leaving for whom professed unbounded affection to be miserable for sake here ceased rapid flow of self reproving spirit elinor impatient to soothe though too honest to flatter gave instantly that praise support frankness contrition so well deserved marianne pressed hand replied be very good future must be proof have laid down plan if be capable of adhering to feeling will be governed temper improved will no longer worry others torture will now live solely for family mother margaret must henceforth be world to will share affection entirely between from from home will never again have smallest incitement to move if do mix in other society will be only to show that spirit be humbled heart amended that can practise civility lesser duty of life with gentleness forbearance a for willoughby to say that will soon that will ever forget must be idle remembrance can be overcome by change of circumstance opinion will be regulated will be checked by religion by reason by constant employment paused added in low voice if must know heart everything must become easy elinor who have now be for time reflecting on propriety impropriety of speedily hazarding narration without feeling at nearer decision than at first heard perceiving that a reflection did nothing resolution must do soon found leading to fact managed recital a hoped with address prepared anxious listener with caution related simply honestly chief point on willoughby grounded apology did justice to repentance softened only protestation of present regard marianne said not word trembled eye be fixed on ground lip became whiter than even sickness have left thousand inquiry sprung up from heart dared not urge one caught syllable with panting eagerness hand unknowingly to herself closely pressed sister tear covered cheek elinor dreading being tired led towards home till reached door of cottage easily conjecturing what curiosity must be though question be suffered to speak talked of nothing willoughby conversation together be carefully minute in particular of speech look where minuteness must be safely indulged a soon a entered house marianne with kiss of gratitude two word just articulate through tear tell mama withdrew from sister walked slowly up stair elinor must not attempt to disturb solitude so reasonable a what now sought with mind anxiously pre arranging result resolution of reviving subject again must marianne fail to do turned into parlour to fulfill parting injunction chapter xlvii mr dashwood did not hear unmoved vindication of former favourite rejoiced in being cleared from part of imputed guilt be sorry for wished happy feeling of past must not be recalled nothing must restore with faith unbroken character unblemished to marianne nothing must do away knowledge of what latter have suffered through mean remove guilt of conduct towards eliza nothing must replace therefore in former esteem injure interest of colonel brandon have mr dashwood like daughter heard willoughby story from have witnessed distress be under influence of countenance manner be probable that compassion must have be greater be neither in elinor power in wish to rouse such feeling in by retailed explanation a have at first be called forth in reflection have given calmness to judgment sobered own opinion of willoughby desert wished therefore to declare only simple truth lay open such fact a be really due to character without embellishment of tenderness to lead fancy astray in evening when be three together marianne began voluntarily to speak of again that be not without effort restless unquiet thoughtfulness in have be for time previously sitting rising colour a spoke unsteady voice plainly showed wish to assure said that see thing a can desire to do mr dashwood must have interrupted instantly with soothing tenderness have not elinor who really wished to hear sister unbiased opinion by eager sign engaged silence marianne slowly continued be great relief to what elinor told morning have now heard exactly what wished to hear for moment voice be lost recovering added with greater calmness than before be now perfectly satisfied wish for change never must have be happy with after knowing a sooner later must have known must have have confidence esteem nothing must have done away to feeling know know cried mother happy with man of libertine practice with one who so injured peace of dearest of friend best of men marianne have not heart to be made happy with man conscience sensitive conscience must have felt that conscience of husband ought to have felt marianne sighed repeated wish for change consider matter said elinor exactly a good mind sound understanding must consider dare say perceive a well a not only in in many other circumstance reason enough to be convinced that marriage must have involved in many certain trouble disappointment in must have be poorly supported by affection on side much le certain have married must have be always poor expensiveness be acknowledged even by whole conduct declares that self denial be word hardly understood by demand inexperience together on small very small income must have brought on distress must not be le grievous to from having be entirely unknown unthought of before sense of honour honesty must have led know when aware of situation to attempt economy must appear to possible perhaps a long a frugality retrenched only on own comfort might have be suffered to practice beyond how little must utmost of single management do to stop ruin have begun before marriage beyond have endeavoured however reasonably to abridge enjoyment be not to be feared that instead of prevailing on feeling so selfish to consent to must have lessened own influence on heart made regret connection have involved in such difficulty marianne lip quivered repeated word selfish in tone implied do really think selfish whole of behaviour replied elinor from beginning to end of affair have be grounded on selfishness be selfishness first made sport with affection afterwards when own be engaged made delay confession of finally carried from barton own enjoyment own ease be in particular ruling principle be very true happiness never be object at present continued elinor regret what have done why doe regret because find have not answered towards have not made happy circumstance be now unembarrassed suffers from evil of kind think only that have married woman of le amiable temper than doe follow have married must have be happy inconvenience must have be different must then have suffered under pecuniary distress because be removed now reckons a nothing must have have wife of whose temper must make complaint must have be always necessitous always poor probably must soon have learned to rank innumerable comfort of clear estate good income a of far more importance even to domestic happiness than mere temper of wife have not doubt of said marianne have nothing to regret nothing own folly rather say mother imprudence child said mr dashwood must be answerable marianne must not let proceed elinor satisfied that felt own error wished to avoid survey of past might weaken sister spirit therefore pursuing first subject immediately continued one observation may think be fairly drawn from whole of story that willoughby difficulty have arisen from first offence against virtue in behaviour to eliza williams crime have be origin of lesser one of present discontent marianne assented most feelingly to remark mother be led by to enumeration of colonel brandon injury merit warm a friendship design must unitedly dictate daughter did not look however a if much of be heard by elinor according to expectation saw on two three following day marianne did not continue to gain strength a have done while resolution be unsubdued still tried to appear cheerful easy sister must safely trust to effect of time upon health margaret returned family be again all restored to other again quietly settled at cottage if not pursuing usual study with quite so much vigour a when first came to barton at least planning vigorous prosecution of in future elinor grew impatient for tidings of edward have heard nothing of since leaving london nothing new of plan nothing certain even of present abode letter have passed between brother in consequence of marianne illness in first of john there have be sentence know nothing of unfortunate edward can make enquiry on so prohibited subject conclude to be still at oxford be intelligence of edward afforded by correspondence for name be not even mentioned in of succeeding letter be not doomed however to be long in ignorance of measure man servant have be sent one morning to exeter on business when a waited at table have satisfied inquiry of mistress a to event of errand be voluntary communication suppose know ma'be that mr ferrars be married marianne gave violent start fixed eye upon elinor saw turning pale fell back in chair in hysteric mr dashwood whose eye a answered servant inquiry have intuitively taken same direction be shocked to perceive by elinor countenance how much really suffered moment afterwards alike distressed by marianne situation knew not on child to bestow principal attention servant who saw only that miss marianne be taken ill have sense enough to call one of maid who with mr dashwood assistance supported into other room by time marianne be rather better mother leaving to care of margaret maid returned to elinor who though still much disordered have so far recovered use of reason voice a to be just beginning inquiry of thomas a to source of intelligence mr dashwood immediately took trouble on herself elinor have benefit of information without exertion of seeking illustration suppose know ma'be that mr ferrars be married who told that mr ferrars be married thomas see mr ferrars ma'be morning in exeter lady too miss steele a be be stopping in chaise at door of new london inn a went there with message from sally at park to brother who be one of post boy happened to look up a went by chaise so see directly be youngest miss steele so took off hat knew called to inquired after ma'be young lady especially miss marianne bid must give compliment mr ferrars best compliment service how sorry be have not time to come on see be in great hurry to go forward for be going further down for little while however when come back 'd make sure to come see did tell be married thomas yes ma'be smiled said how have changed name since be in part be always very affable free spoken young lady very civil behaved so made free to wish joy be mr ferrars in carriage with yes ma'be just see leaning back in did not look up never be gentleman much for talking elinor heart must easily account for not putting forward mr dashwood probably found same explanation be there one else in carriage ma'be only two do know where came from come straight from town a miss lucy mr ferrars told be going farther westward yes ma'be not to bide long will soon be back again then 'd be sure call here mr dashwood now looked at daughter elinor knew better than to expect recognised whole of lucy in message be very confident that edward must never come near observed in low voice to mother that be probably going down to mr pratt near plymouth thomas intelligence seemed over elinor looked a if wished to hear more did see off before came away ma'be horse be just coming out must not bide longer be afraid of being late did mr ferrars look well yes ma'be said how be very well to mind be always very handsome young lady seemed vastly contented mr dashwood must think of other question thomas tablecloth now alike needle be soon afterwards dismissed marianne have already sent to say that must eat nothing more mr dashwood elinor appetite be equally lost margaret might think very well off with so much uneasiness a sister have lately experienced so much reason a have often have to be careless of meal have never be obliged to go without dinner before when dessert wine be arranged mr dashwood elinor be left by remained long together in similarity of thoughtfulness silence mr dashwood feared to hazard remark ventured not to offer consolation now found that have erred in relying on elinor representation of herself justly concluded that thing have be expressly softened at time to spare from increase of unhappiness suffering a then have suffered for marianne found that have be misled by careful considerate attention of daughter to think attachment once have so well understood much slighter in reality than have be wont to believe than be now proved to be feared that under persuasion have be unjust inattentive nay almost unkind to elinor that marianne affliction because more acknowledged more immediately before have too much engrossed tenderness led away to forget in elinor might have daughter suffering almost a much certainly with le self provocation greater fortitude chapter xlviii elinor now found difference between expectation of unpleasant event however certain mind may be told to consider certainty now found that in spite of have always admitted hope while edward remained single that something must occur to prevent marrying lucy that resolution of own mediation of friend more eligible opportunity of establishment for lady must arise to assist happiness of be now married condemned heart for lurking flattery so much heightened pain of intelligence that must be married soon before a imagined must be in order consequently before must be in possession of living surprised little at first soon saw how likely be that lucy in self provident care in haste to secure must overlook thing risk of delay be married married in town now hastening down to uncle what have edward felt on being within four mile from barton on seeing mother servant on hearing lucy message must soon supposed be settled at delaford delaford place in so much conspired to give interest wished to be acquainted with yet desired to avoid saw in instant in parsonage house saw in lucy active contriving manager uniting at once desire of smart appearance with utmost frugality ashamed to be suspected of half economical practice pursuing own interest in thought courting favour of colonel brandon of mr jennings of wealthy friend in edward knew not what saw what wished to see happy unhappy nothing pleased turned away head from sketch of elinor flattered that one of connection in london must write to to announce event give farther particular day after day passed off brought letter tidings though uncertain that one be to blame found fault with absent friend be thoughtless indolent when do write to colonel brandon ma'be be inquiry sprung from impatience of mind to have something going on wrote to love last week rather expect to see than to hear from again earnestly pressed coming to must not be surprised to see walk in today tomorrow day be gaining something something to look forward to colonel brandon must have information to give scarcely have so determined when figure of man on horseback drew eye to window stopped at gate be gentleman be colonel brandon now must hear more trembled in expectation of be not colonel brandon air height be possible must say must be edward looked again have just dismounted must not be mistaken be edward moved away sat down come from mr pratt purposely to see will be calm will be mistress of in moment perceived that others be likewise aware of mistake saw mother marianne change colour saw look at whisper few sentence to other must have given world to be able to speak to make understand that hoped coolness slight must appear in behaviour to have utterance be obliged to leave to own discretion not syllable passed aloud waited in silence for appearance of visitor footstep be heard along gravel path in moment be in passage in be before countenance a entered room be not too happy even for elinor complexion be white with agitation looked a if fearful of reception conscious that merited kind one mr dashwood however conforming a trusted to wish of daughter by whom then meant in warmth of heart to be guided in thing met with look of forced complacency gave hand wished joy illustration be edward coloured stammered out unintelligible reply elinor lip have moved with mother when moment of action be over wished that have shaken hand with too be then too late with countenance meaning to be open sat down again talked of weather marianne have retreated a much a possible out of sight to conceal distress margaret understanding part not whole of case thought incumbent on to be dignified therefore took seat a far from a must maintained strict silence when elinor have ceased to rejoice in dryness of season very awful pause took place be put end to by mr dashwood who felt obliged to hope that have left mr ferrars very well in hurried manner replied in affirmative pause elinor resolving to exert though fearing sound of own voice now said be mr ferrars at longstaple at longstaple replied with air of surprise mother be in town meant said elinor taking up work from table to inquire for mr edward ferrars dared not look up mother marianne turned eye on coloured seemed perplexed looked doubtingly after hesitation said perhaps mean brother mean mr mr robert ferrars mr robert ferrars be repeated by marianne mother in accent of utmost amazement though elinor must not speak even eye be fixed on with same impatient wonder rose from seat walked to window apparently from not knowing what to do took up pair of scissors lay there while spoiling sheath by cutting latter to piece a spoke said in hurried voice perhaps know may not have heard that brother be lately married to to youngest to miss lucy steele word be echoed with unspeakable astonishment by elinor who sat with head leaning over work in state of such agitation a made hardly know where be yes said be married last week be now at dawlish elinor must sit no longer almost ran out of room a soon a door be closed burst into tear of joy at first thought must never cease edward who have till then looked where rather than at saw hurry away perhaps saw even heard emotion for immediately afterwards fell into reverie remark inquiry affectionate address of mr dashwood must penetrate at last without saying word quitted room walked out towards village leaving others in greatest astonishment perplexity on change in situation so wonderful so sudden perplexity have mean of lessening by own conjecture chapter xlix unaccountable however a circumstance of release might appear to whole family be certain that edward be free to what purpose freedom must be employed be easily pre determined by for after experiencing blessing of one imprudent engagement contracted without mother consent a have already done for more than four year nothing le must be expected of in failure of than immediate contraction of errand at barton in fact be simple one be only to ask elinor to marry considering that be not altogether inexperienced in such question might be strange that must feel so uncomfortable in present case a really did so much in need of encouragement fresh air how soon have walked into proper resolution however how soon opportunity of exercising occurred in what manner expressed how be received need not be particularly told only need be said that when sat down to table at four o'clock about three hour after arrival have secured lady engaged mother consent be not only in rapturous profession of lover in reality of reason truth one of happiest of men situation indeed be more than commonly joyful have more than ordinary triumph of accepted love to swell heart raise spirit be released without reproach to from entanglement have long formed misery from woman whom have long ceased to love elevated at once to security with must have thought of almost with despair a soon a have learnt to consider with desire be brought not from doubt suspense from misery to happiness change be openly spoken in such genuine flowing grateful cheerfulness a friend have never witnessed in before heart be now open to elinor weakness error confessed first boyish attachment to lucy treated with philosophic dignity of twenty four be foolish idle inclination on side said consequence of ignorance of world want of employment have mother given active profession when be removed at eighteen from care of mr pratt think nay be sure must never have happened for though left longstaple with what thought at time most unconquerable preference for niece yet have then have pursuit object to engage time keep at distance from for few month must very soon have outgrown fancied attachment especially by mixing more with world a in such case must have done instead of having thing to do instead of having profession chosen for being allowed to choose returned home to be completely idle for first twelvemonth afterwards have not even nominal employment belonging to university must have given for be not entered at oxford till be nineteen have therefore nothing in world to do to fancy in love a mother did not make home in respect comfortable a have friend companion in brother disliked new acquaintance be not unnatural for to be very often at longstaple where always felt at home be always sure of welcome accordingly spent greatest part of time there from eighteen to nineteen lucy appeared everything be amiable obliging be pretty too at least thought so then have seen so little of other woman must make comparison see defect considering everything therefore hope foolish a engagement be foolish a have since in way be proved be not at time unnatural inexcusable piece of folly change few hour have wrought in mind happiness of dashwoods be such so great a promised satisfaction of sleepless night mr dashwood too happy to be comfortable knew not how to love edward praise elinor enough how to be enough thankful for release without wounding delicacy how at once to give leisure for unrestrained conversation together yet enjoy a wished sight society of marianne must speak happiness only by tear comparison must occur regret must arise joy though sincere a love for sister be of kind to give spirit language elinor how be feeling to be described from moment of learning that lucy be married to edward be free to moment of justifying hope have so instantly followed be thing by turn tranquil when second moment have passed when found doubt solicitude removed compared situation with what so lately have be saw honourably released from former engagement saw instantly profiting by release to address declare affection a tender a constant a have ever supposed to be be oppressed be overcome by own felicity happily disposed a be human mind to be easily familiarized with change for better required several hour to give sedateness to spirit degree of tranquillity to heart edward be now fixed at cottage at least for week for other claim might be made on be impossible that le than week must be given up to enjoyment of elinor company suffice to say half be to be said of past present future for though very few hour spent in hard labor of incessant talking will despatch more subject than can really be in common between two rational creature yet with lover be different between subject be finished communication be even made till have be made at least twenty time over lucy marriage unceasing reasonable wonder among formed of course one of earliest discussion of lover elinor particular knowledge of party made appear to in view a one of most extraordinary unaccountable circumstance have ever heard how must be thrown together by what attraction robert must be drawn on to marry girl of whose beauty have heard speak without admiration girl too already engaged to brother on whose account that brother have be thrown off by family be beyond comprehension to make out to own heart be delightful affair to imagination be even ridiculous one to reason judgment be completely puzzle edward must only attempt explanation by supposing that perhaps at first accidentally meeting vanity of one have be so worked on by flattery of other a to lead by degree to rest elinor remembered what robert have told in harley street of opinion of what own mediation in brother affair might have done if applied to in time repeated to edward be exactly like robert be immediate observation that presently added might perhaps be in head when acquaintance between first began lucy perhaps at first might think only of procuring good office in favour other design might afterward arise how long have be carrying on between however be equally at loss with to make out for at oxford where have remained for choice ever since quitting london have have mean of hearing of from letter to very last be neither le frequent le affectionate than usual not smallest suspicion therefore have ever occurred to prepare for what followed when at last burst on in letter from lucy have be for time believed half stupified between wonder horror joy of such deliverance put letter into elinor hand dear sir being very sure have long lost affection have thought at liberty to bestow own on have doubt of being a happy with a once used to think might be with scorn to accept hand while heart be sincerely wish happy in choice will not be fault if be not always good friend a near relationship now make proper can safely say owe ill will be sure will be too generous to do ill office brother have gained affection entirely a must not live without one be just returned from altar be now on way to dawlish for few week place dear brother have great curiosity to see thought must

welcome to keep elinor read returned without comment will not ask opinion of a composition said edward for world must not have have letter of hers seen by in former day in sister be bad enough in wife

come about said elinor after pause be certainly married mother have brought on most appropriate punishment independence settled on robert through resentment against have put in power to make own choice have actually be bribing one son with thousand year to do very deed disinherited other for intending to do will hardly be le hurt suppose by robert marrying lucy than must have be by marrying will be more hurt by for robert always be favourite will be more hurt by on same principle will forgive much sooner in what state affair stood at present between edward knew not for communication with of family have yet be attempted by have quitted oxford within four twenty hour after lucy letter arrived with only one object before nearest road to barton have have leisure to form scheme of conduct with road did not hold most intimate connection must hing till be assured of fate with miss dashwood by rapidity in seeking that fate be to be supposed in spite of jealousy with have once thought of colonel brandon in spite of modesty with rated own desert politeness with talked of doubt did not upon whole expect very cruel reception be business however to say that did said very prettily what might say on subject twelvemonth after must be referred to imagination of husband wife lucy have certainly meant to deceive to go off with flourish of malice against in message by thomas be perfectly clear to elinor edward now thoroughly enlightened on character have scruple in believing capable of utmost meanness of wanton ill nature though eye have be long opened even before acquaintance with elinor began to ignorance want of liberality in of opinion have be equally imputed by to want of education till last letter reached have always believed to be well disposed good hearted girl thoroughly attached to nothing persuasion must have prevented putting end to engagement long before discovery of laid open to mother anger have be continual source of disquiet regret to thought duty said independent of feeling to give option of continuing engagement not when be renounced by mother stood to appearance without friend in world to assist in situation a where there seemed nothing to tempt avarice vanity of living creature how must suppose when so earnestly so warmly insisted on sharing fate whatever might be that thing most disinterested affection be inducement even now can not comprehend on motive acted what fancied advantage must be to to be fettered to man for whom have not smallest regard who have only two thousand pound in world must not foresee that colonel brandon must give living might suppose that something must occur in favour that own family might in time relent at rate lost nothing by continuing engagement for have proved that fettered inclination action connection be certainly respectable one probably gained consideration among friend if nothing more advantageous occurred must be better for to marry than be single edward be of course immediately convinced that nothing must have be more natural than lucy conduct more self evident than motive of elinor scolded harshly a lady always scold imprudence compliment for having spent so much time with at norland when must have felt own inconstancy behaviour be certainly very wrong said because to say nothing of own conviction relation be led away by to fancy expect what a be then situated must never be must only plead ignorance of own heart mistaken confidence in force of engagement be simple enough to think that because faith be plighted to there must be no danger in being with that consciousness of engagement be to keep heart a safe sacred a honour felt that admired told be only friendship till began to make comparison between lucy did not know how far be got after suppose be wrong in remaining so much in sussex argument with reconciled to expediency of be no better than danger be own be doing injury to anybody elinor smiled shook head edward heard with pleasure of colonel brandon being expected at cottage a really wished not only to be better acquainted with to have opportunity of convincing that no longer resented giving living of delaford at present said after thanks so ungraciously delivered a mine be on occasion must think have never forgiven for offering now felt astonished that have never yet be to place so little interest have taken in matter that owed knowledge of house garden glebe extent of parish condition of land rate of tithe to elinor who have heard so much of from colonel brandon heard with so much attention a to be entirely mistress of subject one question after only remained undecided between one difficulty only be to be overcome be brought together by mutual affection with warmest approbation of real friend intimate knowledge of other seemed to make happiness certain only wanted something to live upon edward have two thousand pound elinor one with delaford living be that must call own for be impossible that mr dashwood must advance anything be of quite enough in love to think that three hundred fifty pound year must supply with comfort of life edward be not entirely without hope of favourable change in mother towards on that rested for residue of income elinor have such dependence for since edward must still be unable to marry miss morton choosing have be spoken of in mr ferrars flattering language a only lesser evil than choosing lucy steele feared that robert offence must serve other purpose than to enrich fanny about four day after edward arrival colonel brandon appeared to complete mr dashwood satisfaction to give dignity of having for first time since living at barton more company with than house must hold edward be allowed to retain privilege of first comer colonel brandon therefore walked night to old quarter at park from whence usually returned in morning early enough to interrupt lover first tte tte before breakfast three week residence at delaford where in evening hour at least have little to do to calculate disproportion between thirty six seventeen brought to barton in temper of mind needed improvement in marianne look kindness of welcome encouragement of mother language to make cheerful among such friend however such flattery did revive rumour of lucy marriage have yet reached knew nothing of what have passed first hour of visit be consequently spent in hearing in wondering thing be explained to by mr dashwood found fresh reason to rejoice in what have done for mr ferrars since eventually promoted interest of elinor must be needle to say that gentleman advanced in good opinion of other a advanced in other acquaintance for must not be otherwise resemblance in good principle good sense in disposition manner of thinking must probably have be sufficient to unite in friendship without other attraction being in love with two sister two sister fond of other made that mutual regard inevitable immediate might otherwise have waited effect of time judgment letter from town few day before must have made nerve in elinor body thrill with transport now arrived to be read with le emotion than mirth mr jennings wrote to tell wonderful tale to vent honest indignation against jilting girl pour forth compassion towards poor mr edward who be sure have quite doted upon worthless hussy be now by account almost broken hearted at oxford do think continued nothing be ever carried on so sly for be two day before lucy called sat couple of hour with not soul suspected anything of matter not even nancy who poor soul came cry to day after in great fright for fear of mr ferrars a well a not knowing how to get to plymouth for lucy seems borrowed money before went off to be married on purpose suppose to make show with poor nancy have not seven shilling in world so be very glad to give five guinea to take down to exeter where think of staying three four week with mr burgess in hope a tell to fall in with doctor again must say that lucy crossness not to take along with in chaise be worse than poor mr edward can not get out of head must send for to barton miss marianne must try to comfort mr dashwood strain be more solemn mr ferrars be most unfortunate of woman poor fanny have suffered agony of sensibility considered existence of under blow with grateful wonder robert offence be unpardonable lucy be infinitely worse of be ever again to be mentioned to mr ferrars even if might hereafter be induced to forgive son wife must never be acknowledged a daughter be permitted to appear in presence secrecy with everything have be carried on between be rationally treated a enormously heightening crime because have suspicion of occurred to others proper measure must have be taken to prevent marriage called on elinor to join with in regretting that lucy engagement with edward have not rather be fulfilled than must thus be mean of spreading misery farther in family thus continued mr ferrars have never yet mentioned edward name doe not surprise to great astonishment not line have be received from on occasion perhaps however be kept silent by fear of offending will therefore give hint by line to oxford that sister think letter of proper submission from addressed perhaps to fanny by shown to mother might not be taken amiss for know tenderness of mr ferrars heart that wish for nothing so much a to be on good term with child paragraph be of importance to prospect conduct of edward determined to attempt reconciliation though not exactly in manner pointed out by brother sister letter of proper submission repeated must have beg mother pardon for robert ingratitude to breach of honour to can make submission be grown humble penitent by what have passed be grown very happy must not interest know of submission be proper for to make may certainly ask to be forgiven said elinor because have offended must think might now venture so far a to profess concern for having ever formed engagement drew on mother anger agreed that might when have forgiven perhaps little humility may be convenient while acknowledging second engagement almost a imprudent in eye a first have nothing to urge against still resisted idea of letter of proper submission therefore to make easier to a declared much greater willingness to make mean concession by word of mouth than on paper be resolved that instead of writing to fanny must go to london personally entreat good office in favour if really do interest said marianne in new character of candour in bringing about reconciliation will think that even john fanny be not entirely without merit after visit on colonel brandon side of only three four day two gentleman quitted barton together be to go immediately to delaford edward might have personal knowledge of future home assist patron friend in deciding on improvement be needed to from thence after staying there couple of night be to proceed on journey to town chapter l after proper resistance on part of mr ferrars just so violent so steady a to preserve from that reproach always seemed fearful of incurring reproach of being too amiable edward be admitted to presence pronounced to be again son family have of late be exceedingly fluctuating for many year of life have have two son crime annihilation of edward few week ago have robbed of one similar annihilation of robert have left for fortnight without now by resuscitation of edward have one again in spite of being allowed once more to live however did not feel continuance of existence secure till have revealed present engagement for publication of circumstance feared might give sudden turn to constitution carry off a rapidly a before with apprehensive caution therefore be revealed be listened to with unexpected calmness mr ferrars at first reasonably endeavoured to dissuade from marrying miss dashwood by argument in power told that in miss morton must have woman of higher rank larger fortune enforced assertion by observing that miss morton be daughter of nobleman with thirty thousand pound while miss dashwood be only daughter of private gentleman with more than three when found that though perfectly admitting truth of representation be by mean inclined to be guided by judged wisest from experience of past to submit therefore after such ungracious delay a owed to own dignity a served to prevent suspicion of good will issued decree of consent to marriage of edward elinor what must engage to do towards augmenting income be next to be considered here plainly appeared that though edward be now only son be by mean eldest for while robert be inevitably endowed with thousand pound year not smallest objection be made against edward taking order for sake of two hundred fifty at utmost be anything promised for present in future beyond ten thousand pound have be given with fanny be a much however a be desired more than be expected by edward elinor mr ferrars by shuffling excuse seemed only person surprised at not giving more with income quite sufficient to want thus secured to have nothing to wait for after edward be in possession of living readiness of house to colonel brandon with eager desire for accommodation of elinor be making considerable improvement after waiting time for completion after experiencing a usual thousand disappointment delay from unaccountable dilatoriness of workman elinor a usual broke through first positive resolution of not marrying till thing be ready ceremony took place in barton church early in autumn first month after marriage be spent with friend at mansion house from whence must superintend progress of parsonage direct thing a liked on spot must choose paper project shrubbery invent sweep mr jennings prophecy though rather jumbled together be chiefly fulfilled for be able to visit edward wife in parsonage by michaelmas found in elinor husband a really believed one of happiest couple in world have in fact nothing to wish for marriage of colonel brandon marianne rather better pasturage for cow be visited on first settling by almost relation friend mr ferrars came to inspect happiness be almost ashamed of having authorised even dashwoods be at expense of journey from sussex to do honour will not say that be disappointed dear sister said john a be walking together one morning before gate of delaford house must be saying too much for certainly have be one of most fortunate young woman in world a be confess must give great pleasure to call colonel brandon brother property here place house thing be in such respectable excellent condition wood have not seen such timber where in dorsetshire a there be now standing in delaford hanger though perhaps marianne may not seem exactly person to attract yet think must altogether be advisable for to have now frequently staying with for a colonel brandon seems great deal at home nobody can tell what may happen for when people be much thrown together see little of anybody else will always be in power to set off to advantage so forth in short may a well give chance understand though mr ferrars did come to see always treated with make believe of decent affection be never insulted by real favour preference be due to folly of robert cunning of wife be earned by before many month have passed away selfish sagacity of latter have at first drawn robert into scrape be principal instrument of deliverance from for respectful humility assiduous attention endless flattery a soon a smallest opening be given for exercise reconciled mr ferrars to choice re established completely in favour illustration everything in such respectable condition whole of lucy behaviour in affair prosperity crowned therefore may be held forth a most encouraging instance of what earnest unceasing attention to self interest however progress may be apparently obstructed will do in securing advantage of fortune with other sacrifice than of time conscience when robert first sought acquaintance privately visited in bartlett building be only with view imputed to by brother merely meant to persuade to give up engagement a there must be nothing to overcome affection of naturally expected that one two interview must settle matter in point however that only erred for though lucy soon gave hope that eloquence must convince in time visit conversation be always wanted to produce conviction doubt always lingered in mind when parted must only be removed by half hour discourse with attendance be by mean secured rest followed in course instead of talking of edward came gradually to talk only of robert subject on have always more to say than on other in soon betrayed interest even equal to own in short became speedily evident to that have entirely supplanted brother be proud of conquest proud of tricking edward very proud of marrying privately without mother consent what immediately followed be known passed month in great happiness at dawlish for have many relation old acquaintance to cut drew several plan for magnificent cottage from thence returning to town procured forgiveness of mr ferrars by simple expedient of asking at lucy instigation be adopted forgiveness at first indeed a be reasonable comprehended only robert lucy who have owed mother duty therefore must have transgressed none still remained week longer unpardoned perseverance in humility of conduct message in self condemnation for robert offence gratitude for unkindness be treated with procured in time haughty notice overcame by graciousness led soon afterwards by rapid degree to highest state of affection influence lucy became a necessary to mr ferrars a robert fanny while edward be never cordially forgiven for having once intended to marry elinor though superior to in fortune birth be spoken of a intruder be in thing considered always openly acknowledged to be favourite child settled in town received very liberal assistance from mr ferrars be on best term imaginable with dashwoods setting aside jealousy ill will continually subsisting between fanny lucy in husband of course took part a well a frequent domestic disagreement between robert lucy nothing must exceed harmony in lived together what edward have done to forfeit right of eldest son might have puzzled many people to find out what robert have done to succeed to might have puzzled still more be arrangement however justified in effect if not in cause for nothing ever appeared in robert style of living of talking to give suspicion of regretting extent of income a leaving brother too little bringing too much if edward might be judged from ready discharge of duty in particular from increasing attachment to wife home from regular cheerfulness of spirit might be supposed le contented with lot le free from wish of exchange elinor marriage divided a little from family a must well be contrived without rendering cottage at barton entirely useless for mother sister spent much more than time with mr dashwood be acting on motif of policy a well a pleasure in frequency of visit at delaford for wish of bringing marianne colonel brandon together be hardly le earnest though rather more liberal than what john have expressed be now darling object precious a be company of daughter to desired nothing so much a to give up constant enjoyment to valued friend to see marianne settled at mansion house be equally wish of edward elinor felt sorrow own obligation marianne by general consent be to be reward of with confederacy against with knowledge so intimate of goodness with conviction of fond attachment to herself at last though long after be observable to everybody else burst on what must do marianne dashwood be born to extraordinary fate be born to discover falsehood of own opinion to counteract by conduct most favourite maxim be born to overcome affection formed so late in life a at seventeen with sentiment superior to strong esteem lively friendship voluntarily to give hand to that other man who have suffered no le than under event of former attachment whom two year before have considered too old to be married who still sought constitutional safeguard of flannel waistcoat so be instead of falling sacrifice to irresistible passion a once have fondly flattered with expecting instead of remaining even for ever with mother finding only pleasure in retirement study a afterwards in more calm sober judgment have determined on found at nineteen submitting to new attachment entering on new duty placed in new home wife mistress of family patroness of village colonel brandon be now a happy a who best loved believed deserved to be in marianne be consoled for past affliction regard society restored mind to animation spirit to cheerfulness that marianne found own happiness in forming be equally persuasion delight of observing friend marianne must never love by half whole heart became in time a much devoted to husband a have once be to willoughby willoughby must not hear of marriage without pang punishment be soon afterwards complete in voluntary forgiveness of mr smith who by stating marriage with woman of character a source of clemency gave reason for believing have behaved with honour towards marianne might at once have be happy rich that repentance of misconduct thus brought own punishment be sincere need not be doubted that long thought of colonel brandon with envy of marianne with regret that be for ever inconsolable that fled from society contracted habitual gloom of temper died of broken heart must not be depended on for did lived to exert frequently to enjoy wife be not always out of humour home always uncomfortable in breed of horse dog in sporting of kind found inconsiderable degree of domestic felicity for marianne however in spite of incivility in surviving loss always retained that decided regard interested in thing befell made secret standard of perfection in woman many rising beauty must be slighted by in after day a bearing comparison with mr brandon mr dashwood be prudent enough to remain at cottage without attempting removal to delaford fortunately for sir john mr jennings when marianne be taken from margaret have reached age highly suitable for dancing not very ineligible for being supposed to have lover between barton delaford there be that constant communication strong family affection must naturally dictate among merit happiness of elinor marianne let not be ranked a least considerable that though sister living almost within sight of other must live without disagreement between producing coolness between husband end
