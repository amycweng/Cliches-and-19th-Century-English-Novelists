of world make conversation easy talk very well with happy command of language be too often used believe to make black appear white have already almost persuaded of being warmly attached to daughter though have be so long convinced to contrary speaks of with so much tenderness anxiety lamenting so bitterly neglect of education represents however a wholly unavoidable that be forced to recollect how many successive spring ladyship spent in town while daughter be left in staffordshire to care of servant governess very little better to prevent believing what say if manner have so great

grand affair of education really wish to have attended to while remains at miss summer want to play sing with portion of taste good deal of assurance a have hand arm tolerable voice be so much indulged in infant year be never obliged to attend to anything consequently be without accomplishment be now necessary to finish pretty woman not that be advocate for prevailing fashion of acquiring perfect knowledge of language art science be throwing time away to be mistress of french italian german music singing drawing c will gain woman applause will not add one lover to listgrace manner after be of greatest importance mean therefore fredericas acquirement must be more than superficial flatter myself that will not remain long enough at school to understand anything thoroughly hope to see wife of sir james within twelvemonth know on what ground hope be certainly good foundation for school must be very humiliating to girl of fredericas age by by have better not invite more on account a wish to find situation a unpleasant a possible be sure of sir james at time must make renew application by line will trouble meanwhile to prevent forming other attachment when come to town ask to house occasionally talk to of frederica that may not forget upon whole commend own conduct in affair extremely regard a very happy instance of circumspection tenderness mother must have insisted on daughter accepting so good offer on first overture must not reconcile to myself to force frederica into marriage from heart revolted instead of adopting so harsh measure merely propose to make own choice by rendering thoroughly uncomfortable till doe accept himbut enough of tiresome girl may well wonder how contrive to pas time here for first week be insufferably dull now however begin to mend party be enlarged by mr vernons brother handsome young man who promise amusement there be something about rather interest sort of sauciness familiarity will teach to correct be lively seems clever when have inspired with greater respect for than sister kind office have implanted may be agreeable flirt there be exquisite pleasure in subduing insolent spirit in making person predetermined to dislike acknowledge one superiority have disconcerted already by calm reserve will be endeavour to humble pride of self important de courcys still lower to convince mr vernon that sisterly caution have be bestowed in vain to persuade reginald that have scandalously belied project will serve at least to amuse prevent feeling so acutely dreadful separation from whom love yours ever s vernon viii mr vernon to lady de courcy churchhill dear motheryou must not expect reginald back again for time desire to tell that present open weather induces to accept mr vernons invitation to prolong stay in sussex that may have hunting together mean to send for horse immediately be impossible to say when may see in kent will not disguise sentiment on change from dear mother though think have better not communicate to father whose excessive anxiety about reginald must subject to alarm might seriously affect health spirit lady susan have certainly contrived in space of fortnight to make brother like in short be persuaded that continuing here beyond time originally fixed for return be occasioned a much by degree of fascination towards a by wish of hunting with mr vernon of course can not receive that pleasure from length of visit brother company must otherwise give be indeed provoked at artifice of unprincipled woman what stronger proof of dangerous ability can be given than perversion of reginalds judgment when entered house be so decidedly against in last letter actually gave particular of behaviour at langford such a received from gentleman who knew perfectly well if true must raise abhorrence against reginald be entirely disposed to credit opinion of be sure be a low a of woman in england when first came be evident that considered a one entitled to delicacy respect that felt must be delighted with attention of man inclined to flirt with behaviour confess have be calculated to do away with such idea have not detected smallest impropriety in itnothing of vanity of pretension of levity be altogether so attractive must not wonder at being delighted with have known nothing of previous to personal acquaintance against reason against conviction to be so well pleased with a be sure be doe really astonish admiration be at first very strong more than be natural did not wonder at being much struck by gentleness delicacy of manner when have mentioned of late have be in term of more extraordinary praise yesterday actually said that must not be surprised at effect produced on heart of man by such loveliness such ability when lamented in reply badness of disposition observed that might have be error be to be imputed to neglected education early marriage that be altogether wonderful woman tendency to excuse conduct to forget in warmth of admiration vexes if did not know reginald be too much at home at churchhill to need invitation for lengthening visit must regret mr vernons giving lady susans intention be of course of absolute coquetry desire of universal admiration can not for moment imagine that have anything more serious in view mortifies to see young man of reginalds sense duped by at be c catherine vernon ix mr johnson to lady s vernon edward street dearest friendi congratulate on mr de courcys arrival advise by mean to marry father estate be know considerable believe certainly entailed sir reginald be very infirm not likely to stand in way long hear young man well spoken of though one can really deserve dearest susan mr de courcy may be worth having mainwaring will storm of course easily pacify besides most scrupulous point of honour must not require to wait for emancipation have seen sir james came to town for few day last week called several time in edward street talked to about daughter be so far from having forgotten that be sure must marry of with pleasure gave hope of fredericas relenting told great deal of improvement scolded for making love to maria mainwaring protested that have be only in joke laughed heartily at disappointment in short be very agreeable be a silly a ever yours faithfully alicia x lady susan vernon to mr johnson churchhill be much obliged to dear friend for advice respecting mr de courcy know be given with full conviction of expediency though be not quite determined on following can not easily resolve on anything so serious a marriage especially a be not at present in want of money might perhaps till old gentleman death be very little benefited by match be true that be vain enough to believe within reach have made sensible of power can now enjoy pleasure of triumphing over mind prepared to dislike prejudiced against past action sister too be hope convinced how little ungenerous representation of anyone to disadvantage of will avail when opposed by immediate influence of intellect manner see plainly that be uneasy at progress in good opinion of brother conclude that nothing will be wanting on part to counteract having once made doubt justice of opinion of think may defy have be delightful to to watch advance towards intimacy especially to observe altered manner in consequence of repressing by cool dignity of deportment insolent approach to direct familiarity conduct have be equally guarded from first never behaved le like coquette in whole course of life though perhaps desire of dominion be never more decided have subdued entirely by sentiment serious conversation made may venture to say at least half in love with without semblance of most commonplace flirtation mr vernons consciousness of deserving sort of revenge that can be in power to inflict for ill office must alone enable to perceive be actuated by design in behaviour so gentle unpretending let think act a chooses however have never yet found that advice of sister must prevent young man being in love if chose be advancing now to kind of confidence in short be likely to be engaged in sort of platonic friendship on side may be sure of never being more for if be not attached to person a much a can be to anyone must make point of not bestowing affection on man who have dared to think so meanly of reginald have good figure be not unworthy praise have heard given be still greatly inferior to friend at langford be le polished le insinuating than mainwaring be comparatively deficient in power of saying delightful thing put one in good humour with world be quite agreeable enough however to afford amusement to make many of hour pas very pleasantly must otherwise be spent in endeavouring to overcome sister in law reserve listening to insipid talk of husband account of sir james be most satisfactory mean to give miss frederica hint of intention very soon c s vernon xi mr vernon to lady de courcy churchhill really grow quite uneasy dearest mother about reginald from witnessing very rapid increase of lady susans influence be now on term of most particular friendship frequently engaged in long conversation together have contrived by most artful coquetry to subdue judgment to own purpose be impossible to see intimacy between so very soon established without alarm though can hardly suppose that lady susans plan extend to marriage wish must get reginald home again on plausible pretence be not at disposed to leave have given a many hint of father precarious state of health a common decency will allow to do in own house power over must now be boundless a have entirely effaced former ill opinion persuaded not merely to forget to justify conduct mr smith account of proceeding at langford where accused of having made mr mainwaring young man engaged to miss mainwaring distractedly in love with reginald firmly believed when came here be now be persuaded only scandalous invention have told so with warmth of manner spoke regret at having believed contrary how sincerely do grieve that ever entered house always looked forward to coming with uneasiness very far be from originating in anxiety for reginald expected most disagreeable companion for myself must not imagine that brother must be in smallest danger of being captivated by woman with whose principle be so well acquainted whose character so heartily despised if can get away will be good thing yours c catherine vernon xii sir reginald de courcy to son parkland know that young men in general admit of enquiry even from nearest relation into affair of heart hope dear reginald that will be superior to such a allow nothing for father anxiety think privileged to refuse confidence slight advice must be sensible that a only son representative of ancient family conduct in life be most interesting to connection in very important concern of marriage especially there be everything at stakeyour own happiness that of parent credit of name suppose that must deliberately form absolute engagement of nature without acquainting mother at least without being convinced that must approve of choice can not help fearing that may be drawn in by lady who have lately attached to marriage whole of family far near must highly reprobate lady susans age be material objection want of character be one so much more serious that difference of even twelve year becomes in comparison of small amount be not blinded by sort of fascination must be ridiculous in to repeat instance of great misconduct on side so very generally known neglect of husband encouragement of other men extravagance dissipation be so gross notorious that one must be ignorant of at time can now have forgotten to family have always be represented in softened colour by benevolence of mr charles vernon yet in spite of generous endeavour to excuse know that did from most selfish motif take possible pain to prevent marriage with catherine year increasing infirmity make very desirous of seeing settled in world to fortune of wife goodness of own will make indifferent family character must be equally unexceptionable when choice be fixed so that objection can be made to then can promise ready cheerful consent be duty to oppose match deep art only must render possible must in end make wretched be possible behaviour may arise only from vanity wish of gaining admiration of man whom must imagine to be particularly prejudiced against be more likely that must aim at something further be poor may naturally seek alliance must be advantageous to herself know own right that be out of power to prevent inheriting family estate ability of distressing during life must be specie of revenge to must hardly stoop under circumstance honestly tell sentiment intention wish to work on fear on sense affection must destroy comfort of life to know that be married to lady susan vernon must be death of honest pride with have hitherto considered son must blush to see to hear of to think of may perhaps do good that of relieving own mind by letter felt duty to tell that partiality for lady susan be secret to friend to warn against must be glad to hear reason for disbelieving mr smith intelligence have doubt of authenticity month ago if can give assurance of having design beyond enjoying conversation of clever woman for short period of yielding admiration only to beauty ability without being blinded by to fault will restore to happiness if can not do explain to at least what have occasioned so great alteration in opinion of be c c reginald de courcy xiii lady de courcy to mr vernon parkland dear

excessively vexed that sir reginald must know anything of matter foresaw must make so uneasy caught fear moment have read letter be sure have not have business out of head since wrote by same post to reginald long letter full of particularly asking explanation of what may have heard from lady susan to contradict late shocking report answer came morning will enclose to a think will like to see wish be more satisfactory seems written with determination to think well of lady susan that assurance a to marriage c set heart at ease say can however to satisfy father be certainly le uneasy since reginalds letter how provoking be dear catherine that unwelcome guest of yours must not only prevent meeting christmas be occasion of so much vexation trouble kiss dear child for affectionate mother c

be taking from claim to excellent understanding bitterest enemy have never denied equally low must sink pretension to common sense if be suspected of matrimonial view in behaviour to difference of age must be insuperable objection entreat dear father to quiet mind longer harbour suspicion can not be more injurious to own peace than to understanding can have other view in remaining with lady susan than to enjoy for short time a have expressed conversation of woman of high intellectual power if mr vernon must allow something to affection for herself husband in length of visit must do more justice to sister be unhappily prejudiced beyond hope of conviction against lady susan from attachment to husband in doe honour to can not forgive endeavour at preventing union have be attributed to selfishness in lady susan in case a well a in many others world have most grossly injured that lady by supposing worst where motif of conduct have be doubtful lady susan have heard something so materially to disadvantage of sister a to persuade that happiness of mr vernon to whom be always much attached must be wholly destroyed by marriage circumstance while explains true motif of lady susans conduct remove blame have be so lavished on may also convince how little general report of anyone ought to be credited since character however upright can escape malevolence of slander if sister in security of retirement with a little opportunity a inclination to do evil must not avoid censure must not rashly condemn who living in world surrounded with temptation must be accused of error be known to have power of committing blame severely for having so easily believed slanderous tale invented by charles smith to prejudice of lady susan a be now convinced how greatly have

being able to make worthy man completely wretched lady susan be far from intending conquest on finding how warmly miss mainwaring resented lover defection determined in spite of mr mr mainwarings most urgent entreaty to leave family have reason to imagine did receive serious proposal from sir james removing from langford immediately on discovery of attachment must acquit on article with mind of common candour will be sure dear sir feel truth of will hereby learn to do justice to character of very injured woman know that lady susan in coming to churchhill be governed only by most honourable

deeper distress than hers on receipt of letter be judgment inferior to mine be very unwilling that frederica must be allowed to come to churchhill justly enough a seems sort of reward to behaviour deserving very differently be impossible to take anywhere else be not to remain here long will be absolutely necessary said a dear sister must be sensible to treat daughter with severity while be here most painful necessity will endeavour to submit to be afraid have often be too indulgent poor fredericas temper must never bear opposition well must support encourage must urge necessity of reproof if

be beyond measure concerned to see fair friend in such distress watched with so much tender solicitude that who occasionally caught observing countenance with exultation be quite out of patience

with shrubbery on one side where may see mother walking for hour together in earnest conversation with reginald girl of fredericas age must be childish indeed if such thing strike be not inexcusable to give such example to daughter yet reginald still think lady susan best of mother still condemns frederica a worthless girl be convinced that attempt to run away proceeded from justifiable cause
