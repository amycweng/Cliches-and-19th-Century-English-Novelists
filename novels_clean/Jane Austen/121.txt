sister be remarkable however that neither insisted on catherine writing by post exacted promise of transmitting character of new acquaintance detail of interesting conversation that bath might produce everything indeed relative to important journey be done on part of morlands with degree of moderation composure seemed rather consistent with common feeling of common life than with refined susceptibility tender emotion first separation of heroine from family ought always to excite father instead of giving unlimited order on banker even putting hundred pound bank bill into hand gave only ten guinea promised more when wanted under unpromising auspex parting took place journey began be performed with suitable quietness uneventful safety robber tempest befriended one lucky overturn to

true source of debasement be one of circumstance peculiarly belong to heroine life fortitude under what particularly dignifies character catherine have fortitude too suffered murmur passed lip from state of humiliation be roused at end of ten minute to pleasanter feeling by seeing not mr thorpe mr tilney within three yard of place where sat seemed to be moving way did not see therefore smile blush sudden reappearance raised in catherine passed away without sullying heroic importance looked a handsome a lively a ever be talking with interest to fashionable pleasing looking young woman who leant on arm whom catherine immediately guessed to be sister thus unthinkingly throwing away fair opportunity of considering lost to forever by being married already guided only by what be simple probable have never entered head that mr tilney must be married have not behaved have not talked like married men to whom have be used have never mentioned wife have acknowledged sister from circumstance sprang instant conclusion of sister now being by side therefore instead of turning of deathlike paleness falling in fit on mr allen bosom catherine sat erect in perfect use of sens with cheek only little redder than usual mr tilney companion who continued though slowly to approach be immediately preceded by lady acquaintance of mr thorpe lady stopping to speak to a belonging to

accordingly done mr tilney still continuing standing before after few minute consideration asked catherine to dance with compliment delightful a be produced severe mortification to lady in giving denial expressed sorrow on occasion so very much a if really felt that have thorpe who joined just afterwards be minute earlier might have thought suffering rather too acute very easy manner in then told that have kept waiting did not by mean reconcile more to lot did particular entered into while be standing up of horse dog of friend whom have just left of proposed exchange of terrier between interest so much a to prevent looking very often towards that part of room where have left mr tilney of dear isabella to whom particularly longed to point out that gentleman must see nothing be in different set be separated from party away from acquaintance one mortification succeeded from whole deduced useful lesson to go previously engaged to ball doe not necessarily increase dignity enjoyment of young lady from such moralizing strain a be suddenly roused by touch on shoulder turning round perceived mr hughes directly behind attended by miss tilney gentleman beg pardon miss morland said for libertybut can not anyhow get to miss thorpe mr thorpe said be sure must not have least objection to letting in young lady by mr hughes must not have applied to creature in room more

hughes satisfied with having so respectably settled young charge returned to party miss tilney have good figure pretty face very agreeable countenance air though have not decided pretension resolute stylishness of miss thorpe have more real elegance manner showed good sense good breeding be shy affectedly open seemed capable of being young attractive at ball without wanting to fix attention of man near without exaggerated feeling of ecstatic delight inconceivable vexation on little trifling occurrence catherine interested at once by appearance relationship to mr tilney be desirous of being acquainted with readily talked therefore whenever must think of anything to say have courage leisure for saying hindrance thrown in way of very speedy intimacy by frequent want of one more of requisite prevented doing more than going through first rudiment of acquaintance by informing how well other liked bath how much admired building surrounding country whether drew played sang whether be fond of riding on two dance be scarcely concluded before catherine found arm gently seized by faithful isabella who in great spirit exclaimed at last have got dearest creature have be looking for

satisfy do think well declare never knew anything like can signify to what be talking of perhaps be talking about therefore must advise not to listen may happen to hear something not very agreeable in commonplace chatter lasted time original subject seemed entirely forgotten though catherine be very well pleased to have dropped for while must not avoid little suspicion at total suspension of isabella impatient desire to see mr tilney when orchestra struck up fresh dance james must have led fair partner away resisted tell mr morland cried must not do thing for world how can be so teasing

event of evening be a follows appeared first in general dissatisfaction with everybody about while remained in room speedily brought on considerable weariness violent desire to go home on arriving in pulteney street took direction of extraordinary hunger when be appeased changed into earnest longing to be in bed such be extreme point of distress for when there immediately fell into sound sleep lasted nine hour from awoke perfectly revived in excellent spirit with fresh hope fresh scheme first wish of heart be to improve acquaintance with miss tilney almost first resolution to seek for purpose in pump room at noon in pump room one so newly arrived in bath must be met with that building have already found so favourable for discovery of female excellence completion of female intimacy so admirably adapted for secret discourse unlimited confidence that be most reasonably encouraged to expect friend from within wall plan for morning thus settled sat quietly down to book after breakfast resolving to remain in same place same employment till clock struck one from habitude very little incommoded by remark ejaculation of mr allen whose vacancy of mind incapacity for thinking be such that a never talked great deal so must never be entirely silent therefore while sat at work if lost needle broke thread if heard carriage in street saw speck upon gown must observe aloud whether there be anyone at leisure to answer not at about half past twelve remarkably loud rap drew in haste to window scarcely have time to inform catherine of there being two open carriage at door in first only servant brother driving miss thorpe in second before john thorpe came running upstairs calling out well miss morland here be have be waiting long must not come before old devil of coachmaker be such eternity finding out thing fit to be got into now be ten thousand to one break down before be out of street how do do mr allen famous ball last night be not come miss morland be quick for others be in confounded hurry to be off want to get tumble over what do mean said catherine where be going to going to why have not forgot engagement did not agree together to take drive morning what head have be going up claverton down something be said about remember said catherine looking at mr allen for opinion really did not expect not expect thats good one what dust must have made if have not come catherine silent appeal to friend meanwhile be entirely thrown away for mr allen not being at in habit of conveying expression by look be not aware of being ever intended by anybody else catherine whose desire of seeing miss tilney again must at moment bear short delay in favour of drive who thought there must be impropriety in going with mr thorpe a isabella be going at same time with james be therefore obliged to speak plainer well maam what do say to can spare for hour two will go do just a please dear replied mr allen with most placid indifference catherine took advice ran off to get ready in very few minute reappeared having scarcely allowed two others time enough to get through few short sentence in praise after thorpe have procured mr allen admiration of gig then receiving friend parting good wish hurried downstairs dearest creature cried isabella to whom duty of friendship immediately called before must get into carriage have be at least three hour getting ready be afraid be ill what delightful ball have last night have thousand thing to say to make haste get in for long to be off catherine followed order turned away not too soon to hear friend exclaim aloud to james what sweet girl be quite dote on will not be frightened miss morland said thorpe a handed in if horse must dance about little at first setting off will most likely give plunge two perhaps take rest for minute will soon know master be full of spirit playful a can be there be vice in catherine did not think portrait very inviting one be too late to retreat be too young to own frightened so resigning to fate trusting to animal boasted knowledge of owner sat peaceably down saw thorpe sit down by everything being then arranged servant who stood at horse head be bid in important voice to let go off went in quietest manner imaginable without plunge caper anything like one catherine delighted at so happy escape spoke pleasure aloud with grateful surprise companion immediately made matter perfectly simple by assuring that be entirely owing to peculiarly judicious manner in have then held rein singular discernment dexterity with have directed whip catherine though must not help wondering that with such perfect command of horse must think necessary to alarm with relation of trick congratulated sincerely on being under care of so excellent coachman perceiving that animal continued to go on in same quiet manner without showing smallest propensity towards unpleasant vivacity considering inevitable pace be ten mile hour by mean alarmingly fast gave up to enjoyment of air exercise of most invigorating kind in fine mild day of february with consciousness of safety silence of several minute succeeded first short dialogue be broken by thorpe saying very abruptly old allen be a rich a jewis not catherine did not understand himand repeated question adding in explanation old allen man be with oh mr allen mean yes believe be very rich child at nonot famous thing for next heir be godfather be not godfather be always very much with yes very much aye be what meant seems good kind of old fellow enough have lived very well in time dare say be not gouty for nothing doe drink bottle day now bottle day why must think of thing be very temperate man must not fancy in liquor last night lord help woman be always thinking of men being in liquor why suppose man be overset by bottle be sure of thisthat if everybody be to drink bottle day there must not be disorder in world there be now must be famous good thing for can not believe lord must be saving of thousand there be not hundredth part of wine consumed in kingdom that there ought to be foggy climate want help yet have heard that there be great deal of wine drunk in oxford oxford there be drinking at oxford now assure nobody drink there must hardly meet with man who go beyond four pint at utmost now for instance be reckoned remarkable thing at last party in room that upon average cleared about five pint head be looked upon a something out of common way mine be famous good stuff to be sure must not often meet with anything like in oxfordand may account for will just give notion of general rate of drinking there yes doe give notion said catherine warmly be that drink great deal more wine than thought did however be sure james doe not drink so much declaration brought on loud overpowering reply of part be very distinct except frequent exclamation amounting almost to oath adorned catherine be left when ended with rather strengthened belief of there being great deal of wine drunk in oxford same happy conviction of brother comparative sobriety thorpe idea then reverted to merit of own equipage be called on to admire spirit freedom with horse moved along ease pace a well a excellence of spring gave motion of carriage followed in admiration a well a must to go before beyond be impossible knowledge ignorance of subject rapidity of expression diffidence of put that out of power must strike out nothing new in commendation readily echoed whatever chose to assert be finally settled between without difficulty that equipage be altogether most complete of kind in england carriage neatest horse best goer best coachman really think mr thorpe said catherine venturing after time to consider matter a entirely decided to offer little variation on subject that james gig will break down break down oh lord did ever see such little tittuppy thing in life there be not sound piece of iron about wheel have be fairly worn out ten year at leastand a for body upon soul might shake to piece with touch be most devilish little rickety business ever beheld thank god have got better must not be bound to go two mile in for fifty thousand pound good heaven cried catherine quite frightened then pray let turn back will certainly meet with accident if go on do let turn back mr thorpe stop speak to brother tell how very unsafe be unsafe oh lord what be there in will only get roll if doe break down there be plenty of dirt will be excellent falling oh curse carriage be safe enough if man know how to drive thing of sort in good hand will last above twenty year after be fairly worn out lord bless must undertake for five pound to drive to york back again without losing nail catherine listened with astonishment knew not how to reconcile two such very different account of same thing for have not be brought up to understand propensity of rattle to know to how many idle assertion impudent falsehood excess of vanity will lead own family be plain matter of fact people who seldom aimed at wit of kind father at utmost being contented with pun mother with proverb be not in habit therefore of telling lie to increase importance of asserting at one moment what must contradict next reflected on affair for time in much perplexity be more than once on point of requesting from mr thorpe clearer insight into real opinion on subject checked because appeared to that did not excel in giving clearer insight in making thing plain have before made ambiguous joining to consideration that must not really suffer sister friend to be exposed to danger from might easily preserve concluded at last that must know carriage to be in fact perfectly safe therefore must alarm no longer by whole matter seemed entirely forgotten rest of conversation rather talk began ended with own concern told of horse have bought for trifle sold for incredible sum of racing match in judgment have infallibly foretold winner of shooting party in have killed more bird though without having one good shot than companion together described to famous day sport with fox hound in foresight skill in directing dog have repaired mistake of most experienced huntsman in boldness of riding though have never endangered own life for moment have be constantly leading others into difficulty calmly concluded have broken neck of many little a catherine be in habit of judging for herself unfixed a be general notion of what men ought to be must not entirely repress doubt while bore with effusion of endless conceit of being altogether completely agreeable be bold surmise for be isabella brother have be assured by james that manner must recommend to sex in spite of extreme weariness of company crept over before have be out hour continued unceasingly to increase till stopped in pulteney street again induced in small degree to resist such high authority to distrust power of giving universal pleasure when arrived at mr allen door astonishment of isabella be hardly to be expressed on finding that be too late in day for to attend friend into house past three oclock be inconceivable incredible impossible must neither believe own watch brother servant must believe assurance of founded on reason reality till morland produced watch ascertained fact to have doubted moment longer then must have be equally inconceivable incredible impossible must only protest over over again that two hour half have ever gone off so swiftly before a catherine be called on to confirm catherine must not tell falsehood even to please isabella latter be spared misery of friend dissenting voice by not waiting for answer own feeling entirely engrossed wretchedness be most acute on finding obliged to go directly home be age since have have moment conversation with dearest catherine though have such thousand of thing to say to appeared a if be never to be together again so with smile of most exquisite misery laughing eye of utter despondency bade friend adieu went on

intelligence to give that be most particularly unfortunate in having missed meeting with brother sister must have foreseen such circumstance nothing must have persuaded to go out with others a be must only lament ill luck think over what have lost till be clear to that drive have by mean be very pleasant john thorpe be quite disagreeable chapter allen thorpe morlands met in evening at theatre a

meet miss tilney again continued in full force next morning till usual moment of going to pump room felt alarm from dread of second prevention nothing of kind occurred visitor appeared to delay three set off in good time for pump room where ordinary course of event conversation took place mr allen after drinking glass of water joined gentleman to talk over politics of day compare account of newspaper lady walked about together noticing new face almost new bonnet in room female part of thorpe family attended by james morland appeared among crowd in le than quarter of hour catherine immediately took usual place by side of friend james who be now in constant attendance maintained similar position separating from rest of party walked in manner for time till catherine began to doubt happiness of situation confining entirely to friend brother gave very little share in notice of be always engaged in sentimental discussion lively dispute sentiment be conveyed in such whispering voice vivacity attended with so much laughter that though catherine supporting opinion be not unfrequently called for by one other be never able to give from not having heard word of subject at length however be empowered to disengage from friend by avowed necessity of speaking to miss tilney whom most joyfully saw just entering room with mr hughes whom instantly joined with firmer determination to be acquainted than might have have courage to command have not be urged by disappointment of day before miss tilney met with great civility returned advance with equal goodwill continued talking together a long a party remained in room though in probability not observation be made expression used by have not be made used thousand of time before under roof in bath season yet merit of being spoken with simplicity truth without personal conceit might be something uncommon how well brother dance be artless exclamation of catherine towards close of conversation at once surprised amused companion henry replied with smile yes doe dance very well must have thought very odd to hear say be engaged other evening when saw sitting down really have be engaged whole day to mr thorpe miss

with knowledge of new acquaintance feeling on catherine without smallest consciousness of having explained went home very happy morning have answered hope evening of following day be now object of expectation future good what gown what head dress must wear on occasion became chief concern can not be justified in dress be at time frivolous distinction excessive solicitude about often destroys own aim catherine knew very well great aunt have read lecture on subject only christmas before yet lay awake ten minute on wednesday night debating between spotted tamboured muslin nothing shortness of time prevented buying new one for evening must have be error in judgment great though not uncommon from one of other sex rather than own brother rather than great aunt might have warned for man only can be aware of insensibility of man towards new gown must be mortifying to feeling of many lady must be made to understand how little heart of man be affected by what be costly new in attire how little be biased by texture of muslin how unsusceptible of peculiar tenderness towards spotted sprigged mull jackonet woman be fine for own satisfaction alone man will admire more woman will like better for neatness fashion be enough for former something of shabbiness impropriety will be most endearing to latter not one of grave reflection troubled tranquillity of catherine entered room on thursday evening with feeling very different from what have attended thither monday before have then be exulting in engagement to thorpe be now chiefly anxious to avoid sight lest must engage again for though must not dared not expect that mr tilney must ask third time to dance wish hope plan centred in nothing young lady may feel for heroine in critical moment for young lady have at time other known same agitation have be at least have believed to be in danger from pursuit of someone whom wished to avoid have be anxious for attention of someone whom wished to please a soon a be joined by thorpe catherine agony began fidgeted about if john thorpe came towards hid a much a possible from view when spoke to pretended not to hear cotillion be over country dancing beginning saw nothing of tilneys be frightened dear catherine whispered isabella be really going to dance with brother again declare positively be quite shocking tell ought to be ashamed of john must keep in countenance make haste dear creature come to john be just walked off will be back in moment catherine have time inclination to answer others walked away john thorpe be still in view gave up for lost that might not appear however to observe expect kept eye intently fixed on fan self condemnation for folly in supposing that among such crowd must even meet with tilneys in reasonable time have just passed through mind when suddenly found addressed again solicited to dance by mr tilney with what sparkling eye ready motion granted request with how pleasing flutter of heart went with to set may be easily imagined to escape a believed so narrowly escape john thorpe to be asked so immediately on joining asked by mr tilney a if have sought on purposeit did not appear to that life must supply greater felicity scarcely have worked into quiet possession of place however when attention be claimed by john thorpe who stood behind heyday miss morland said what be meaning of thought be to dance together wonder must think so for never asked be good one by jove asked a soon a came into room be just going to ask again when turned round be gone be cursed shabby trick only came for sake of dancing with firmly believe be engaged to ever since monday yes remember asked while be waiting in lobby for cloak here have be telling acquaintance be going to dance with prettiest girl in room when see standing up with somebody else will quiz famously oh will never think of after description a by heaven if will kick out of room for blockhead what chap have there catherine satisfied curiosity tilney repeated humi know good figure of man well put together doe want horse here be friend of mine sam fletcher have got one to sell must suit anybody famous clever animal for roadonly forty guinea have fifty mind to buy for be one of maxim always to buy good horse when meet with one must not answer purpose must not do for field must give money for real good hunter have three now best that ever be backed must not take eight hundred guinea for fletcher mean to get house in leicestershire against next season be so duncomfortable living at inn be last sentence by must weary catherine attention for be just then borne off by resistless pressure of long string of passing lady partner now drew near said that gentleman must have put out of patience have stayed with minute longer have business to withdraw attention of partner from have entered into contract of mutual agreeableness for space of evening agreeableness belongs solely to other for time nobody can fasten on notice of one without injuring right of other consider country dance a emblem of marriage fidelity complaisance be principal duty of men who choose to dance marry have business with partner wife of neighbour be such very different thing that think can not be compared together to be sure not people that marry can never part must go keep house together people that dance only stand opposite other in long room for hour such be definition of matrimony dancing taken in light certainly resemblance be not striking think must place in view will allow in man have advantage of choice woman only power of refusal that in be engagement between man woman formed for advantage of that when once entered into belong exclusively to other till moment of dissolution that be duty to endeavour to give other cause for wishing that have bestowed elsewhere best interest to keep own imagination from wandering towards perfection of neighbour fancying that must have be better off with anyone else will allow yes to be sure a state sound very well still be so very different can not look upon at in same light think same duty belong to in one respect there certainly be difference in marriage man be supposed to provide for support of woman woman to make home agreeable to man be to purvey be to smile in dancing duty be exactly changed agreeableness compliance be expected from while furnishes fan lavender water that suppose be difference of duty struck a rendering condition incapable of comparison indeed never thought of then be quite at loss one thing however must observe disposition on side be rather alarming totally disallow similarity in obligation may not thence infer that notion of duty of dancing state be not so strict a partner might wish have not reason to fear that if gentleman who spoke to just now be to return if other gentleman be to address there must be nothing to restrain from conversing with a long a chose mr thorpe be such very particular friend of brother that if talk to must talk to again there be hardly three young men in room besides have acquaintance with be to be only security ala ala nay be sure can not have better for if know anybody be impossible for to talk to besides want to talk to anybody now have given security worth having will proceed with courage do find bath a agreeable a when have honour of making inquiry before yes quitemore so indeed more so take care will forget to be tired of at proper time ought to be tired at end of six week think must be tired if be to stay here six month bath compared with london have little variety so everybody find out year for six week allow bath be pleasant enough beyond that be most tiresome place in world must be told so by people of description who come regularly winter lengthen six week into ten twelve go away at last because can afford to stay no longer well other people must judge for who go to london may think nothing of bath who live in small retired village in country can never find greater sameness in place a than in own home for here be variety of amusement variety of thing to be seen done day long can know nothing of there be not fond of country yes be have always lived there always be very happy certainly there be much more sameness in country life than in bath life one day in country be exactly like then spend time so much more rationally in country do do not believe there be much difference here be in pursuit only of amusement day long so be at homeonly find so much of walk about here so do there here see variety of people in street there can only go call on mr allen mr tilney be very much amused only go call on mr allen repeated what picture of intellectual poverty however when sink into abyss again will have more to say will be able to talk of bath of that did here oh yes will

here conversation closed demand of dance becoming now too importunate for divided attention soon after reaching bottom of set catherine perceived to be earnestly regarded by gentleman who stood among looker on immediately behind partner be very handsome man of commanding aspect past bloom not past vigour of life with eye still directed towards saw presently address mr tilney in familiar whisper confused by notice blushing from fear of being excited by something wrong in appearance turned away head while did so gentleman retreated partner coming nearer said see that guess what have just be asked that gentleman know name have right to know be general tilney father catherine answer be only ohbut be oh expressing everything needful attention to word perfect reliance on truth with real interest strong admiration did eye now follow general a moved through crowd how handsome family be be secret remark in chatting with miss tilney before evening concluded new source of felicity arose to have never taken country walk since arrival in bath miss tilney to whom commonly frequented environs be familiar spoke of in term made eagerness to know too on openly fearing that might find nobody to go with be proposed by brother sister that must join in walk morning other will like cried beyond anything in world let put offlet go tomorrow be readily agreed to with only proviso of miss tilneys that did not rain catherine be sure must not at twelve oclock be to call for in pulteney street remembertwelve oclock be parting speech to new friend of other older more established friend isabella of whose fidelity worth have enjoyed fortnight experience scarcely saw anything during evening yet though longing to make acquainted with happiness cheerfully submitted to wish of mr allen took rather early away spirit danced within a danced in chair way home chapter morrow brought very sober looking morning sun making only few effort to appear catherine augured from everything most favourable to wish bright morning so early in year allowed must generally turn to rain cloudy one foretold improvement a day advanced applied to mr allen for confirmation of hope mr allen not having own sky barometer about declined giving absolute promise of sunshine applied to mr allen mr allen opinion be more positive have doubt in world of being very fine day if cloud must only go off sun keep out at about eleven oclock however few speck of small rain upon window caught catherine watchful eye oh dear do believe will be wet broke from in most desponding tone thought how must be said mr allen walk for today sighed catherine perhaps may come to nothing may hold up before twelve perhaps may then dear will be so dirty oh will not signify never mind dirt replied friend very placidly know never mind dirt after short pause come on faster faster said catherine a stood watching at window so doe indeed if keep raining street will be very wet there be four umbrella up already how hate sight of umbrella be disagreeable thing to carry must much rather take chair at time be such nice looking morning felt so convinced must be dry anybody must have thought so indeed there will be very few people in pump room if rain morning hope mr allen will put on greatcoat when go dare say will not for have rather do anything in world than walk out in greatcoat wonder must dislike must be so comfortable rain continuedfast though not heavy catherine went five minute to clock threatening on return that if still kept on raining five minute must give up matter a hopeless clock struck twelve still rained will not be able to go dear quite despair yet will not give up till quarter after twelve be just time of day for to clear up do think look little lighter there be twenty minute after twelve now will give up entirely oh that have such weather here a have at udolpho at least in tuscany south of francethe night poor st aubin diedsuch beautiful weather at half past twelve when catherine anxious attention to weather be over must no longer claim merit from amendment sky began voluntarily to clear gleam of sunshine took quite by surprise looked round cloud be parting instantly returned to window to watch over encourage happy appearance ten minute more made certain that bright afternoon must succeed justified opinion of mr allen who have always thought must clear up whether catherine might still expect friend whether there have not be too much rain for miss tilney to venture must yet be question be too dirty for mr allen to accompany husband to pump room accordingly set off by catherine have barely watched down street when notice be claimed by approach of same two open carriage containing same three people have surprised so much few morning back isabella brother mr thorpe declare be coming for perhapsbut will not goi can not go indeed for know miss tilney may still call mr allen agreed to john thorpe be soon with voice be with yet sooner for on stair be calling out to

not go with today because be engaged expect friend moment be of course vehemently talked down a reason at mr allen be called on to second two others walked in to give assistance sweetest catherine be not delightful will have most heavenly drive be to thank brother for scheme darted into head at breakfast time verily believe at same instant must have be off two hour ago if have not be for detestable rain doe not signify night be moonlight will do delightfully oh be in such ecstasy at thought of little country air quiet so much better than going to lower room will drive directly to clifton dine there a soon a dinner be over if there be time for go on to kingsweston doubt being able to do so much said morland croaking fellow cried thorpe will be able to do ten time more kingsweston aye blaize castle too anything else can hear of here be sister say will not go blaize castle cried catherine what be that finest place in englandworth going fifty mile at time to see what be really castle old castle oldest in kingdom be like what one read of exactlythe very same now reallyare there tower long gallery by dozen then must like to see cannoti can not go not go beloved creature what do mean can not go becauselooking down a spoke fearful of isabella smilei expect miss tilney brother to call on to take country walk promised to come at twelve only rained now a be so

dearest catherine can not form idea of dirt come must go can not refuse going now must like to see castle may go over may go up staircase into suite of room yes yes hole corner then if must only be gone out for hour till be dryer call by by make easy there be danger of for heard tilney hallooing to man who be just passing by on horseback that be going a far a wick rock then will will go mr allen just a please dear mr allen must persuade to go be general cry mr allen be not inattentive to well dear said suppose go in two minute be off catherine feeling a got into carriage be in very unsettled state divided between regret for loss of one great pleasure hope of soon enjoying almost equal in degree however unlike in kind must not think tilneys have acted quite well by in so readily giving up engagement without sending message of excuse be now hour later than time fixed on for beginning of walk in spite of what have heard of prodigious accumulation of dirt in course of hour must not from own observation help thinking that might have gone with very little inconvenience to feel slighted by be very painful on other hand delight of exploring edifice like udolpho a fancy represented blaize castle to be be such counterpoise of good a might console for almost anything passed briskly down pulteney street through laura place without exchange of many word thorpe talked to horse meditated by turn on broken promise broken arch phaeton false hanging tilneys trap door a entered argyle building however be roused by address from companion who be that girl who looked at so hard a went by who where on right hand pavementshe must be almost out of sight now catherine looked round saw miss tilney leaning on brother arm walking slowly down street saw looking back at stop stop mr thorpe impatiently cried be miss tilney be indeed how must tell be gone stop stop will get out moment go to to what purpose did speak thorpe only lashed horse into brisker trot tilneys who have soon ceased to look after be in moment out of sight round corner of laura place in moment be whisked into marketplace still however during length of street entreated to stop pray pray stop mr thorpe can not go on will not go on must go back to miss tilney mr thorpe only laughed smacked whip encouraged horse made odd noise drove on catherine angry vexed a be having power of getting away be obliged to give up point submit reproach however be not spared how must deceive so mr thorpe how must say that saw driving up lansdown road must not have have happen so for world must think so strange so rude of to go by too without saying word know how vexed be will have pleasure at clifton in anything else have rather ten thousand time rather get out now walk back to how must say saw driving out in phaeton thorpe defended very stoutly declared have never seen two men so much alike in life must hardly give up point of having be tilney drive even when subject be over be not likely to be very agreeable catherine complaisance be no longer what have be in former airing listened reluctantly reply be short blaize castle remained only comfort towards that still looked at interval with pleasure though rather than be disappointed of promised walk especially rather than be thought ill of by tilneys must willingly have given up happiness wall must supplythe happiness of progress through long suite of lofty room exhibiting remains of magnificent furniture though now for many year desertedthe happiness of being stopped in way along narrow winding vault by low grated door even of having lamp only lamp extinguished by sudden gust of wind of being left in total darkness in meanwhile proceeded on journey without mischance be within view of town of keynsham when halloo from morland who be behind made friend pull up to know what be matter others then came close enough for conversation morland said have better go back thorpe be too late to go on today sister think so a well a have be exactly hour coming from pulteney street very little more than seven mile suppose have at least eight more to go will never do set out great deal too late have much better put off till day turn round be one to replied thorpe rather angrily instantly turning horse be on way back to bath if brother have not got dbeast to drive said soon afterwards might have done very well horse must have trotted to clifton within hour if left to have almost broke arm with pulling in to cursed broken winded jade pace morland be fool for not keeping horse gig of own be not said catherine warmly for be sure must not afford why can not afford because have not money enough whose fault be that nobody that know of thorpe then said something in loud incoherent way to have often recourse about being dthing to be miserly that if people who rolled in money must not afford thing did not know who must catherine did not even endeavour to understand disappointed of what be to have be consolation for first disappointment be le le disposed to be agreeable to find companion so returned to pulteney street without speaking twenty word a entered house footman told that gentleman lady have called inquired for few minute after setting off when told be gone out with mr thorpe lady have asked whether message have be left for on saying have felt for card said have none about went away pondering over heart rending tidings catherine walked slowly upstairs at head of be met by mr allen who on hearing reason of speedy return said be glad brother have so much sense be glad be come back be strange wild scheme spent evening together at thorpe catherine be disturbed out of spirit isabella seemed to find pool of commerce in fate of shared by private partnership with morland very good equivalent for quiet country air of inn at clifton satisfaction too in not being at lower room be spoken more than once how pity poor creature be going there how glad be be not amongst wonder whether will be full ball not have not begun dancing yet must not be there for world be so delightful to have evening now then to dare say will not be very good ball know mitchell will not be there be sure pity everybody be dare say mr morland long to be at be sure do well pray let anybody here be restraint on dare say must do very well without men think yourselves of such consequence catherine must almost have accused isabella of being wanting in tenderness towards sorrow so very little did appear to dwell on mind so very inadequate be comfort offered be so dull dearest creature whispered will quite break heart be amazingly shocking to be sure tilneys be entirely to blame why be not more punctual be dirty indeed what did signify be sure john must not have minded never mind going through anything where friend be concerned that be disposition john be just same have amazing strong feeling good heaven what delightful hand have got king vow never be so happy in life must fifty time rather must have than now may dismiss heroine to sleepless couch be true heroine portion to pillow strewed with thorn wet with tear lucky may think if get good night rest in course of next three month chapter mr allen said catherine next morning will there be harm in calling on miss tilney today will not be easy till have explained everything go by mean dear only put on white gown miss tilney always wear white catherine cheerfully complied being properly equipped be more impatient than ever to be at pump room that might inform herself of general tilneys lodging for though believed be in milsom street be not certain of house mr allen wavering conviction only made more doubtful to milsom street be directed having made perfect in number hastened away with eager step beating heart to pay visit explain conduct be forgiven tripping lightly through church yard resolutely turning away eye that might not be obliged to see beloved isabella dear family who have reason to believe be in shop hard by reached house without impediment looked at number knocked at door inquired for miss tilney man believed miss tilney to be at home be not quite certain must be pleased to send up name gave card in few minute servant returned with look did not quite confirm word said have be mistaken for miss tilney be walked out catherine with blush of mortification left house felt almost persuaded that miss tilney be at home too much offended to admit a retired down street must not withhold one glance at drawing room window in expectation of seeing there one appeared at at bottom of street however looked back again then not at window issuing from door saw miss tilney be followed by gentleman whom catherine believed to be father turned up towards edgar building catherine in deep mortification proceeded on way must almost be angry at such angry incivility checked resentful sensation remembered own ignorance knew not how such offence a hers might be classed by law of worldly politeness to what degree of unforgivingness might with propriety lead to what rigour of rudeness in return might justly make amenable dejected humbled have even thought of not going with others to theatre night must be confessed that be not of long continuance for soon recollected in first place that be without excuse for staying at home in second that be play wanted very much to see to theatre accordingly went tilneys appeared to plague please feared that amongst many perfection of family fondness for play be not to be ranked perhaps be because be habituated to finer performance of london stage knew on isabella authority rendered everything else of kind quite horrid be not deceived in own expectation of pleasure comedy so well suspended care that one observing during first four act must have supposed have wretchedness about on beginning of fifth however sudden view of mr henry tilney father joining party in opposite box recalled to anxiety distress stage must no longer excite genuine merrimentno longer keep whole attention other look upon average be directed towards opposite box for space of two entire scene did thus watch henry tilney without being once able to catch eye no longer must be suspected of indifference for play notice be never withdrawn from stage during two whole scene at length however did look towards bowedbut bow smile continued observance attended eye be immediately returned to former direction catherine be restlessly miserable must almost have run round to box in sat forced to hear explanation feeling rather natural than heroic possessed instead of considering own dignity injured by ready condemnationinstead of proudly resolving in conscious innocence to show resentment towards who must harbour doubt of to leave to trouble of seeking explanation to enlighten on past only by avoiding sight flirting with somebody elseshe took to herself shame of misconduct at least of appearance be only eager for opportunity of explaining cause play concludedthe curtain fellhenry tilney be no longer to be seen where have hitherto sat father remained perhaps might be now coming round to box be right in few minute appeared making way through then thinning row spoke with like calm politeness to mr allen friend not with such calmness be answered by latter oh mr tilney have be quite wild to speak to make apology must have thought so rude indeed be not own fault be mr allen did not tell that mr tilney sister be gone out in phaeton together then what must do have ten thousand time rather have be with now have not mr allen dear tumble gown be mr allen reply assurance however standing sole a did be not thrown away brought more cordial more natural smile into countenance replied in tone retained only little affected reserve be much obliged to at rate for wishing pleasant walk after passing in argyle street be so kind a to look back on purpose indeed did not wish pleasant walk never thought of such thing begged mr thorpe so earnestly to stop called out to a soon a ever saw now mr allen did notoh be not there indeed did if mr thorpe must only have stopped must have jumped out run after be there henry in world who must be insensible to declaration henry tilney at least be not with yet sweeter smile said everything need be said of sister concern regret dependence on catherine honour oh say miss tilney be not angry cried catherine because know be for must not see morning when called saw walk out of house next minute after leaving be hurt be not affronted perhaps did not know have be there be not within at time heard of from eleanor have be wishing ever since to see to explain reason of such incivility perhaps can do a well be nothing more than fatherthey be just preparing to walk out being hurried for time not caring to have put offmade point of being denied be do assure be very much vexed meant to make apology a soon a possible catherine mind be greatly eased by information yet something of solicitude remained from sprang following question thoroughly artless in though rather distressing to gentleman mr tilney why be le generous than sister if felt such confidence in good intention must suppose to be only mistake why must be so ready to take offence take offence nay be sure by look when came into box be angry angry must have right well nobody must have thought have right who saw face replied by asking to make room for talking of play remained with time be only too agreeable for catherine to be contented when went away before parted however be agreed that projected walk must be taken a soon a possible setting aside misery of quitting box be upon whole left one of happiest creature in world while talking to other have observed with surprise john thorpe who be never in same part of house for ten minute together be engaged in conversation with general tilney felt something more than surprise when thought must perceive object of attention discourse what must have to say of feared general tilney did not like appearance found be implied in preventing admittance to daughter rather than postpone own walk few minute how came mr thorpe to know father be anxious inquiry a pointed out to companion knew nothing about father like military man have very large acquaintance when entertainment be over thorpe came to assist in getting out catherine be immediate object of gallantry while waited in lobby for chair prevented inquiry have travelled from heart almost to tip of tongue by asking in consequential manner whether have seen talking with general tilney be fine old fellow upon soul stout activelooks a young a son have great regard for assure gentleman like good sort of fellow a ever lived how came to know know there be few people much about town know have met forever at bedford knew face again today moment came into billiard room one of best player have by by have little touch together though be almost afraid of at first odds be five to four against if have not made one of cleanest stroke that perhaps ever be made in worldi took ball exactlybut must not make understand without table however did beat very fine fellow a rich a jew must like to dine with dare say give famous dinner what do think have be talking of yes by heaven general think finest girl in bath oh nonsense how can say so what do think saidlowering voicewell done general said be quite of mind here catherine who be much le gratified by admiration than by general tilneys be not sorry to be called away by mr allen thorpe however must see to chair till entered continued same kind of delicate flattery in spite of entreating to have done general tilney instead of disliking must admire be very delightful joyfully thought that there be not one of family whom need now fear to meet evening have done more much more for than must have be expected chapter monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday saturday have now passed in review before reader event of day hope fear mortification pleasure have be separately stated pang of sunday only now remain to be described close week clifton scheme have be deferred not relinquished on afternoon crescent of day be brought forward again in private consultation between isabella james former of whom have particularly set heart upon going latter le anxiously placed upon pleasing be agreed that provided weather be fair party must take place on following morning be to set off very early in order to be at home in good time affair thus determined thorpe approbation secured catherine only remained to be apprised of have left for few minute to speak to miss tilney in interval plan be completed a soon a came again agreement be demanded instead of gay acquiescence expected by isabella catherine looked grave be very sorry must not go engagement ought to have kept from joining in former attempt must make impossible for to accompany now have that moment settled with miss tilney to take proposed walk tomorrow be quite determined must not upon account retract that must must retract be instantly eager cry of thorpe must go to clifton tomorrow must not go without must be nothing to put off mere walk for one day longer must not hear of refusal catherine be distressed not subdued urge isabella be engaged to miss tilney can not go availed nothing same argument assailed again must go must go must not hear of refusal must be so easy to tell miss tilney that have just be reminded of prior engagement must only beg to put off walk till tuesday must not be easy must not do there have be prior engagement isabella became only more more urgent calling on in most affectionate manner addressing by most endearing name be sure dearest sweetest catherine must not seriously refuse such trifling request to friend who loved so dearly knew beloved catherine to have so feeling heart so sweet temper to be so easily persuaded by loved in vain catherine felt to be in right though pained by such tender such flattering supplication must not allow to influence isabella then tried method reproached with having more affection for miss tilney though have known so little while than for best oldest friend with being grown cold indifferent in short towards can not help being jealous catherine when see slighted for stranger who love so excessively when once affection be placed be not in power of anything to change believe feeling be stronger than anybodys be sure be too strong for own peace to see supplanted in friendship by stranger doe cut to quick own tilneys seem to swallow up everything else catherine thought reproach equally strange unkind be part of friend thus to expose feeling to notice of others isabella appeared to ungenerous selfish regardless of everything own gratification painful idea crossed mind though said nothing isabella in meanwhile have applied handkerchief to eye morland miserable at sight must not help saying nay catherine think can not stand out longer now sacrifice be not much to oblige friendi will think quite unkind if still refuse be first time of brother openly siding against anxious to avoid displeasure proposed compromise if must only put off scheme till tuesday might easily do a depended only on must go with everybody might then be satisfied be immediate answer must not be for thorpe did not know that might not go to town on tuesday catherine be sorry must do more short silence ensued be broken by isabella who in voice of cold resentment said very well then there be end of party if catherine doe not go can not can not be only woman must not upon account in world do so improper thing catherine must go said james why can not mr thorpe drive one of other sister dare say of must like to go thank ye cried thorpe did not come to bath to drive sister about look like fool no if go d if do only go for sake of driving be compliment give pleasure word be lost on thorpe who have turned abruptly away three others still continued together walking in most uncomfortable manner to poor catherine sometimes not word be said sometimes be again attacked with supplication reproach arm be still linked within isabella though heart be at war at one moment be softened at irritated always distressed always steady did not think have be so obstinate catherine said james be not used to be so hard to persuade once be kindest best tempered of sister hope be not le so now replied very feelingly indeed can not go if be wrong be doing what believe to be right suspect said isabella in low voice there be great struggle catherine heart swelled drew away arm isabella made opposition thus passed long ten minute till be again joined by thorpe who coming to with gayer look said well have settled matter now may go tomorrow with safe conscience have be to miss tilney made excuse have not cried catherine have upon soul left moment told have sent to say that having just recollected prior engagement of going to clifton with tomorrow must not have pleasure of walking with till tuesday said very well tuesday be just a convenient to so there be end of difficulty pretty good thought of minehey isabella countenance be once more smile good humour james too looked happy again most heavenly thought indeed now sweet catherine distress be over be honourably acquitted will have most delightful party will not do said catherine can not submit to must run after miss tilney directly set right isabella however caught hold of one hand thorpe of other remonstrance poured in from three even james be quite angry when everything be settled when miss tilney herself said that tuesday must suit a well be quite ridiculous quite absurd to make further objection care mr thorpe have business to invent such message if have thought right to put off must have spoken to miss tilney be only doing in ruder way how do know that mr thorpe hashe may be mistaken again perhaps led into one act of rudeness by mistake on friday let go mr thorpe isabella hold thorpe told must be in vain to go after tilneys be turning corner into brock street when have overtaken be at home by time then will go after said catherine wherever be will go after doe not signify talking if must not be persuaded into doing what thought wrong never will be tricked into with word broke away hurried off thorpe must have darted after morland withheld let go let go if will go be a obstinate a thorpe never finished simile for must hardly have be proper one away walked catherine in great agitation a fast a crowd must permit fearful of being pursued yet determined to persevere a walked reflected on what have passed be painful to to disappoint displease particularly to displease brother must not repent resistance setting own inclination apart to have failed second time in engagement to miss tilney to have retracted promise voluntarily made only five minute before on false pretence too must have be wrong have not be withstanding on selfish principle alone have not consulted merely own gratification might have be ensured in degree by excursion by seeing blaize castle have attended to what be due to others to own character in opinion conviction of being right however be not enough to restore composure till have spoken to miss tilney must not be at ease quickening pace when got clear of crescent almost ran over remaining ground till gained top of milsom street so rapid have be movement that in spite of tilneys advantage in outset be just turning into lodging a came within view of servant still remaining at open door used only ceremony of saying that must speak with miss tilney moment hurrying by proceeded upstairs then opening first door before happened to be right immediately found in drawing room with general tilney son daughter explanation defective only in beingfrom irritation of nerve shortness of breathno

necessary have often wondered at person courage must sit down on purpose to do little boy girl must be tormented said henry be what one at acquainted with human nature in civilized state can deny in behalf of most distinguished historian must observe that might well be offended at being supposed to have higher aim that by method style be perfectly well qualified to torment reader of most advanced reason mature time of life use verb to torment a observed to be own method instead of to instruct supposing to be now admitted a synonymous think foolish to call instruction torment if have be a much used a to hear poor little child first learning letter then learning to spell if have ever seen how stupid can be for whole morning together how tired poor mother be at end of a be in habit of seeing almost day of life at home must allow to torment to instruct might sometimes be used a synonymous word very probably historian be not accountable for difficulty of learning to read even who altogether

return without spending many hour in examination of feeling that have gone to appointment preparing for happiness have not afforded instead of finding improved in acquaintance with miss tilney from intercourse of day seemed hardly so intimate with a before instead of seeing henry tilney to greater advantage than ever in ease of family party have never said so little be so little agreeable in spite of father great civility to herin spite of thanks invitation complimentsit have be release to get away from puzzled to account for must not be general tilneys fault that be perfectly agreeable good natured altogether very charming man did not admit of doubt for be tall handsome henry father must not be accountable for childrens want of spirit for want of enjoyment in company former hoped at last might have be accidental latter must only attribute to own stupidity isabella on hearing particular of visit gave different explanation be pride pride insufferable haughtiness pride have long suspected family to be very high made certain such insolence of behaviour a miss tilneys have never heard of in life not to do honour of house with common good breeding to behave to guest with such superciliousness hardly even to speak to be not so bad a isabella there be superciliousness be very civil oh dont defend then brother who have appeared so attached to good heaven well people feeling

man john think very well of john judgment well will see how behave to evening will meet at room must go intend thought be settled nay since make such point of can refuse nothing insist upon being very agreeable for heart know will be forty mile off a for dancing mention beg be quite out of question charles hodges will plague to death dare say will cut very short ten to one guess reason be exactly what want to avoid so will insist on keeping conjecture to isabella opinion of tilneys did not influence friend be sure there have be insolence in manner of brother sister did not credit there being pride in heart evening rewarded confidence be met by one with same kindness by other with same attention a heretofore miss tilney took pain to be near henry asked to dance having heard day before in milsom street that elder brother captain tilney be expected almost hour be at loss for name of very fashionable looking handsome young man whom have never seen before who now evidently belonged to party looked at with great admiration even supposed possible that people might think handsomer than brother though in eye air be more assuming countenance le prepossessing taste manner be beyond doubt decidedly inferior for within hearing not only protested against thought of dancing even laughed openly at henry for finding possible from latter circumstance may be presumed that might be heroine opinion of admiration of be not of very dangerous kind not likely to produce animosity between brother persecution to lady can not be instigator of three villain in horseman greatcoat by whom will hereafter be forced into traveling chaise four will drive off with incredible speed catherine meanwhile undisturbed by presentiment of such evil of evil at except of having short set to dance down enjoyed usual happiness with henry tilney listening with sparkling eye to everything said in finding irresistible becoming so at end of first dance captain tilney came towards again much to catherine dissatisfaction pulled brother away retired whispering together though delicate sensibility did not take immediate alarm lay down a fact that captain tilney must have heard malevolent misrepresentation of now hastened to communicate to brother in hope of separating forever must not have partner conveyed from sight without very uneasy sensation suspense be of full five minute duration be beginning to think very long quarter of hour when returned explanation be given by henry requesting to know if thought friend miss thorpe must have objection to dancing a brother must be most happy to be introduced to catherine without hesitation replied that be very sure miss thorpe did not mean to dance at cruel reply be passed on to other immediately walked away brother will not mind know said because heard say before hated dancing be very good natured in to think of suppose saw isabella sitting down fancied might wish for partner be quite mistaken for must not dance upon account in world henry smiled said how very little trouble can give to understand motive of other people action why what do mean with be not how be such one likely to be influenced what be inducement most likely to act upon such person feeling age situation probable habit of life consideredbut how must be influenced what must be inducement in acting so so understand then be on very unequal term for understand perfectly well yes can not speak well enough to be unintelligible bravo excellent satire on modern language pray tell what mean will indeed do really desire be not aware of consequence will involve in very cruel embarrassment certainly bring on disagreement between no will not do either be not afraid well then only meant that attributing brother wish of dancing with miss thorpe to good nature alone convinced of being superior in good nature to rest of world catherine blushed disclaimed gentleman prediction be verified there be something however in word repaid for pain of confusion that something occupied mind so much that drew back for time forgetting to speak to listen almost forgetting where be till roused by voice of isabella looked up saw with captain tilney preparing to give hand across isabella shrugged shoulder smiled only explanation of extraordinary change must at time be given a be not quite enough for catherine comprehension spoke astonishment in very plain term to partner can not think how must happen isabella be so determined not to dance did isabella never change mind before oh becauseand brother after what told from how must think of going to ask can not take surprise to myself on head bid be surprised on friend account therefore be a for brother conduct in business must own have be no more than believed perfectly equal to fairness of friend be open attraction firmness know must only be understood by be laughing assure isabella be very firm in general be a much a must be said of anyone to be always firm must be to be often obstinate when properly to relax be trial of judgment without reference to brother really think miss thorpe have by mean chosen ill in fixing on present hour friend be not able to get together for confidential discourse till dancing be over then a walked about room arm in arm isabella thus explained wonder at surprise be really fatigued to death be such rattle amusing enough if mind have be disengaged must have given world to sit still then why did not oh dear must have looked so particular know how abhor doing refused a long a possibly must must take denial have idea how pressed begged to excuse get other partnerbut not after aspiring to hand there be nobody else in room must bear to think of be not that wanted merely to dance wanted to be with oh such nonsense told have taken very unlikely way to prevail upon for of thing in world hated fine speech compliment soand so then found there must be peace if did not stand up besides thought mr hughes who introduced might take ill if did not dear brother be sure must have be miserable if have sat down whole evening be so glad be over spirit be quite jaded with listening to nonsense then being such smart young fellow saw eye be upon be very handsome indeed handsome yes suppose may dare say people must admire in general be not at all in style of beauty hate florid complexion dark eye in man however be very well amazingly

bath than modesty such a yoursbut not for world must pain by open praise if can be induced to honour with visit will make happy beyond expression ti true can offer nothing like gaiety of lively place can tempt neither by amusement splendour for mode of living a see be plain unpretending yet endeavour will be wanting on side to make northanger abbey not wholly disagreeable northanger abbey be thrilling word wound up catherine feeling to highest point of ecstasy grateful gratified heart must hardly restrain expression within language of tolerable calmness to receive so flattering invitation to have company so warmly solicited everything honourable soothing present enjoyment future hope be contained in acceptance with only saving clause of papa mamma approbation be eagerly given will write home directly said if object a dare say will not general tilney be not le sanguine having already waited on excellent friend in pulteney street obtained sanction of wish since can consent to part with said may expect philosophy from world miss tilney be earnest though gentle in secondary civility affair became in few minute a nearly settled a necessary reference to fullerton must allow circumstance of morning have led catherine feeling through variety of suspense security disappointment be now safely lodged in perfect bliss with spirit elated to rapture with henry at heart northanger abbey on lip hurried home to write letter mr mr morland relying on discretion of friend to whom have already entrusted daughter felt doubt of propriety of acquaintance have be formed under eye sent therefore by return of post ready consent to visit in gloucestershire indulgence though not more than catherine have hoped for completed conviction of being favoured beyond other human

court cottage northanger turned up abbey be to be inhabitant long damp passage narrow cell ruined chapel be to be within daily reach must not entirely subdue hope of traditional legend awful memorial of injured ill fated nun be wonderful that friend must seem so little elated by possession of such home that consciousness of must be so meekly borne power of early habit only must account for distinction to have be born gave pride superiority of abode be more to than superiority of person many be inquiry be eager to make of miss tilney so active be thought that when inquiry be answered be hardly more assured than before of northanger abbey having be richly endowed convent at time of reformation of having fallen into hand of ancestor of tilneys on dissolution of large portion of ancient building still making part of present dwelling although rest be decayed of standing low in valley sheltered from north east by rising wood of oak chapter with mind thus full of happiness catherine be hardly aware that two three day have passed away without seeing isabella for more than few minute together began first to be sensible of to sigh for conversation a walked along pump room one morning by mr allen side without anything to say to hear scarcely have felt five minute longing of friendship before object of appeared inviting to secret conference led way to seat be favourite place said a sat down on bench between door commanded tolerable view of everybody entering at be so out of way catherine observing that isabella eye be continually bent towards one door other a in eager expectation remembering how often have be falsely accused of being arch thought present fine opportunity for being really so therefore gaily said be uneasy isabella james will soon be here psha dear creature replied think simpleton a to be always wanting to confine to elbow must be hideous to be always together must be jest of place so be going to northanger be amazingly glad of be one of finest old place in england understand will depend upon most particular description of will certainly have best in power to give who be looking for be sister coming be not looking for anybody one eye must be somewhere know what foolish trick have of fixing mine when thought be hundred mile off be amazingly absent believe be most absent creature in world tilney say be always case with mind of certain stamp thought isabella have something in particular to tell oh yes so have here be proof of what be saying poor head have quite forgot well thing be have just have letter from john can guess content indeed can not sweet love be so abominably affected what can write about know be over head ear in love with with dear isabella nay sweetest catherine be being quite absurd modesty be very well in way really little common honesty be sometimes quite a becoming have idea of being so overstrained be fishing for compliment attention be such a child must have noticed be hour before left bath that gave most positive encouragement say so in letter say that a good a made offer that received advance in kindest way now want to urge suit say manner of pretty thing to so be in vain to affect ignorance catherine with earnestness of truth expressed astonishment at charge protesting innocence of thought of mr thorpe being in love with consequent impossibility of having ever intended to encourage a to attention on side do declare upon honour never be sensible of for momentexcept just asking to dance first day of coming a to making offer anything like there must be unaccountable mistake must not have misunderstood thing of kind know a ever wish to be believed solemnly protest that syllable of such nature ever passed between last half hour before went away must be completely mistakefor did not see once that whole morning that certainly did for spent whole morning in edgar buildingsit be day father consent cameand be pretty sure that john be alone in parlour time before left house be well if say be so dare saybut for life of can not recollect do remember now being with seeing a well a restbut that be ever alone for five minuteshowever be not worth arguing about for might pas on side must be convinced by having recollection of that never thought expected wished for anything of kind from be excessively concerned that must have regard for mebut indeed have be quite unintentional on side never have smallest idea of pray undeceive a soon a can tell beg pardonthat isi know what ought to saybut make understand what mean in properest way must not speak disrespectfully of brother of yours isabella be sure know very well that if must think of one man more than anotherhe be not person isabella be silent dear friend must not be angry with can not suppose brother care so very much about know will still be sister yes yes with blush there be more way than one of being sister where be wandering to well dear catherine case seems to be that be determined against poor johnis not so certainly can not return affection a certainly never meant to encourage since be case be sure will not tease further john desired to speak to on subject therefore have confess a soon a read letter thought very foolish imprudent business not likely to promote good of for what be to live upon supposing came together have of something to be sure be not trifle will support family nowadays after that romancers may say there be doing without money only wonder john must think of must not have received last do acquit then of anything wrongyou be convinced that never meant to deceive brother never suspected of liking till moment oh a to answered isabella laughingly pretend to determine what thought design in time past may have be be best known to yourself little harmless flirtation so will occur one be often drawn on to give more encouragement than one wish to stand by may be assured that be last person in world to judge severely thing must be allowed for in youth high spirit what one mean one day know one may not mean next circumstance change opinion alter opinion of brother never did alter be always same be describing what never happened dearest catherine continued other without at listening to must not for world be mean of hurrying into engagement before knew what be about think anything must justify in wishing to sacrifice happiness merely to oblige brother because be brother who perhaps after know might be just a happy without for people seldom know what must be at young men especially be so amazingly changeable inconstant what say be why must brother happiness be dearer to than friend know carry notion of friendship pretty high above thing dear catherine be in hurry take word for that if be in too great hurry will certainly live to repent tilney say there be nothing people be so often deceived in a state of own affection believe be very right ah here come never mind will not see be sure catherine looking up perceived captain tilney isabella earnestly fixing eye on a spoke soon caught notice approached immediately took seat to movement invited first address made catherine start though spoken low must distinguish what always to be watched in person by proxy psha nonsense be isabella answer in same half whisper why do put such thing into head if must believe itmy spirit know be pretty independent wish heart be independent must be enough for heart indeed what can have to do with heart men have none of heart if have not heart have eye give torment enough do be sorry for be sorry find anything so disagreeable in will look way hope plea turning back on hope eye be not tormented now never more so for edge of blooming cheek be still in viewat once too much too little catherine heard quite out of countenance must listen no longer amazed that isabella must endure jealous for brother rose up saying must join mr allen proposed walking for isabella showed inclination be so amazingly tired be so odious to parade about pump room if moved from seat must miss sister be expecting sister moment so that dearest catherine must excuse must sit quietly down again catherine must be stubborn too mr allen just then coming up to propose returning home joined walked out of pump room leaving isabella still sitting with captain tilney with much uneasiness did thus leave seemed to captain tilney be falling in love with isabella isabella unconsciously encouraging unconsciously must be for isabella attachment to james be a certain well acknowledged a engagement to doubt truth good intention be impossible yet during whole of conversation manner have be odd wished isabella have talked more like usual self not so much about money have not looked so well pleased at sight of captain tilney how strange that must not perceive admiration catherine longed to give hint of to put on guard prevent pain too lively behaviour might otherwise create for brother compliment of john thorpe affection did not make amends for thoughtlessness in sister be almost a far from believing a from wishing to be sincere for have not forgotten that must mistake assertion of offer of encouragement convinced that mistake must sometimes be very egregious in vanity therefore gained little chief profit be in wonder that must think worth while to fancy in love with be matter of lively astonishment isabella talked of attention have never be sensible of isabella have said many thing hoped have be spoken in haste must never be said again upon be glad to rest altogether for present ease comfort chapter few day passed away catherine though not allowing to suspect friend must not help watching closely result of observation be not agreeable isabella seemed altered creature when saw indeed surrounded only by immediate friend in edgar building pulteney street change of manner be so trifling that have gone farther might have passed unnoticed something of languid indifference of boasted absence of mind catherine have never heard of before must occasionally come across have nothing worse appeared that might only have spread new grace inspired warmer interest when catherine saw in public admitting captain tilneys attention a readily a be offered allowing almost equal share with james in notice smile alteration became too positive to be passed over what must be meant by such unsteady conduct what friend must be at be beyond comprehension isabella must not be aware of pain be inflicting be degree of wilful thoughtlessness catherine must not resent james be sufferer saw grave uneasy however careless of present comfort woman might be who have given heart to be always object for poor captain tilney too be greatly concerned though look did not please name be passport to goodwill thought with sincere compassion of approaching disappointment for in spite of what have believed to overhear in pump room behaviour be so incompatible with knowledge of isabella engagement that must not upon reflection imagine aware of might be jealous of brother a rival if more have seemed implied fault must have be in misapprehension wished by gentle remonstrance to remind isabella of situation make aware of double unkindness for remonstrance opportunity comprehension be always against if able to suggest hint isabella must never understand in distress intended departure of tilney family became chief consolation journey into gloucestershire be to take place within few day captain tilneys removal must at least restore peace to heart own captain tilney have at present intention of removing be not to be of party to northanger be to continue at bath when catherine knew resolution be directly made spoke to henry tilney on subject regretting brother evident partiality for miss thorpe entreating to make known prior engagement brother doe know be henry answer doe then why doe stay here made reply be beginning to talk of something else eagerly continued why persuade to go away longer stay worse will be for at last pray advise for own sake for everybodys sake to leave bath directly absence will in time make comfortable again can have hope here be only staying to be miserable henry smiled said be sure brother must not wish to do then will persuade to go away persuasion be not at command pardon if can not even endeavour to persuade have told that miss thorpe be engaged know what be about must be own master no doe not know what be about cried catherine doe not know pain be giving brother not james have ever told so be sure be very uncomfortable be sure be brother doing yes very sure be brother attention to miss thorpe miss thorpe admission of give pain be not same thing think mr morland must acknowledge difference man be offended by man admiration of woman love be woman only who can make torment catherine blushed for friend said isabella be wrong be sure can not mean to torment for be very much attached to brother have be in love with ever since first met while father consent be uncertain fretted almost into fever know must be attached to understand be in love with james flirt with frederick oh not flirt woman in love with one man can not flirt with be probable that will neither love so well flirt so well a might do either singly gentleman must give up little after short pause catherine resumed with then believe isabella so very much attached to brother can have opinion on subject what can brother mean if know engagement what can mean by behaviour be very close questioner be only ask what want to be told do only ask what can be expected to tell yes think so for must know brother heart brother heart a term on present occasion assure can only guess at well well nay if be to be guesswork let guess for ourselves to be guided by second hand conjecture be pitiful premise be before brother be lively perhaps sometimes thoughtless young man have have about week acquaintance with friend have known engagement almost a long a have known well said catherine after moment consideration may be able to guess at brother intention from be sure can not be not father uncomfortable about doe not want captain tilney to go away sure if father be to speak to must go dear miss morland said henry in amiable solicitude for brother comfort may not be little mistaken be not carried little too far must thank on own account miss thorpe for supposing that affection at least good behaviour be only to be secured by seeing nothing of captain tilney be safe only in solitude be heart constant to only when unsolicited by anyone else can not think thisand may be sure that must not have think will not say be uneasy because know that be so at moment be a little uneasy a can have doubt of mutual attachment of brother friend depend upon therefore that real jealousy never can exist between depend upon that disagreement between can be of duration heart be open to other a heart can be to know exactly what be required what can be borne may be certain that one will never tease other beyond what be known to be pleasant perceiving still to look doubtful grave added though frederick doe not leave bath with will probably remain very short time perhaps only few day behind leave of absence will soon expire must return to regiment what will then be acquaintance mess room will drink isabella thorpe for fortnight will laugh with brother over poor tilneys passion for month catherine must contend no longer against comfort have resisted approach during whole length of speech now carried captive henry tilney must know best blamed for extent of fear resolved never to think so seriously on subject again resolution be supported by isabella behaviour in parting interview thorpe spent last evening of catherine stay in pulteney street nothing passed between lover to excite uneasiness make quit in apprehension james be in excellent spirit isabella most engagingly placid tenderness for friend seemed rather first feeling of heart at moment be allowable once gave lover flat contradiction once drew back hand catherine remembered henry instruction placed to judicious affection embrace tear promise of parting fair one may be fancied chapter mr mr allen be sorry to lose young friend whose good humour cheerfulness have made valuable companion in promotion of whose enjoyment own have be gently increased happiness in going with miss tilney however prevented wishing otherwise a be to remain only one more week in bath quitting now must not long be felt mr allen attended to milsom street where be to breakfast saw seated with kindest welcome among new friend so great be agitation in finding a one of family so fearful be of not doing exactly what be right of not being able to preserve good opinion that in embarrassment of first five minute must almost have wished to return with to pulteney street miss tilneys manner henry smile soon did away of unpleasant feeling still be far from being at ease must incessant attention of general entirely reassure nay perverse a seemed doubted whether might not have felt le have be le attended to anxiety for comforthis continual solicitation that must eat often expressed fear of seeing nothing to tastethough never in life before have beheld half such variety on breakfast tablemade impossible for to forget for moment that be visitor felt utterly unworthy of such respect knew not how to reply to tranquillity be not improved by general impatience for appearance of eldest son by displeasure expressed at laziness when captain tilney at last came down be quite pained by severity of father reproof seemed disproportionate to offence much be concern increased when found principal cause of lecture that tardiness be chiefly resented from being disrespectful to be placing in very uncomfortable situation felt great compassion for captain tilney without being able to hope for goodwill listened to father in silence attempted not defence confirmed in fearing that inquietude of mind on isabella account might by keeping long sleepless have be real cause of rising late be first time of being decidedly in company have hoped to be now able to form opinion of scarcely heard voice while father remained in room even afterwards so much be spirit affected must distinguish nothing word in whisper to eleanor how glad will be when be off bustle of going be not pleasant clock struck ten while trunk be carrying down general have fixed to be out of milsom street by hour greatcoat instead of being brought for to put on directly be spread out in curricle in be to accompany son middle seat of chaise be not drawn out though there be three people to go in daughter maid have so crowded with parcel miss morland must not have room to sit so much be influenced by apprehension when handed in have difficulty in saving own new writing desk from being thrown out into street at last however door be closed upon three female set off at sober pace in handsome highly fed four horse of gentleman usually perform journey of thirty mile such be distance of northanger from bath to be now divided into two equal stage catherine spirit revived a drove from door for with miss tilney felt restraint with interest of road entirely new to of abbey before curricle behind caught last view of bath without regret met with milestone before expected tediousness of two hour wait at petty france in there be nothing to be done to eat without being hungry loiter about without anything to see next followedand admiration of style in travelled of fashionable chaise fourpostilions handsomely liveried rising so regularly in stirrup numerous outrider properly mounted sunk little under consequent inconvenience have party be perfectly agreeable delay must have be nothing general tilney though so charming man seemed always check upon childrens spirit scarcely anything be said by observation of with discontent at whatever inn afforded angry impatience at waiter made catherine grow moment more in awe of

be anxious for seeing a much of country a possible remembrance of mr allen opinion respecting young men open carriage made blush at mention of plan first thought be to decline second be of greater deference for general tilneys judgment must not propose anything improper for in course of few minute found with henry in curricle a happy being a ever existed very short trial convinced that curricle be prettiest equipage in world chaise four wheeled off with grandeur to be sure be heavy troublesome business must not easily forget having stopped two hour at petty france time must have be enough for curricle so nimbly be light horse disposed to move have not general chosen to have own carriage lead way must have passed with ease in minute merit of curricle did not belong to horse henry drove so wellso quietlywithout making disturbance without parading to swearing at so different from only gentleman coachman whom be in power to compare with then hat sat so well innumerable cape of greatcoat looked so becomingly important to be driven by next to being dancing with be certainly greatest happiness in world in addition to other delight have now that of listening to own praise of being thanked at least on sister account for kindness in thus becoming visitor of hearing ranked a real friendship described a creating real gratitude sister said be uncomfortably circumstancedshe have female companionand in frequent absence of father be sometimes without companion at how can that be said catherine be not with northanger be not more than half home have establishment at own house in woodston be nearly twenty mile from father of time be necessarily spent there how sorry must be for be always sorry to leave eleanor yes besides affection for must be so fond of abbey after being used to such home a abbey ordinary parsonage house must be very disagreeable smiled said have formed very favourable idea of abbey to be sure have be not fine old place just like what one read about be prepared to encounter horror that building such a what one read about may produce have stout heart nerve fit for sliding panel tapestry oh yesi think must be easily frightened because there

darkness oh say so well go on henry be too much amused by interest have raised to be able to carry farther must no longer command solemnity of subject voice be obliged to entreat to use own fancy in perusal of matildas woe catherine recollecting grew ashamed of eagerness began earnestly to assure that attention have be fixed without smallest apprehension of really meeting with what related miss tilney be sure must never put into chamber a have described be not at afraid a drew near end of journey impatience for sight of abbeyfor time suspended by conversation on subject very differentreturned in full force bend in road be expected with solemn awe to afford glimpse of massy wall of grey stone rising amidst grove of ancient oak with last beam of sun playing in beautiful splendour on high gothic window so low did building stand that found passing through great gate of lodge into very ground of northanger without having discerned even antique chimney knew not that have right to be surprised there be something in mode of approach certainly have not expected to pas between lodge of modern appearance to find with such ease in very precinct of abbey driven so rapidly along smooth level road of fine gravel without obstacle alarm solemnity of kind struck a odd inconsistent be not long at leisure however for such consideration sudden scud of rain driving full in face made impossible for to observe anything further fixed thought on welfare of new straw bonnet be actually under abbey wall be springing with henry assistance from carriage be beneath shelter of old porch have even passed on to hall where friend general be waiting to welcome without feeling one awful foreboding of future misery to one moment suspicion of past scene of horror being acted within solemn edifice breeze have not seemed to waft sigh of murdered to have wafted nothing worse than thick mizzling rain having given good shake to habit be ready to be shown into common drawing room

difference be very distressing general perceiving how eye be employed began to talk of smallness of room simplicity of furniture where everything being for daily use pretended only to comfort etc flattering however that there be apartment in abbey not unworthy noticeand be proceeding to mention costly gilding of one in particular when taking out watch stopped short to pronounce with surprise within twenty minute of five seemed word of separation catherine found hurried away by miss tilney in such manner a convinced that strictest punctuality to family hour must be expected at northanger returning through large lofty hall ascended broad staircase of shining oak after many flight many landing place brought upon long wide gallery on one side have range of door be lighted on other by window catherine have only time to discover looked into quadrangle before miss tilney led way into chamber scarcely staying to hope must find comfortable left with anxious entreaty that must make a little alteration a possible in dress chapter moment glance be enough to satisfy catherine that apartment be very unlike one henry have endeavoured to alarm by description of be by mean unreasonably large contained tapestry velvet wall be papered floor be carpeted window be neither le perfect more dim than of drawing room below furniture though not of latest fashion be handsome comfortable air of room altogether far from uncheerful heart instantaneously at ease on point resolved to lose time in particular examination of anything a greatly dreaded disobliging general by delay habit therefore be thrown off with possible haste be preparing to unpin linen package chaise seat have conveyed for immediate accommodation when eye suddenly fell on large high chest standing back in deep recess on one side of fireplace sight of made start forgetting everything else stood gazing on in motionless wonder while thought crossed be strange indeed did not expect such sight a immense heavy chest what can hold why must be placed here pushed back too a if meant to be out of sight will look into itcost what may will look into itand directly tooby daylight if stay till evening candle may go out advanced examined closely be of cedar curiously inlaid with darker wood raised about foot from ground on carved stand of same lock be silver though tarnished from age at end be imperfect remains of handle also of silver broken perhaps prematurely by strange violence on centre of lid be mysterious cipher in same metal catherine bent over intently without being able to distinguish anything with certainty must not in direction took believe last letter to be t yet that must be anything else in house be circumstance to raise common degree of astonishment if not originally theirs by what strange event must have fallen into tilney family fearful curiosity be moment growing greater seizing with trembling hand hasp of lock resolved at hazard to satisfy at least a to content with difficulty for something

exertion of strength that unless secured by supernatural mean lid in one moment must be thrown back with spirit sprang forward confidence did not deceive resolute effort threw back lid gave to astonished eye view of white cotton counterpane properly folded reposing at one end of chest in undisputed possession be gazing on with first blush of surprise when miss tilney anxious for friend

resolution with most violent dispatch miss tilney gently hinted fear of being late in minute ran downstairs together in alarm not wholly unfounded for general tilney be pacing drawing room watch in hand having on very instant of entering pulled bell with violence ordered dinner to be on table directly catherine trembled at emphasis with spoke sat pale breathless in most humble mood concerned for child detesting old chest general recovering politeness a looked at spent rest of time in scolding daughter for so foolishly hurrying fair friend who be absolutely out of breath from haste when there be not least occasion for hurry in world catherine must not at get over double distress of having involved friend in lecture be great simpleton till be happily seated at dinner table when general complacent smile good appetite of own restored to peace dining parlour be noble room suitable in dimension to much larger drawing room than one in common use fitted up in style of luxury expense be almost lost on unpractised eye of catherine who saw little more than spaciousness number of attendant of former spoke aloud admiration general with very gracious countenance acknowledged that be by mean ill sized room further confessed though a careless on such subject a most people did look upon tolerably large eating room a one of necessary of life supposed however that must have be used to much better sized apartment at mr allen indeed be catherine honest assurance mr allen dining parlour be not more than half a large have never seen so large room a in life general good humour increased why a have such room thought must be simple not to make use of upon honour believed there might be more comfort in room of only size mr allen house be sure must be exactly of true size for rational happiness evening passed without further disturbance in occasional absence of general tilney with much positive cheerfulness be only in presence that catherine felt smallest fatigue from journey even then even in moment of languor restraint sense of general happiness preponderated must think of friend in bath without one wish of being with night be stormy wind have be rising at interval whole afternoon by time party broke up blew rained violently catherine a crossed hall listened to tempest with sensation of awe when heard rage round corner of ancient building close with sudden fury distant door felt for first time that be really in abbey yes be characteristic sound brought to recollection countless variety of dreadful situation horrid scene such building have witnessed such storm ushered in most heartily did rejoice in happier circumstance attending entrance within wall so solemn have nothing to dread from midnight assassin drunken gallant henry have certainly be only in jest in what have told that morning in house so furnished so guarded must have nothing to explore to suffer might go to bedroom a securely a if have be own chamber at fullerton thus wisely fortifying mind a proceeded upstairs be enabled especially on perceiving that miss tilney slept only two door from to enter room with tolerably stout heart spirit be immediately assisted by cheerful blaze of wood fire how much better be said a walked to fenderhow much better to find fire ready lit than to have to wait shivering in cold till family be in bed a so many poor girl have be obliged to do then to have faithful old servant frightening one by coming in with faggot how glad be that northanger be what be if have be like other place know that in such night a must have answered for courage now to be sure there be nothing to alarm one looked round room window curtain seemed in motion must be nothing violence of wind penetrating through division of shutter stepped boldly forward carelessly humming tune to assure herself of being so peeped courageously behind curtain saw nothing on low window seat to scare on placing hand against shutter felt strongest conviction of wind force glance at old chest a turned away from examination be not without use scorned causeless fear of idle fancy began with most happy indifference to prepare for bed must take time must not hurry did not care if be last person up in house must not make up fire must seem cowardly a if wished for protection of light after be in bed fire therefore died away catherine having spent best part of hour in arrangement be beginning to think of stepping into bed when on giving parting glance round room be struck by appearance of high old fashioned black cabinet though in situation conspicuous enough have never caught notice before henry word description of ebony cabinet be to escape observation at first immediately rushed across though there must be nothing really in there be something whimsical be certainly very remarkable coincidence took candle looked closely at cabinet be not absolutely ebony gold be japan black yellow japan of handsomest kind a held candle yellow have very much effect of gold key be in door have strange fancy to look into not however with smallest expectation of finding anything be so very odd after what henry have said in short must not sleep till have examined so placing candle with great caution on chair seized key with very tremulous hand tried to turn resisted utmost strength alarmed not discouraged tried way bolt flew believed successful how strangely mysterious door be still immovable paused moment in breathless wonder wind roared down chimney rain beat in torrent against window everything seemed to speak awfulness of situation to retire to bed however unsatisfied on point must be vain since sleep must be impossible with consciousness of cabinet so mysteriously closed in immediate vicinity again therefore applied to key after moving in possible way for instant with determined celerity of hope last effort door suddenly yielded to hand heart leaped with exultation at victory having thrown open folding door second being secured only by bolt of le wonderful construction than lock though in eye must not discern anything unusual double range of small drawer appeared in view with larger drawer above below in centre small door closed also with lock key secured in probability cavity of importance catherine heart beat quick courage did not fail with cheek flushed by hope eye straining with curiosity finger grasped handle of drawer drew forth be entirely empty with le alarm greater eagerness seized second third fourth be equally empty not one be left unsearched in not one be anything found well read in art of concealing treasure possibility of false lining to drawer did not escape felt round with anxious acuteness in vain place in middle alone remained now unexplored though have never from first have smallest idea of finding anything in part of cabinet be not in least disappointed at ill success thus far must be foolish not to examine thoroughly while be about be time however before must unfasten door same difficulty occurring in management of inner lock a of outer at length did open not vain a hitherto be search quick eye directly fell on roll of paper pushed back into further part of cavity apparently for concealment feeling at moment be indescribable heart fluttered knee trembled cheek grew pale seized with unsteady hand precious manuscript for glance sufficed to ascertain written character while acknowledged with awful sensation striking exemplification of what henry have foretold resolved instantly to peruse line before attempted to rest dimness of light candle emitted made turn to with alarm there be danger of sudden extinction have hour to burn that might not have greater difficulty in distinguishing writing than what ancient date might occasion hastily snuffed ala be snuffed extinguished in one lamp must not have expired with more awful effect catherine for few moment be motionless with horror be done completely not remnant of light in wick must give hope to rekindling breath darkness impenetrable immovable filled room violent gust of wind rising with sudden fury added fresh horror to moment catherine trembled from head to foot in pause succeeded sound like receding footstep closing of distant door struck on affrighted ear human nature must support more cold sweat stood on forehead manuscript fell from hand groping way to bed jumped hastily in sought suspension of agony by creeping far underneath clothes to close eye in sleep that night felt must be entirely out of question with curiosity so justly awakened feeling in way so agitated repose must be absolutely impossible storm too abroad so dreadful have not be used to feel alarm from wind now blast seemed fraught with awful intelligence manuscript so wonderfully found so wonderfully accomplishing morning prediction how be to be accounted for what must contain to whom must relate by what mean must have be so long concealed how singularly strange that must fall to lot to discover till have made mistress of content however must have repose comfort with sun first ray be determined to peruse many be tedious hour must yet intervene shuddered tossed about in bed envied quiet sleeper storm still raged various be noise more terrific even than wind struck at interval on startled ear very curtain of bed seemed at one moment in motion at lock of door be agitated a if by attempt of somebody to enter hollow murmur seemed to creep along gallery more than once blood be chilled by sound of distant moan hour after hour passed away wearied catherine have heard three proclaimed by clock in house before tempest subsided unknowingly fell fast asleep chapter housemaid folding back window shutter at eight oclock next day be sound first roused catherine opened eye wondering that must ever have be closed on object of cheerfulness fire be already burning bright morning have succeeded tempest of night instantaneously with consciousness of existence returned recollection of manuscript springing from bed in very moment of maid going away eagerly collected scattered sheet have burst from roll on falling to ground flew back to enjoy luxury of perusal on pillow now plainly saw that must not expect manuscript of equal length with generality of what have shuddered over in book for roll seeming to consist entirely of small disjointed sheet be altogether of trifling size much le than have supposed to be at first greedy eye glanced rapidly over page started at import must be possible did not sens play false inventory of linen in coarse modern character seemed be before if evidence of sight might be trusted

expenditure scarcely more interesting in letter hair powder shoe string breech ball larger sheet have enclosed rest seemed by first cramp line to poultice chestnut marea farrier bill such be collection of paper left perhaps a must then suppose by negligence of servant in place whence have taken have filled with expectation alarm robbed of half night rest felt humbled to dust must not adventure of chest have taught wisdom corner of catching eye a lay seemed to rise up in judgment against nothing must now be clearer than absurdity of recent fancy to suppose that manuscript of many generation back must have remained undiscovered in room such a so modern so habitableor that must be first to posse skill of unlocking cabinet key of be open to how must have so imposed on heaven forbid that henry tilney must ever know folly be in great measure own doing for have not cabinet appeared so exactly to agree with description of adventure must never have felt smallest curiosity about be only comfort occurred impatient to get rid of hateful evidence of folly detestable paper then scattered over bed rose directly folding up a nearly a possible in same shape a before returned to same spot within cabinet with very hearty wish that untoward accident might ever bring forward again to disgrace even with why lock must have be so difficult to open however be still something remarkable for must now manage with perfect ease in there be surely something mysterious indulged in flattering suggestion for minute till possibility of door having be at first unlocked of being fastener darted into head cost blush got away a soon a must from room in conduct produced such unpleasant reflection found way with speed to breakfast parlour a have be pointed out to by miss tilney evening before henry be alone in immediate hope of having be undisturbed by tempest with arch reference to character of building inhabited be rather distressing for world must not have weakness suspected yet unequal to absolute falsehood be constrained to acknowledge that wind have kept awake little have charming morning after added desiring to get rid of subject storm sleeplessness be nothing when be over what beautiful hyacinth have just learnt to love hyacinth how might learn by accident argument sister taught can not tell how mr allen used to take pain year after year to make like never must till saw other day in milsom street be naturally indifferent about flower now love hyacinth so much better have gained new source of enjoyment be well to have a many hold upon happiness a possible besides taste for flower be always desirable in sex a mean of getting out of door tempting to more frequent exercise than must otherwise take though love of hyacinth may be rather domestic who can tell sentiment once raised may in time come to love rose want such pursuit to get out of door pleasure of walking breathing fresh air be enough for in fine weather be out more than half time mamma say be never within at rate however be pleased that have learnt to love hyacinth mere habit of learning to love be thing teachableness of disposition in young lady be great blessing have sister pleasant mode of instruction catherine be saved embarrassment of attempting answer by entrance of general whose smiling compliment announced happy state of mind whose gentle hint of sympathetic early rising did not advance composure elegance of breakfast set forced on catherine notice when be seated at table luckily have be general choice be enchanted by approbation of taste confessed to be neat simple thought right to encourage manufacture of country for part to uncritical palate tea be a well flavoured from clay of staffordshire a from that of dresden sve be quite old set purchased two year ago manufacture be much improved since time have seen beautiful specimen when last in town have not be perfectly without vanity of kind might have be tempted to order new set trusted however that opportunity might ere long occur of selecting onethough not for catherine be probably only one of party who did not understand shortly after breakfast henry left for woodston where business required must keep two three day attended in hall to see mount horse immediately on re entering breakfast room catherine walked to window in hope of catching glimpse of figure be somewhat heavy call upon brother fortitude observed general to eleanor woodston will make sombre appearance today be pretty place asked catherine what say eleanor speak opinion for lady can best tell taste of lady in regard to place a well a men think must be acknowledged by most impartial eye to have many recommendation house stand among fine meadow facing south east with excellent kitchen garden in same aspect wall surrounding built stocked about ten year ago for benefit of son be family living miss morland property in place being chiefly own may believe take care that will not be bad one did henry income depend solely on living must not be ill provided for perhaps may seem odd that with only two younger child must think profession necessary for certainly there be moment when must wish disengaged from tie of business though may not exactly make convert of young lady be sure father miss morland must agree with in thinking expedient to give young man employment money be nothing be not object employment be thing even frederick eldest son see who will perhaps inherit a considerable landed property a private man in county have profession imposing effect of last argument be equal to wish silence of lady proved to be unanswerable something have be said evening before of being shown over house now offered a conductor though catherine have hoped to explore accompanied only by daughter be proposal of too much happiness in under circumstance not to be gladly accepted for have be already eighteen hour in abbey have seen only few of room netting box just leisurely drawn forth be closed with joyful haste be ready to attend in moment when have gone over house promised moreover pleasure of accompanying into shrubbery garden curtsied acquiescence perhaps might be more agreeable to to make first object weather be at present favourable at time of year uncertainty be very great of continuing so must prefer be equally at service did daughter think must most accord with fair friend wish thought must discern yes certainly read in miss morlands eye judicious desire of making use of present smiling weather when did judge amiss abbey must be always safe dry yielded implicitly must fetch hat attend in moment left room catherine with disappointed anxious face began to speak of unwillingness that must be taking out of door against own inclination under mistaken idea of pleasing be stopped by miss tilneys saying with little confusion believe will be wisest to take morning while be so fine be uneasy on father account always walk out at time of day catherine did not exactly know how be to be understood why be miss tilney embarrassed must there be unwillingness on general side to show over abbey proposal be own be not odd that must always take walk so early father mr allen did so be certainly very provoking be impatience to see house have scarcely curiosity about ground if henry have be with indeed now must not know what be picturesque when saw such be thought kept to herself put on bonnet in patient discontent be struck however beyond expectation by grandeur of abbey a saw for first time from lawn whole building enclosed large court two side of quadrangle rich in gothic ornament stood forward for admiration remainder be shut off by knoll of old tree luxuriant plantation steep woody hill rising behind to give shelter be beautiful even in leafless month of march catherine have seen nothing to compare with feeling of delight be so strong that without waiting for better authority boldly burst forth in wonder praise general listened with assenting gratitude seemed a if own estimation of northanger have waited unfixed till hour kitchen garden be to be next admired led way to across small portion of park number of acre contained in garden be such a catherine must not listen to without dismay being more than double extent of mr allen a well a father including church yard orchard wall seemed countless in number endless in length village of hot house seemed to arise among whole parish to be at work within enclosure general be flattered by look of surprise told almost a plainly a soon forced to tell in word that have never seen garden at equal to before then modestly owned that without ambition of sort himselfwithout solicitude about ithe did believe to be unrivalled in kingdom if have hobby horse be that loved garden though careless enough in most matter of eating loved good fruitor if did not friend child did there be great vexation however attending such garden a utmost care must not always secure most valuable fruit pinery have yielded only one hundred in last year mr allen supposed must feel inconvenience a well a not at mr allen did not care about garden never went into with triumphant smile of self satisfaction general wished must do same for never entered without being vexed in way other by falling short of plan how be mr allen succession house worked describing nature of own a entered mr allen have only one small hot house mr allen have use of for plant in winter there be fire in now then be happy man said general with look of very happy contempt having taken into division led under wall till be heartily weary of seeing wondering suffered girl at last to seize advantage of outer door then expressing wish to examine effect of recent alteration about tea house proposed a unpleasant extension of walk if miss morland be not tired where be going eleanor why do choose that cold damp path to miss morland will get wet best way be across park be so favourite walk of mine said miss tilney always think best nearest way perhaps may be damp be narrow winding path through thick grove of old scotch fir catherine struck by gloomy aspect eager to enter must not even by general disapprobation be kept from stepping forward perceived inclination having again urged plea of health in vain be too polite to make further opposition excused however from attending ray of sun be not too cheerful for must meet by course turned away catherine be shocked to find how much spirit be relieved by separation shock however being le real than relief offered injury began to talk with easy gaiety of delightful melancholy grove inspired be particularly fond of spot said companion with sigh be mother favourite walk catherine have never heard mr tilney mentioned in family before interest excited by tender remembrance showed directly in altered countenance in attentive pause with waited for something more used to walk here so often with added eleanor though never loved then a have loved since at time indeed used to wonder at choice memory endears now ought not reflected catherine to endear to husband yet general must not enter miss tilney continuing silent ventured to say death must have be great affliction great increasing one replied other in low voice be only thirteen when happened though felt loss perhaps a strongly a one so young must feel did not must not then know what loss be stopped for moment then added with great firmness have sister knowand though henrythough brother be very affectionate henry be great deal here be most thankful for be impossible for not to be often solitary to be sure must miss very much mother must have be always present mother must have be constant friend influence must have be beyond other be very charming woman be handsome be there picture of in abbey why have be so partial to grove be from dejection of spiritswere question now eagerly poured forth first three received ready affirmative two others be passed by catherine interest in deceased mr tilney augmented with question whether answered not of unhappiness in marriage felt persuaded general certainly have be unkind husband did not love walk must therefore have loved besides handsome a be there be something in turn of feature spoke not having behaved well to picture suppose blushing at consummate art of own question hang in father room no be intended for drawing room father be dissatisfied with painting for time have place soon after death obtained for own hung in bed chamberwhere will be happy to show be very like here be proof portraitvery likeof departed wife not valued by husband must have be dreadfully cruel to catherine attempted no longer to hide from nature of feeling in spite of attention have previously excited what have be terror dislike before be now absolute aversion yes aversion cruelty to charming woman made odious to have often read of such character character mr allen have be used to call unnatural overdrawn here be proof positive of contrary have just settled point when end of path brought directly upon general in spite of virtuous indignation found again obliged to walk with listen to even to smile when smiled being no longer able however to receive pleasure from surrounding object soon began to walk with general perceived with concern for health seemed to reproach for opinion of be most urgent for returning with daughter to house must follow in quarter of hour again partedbut be called back in minute to receive strict charge against taking friend round abbey till return second instance of anxiety to delay what so much wished for struck catherine a very remarkable chapter hour passed away before general came in spent on part of young guest in very favourable consideration of character lengthened absence solitary ramble did not speak mind at ease conscience void of reproach at length appeared might have be gloom of meditation must still smile with miss tilney understanding in part friend curiosity to see house soon revived subject father being contrary to catherine expectation unprovided with pretence for further delay beyond of stopping five minute to order refreshment to be in room by return be at last ready to escort set forward with grandeur of air dignified step caught eye must not shake doubt of well read catherine led way across hall through common drawing room one useless antechamber into room magnificent in size furniturethe real drawing room used only with company of consequence be very noblevery grandvery charmingwas catherine have to say for indiscriminating eye scarcely discerned colour of satin minuteness of praise praise have much meaning be supplied by general costliness elegance of room fitting up must be nothing to cared for furniture of more modern date than fifteenth century when general have satisfied own curiosity in close examination of well known ornament proceeded into library apartment in way of equal magnificence exhibiting collection of book on humble man might have looked with pride catherine heard admired wondered with more genuine feeling than beforegathered that must from storehouse of knowledge by running over title of shelf be ready to proceed suite of apartment did not spring up with wish large a be building have already visited greatest part though on being told that with addition of kitchen six seven room have now seen surrounded three side of court must scarcely believe overcome suspicion of there being many chamber secreted be relief however that be to return to room in common use by passing through few of le importance looking into court with occasional passage not wholly unintricate connected different side be further soothed in progress by being told that be treading what have once be cloister having trace of cell pointed out observing several door be opened explained to herby finding successively in billiard room in general private apartment without comprehending connection being able to turn aright when left lastly by passing through dark little room owning henry authority strewed with litter of book gun greatcoat from dining room of though already seen always to be seen at five oclock general must not forgo pleasure of pacing out length for more certain information of miss morland a to what neither doubted cared for proceeded by quick communication to kitchenthe ancient kitchen of convent rich in massy wall smoke of former day in stove hot closet of present general improving hand have not loitered here modern invention to facilitate labour of

building be not only new declared to be so intended only for office enclosed behind by stable yard uniformity of architecture have be thought necessary catherine must have raved at hand have swept away what must have be beyond value of rest for purpose of mere domestic economy must willingly have be spared mortification of walk through scene so fallen have general allowed if have vanity be in arrangement of office a be convinced that to mind like miss morlands view of accommodation comfort by labour of inferior be softened must always be gratifying must make apology for leading on took slight survey of catherine be impressed beyond expectation by multiplicity convenience purpose for few shapeless pantry comfortless scullery be deemed sufficient at fullerton be here carried on in

whom have at time be honoured turned with smiling countenance to catherine ventured to hope henceforward of earliest tenant might be friend from fullerton felt unexpected compliment deeply regretted impossibility of thinking well of man so kindly disposed towards so full of civility to family gallery be terminated by folding door miss tilney advancing have thrown open passed through seemed on point of doing same by first door to left in long reach of gallery when general coming forward called hastily a catherine thought rather angrily back demanding whither be goingand what be there more to be seenhad not miss morland already seen must be worth noticeand did not suppose friend might be glad of refreshment after so much exercise miss tilney drew back directly heavy door be closed upon mortified catherine who having seen in momentary glance beyond narrower passage more numerous opening symptom of winding staircase believed at last within reach of something worth notice felt a unwillingly paced back gallery that must rather be allowed to examine end of house than see finery of rest general evident desire of preventing such examination be additional stimulant something be certainly to be concealed fancy though have trespassed lately once twice must not mislead here what that something be short sentence of miss tilneys a followed general at distance downstairs seemed to point out be going to take into what be mother roomthe room in died be word few a be conveyed page of intelligence to catherine be wonder that general must shrink from sight of such object a room must contain room in probability never entered by since dreadful scene have passed released suffering wife left to sting of conscience ventured when next alone with eleanor to express wish of being permitted to see a well a rest of side of house eleanor promised to attend there whenever must have convenient hour catherine understood general must be watched from home before room must be entered

after death of injured wife before room be put to right be with suppose to last said miss tilney sighing be unfortunately from home illness be sudden short before arrived be over catherine blood ran cold with horrid suggestion naturally sprang from word must be possible must henry father yet how many be example to justify even blackest suspicion when saw in evening while worked with friend slowly pacing drawing room for hour together in silent thoughtfulness with downcast eye contracted brow felt secure from possibility of wronging be air attitude of montoni must more plainly speak gloomy working of mind not wholly dead to sense of humanity in fearful review of past scene of guilt unhappy man anxiousness of spirit directed eye towards figure so repeatedly a to catch miss tilneys notice father whispered often walk about room in way be nothing unusual so much worse thought catherine such ill timed exercise be of piece with strange unseasonableness of morning walk boded nothing good after evening little variety seeming length of made peculiarly sensible of henry importance among be heartily glad to be dismissed though be look from general not designed for observation sent

over affair of nation for hour after be asleep can either of be more meetly employed eye will be blinding for good of others yours preparing by rest for future mischief business alleged magnificent compliment must win catherine from thinking that very different object must occasion so serious delay of proper repose to be kept up for hour after family be in bed by stupid pamphlet be not very likely there must be deeper cause something be to be done must be done only while household slept probability mr tilney yet lived shut up for cause unknown receiving from pitiless hand of husband nightly supply of coarse food be conclusion necessarily followed shocking a be idea be at least better than death unfairly hastened a in natural course of thing must ere long be released suddenness of reputed illness absence of daughter probably of other child at timeall favoured supposition of imprisonment originjealousy perhaps wanton crueltywas yet to be unravelled in revolving matter while undressed suddenly struck a not unlikely that might that morning have passed near very spot of unfortunate woman confinementmight have be within few pace of cell in languished out day for what part of abbey must be more fitted for purpose than yet bore trace of monastic division in high arched passage paved with stone already have trodden with peculiar awe well remembered door of general have given no account to what might not door lead in support of plausibility of conjecture further occurred to that forbidden gallery in lay apartment of unfortunate mr tilney must be a certainly a memory must guide exactly over suspected range of cell staircase by side of apartment of have caught transient glimpse communicating by secret mean with cell might well have favoured barbarous proceeding of husband down staircase have perhaps be conveyed in state of well prepared insensibility catherine sometimes started at boldness of own surmise sometimes hoped feared that have gone too far be supported by such appearance a made dismissal impossible side of quadrangle in supposed guilty scene to be acting being according to belief just opposite own struck that if judiciously watched ray of light from general lamp might glimmer through lower window a passed to prison of wife twice before stepped into bed stole gently from room to corresponding window in gallery to see if appeared abroad be dark must yet be too early various ascending noise convinced that servant must still be up till midnight supposed must be in vain to watch then when clock have struck twelve be quiet must if not

sunday whole time between morning afternoon service be required by general in exercise abroad eating cold meat at home great a be catherine curiosity courage be not equal to wish of exploring after dinner either by fading light of sky between six seven oclock by yet more partial though stronger illumination of treacherous lamp day be unmarked therefore by anything to interest imagination beyond sight of very elegant monument to memory of mr tilney immediately fronted family pew by eye be instantly caught long retained perusal of highly strained epitaph in virtue be ascribed to by inconsolable husband who must have be in way other destroyer affected even to tear that general having erected monument must be able to face be not perhaps very strange yet that must sit so boldly collected within view maintain so elevated air look so fearlessly around nay that must even enter church seemed wonderful to catherine not however that many instance of being equally hardened in guilt might not be produced must remember dozen who have persevered in possible vice going on from crime to crime murdering whomsoever chose without feeling of humanity remorse till violent death religious retirement closed black career erection of monument must not in smallest degree affect doubt of mr tilneys actual decease be even to descend into family vault where ash be supposed to slumber be to behold coffin in be said to be enclosedwhat must avail in such case catherine have read too much not to be perfectly aware of ease with waxen figure might be introduced supposititious funeral carried on succeeding morning promised something better general early walk ill timed a be in other view be favourable here when knew to be out of house directly proposed to miss tilney accomplishment of promise eleanor be ready to oblige catherine reminding a went of promise first visit in consequence be to portrait in bed chamber represented very lovely woman with mild pensive countenance justifying so far expectation of new observer be not in respect answered for catherine have depended upon meeting with feature hair complexion must be very counterpart very image if not of henry of eleanorsthe only portrait of have be in habit of thinking bearing always equal resemblance of mother child face once taken be taken for generation here be obliged to look consider study for likeness contemplated however in spite of drawback with much emotion for yet stronger interest must have left unwillingly agitation a entered great gallery be too much for endeavour at discourse must only look at companion eleanors countenance be dejected yet sedate composure spoke inured to gloomy object to be advancing again passed through folding door again hand be upon important lock catherine hardly able to breathe be turning to close former with fearful caution when figure dreaded figure of general at further end of gallery stood before name of eleanor at same moment in loudest tone resounded through building giving to daughter first intimation of presence to catherine terror upon terror attempt at concealment have be first instinctive movement on perceiving yet must scarcely hope to have escaped eye when friend who with apologizing look darted hastily by have joined disappeared with ran for safety to own room locking in believed that must never have courage to go down again remained there at least hour in greatest agitation deeply commiserating state of poor friend expecting summons from angry general to attend in own apartment summons however arrived at last on seeing carriage drive up to abbey be emboldened to descend meet under protection of visitor breakfast room be gay with company be named to by general a friend of daughter in complimentary style so well concealed resentful ire a to make feel secure at least of life for present eleanor with command of countenance did honour to concern for character taking early occasion of saying to father only wanted to answer note began to hope that have be unseen by general that from consideration of policy must be allowed to suppose so upon trust dared still to remain in presence after company left nothing occurred to disturb in course of morning reflection came to resolution of making next attempt on forbidden door alone must be much better in respect that eleanor must know nothing of matter to involve in danger of second detection to court into apartment must wring heart must not be office of friend general utmost anger must not be to herself what might be to daughter besides thought examination must be more satisfactory if made without companion must be impossible to explain to eleanor suspicion from other have in likelihood be hitherto happily exempt must therefore in presence search for proof of general cruelty however might yet have escaped discovery felt confident of somewhere drawing forth in shape of fragmented journal continued to last gasp of way to apartment be now perfectly mistress a wished to get over before henry return who be expected on morrow there be time to be lost day be bright courage high at four oclock sun be now two hour above horizon must be only retiring to dress hour earlier than usual be done catherine found alone in gallery before clock have ceased to strike be time for thought hurried on slipped with least possible noise through folding door without stopping to look breathe rushed forward to one in question lock yielded to hand luckily with sullen sound must alarm human being on tiptoe entered room be before be minute before must advance step beheld what fixed to spot agitated feature saw large well proportioned apartment handsome dimity bed arranged a unoccupied with housemaid care bright bath stove mahogany wardrobe neatly painted chair on warm beam of western sun gaily poured through two sash window catherine have expected to have feeling worked worked be astonishment doubt first seized shortly succeeding ray of common sense added bitter emotion of shame must not be mistaken a to room how grossly mistaken in everything elsein miss tilneys meaning in own calculation apartment to have given date so ancient position so awful

unpleasant by general seemed always at hand when least wanted much worse listenedthe sound have ceased resolving not to lose moment passed through closed door at instant door underneath be hastily opened someone seemed with swift step to ascend stair by head of have yet to pas before must gain gallery have power to move with feeling of terror not very definable fixed eye on staircase in few moment gave henry to view mr tilney exclaimed in voice of more than common astonishment looked astonished too good god continued not attending to address how came here how came up staircase how came up that staircase replied greatly surprised because be nearest way from stable yard to own chamber why must not come up catherine recollected blushed deeply must say no more seemed to be looking in countenance for explanation lip did not afford moved on towards gallery may not in turn said a pushed back folding door ask how came here passage be at least a extraordinary road from breakfast parlour to apartment a staircase can be from stable to mine have be said catherine looking down to see mother room mother room be there anything extraordinary to be seen there nothing at thought did

can never expect to know such woman dearest catherine beware how give heart believe c catherine have not read three line before sudden change of countenance short exclamation of sorrowing wonder declared to be receiving unpleasant news henry earnestly watching through whole letter saw plainly that ended no better than began be prevented however from even looking surprise by father entrance went to breakfast directly catherine must hardly eat anything tear filled eye even ran down cheek a sat letter be one moment in hand then in lap then in pocket looked a if knew not what did general between cocoa newspaper have luckily leisure for noticing to other two distress be equally visible a soon a dared leave table hurried away to own room housemaid be busy in be obliged to come down again turned into drawing room for privacy henry eleanor have likewise retreated thither be at moment deep in consultation about drew back trying to beg pardon be with gentle violence forced to return others withdrew after eleanor have affectionately expressed wish of being of use comfort to after hour free indulgence of grief reflection catherine felt equal to encountering friend whether must make distress known to be consideration perhaps if particularly questioned might just give ideajust distantly hint at itbut not more to expose friend such friend a isabella have be to herand then own brother so closely concerned in believed must waive subject altogether henry eleanor be by in breakfast room a entered looked at anxiously catherine took place at table after short silence eleanor said bad news from fullerton hope mr mr morlandyour brother sistersi hope be none of ill thank sighing a spoke be very well letter be from brother at oxford nothing further be said for few minute then speaking through tear added think will ever wish for letter again be sorry said henry closing book have just opened if have suspected letter of containing anything unwelcome must have given with very different feeling contained something worse than anybody must suppose poor james be so unhappy will soon know why to have so kind hearted so affectionate sister replied henry warmly must be comfort to under distress have one favour to beg said catherine shortly afterwards in agitated manner that if brother must be coming here will give notice of may go away brother frederick yes be sure must be very sorry to leave so soon something have happened must make very dreadful for to be in same house with captain tilney eleanors work be suspended while gazed with increasing astonishment henry began to suspect truth something in miss thorpe name be included passed lip how quick be cried catherine have guessed declare yet when talked about in bath little thought of ending so isabellano wonder now have not heard from herisabella have deserted brother be to marry yours must have believed there have be such inconstancy fickleness everything be bad in world hope so far a concern brother be misinformed hope have not have material share in bringing on mr morlands disappointment marrying miss thorpe be not probable think must be deceived so far be very sorry for mr morlandsorry that anyone love must be unhappy surprise must be greater at frederick marrying than at other part of story be very true however will read james letter staythere be one part recollecting with blush last line will take trouble of reading to passage concern brother read cried catherine whose second thought be clearer know what be thinking of blushing again that have blushed before james only mean to give good advice gladly received letter having read through with close attention returned saying well if be to be so can only say that be sorry for frederick will not be first man who have chosen wife with le sense than family expected envy situation either a lover son miss tilney at catherine invitation now read letter likewise having expressed also concern surprise began to inquire into miss thorpe connection fortune mother be very good sort of woman be catherine answer what be father lawyer believe live at putney be wealthy family no not very believe isabella have fortune at will not signify in family father be so very liberal told other day that only valued money a allowed to promote happiness of child brother sister looked at other said eleanor after short pause must be to promote happiness to enable to marry girl must be unprincipled one must not have used brother so how strange infatuation on frederick side girl who before eye be violating engagement voluntarily entered into with man be not inconceivable henry frederick too who always wore heart so proudly who found woman good enough to be loved be most unpromising circumstance strongest presumption against when think of past declaration give up moreover have too good opinion of miss thorpe prudence to suppose that must part with one gentleman before other be secured be over with frederick indeed be deceased mandefunct in understanding prepare for sister in law eleanor sister in law a must delight in open candid artless guileless with affection strong simple forming pretension knowing disguise sister in law henry must delight in said eleanor with smile perhaps observed catherine though have behaved so ill by family may behave better by yours now have really got man like may be constant indeed be afraid will replied henry be afraid will be very constant unless baronet must come in way be frederick only chance will get bath paper look over arrival think be for ambition then upon word there be thing seem very like can not forget that when first knew what father must do for seemed quite disappointed that be not more never be so deceived in anyones character in life before among great variety that have known studied own disappointment loss in be very great a for poor james suppose will hardly ever recover brother be certainly very much to be pitied at present must not in concern for suffering undervalue yours feel suppose that in losing isabella lose feel void in heart nothing else can occupy society be becoming irksome a for amusement in be wont to share at bath very idea of without be abhorrent must not for instance now go to ball for world feel that have longer friend to whom can speak with unreserve on whose regard can place dependence whose counsel in difficulty must rely on feel said catherine after few moment reflection ought to say truth though be hurt grieved can not still love that be never to hear from perhaps never to see again feel so very very much afflicted a one must have thought feel a always do what be most to credit of human nature such feeling ought to be investigated that may know catherine by chance other found spirit so very much relieved by conversation that must not regret being led on though so unaccountably to mention circumstance have produced chapter from time subject be frequently canvassed by three young people catherine found with surprise that two young friend be perfectly agreed in considering isabella want of consequence fortune a likely to throw great difficulty in way of marrying brother persuasion that general must upon ground alone independent of objection might be raised against character oppose connection turned feeling moreover with alarm towards be a insignificant perhaps a portionless a isabella if heir of tilney property have not grandeur wealth enough in at what point of interest be demand of younger brother to rest very painful reflection to thought led must only be dispersed by dependence on effect of particular partiality a be given to understand by word a well a action have from first be so fortunate a to excite in general by recollection of most generous disinterested sentiment on subject of money have more than once heard utter tempted to think disposition in such matter misunderstood by child be so fully convinced however that brother must not have courage to apply in person for father consent so repeatedly assured that have never in life be le likely to come to northanger than at present time that suffered mind to be at ease a to necessity of sudden removal of own a be not to be supposed captain tilney whenever made application must give father just idea of isabella conduct occurred to a highly expedient that henry must lay whole business before a really be enabling general by mean to form cool impartial opinion prepare objection on fairer ground than inequality of situation proposed to accordingly did not catch at measure so eagerly a have expected no said father hand need not be strengthened frederick confession of folly need not be forestalled must tell own story will tell only half of quarter must be enough day two passed away brought tidings of captain tilney brother sister knew not what to think sometimes appeared to a if silence must be natural result of suspected engagement at others that be wholly incompatible with general meanwhile though offended morning by frederick remissness in writing be free from real anxiety about have more pressing solicitude than of making miss morlands time at northanger pas pleasantly often expressed uneasiness on head feared sameness of day society employment must disgust with place wished lady frasers have be in country talked now then of having large party to dinner once twice began even to calculate number of young dancing people in neighbourhood then be such dead time of year wild fowl game lady frasers be not in country ended at last in telling henry one morning when next went to woodston must take by surprise there day other eat mutton with henry be greatly honoured very happy catherine be quite delighted with scheme when do think sir may look forward to pleasure must be at woodston on monday to attend parish meeting will probably be obliged to stay two three day well well will take chance one of day there be need to fix be not to put at out of way whatever may happen to have in house will be enough think can answer for young lady making allowance for bachelor table let see monday will be busy day with will not come on monday tuesday will be busy one with expect surveyor from brockham with report in morning afterwards can not in decency fail attending club really must not face acquaintance if stayed away now for a be known to be in country must be taken exceedingly amiss be rule with miss morland never to give offence to of neighbour if small sacrifice of time attention can prevent be set of very worthy men have buck from northanger twice year dine with can tuesday therefore may say be out of question on wednesday think henry may expect will be with early that may have time to look about two hour three quarter will carry to woodston suppose will be in carriage by ten so about quarter before one on wednesday may look for ball must not have be more welcome to catherine than little excursion so strong be desire to be acquainted with woodston heart be still bounding with joy when henry about hour afterwards came booted greatcoated into room where eleanor be sitting said be come young lady in very moralizing strain to observe pleasure in world be always to be paid for that often purchase at great disadvantage giving ready monied actual happiness for draft on future may not be honoured witness at present hour because be to hope for satisfaction of seeing at woodston on wednesday bad weather twenty other cause may prevent must go away directly two day before intended go away said catherine with very long face why why how can ask question because time be to be lost in frightening old housekeeper out of wit because must go prepare dinner for to be sure oh not seriously aye sadly toofor have much rather stay how can think of thing after what general said when so particularly desired not to give trouble because anything must do henry only smiled be sure be quite unnecessary upon sister account mine must know to be so general made point of providing nothing extraordinary besides if have not said half so much a did have always such excellent dinner at home that sitting down to middling one for one day must not signify wish must reason like for sake own good bye a tomorrow be sunday eleanor will not return went being at time much simpler operation to catherine to doubt own judgment than henry be very soon obliged to give credit for being right however disagreeable to going inexplicability of general conduct dwelt much on thought that be very particular in eating have by own unassisted observation already discovered why must say one thing so positively mean while be most unaccountable how be people at rate to be understood who henry must have be aware of what father be at from saturday to wednesday however be now to be without henry be sad finale of reflection captain tilneys letter must certainly come in absence wednesday be very sure must be wet past present future be equally in gloom brother so unhappy loss in isabella so great eleanors spirit always affected by henry absence what be there to interest amuse be tired of wood shrubberiesalways so smooth so dry abbey in be no more to now than other house painful remembrance of folly have helped to nourish perfect be only emotion must spring from consideration of building what revolution in idea who have so longed to be in abbey now there be nothing so charming to imagination a unpretending comfort of well connected parsonage something like fullerton better fullerton have fault woodston probably have none if wednesday must ever come did come exactly when might be reasonably looked for cameit be fineand catherine trod on air by ten oclock chaise four conveyed trio from abbey after agreeable drive of almost twenty mile entered woodston large populous village in situation not unpleasant catherine be ashamed to say how pretty thought a general seemed to think apology necessary for flatness of country size of village in heart preferred to place have ever be at looked with great admiration at neat house above rank of cottage at little chandler shop passed at further end of village tolerably disengaged from rest of stood parsonage new built substantial stone house with semicircular sweep green gate a drove up to door henry with friend of solitude large newfoundland puppy two three terrier be ready to receive make much of catherine mind be too full a entered house for to observe to say great deal till called on by general for opinion of have very little idea of room in be sitting upon looking round then perceived in moment that be most comfortable room in world be too guarded to say so coldness of praise disappointed be not calling good house said be not comparing with fullerton northangerwe be considering a mere parsonage small confined allow decent perhaps habitable altogether not inferior to generality in other word believe there be few country parsonage in england half so good may admit of improvement however far be from to say otherwise anything in reasona bow thrown out perhapsthough between ourselves if there be one thing more than aversion be patched on bow catherine did not hear enough of speech to understand be pained by other subject being studiously brought forward supported by henry at same time that tray full of refreshment be introduced by servant general be shortly restored to complacency catherine to usual ease of spirit room in question be of commodious well proportioned size handsomely fitted up a dining parlour on quitting to walk round ground be shown first into smaller apartment belonging peculiarly to master of house made unusually tidy on occasion afterwards into what be to be drawing room with appearance of though unfurnished catherine be delighted enough even to satisfy general be prettily shaped room window reaching to ground view from pleasant though only over green meadow expressed admiration at moment with honest simplicity with felt oh why fit up room mr tilney what pity not to have fitted up be prettiest room ever saw be prettiest room in world trust said general with most satisfied smile that will very speedily be furnished wait only for lady taste well if be house must never sit anywhere else oh what sweet little cottage there be among treesapple tree too be prettiest cottage like ityou approve a objectit be enough henry remember that robinson be spoken to about cottage remains such compliment recalled catherine consciousness silenced directly though pointedly applied to by general for choice of prevailing colour of paper hanging nothing like opinion on subject must be drawn from influence of fresh object fresh air however be of great use in dissipating embarrassing association having reached ornamental part of premise consisting of walk round two side of meadow on henry genius have begun to act about year ago be sufficiently recovered to think prettier than pleasure ground have ever be in before though there be not shrub in higher than green bench in corner saunter into other meadow through part of village with visit to stable to examine improvement charming game of play

gratifying have be tenor of conduct throughout whole visit so well assured be mind on subject of expectation must have felt equally confident of wish of son catherine must have quitted woodston with

ashamed of having ever loved profession of attachment be now a disgusting a excuse be empty demand impudent write to james on behalf james must never hear isabella name mentioned by again on henry arrival from woodston made known to eleanor brother safety congratulating with sincerity on reading aloud most material passage of letter with strong indignation when have finished itso much for isabella cried for intimacy must think idiot must not have written so perhaps have served to make character better known to than mine be to see what have be about be vain coquette trick have not answered believe have ever regard for james for wish have never known will soon be a if never have said henry there be one thing can not understand see that have have design on captain tilney have not succeeded understand what captain tilney have be about time why must pay such attention a to make quarrel with brother then fly off have very little to say for frederick motif such a believe to have be have vanity a well a miss thorpe chief difference be that having stronger head have not yet injured if effect of behaviour doe not justify with have better not seek after cause then suppose ever really cared about be persuaded that never did only made believe to do so for mischief sake henry bowed assent well then must say that like at though have turned out so well for like at a happens there be great harm done because think isabella have heart to lose suppose have made very much in love with must first suppose isabella to have have heart to loseconsequently to have be very different creature in case must have met with very different treatment be very right that must stand by brother if must stand by yours must not be much distressed by disappointment of miss thorpe mind be warped by innate principle of general integrity therefore not accessible to cool reasoning of family partiality desire of revenge catherine be complimented out of further bitterness frederick must not be unpardonably guilty while henry made so agreeable resolved on not answering isabella letter tried to think more of chapter soon after general found obliged to go to london for week left northanger earnestly regretting that necessity must rob even for hour of miss morlands company anxiously recommending study of comfort amusement to child a chief object in absence departure gave catherine first experimental conviction that loss may be sometimes gain happiness with time now passed employment voluntary laugh indulged meal scene of ease good humour walking where liked when liked hour pleasure fatigue at own command made thoroughly sensible of restraint general presence have imposed most thankfully feel present release from such ease such delight made love place people more more day have not be for dread of soon becoming expedient to leave one apprehension of not being equally beloved by other must at moment of day have be perfectly happy be now in fourth week of visit before general came home fourth week must be turned perhaps might seem intrusion if stayed much longer be painful consideration whenever occurred eager to get rid of such weight on mind very soon resolved to speak to eleanor about at once propose going away be guided in conduct by manner in proposal might be taken aware that if gave much time might feel difficult to bring forward so unpleasant subject took first opportunity of being suddenly alone with eleanor of eleanors being in middle of speech about something very different to start forth obligation of going away very soon eleanor looked declared much concerned have hoped for pleasure of company for much longer timehad be misled perhaps by wish to suppose that much longer visit have be promisedand must not think that if mr mr morland be aware of pleasure be to to have there must be too generous to hasten return catherine explained oh a to papa mamma be in hurry at a long a be happy must always be satisfied then why might ask in such hurry to leave oh because have be there so long nay if can use such word can urge farther if think long oh indeed for own pleasure must stay with a long again be directly settled that till have leaving be not even to be thought of in having cause of uneasiness so pleasantly removed force of other be likewise weakened kindness earnestness of eleanors manner in pressing to stay henry gratified look on being told that stay be determined be such sweet proof of importance with a left only just so much solicitude a human mind can never do comfortably without didalmost alwaysbelieve that henry loved quite always that father sister loved even wished to belong to believing so far doubt anxiety be merely sportive irritation henry be not able to obey father injunction of remaining wholly at northanger in attendance on lady during absence in engagement of curate at woodston obliging to leave on saturday for couple of night loss be not now what have be while general be at home lessened gaiety did not ruin comfort two girl agreeing in occupation improving in intimacy found so well sufficient for time to that be eleven oclock rather late hour at abbey before quitted supper room on day of henry departure have just reached head of stair when seemed a far a thickness of wall must allow to judge that carriage be driving up to door next moment confirmed idea by loud noise of house bell after first perturbation of surprise have passed away in good heaven what can be matter be quickly decided by eleanor to be eldest brother whose arrival be often a sudden if not quite so unseasonable accordingly hurried down to welcome catherine walked on to chamber making up mind a well a must to further acquaintance with captain tilney comforting under unpleasant impression conduct have given persuasion of being by far too fine gentleman to approve of at least must not meet under such circumstance a must make meeting materially painful trusted must never speak of miss thorpe indeed a must by time be ashamed of part have acted there must be danger of a long a mention of bath scene be avoided thought must behave to very civilly in such consideration time passed away be certainly in favour that eleanor must be so glad to see have so much to say for hour be almost gone since arrival eleanor did not come up at moment catherine thought heard step in gallery listened for continuance be silent scarcely however have convicted fancy of error when noise of something moving close to door made start seemed a if someone be touching very doorwayand in moment slight motion of lock proved that hand must be on trembled little at idea of anyones approaching so cautiously resolving not to be again overcome by trivial appearance of alarm misled by raised imagination stepped quietly forward opened door eleanor only eleanor stood there catherine spirit however be tranquillized for instant for eleanors cheek be pale manner greatly agitated though evidently intending to come in seemed effort to enter room still greater to speak when there catherine supposing uneasiness on captain tilneys account must only express concern by silent attention obliged to be seated rubbed temple with lavender water hung over with affectionate solicitude dear catherine must notyou must not indeed be eleanors first connected word be quite well kindness distracts mei can not bear iti come to on errand errand to how will tell oh how will tell new idea now darted into catherine mind turning a pale a friend exclaimed ti messenger from woodston be mistaken indeed returned eleanor looking at most compassionately be one from woodston be father voice faltered eye be turned to ground a mentioned name unlooked for return be enough in to make catherine heart sink for few moment hardly supposed there be anything worse to be told said nothing eleanor endeavouring to collect speak with firmness with eye still cast down soon went on be too good be sure to think worse of for part be obliged to perform be indeed most unwilling messenger after what have so lately passed so lately be settled between ushow joyfully how thankfully on sideas to continuing here a hoped for many many week longer how can tell that kindness be not to be acceptedand that happiness company have hitherto given be to be repaid bybut must not trust with word dear catherine be to part father have recollected engagement take whole family away on monday be going to lord longtowns near hereford for fortnight explanation apology be equally impossible can not attempt dear eleanor cried catherine suppressing feeling a well a must be so distressed second engagement must give way to first be very very sorry be to partso soon so suddenly too be not offended indeed be not can finish visit here know at time hope will come to can when return from lord come to fullerton will not be in power catherine come when can then eleanor made answer catherine thought recurring to something more directly interesting added thinking aloud mondayso soon a monday go well be certain ofi will be able to take leave however need not go till just before do know be distressed eleanor can go on monday very well father mother having notice of be of very little consequence general will send servant with dare say wayand then will soon be at salisbury then be only nine mile from home ah catherine be settled so must be somewhat le intolerable though in such common attention must have received what ought buthow can tell youtomorrow morning be fixed for leaving not even hour be left to choice very carriage be ordered will be here at seven oclock servant will be offered catherine sat down breathless speechless must hardly believe sens when heard displeasure resentment that can feel at moment however justly great can be more than myselfbut must not talk of what felt oh must suggest anything in extenuation good god what will father mother say after courting from protection of real friend to thisalmost double distance from home to have driven out of house without consideration even of decent civility dear dear catherine in being bearer of such message seem guilty myself of insult yet trust will acquit for must have be long enough in house to see that be nominal mistress of that real power be nothing have offended general said catherine in faltering voice ala for feeling a daughter know answer for be that can have given just cause of offence certainly be greatly very greatly discomposed have seldom seen more so temper be not happy something have now occurred to ruffle in uncommon degree disappointment vexation just at moment seems important can hardly suppose to have concern in for how be possible be with pain that catherine must speak at be only for eleanors sake that attempted be sure said be very sorry if have offended be last thing must willingly have done be unhappy eleanor engagement know must be kept be only sorry be not recollected sooner might have written home be of very little consequence hope earnestly hope that to real safety will be of none to everything else be of greatest consequence to comfort appearance propriety to family to world be friend allen still

better bred man in life lodging be taken very day after left catherine wonder milsom street know a walked home again mr morland endeavoured to impress on daughter mind happiness of having such steady well wishers a mr mr allen very little consideration neglect unkindness of slight acquaintance like tilneys ought to have with while must preserve good opinion affection of earliest friend there be great deal of good sense in there be situation of human mind in good sense have very little power catherine feeling contradicted almost position mother advanced be upon behaviour of very slight

be very reverse of that have be before for two day mr morland allowed to pas even without hint when third night rest have restored cheerfulness improved in useful activity given greater inclination for needlework must no longer refrain from gentle reproof of dear catherine be afraid be growing quite fine lady know when poor richards cravat must be done if have friend head run too much upon bath there be time for everythinga time for ball play time for work have have long run of amusement now must try to be useful catherine took up work directly saying in dejected voice that head did not run upon bathmuch then be fretting about general tilney be very simple of for ten to one whether ever see again must never fret about trifle after short silencei hope catherine be not getting out of humour with home because be not so grand a northanger must be turning visit into evil indeed wherever be must always be contented especially at home because there must spend most of time did not quite like at breakfast to hear talk so much about french bread at northanger be sure care about bread be same to what eat there be very clever essay in one of book upstairs upon much subject about young girl have be spoilt for home by great acquaintancethe mirror think will look out for day other because be sure will do good catherine said more with endeavour to do right applied to work after few minute sunk again without knowing into languor listlessness moving in chair from irritation of weariness much oftener than moved needle mr morland watched progress of relapse seeing in daughter absent dissatisfied look full proof of repining spirit to have now begun to attribute want of cheerfulness hastily left room to fetch book in question anxious to lose time in attacking so dreadful malady be time before must find what looked for other family matter occurring to detain quarter of hour have elapsed ere returned downstairs with volume from so much be hoped avocation above having shut out noise what created knew not that visitor have arrived within last few minute till on entering room first object beheld be young man whom have never seen before with look of much respect immediately rose being introduced to by conscious daughter a mr henry tilney with embarrassment of real sensibility began to apologize for appearance there acknowledging that after what have passed have little right to expect welcome at fullerton stating impatience to be assured of miss morlands having reached home in safety a cause of intrusion did not address to uncandid judge resentful heart far from comprehending sister in father misconduct mr morland have be always kindly disposed towards instantly pleased by appearance received with simple profession of unaffected benevolence thanking for attention to daughter assuring that friend of child be always welcome there entreating to say not word of past be not ill inclined to obey request for though heart be greatly relieved by such unlooked for mildness be not just at moment in power to say anything to purpose returning in silence to seat therefore remained for minute most civilly answering mr morlands common remark about weather road catherine meanwhilethe anxious agitated happy feverish catherinesaid not word glowing cheek brightened eye made mother trust that good natured visit must at least set heart at ease for time gladly therefore did lay aside first volume of mirror for future hour desirous of mr morlands assistance a well in giving encouragement a in finding conversation for guest whose embarrassment on father account earnestly pitied mr morland have very early dispatched one of child to summon mr morland be from homeand being thus without support at end of quarter of hour have nothing to say after couple of minute unbroken silence henry turning to catherine for first time since mother entrance asked with sudden alacrity if mr mr allen be now at fullerton on developing from amidst perplexity of word in reply meaning one short syllable must have given immediately expressed intention of paying respect to with rising colour asked if must have goodness to show way may see house from window sir be information on sarah side produced only bow of acknowledgment from gentleman silencing nod from mother for mr morland thinking probable a secondary consideration in wish of waiting on worthy neighbour that might have explanation to give of father behaviour must be more pleasant for to communicate only to catherine must not on account prevent accompanying began walk mr morland be not entirely mistaken in object in wishing explanation on father account have to give first purpose be to explain before reached mr allen ground have done so well that catherine did not think must ever be repeated too often be assured of affection heart in return be solicited perhaps pretty equally knew be already entirely own for though henry be now sincerely attached to though felt delighted in excellency of character truly loved society must confess that affection originated in nothing better than gratitude in other word that persuasion of partiality for have be only cause of giving serious thought be new circumstance in romance acknowledge dreadfully derogatory of heroine dignity if be a new in common life credit of wild imagination will at least be own very short visit to mr allen in henry talked at random without sense connection catherine rapt in contemplation of own unutterable happiness scarcely opened lip dismissed to ecstasy of tte tte before be suffered to close be enabled to judge how far be sanctioned by parental authority in present application on return from woodston two day before have be met near abbey by impatient father hastily informed in angry term of miss morlands

have saved from necessity of conscientious rejection by engaging faith before mentioned subject a proceeded to give particular explain motif of father conduct feeling soon hardened into even triumphant delight general have have nothing to accuse of nothing to lay to charge being involuntary unconscious object of deception pride must not pardon better pride must have be ashamed to own be guilty only of being le rich than have supposed to be under mistaken persuasion of possession claim have courted acquaintance in bath solicited company at northanger designed for daughter in law on discovering error to turn from house seemed best though to feeling inadequate proof of resentment towards contempt of family john thorpe have first misled general perceiving son one night at theatre
