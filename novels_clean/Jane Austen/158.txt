acquaintance increased so did satisfaction in other a walking companion emma have very early foreseen how useful might find in respect mr weston loss have be important father never went beyond shrubbery where two division of ground sufficed for long walk short a year varied since mr weston marriage exercise have be too much confined have ventured once alone to randalls be not pleasant harriet smith therefore one whom must summon at time to walk must be valuable addition to privilege in respect a saw more of approved be confirmed in kind design harriet certainly be not clever have sweet docile grateful disposition be totally free from conceit only desiring to be guided by one looked up to early attachment to herself be very amiable inclination for good company power of appreciating what be elegant clever shewed that there be want of taste though strength of understanding must not be expected altogether be quite convinced of harriet smith being exactly young friend wantedexactly something home required friend a mr weston be out of question two such must never be granted two such did not want be quite different sort of thing sentiment distinct independent mr weston be object of regard have basis in gratitude esteem harriet must be loved a one to whom must be useful for mr weston there be nothing to be done for harriet thing first attempt at usefulness be in endeavour to find out who be parent harriet must not tell be ready to tell thing in power on subject question be vain emma be obliged to fancy what likedbut must never believe that in same situation must not have discovered truth harriet have penetration have be satisfied to hear believe just what mr goddard chose to tell looked farther mr goddard teacher girl affair of school in general formed naturally great part of conversationand for acquaintance with martin of abbey mill farm must have be whole martin occupied thought good deal have spent two very happy month with now loved to talk of pleasure of visit describe many comfort wonder of place emma encouraged talkativenessamused by such picture of set of being enjoying youthful simplicity must speak with so much exultation of mr martin having two parlour two very good parlour indeed one of quite a large a mr goddard drawing room of having upper maid who have lived five twenty year with of having eight cow two of alderneys one little welch cow very pretty little welch cow indeed of mr martin saying a be so fond of must be called cow of having very handsome summer house in garden where day next year be to drink teaa very handsome summer house large enough to hold dozen people for time be amused without thinking beyond immediate cause a came to understand family better other feeling arose have taken up wrong idea fancying be mother daughter son son wife who lived together when appeared that mr martin who bore part in narrative be always mentioned with approbation for great good nature in doing something other be single man that there be young mr martin wife in case did suspect danger to poor little friend from hospitality kindness that if be not taken care of might be required to sink forever with inspiriting notion question increased in number meaning particularly led harriet to talk more of mr martin there be evidently dislike to harriet be very ready to speak of share have have in moonlight walk merry evening game dwelt good deal upon being so very good humoured obliging have gone three mile round one day in order to bring walnut because have said how fond be of in thing else be so very obliging have shepherd son into parlour one night on purpose to sing to be very fond of singing must sing little believed be very clever understood thing have very fine flock while be with have be bid more for wool than body in country believed body spoke well of mother sister be very fond of mr martin have told one day there be blush a said that be impossible for body to be better son therefore be sure whenever married must make good husband not that wanted to marry be in hurry at well done mr martin thought emma know what be about when have come away mr martin be so very kind a to send mr goddard beautiful goosethe finest goose mr goddard have ever seen mr goddard have dressed on sunday asked three teacher miss nash miss prince miss richardson to sup with mr martin suppose be not man of information beyond line of own business doe not read oh yesthat be noi knowbut believe have read good dealbut not what must think thing of read agricultural report other book that lay in one of window seatsbut read to sometimes of evening before went to card must read something aloud out of elegant extract very entertaining know have read vicar of wakefield never read romance of forest child of abbey have never heard of such book before mentioned be determined to get now a soon a ever can next question be what sort of looking man be mr martin oh not handsomenot at handsome thought very plain at first think so plain now one doe not know after time did never see be in highbury now then be sure to ride through week in way to kingston have passed very often may be may have seen fifty time without having idea of name young farmer whether on horseback on foot be very last sort of person to raise curiosity yeomanry be precisely order of people with whom feel can have nothing to do degree two lower creditable appearance might interest might hope to be useful to family in way other farmer can need none of help be therefore in one sense a much above notice a in other be below to be sure oh yes be not likely must ever have observed know very well indeedi mean by sight have doubt of being very respectable young man know indeed that be so a such wish well what do imagine age to be be four twenty th of last june birthday be rd just fortnight day differencewhich be very odd only four twenty be too young to settle mother be perfectly right not to be in hurry seem very comfortable a be if be to take pain to marry must probably repent six year hence if must meet with good sort of young woman in same rank a own with little money might be very desirable six year hence dear miss woodhouse must be thirty year old well be a early a most men can afford to marry who be not born to independence mr martin imagine have fortune entirely to makecannot be at beforehand with world money might come into when father died share of family property be dare say afloat employed in stock so forth though with diligence good luck may be rich in time be next to impossible that must have realised thing yet to be sure so be live very comfortably have indoors man else want for thing mr martin talk of taking boy year wish may not get into scrape harriet whenever doe marryi mean a to being acquainted with wifefor though sister from superior education be not to be altogether objected to doe not follow that might marry body at fit for to notice misfortune of birth ought to make particularly careful a to associate there can be doubt of being gentleman daughter must support claim to station by thing within own power there will be plenty of people who must take pleasure in degrading yes to be sure suppose there be while visit at hartfield be so kind to miss woodhouse be not afraid of what body can do understand force of influence pretty well harriet must have so firmly established in good society a to be independent even of hartfield miss woodhouse want to see permanently well connected to end will be advisable to have a few odd acquaintance a may be therefore say that if must still be in country when mr martin marries wish may not be drawn in by intimacy with sister to be acquainted with wife who will probably be mere farmer daughter without education to be sure yes not that think mr martin must ever marry body what have have educationand be very well brought up however mean to set up opinion against yoursand be sure will not wish for acquaintance of wife will always have great regard for miss martin especially elizabeth must be very sorry to give up for be quite a well educated a if marries very ignorant vulgar woman certainly have better not visit if can help emma watched through fluctuation of speech saw alarming symptom of love young man have be first admirer trusted there be other hold that there must be no serious difficulty on harriets side to oppose friendly arrangement of own met mr martin very next day a be walking on donwell road be on foot after looking very respectfully at looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at companion emma be not sorry to have such opportunity of survey walking few yard forward while talked together soon made quick eye sufficiently acquainted with mr robert martin appearance be very neat looked like sensible young man person have other advantage when came to be contrasted with gentleman thought must lose ground have gained in harriets inclination harriet be not insensible of manner have voluntarily noticed father gentleness with admiration a well a wonder mr martin looked a if did not know what manner be remained few minute together a miss woodhouse must not be kept waiting harriet then came running to with smiling face in flutter of spirit miss woodhouse hoped very soon to compose only think of happening to meet himhow very odd be quite chance said that have not gone round by randalls did not think ever walked road thought walked towards randalls most day have not be able to get romance of forest yet be so busy last time be at kingston that quite forgot go again to morrow so very odd must happen to meet well miss woodhouse be like what expected what do think of do think so very plain be very plain undoubtedlyremarkably plainbut be nothing compared with entire want of gentility have right to expect much did not expect much have idea that must be so very clownish so totally without air have imagined confess degree two nearer gentility to be sure said harriet in mortified voice be not so genteel a real gentleman think harriet since acquaintance with have be repeatedly in company of such very real gentleman that must be struck with difference in mr martin at hartfield have have very good specimen of well educated well bred men must be surprized if after seeing must be in company with mr martin again without perceiving to be very inferior creatureand rather wondering at for having ever thought at agreeable before begin to feel that now be not struck be sure must have be struck by awkward look abrupt manner uncouthness of voice heard to be wholly unmodulated a stood here certainly be not like mr knightley have not such fine air way of walking a mr knightley see difference plain enough mr knightley be so very fine man mr knightleys air be so remarkably good that be not fair to compare mr martin with might not see one in hundred with gentleman so plainly written a in mr knightley be not only gentleman have be lately used to what say to mr weston mr elton compare mr martin with of compare manner of carrying of walking of speaking of being silent must see difference oh yesthere be great difference mr weston be almost old man mr weston must be between forty fifty make good manner more valuable older person grows more important be that manner must not be bad more glaring disgusting loudness coarseness awkwardness becomes what be passable in youth be detestable in later age mr martin be now awkward abrupt what will be at mr weston time of life there be saying indeed replied harriet rather solemnly there may be pretty good guessing will be completely gross vulgar farmer totally inattentive to appearance thinking of nothing profit loss will indeed will be very bad how much business engrosses already be very plain from circumstance of forgetting to inquire for book recommended be great deal too full of market to think of thing elsewhich be just a must be for thriving man what have to do with book have doubt that will thrive be very rich man in timeand being illiterate coarse need not disturb wonder did not remember bookwas harriets answer spoken with degree of grave displeasure emma thought might be safely left to therefore said more for time next beginning be in one respect perhaps mr eltons manner be superior to mr knightleys mr weston have more gentleness might be more safely held up a pattern there be openness quickness almost bluntness in mr weston body like in because there be so much good humour with itbut must not do to be copied must mr knightleys downright decided commanding sort of manner though suit very well figure look situation in life seem to allow if young man be to set about copying must not be sufferable on contrary think young man might be very safely recommended to take mr elton a model mr elton be good humoured cheerful obliging gentle seems to to be grown particularly gentle of late know whether have design of ingratiating with of harriet by additional softness strike that manner be softer than used to be if mean thing must be to please did not tell what said of other day then repeated warm personal praise have drawn from mr elton now did full justice to harriet blushed smiled said have always thought mr elton very agreeable mr elton be very person fixed on by emma for driving young farmer out of harriets head thought must be excellent match only too palpably desirable natural probable for to have much merit in planning feared be what body else must think of predict be not likely however that body must have equalled in date of plan a have entered brain during very first evening of harriets coming to hartfield longer considered greater be sense of expediency mr eltons situation be most suitable quite gentleman without low connexion at same time not of family must fairly object to doubtful birth of harriet have comfortable home for emma imagined very sufficient income for though vicarage of highbury be not large be known to have independent property thought very highly of a good humoured well meaning respectable young man without deficiency of useful understanding knowledge of world have already satisfied that thought harriet beautiful girl trusted with such frequent meeting at hartfield be foundation enough on side on harriets there must be little doubt that idea of being preferred by must have usual weight efficacy be really very pleasing young man young man whom woman not fastidious might like be reckoned very handsome person much admired in general though not by there being want of elegance of feature must not dispense withbut girl who must be gratified by robert martin riding about country to get walnut for might very well be conquered by mr eltons admiration chapter v know what opinion may be mr weston said mr knightley of great intimacy between emma harriet smith think bad thing bad thing do really think bad thingwhy so think will of do other good surprize emma must do harriet good by supplying with new object of interest harriet may be said to do emma good have be seeing intimacy with greatest pleasure how very differently feelnot think will do other good will certainly be beginning of one of quarrel about emma mr knightley perhaps think be come on purpose to quarrel with knowing weston to be out that must still fight own battle mr weston must undoubtedly support if be here for think exactly a do on subject be speaking of only yesterday agreeing how fortunate be for emma that there must be such girl in highbury for to associate with mr knightley will not allow to be fair judge in case be so much used to live alone that know value of companion perhaps man can be good judge of comfort woman feel in society of one of own sex after being used to life can imagine objection to harriet smith be not superior young woman emmas friend ought to be on other hand a emma want to see better informed will be inducement to to read more will read together mean know emma have be meaning to read more ever since be twelve year old have seen great many list of drawing up at various time of book that meant to read regularly throughand very good list werevery well chosen very neatly arrangedsometimes alphabetically sometimes by other rule list drew up when only fourteeni remember thinking did judgment so much credit preserved time dare say may have made out very good list now have done with expecting course of steady reading from emma will never submit to thing requiring industry patience subjection of fancy to understanding where miss taylor failed to stimulate may safely affirm that harriet smith will hingyou never must persuade to read half so much a wishedyou know must not dare say replied mr weston smiling thought so thenbut since have parted can never remember emmas omitting to do thing wished there be hardly desiring to refresh memory a thatsaid mr knightley feelingly for moment two have done soon added who have have such charm thrown over sens must still see hear remember emma be spoiled by being cleverest of family at ten year old have misfortune of being able to answer question puzzled sister at seventeen be always quick assured isabella slow diffident ever since be twelve emma have be mistress of house of in mother lost only person able to cope with inherits mother talent must have be under subjection to must have be sorry mr knightley to be dependent on recommendation have quitted mr woodhouses family wanted situation think must have spoken good word for to body be sure always thought unfit for office held yes said smiling be better placed here very fit for wife not at for governess be preparing to be excellent wife time be at hartfield might not give emma complete education a power must seem to promise be receiving very good education from on very material matrimonial point of submitting own will doing a be bid if weston have asked to recommend wife must certainly have named miss taylor thank there will be very little merit in making good wife to man a mr weston why to own truth be afraid be rather thrown away that with disposition to bear there will be nothing to be borne will not despair however weston may grow cross from wantonness of comfort son may plague hope not thatit be not likely mr knightley foretell vexation from quarter not indeed only name possibility pretend to emmas genius for foretelling guessing hope with heart young man may be weston in merit churchill in fortunebut harriet smithi have not half done about harriet smith think very worst sort of companion that emma must possibly have know nothing look upon emma a knowing thing be flatterer in way so much worse because undesigned ignorance be hourly flattery how can emma imagine have thing to learn while harriet be presenting such delightful inferiority a for harriet will venture to say that can not gain by acquaintance hartfield will only put out of conceit with other place belongs to will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable with among whom birth circumstance have placed home be much mistaken if emmas doctrine give strength of mind tend at to make girl adapt rationally to variety of situation in only give little polish depend more upon emmas good sense than do be more anxious for present comfort for can not lament acquaintance how well looked last night oh must rather talk of person than mind must very well will not attempt to deny emmas being pretty pretty say beautiful rather can imagine thing nearer perfect beauty than emma altogetherface figure know what must imagine confess have seldom seen face figure more pleasing to than hers be partial old friend eyethe true hazle eyeand so brilliant regular feature open countenance with complexion oh what bloom of full health pretty height size such firm upright figure there be health not merely in bloom in air head glance one hears sometimes of child being picture of health now emma always give idea of being complete picture of grown up health be loveliness mr knightley be not have not fault to find with person replied think describe love to look at will add praise think personally vain considering how very handsome be appears to be little occupied with vanity lie way mr weston be not to be talked out of dislike of harriet smith dread of doing harm mr knightley be equally stout in confidence of not doing harm with dear emmas little fault be excellent creature where will see better daughter kinder sister truer friend have quality may be trusted will never lead one really wrong will make lasting blunder where emma errs once be in right hundred time very well will not plague more emma will be angel will keep spleen to myself till christmas brings john isabella john love emma with reasonable therefore not blind affection isabella always think a doe except when be not quite frightened enough about child be sure of having opinion with know that love really too well to be unjust unkind excuse mr knightley if take liberty consider know a having somewhat of privilege of speech that emmas mother might have have liberty of hinting that think possible good can arise from harriet smith intimacy being made matter of much discussion among pray excuse supposing little inconvenience may be apprehended from intimacy can not be expected that emma accountable to nobody father who perfectly approves acquaintance must put end to so long a be source of pleasure to herself have be so many year province to give advice that can not be surprized mr knightley at little remains of office not at cried be much obliged to for be very good advice will have better fate than advice have often found for will be attended to mr john knightley be easily alarmed might be made unhappy about sister be satisfied said will not raise outcry will keep ill humour to have very sincere interest in emma isabella doe not seem more sister have never excited greater interest perhaps hardly so great there be anxiety curiosity in what one feel for emma wonder what will become of so do said mr weston gently very much always declares will never marry of course mean just nothing at have idea that have yet ever seen man cared for must not be bad thing for to be very much in love with proper object must like to see emma in love in doubt of return must do good there be nobody hereabouts to attach go so seldom from home there doe indeed seem a little to tempt to break resolution at present said mr weston a can well be while be so happy at hartfield can not wish to be forming attachment must be creating such difficulty on poor mr woodhouses account recommend matrimony at present to emma though mean slight to state assure part of meaning be to conceal favourite thought of own mr weston on subject a much a possible there be wish at randalls respecting emmas destiny be not desirable to have suspected quiet transition mr knightley soon afterwards made to what doe weston think of weather will have rain convinced that have nothing more to say surmise about hartfield chapter vi emma must not feel doubt of having given harriets fancy proper direction raised gratitude of young vanity to very good purpose for found decidedly more sensible than before of mr eltons being remarkably handsome man with most agreeable manner a have hesitation in following up assurance of admiration by agreeable hint be soon pretty confident of creating a much liking on harriets side a there must be occasion for be quite convinced of mr eltons being in fairest way of falling in love if not in love already have scruple with regard to talked of harriet praised so warmly that must not suppose thing wanting little time must not add perception of striking improvement of harriets manner since introduction at hartfield be not one of least agreeable proof of growing attachment have given miss smith that required said have made graceful easy be beautiful creature when came to in opinion attraction have added be infinitely superior to what received from nature be glad think have be useful to harriet only wanted drawing out receiving few very few hint have natural grace of sweetness of temper artlessness in have done very little if be admissible to contradict lady said gallant mr elton have perhaps given little more decision of character have taught to think on point have not fallen in way before exactly so be what principally strike so much superadded decision of character skilful have be hand great have be pleasure be sure never met with disposition more truly amiable have doubt of be spoken with sort of sighing animation have vast deal of lover be not le pleased day with manner in seconded sudden wish of hers to have harriets picture did ever have likeness taken harriet said did ever sit for picture harriet be on point of leaving room only stopt to say with very interesting navet oh dear never sooner be out of sight than emma exclaimed what exquisite possession good picture of must be must give money for almost long to attempt likeness know dare say two three year ago have great passion for taking likeness attempted several of friend be thought to have tolerable eye in general from one cause gave up in disgust really must almost venture if harriet must sit to must be such delight to have picture let entreat cried mr elton must indeed be delight let entreat miss woodhouse to exercise so charming talent in favour of friend know what drawing be how must suppose ignorant be not room rich in specimen of landscape flower have not mr weston inimitable figure piece in drawing room at randalls yes good manthought emmabut what have that to do with taking likeness know nothing of drawing dont pretend to be in rapture about mine keep rapture for harriets face well if give such kind encouragement mr elton believe will try what can do harriets feature be very delicate make likeness difficult yet there be peculiarity in shape of eye line about mouth one ought to catch exactly sothe shape of eye line about mouthi have not doubt of success pray pray attempt a will do will indeed to use own word be exquisite possession be afraid mr elton harriet will not like to sit think so little of own beauty did not observe manner of answering how completely meant why must picture be drawn oh yes observed assure be not lost on still can not imagine must not be persuaded harriet be soon back again proposal almost immediately made have scruple must stand many minute against earnest pressing of others emma wished to go to work directly therefore produced portfolio containing various attempt at portrait for not one of have ever be finished that might decide together on best size for harriet many beginning be displayed miniature half length whole length pencil crayon water colour have be tried in turn have always wanted to do thing have made more progress in drawing music than many might have done with so little labour a must ever submit to played sangand drew in almost style steadiness have always be wanting in nothing have approached degree of excellence must have be glad to command ought not to have failed of be not much deceived a to own skill a artist musician be not unwilling to have others deceived sorry to know reputation for accomplishment often higher than deserved there be merit in drawingin least finished perhaps most style be spirited have there be much le have there be ten time more delight admiration of two companion must have be same be in ecstasy likeness plea body miss woodhouses performance must be capital great variety of face for said emma have only own family to study from there be fatheranother of fatherbut idea of sitting for picture made so nervous must only take by stealth neither of very like therefore mr weston again again again see dear mr weston always kindest friend on occasion must sit whenever asked there be sister really quite own little elegant figureand face not unlike must have made good likeness of if must have sat longer be in such hurry to have draw four child that must not be quiet then here come attempt at three of four childrenthere be henry john bella from one end of sheet to other one of might do for one of rest be so eager to have drawn must not refuse there be making child of three four year old stand still know can be very easy to take likeness of beyond air complexion unless be coarser featured

much of being finished when put away in pet vowed must never take likeness must not help being provoked for after pain when have really made very good likeness of itmrs weston be quite agreed in thinking very likeonly too handsometoo flatteringbut be fault on right sideafter came poor dear isabella cold approbation ofyes be little likebut to be sure did not do justice have have great deal of trouble in persuading to sit at be made great favour of altogether be more than must bear so never must finish to have apologised over a unfavourable likeness to morning visitor in brunswick squareand a said did then forswear ever drawing body again for harriets sake rather for own a there be husband wife in case at present will break resolution now mr elton seemed very properly struck delighted by idea be repeating husband wife in case at present indeed a observe exactly so husband wife with so interesting consciousness emma began to consider whether have not better leave together at once a wanted to be drawing declaration must wait little longer have soon fixed on size sort of portrait be to be whole length in water colour like mr john knightleys be destined if must please to hold very honourable station over mantelpiece sitting began harriet smiling blushing afraid of not keeping attitude countenance presented very sweet mixture of youthful expression to steady eye of artist there be doing thing with mr elton fidgeting behind watching touch gave credit for stationing where might gaze gaze again without offence be really obliged to put end to request to place elsewhere then occurred to to employ in reading if must be so good a to read to must be kindness indeed must amuse away difficulty of part lessen irksomeness of miss smith mr elton be only too happy harriet listened emma drew in peace must allow to be still frequently coming to look thing le must certainly have be too little in lover be ready at smallest intermission of pencil to jump up see progress be charmedthere be being displeased with such encourager for admiration made discern likeness almost before be possible must not respect eye love complaisance be unexceptionable sitting be altogether very satisfactory be quite enough pleased with first day sketch to wish to go on there be want of likeness have be fortunate in attitude a meant to throw in little improvement to figure to give little more height considerably more elegance have great confidence of being in way pretty drawing at last of filling destined place with credit to botha standing memorial of beauty of one skill of other friendship of with a many other agreeable association a mr eltons very promising attachment be likely to add harriet be to sit again next day mr elton just a ought entreated for permission of attending reading to again by mean will be most happy to consider a one of party same civility courtesy same success satisfaction took place on morrow accompanied whole progress of picture be rapid happy body who saw be pleased mr elton be in continual rapture defended through criticism miss woodhouse have given friend only beauty wantedobserved mr weston to himnot in least suspecting that be addressing loverthe expression of eye be most correct miss smith have not eyebrow eyelash be fault of face that have not do think so replied can not agree with appears to most perfect resemblance in feature never saw such likeness in life must allow for effect of shade know have made too tall emma said mr knightley emma knew that have must not own mr elton warmly added oh certainly not too tall not in least too tall consider be sitting downwhich naturally present differentwhich in short give exactly ideaand proportion must be preserved know proportion fore shorteningoh give one exactly idea of such height a miss smith exactly so indeed be very pretty said mr woodhouse so prettily done just a drawing always be dear know body who draw so well a do only thing thoroughly like be that seems to be sitting out of door with only little shawl over shouldersand make one think must catch cold dear papa be supposed to be summer warm day in summer look at tree be never safe to sit out of door dear sir may say thing cried mr elton must confess that regard a most happy thought placing of miss smith out of door tree be touched with such inimitable spirit other situation must have be much le in character navet of miss smith mannersand altogetheroh be most admirable can not keep eye from never saw such likeness next thing wanted be to get picture framed here be few difficulty must be done directly must be done in london order must go through hand of intelligent person whose taste must be depended on isabella usual doer of commission must not be applied to because be december mr woodhouse must not bear idea of stirring out of house in fog of december sooner be distress known to mr elton than be removed gallantry be always on alert might be trusted with commission what infinite pleasure must have in executing must ride to london at time be impossible to say how much must be gratified by being employed on errand be too goodshe must not endure thoughtshe must not give troublesome office for worldbrought on desired repetition of entreaty assurancesand very few minute settled business mr elton be to take drawing to london chuse frame give direction emma thought must so pack a to ensure safety without much incommoding while seemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough what precious deposit said with tender sigh a received man be almost too gallant to be in love thought emma must say so that suppose there may be hundred different way of being in love be excellent young man will suit harriet exactly will be exactly so a say doe sigh languish study for compliment rather more than must endure a principal come in for pretty good share a second be gratitude on harriets account chapter vii very day of mr eltons going to london produced fresh occasion for emmas service towards friend harriet have be at hartfield a usual soon after breakfast after time have gone home to return again to dinner returned sooner than have be talked of with agitated hurried look announcing something extraordinary to have happened be longing to tell minute brought out have heard a soon a got back to mr goddard mr martin have be there hour before finding be not at home particularly expected have left little parcel for from one of sister gone away on opening parcel have actually found besides two song have lent elizabeth to copy letter to herself letter be from from mr martin contained direct proposal of marriage who must have thought be so surprized did not know what to do yes quite proposal of marriage very good letter at least thought so wrote a if really loved very muchbut did not knowand so be come a fast a must to ask miss woodhouse what must do be half ashamed of friend for seeming so pleased so doubtful upon word cried young man be determined not to lose thing for want of asking will connect well if can will read letter cried harriet pray do iid rather must emma be not sorry to be pressed read be surprized style of letter be much above expectation there be not merely grammatical error a composition must not have disgraced gentleman language though plain be strong unaffected sentiment conveyed very much to credit of writer be short expressed good sense warm attachment liberality propriety even delicacy of feeling paused over while harriet stood anxiously watching for opinion with well well be at last forced to add be good letter be too short yes indeed very good letter replied emma rather slowlyso good letter harriet thing considered think one of sister must have helped can hardly imagine young man whom saw talking with other day must express so well if left quite to own power yet be not style of woman certainly be too strong concise not diffuse enough for woman doubt be sensible man suppose may have natural talent forthinks strongly clearlyand when take pen in hand thought naturally find proper word be so with men yes understand sort of mind vigorous decided with sentiment to certain point not coarse better written letter harriet returning than have expected well said still waiting harrietwellandand what will do what will do in what respect do mean with regard to letter yes what be in doubt of must answer of courseand speedily yes what will say dear miss woodhouse do advise oh letter have much better be own will express very properly be sure there be danger of not being intelligible be first thing meaning must be unequivocal doubt demur such expression of gratitude concern for pain be inflicting a propriety requires will present unbidden to mind be persuaded need not be prompted to write with appearance of sorrow for disappointment think ought to refuse then said harriet looking down ought to refuse dear harriet what do mean be in doubt a to thoughtbut beg pardon perhaps have be under mistake certainly have be misunderstanding if feel in doubt a to purport of answer have imagined be consulting only a to wording of harriet be silent with little reserve of manner emma continued mean to return favourable answer collect be meanwhat will do what must advise to do pray dear miss woodhouse tell ought to do will not give advice harriet will have nothing to do with be point must settle with feeling have notion that liked so very much said harriet contemplating letter for little while emma persevered in silence beginning to apprehend bewitching flattery of letter might be too powerful thought best to say lay down a general rule harriet that if woman doubt a to whether must accept man not certainly ought to refuse if can hesitate a to yes ought to say directly be not state to be safely entered into with doubtful feeling with heart thought duty a friend older than to say thus much to imagine want to influence oh be sure be great deal too kind tobut if must just advise have best dono mean thatas say one mind ought to be quite made upone must not be hesitatingit be very serious thingit will be safer to say perhapsdo think have better say not for world said emma smiling graciously must advise way must be best judge of own happiness if prefer mr martin to other person if think most agreeable man have ever be in company with why must hesitate blush harrietdoes body else occur to at moment under definition harriet harriet deceive be run away with by gratitude compassion at moment whom be thinking of symptom be favourableinstead of answering harriet turned away confused stood thoughtfully by fire though letter be still in hand be now mechanically twisted about without regard emma waited result with impatience not without strong hope at last with hesitation harriet said miss woodhouse a will not give opinion must do a well a can by have now quite determined really almost made up mindto refuse mr martin do think be right perfectly perfectly right dearest harriet be doing just what ought while be at in suspense kept feeling to myself now that be so completely decided have hesitation in approving dear harriet give joy of must have grieved to lose acquaintance must have be consequence of marrying mr martin while be in smallest degree wavering said nothing about because must not influence must have be loss of friend to must not have visited mr robert martin of abbey mill farm now be secure of for ever harriet have not surmised own danger idea of struck forcibly must not have visited cried looking aghast to be sure must not never thought of before must have be too dreadfulwhat escapedear miss woodhouse must not give up pleasure honour of being intimate with for thing in world indeed harriet must have be severe pang to lose must have be must have thrown out of good society must have given up dear mehow must ever have borne must have killed never to come to hartfield more dear affectionate creatureyou banished to abbey mill farmyou confined to society of illiterate vulgar life wonder how young man must have assurance to ask must have pretty good opinion of think be conceited either in general said harriet conscience opposing such censure at least be very good natured will always feel much obliged to have great regard forbut be quite different thing fromand know though may like doe not follow shouldand certainly must confess that since visiting here have seen peopleand if one come to compare person manner there be comparison at one be so very handsome agreeable however do really think mr martin very amiable young man have great opinion of being so much attached to meand writing such letterbut a to leaving be what must not do upon consideration thank thank own sweet little friend will not be parted woman be not to marry man merely because be asked because be attached to can write tolerable letter oh noand be short letter too emma felt bad taste of friend let pas with very true must be small consolation to for clownish manner might be offending hour of day to know that husband must write good letter oh yes very nobody care for letter thing be to be always happy with pleasant companion be quite determined to refuse how will do what will say emma assured there must be difficulty in answer advised being written directly be agreed to in hope of assistance though emma continued to protest against assistance being wanted be in fact given in formation of sentence looking over letter again in replying to have such softening tendency that be particularly necessary to brace up with few decisive expression be so very much concerned at idea of making unhappy thought so much of what mother sister must think say be so anxious that must not fancy ungrateful that emma believed if young man have come in way at moment must have be accepted after letter however be written sealed sent business be finished harriet safe be rather low evening emma must allow for amiable regret sometimes relieved by speaking of own affection sometimes by bringing forward idea of mr elton will never be invited to abbey mill again be said in rather sorrowful tone if be must ever bear to part with harriet be great deal too necessary at hartfield to be spared to abbey mill be sure must never want to go there for be never happy at hartfield time afterwards be think mr goddard must be very much surprized if knew what have happened be sure miss nash wouldfor miss nash think own sister very well married be only linen draper one must be sorry to see greater pride refinement in teacher of school harriet dare say miss nash must envy opportunity a of being married even conquest must appear valuable in eye a to thing superior for suppose be quite in dark attention of certain person can hardly be among tittle tattle of highbury yet hitherto fancy be only people to whom look manner have explained harriet blushed smiled said something about wondering that people must like so much idea of mr elton be certainly cheering still after time be tender hearted again towards rejected mr martin now have got letter said softly wonder what be doingwhether sister knowif be unhappy will be unhappy too hope will not mind so very much let think of among absent friend who be more cheerfully employed cried emma at moment perhaps mr elton be shewing picture to mother sister telling how much more beautiful be original after being asked for five six time allowing to hear name own dear name picturebut have left picture in bond street have sothen know nothing of mr elton dear little modest harriet depend upon picture will not be in bond street till just before mount horse to morrow be companion evening solace delight open design to family introduces among diffuses through party pleasantest feeling of nature eager curiosity warm prepossession how cheerful how animated how suspicious how busy imagination be harriet smiled again smile grew stronger chapter viii harriet slept at hartfield night for week past have be spending more than half time there gradually getting to have bed room appropriated to herself emma judged best in respect safest kindest to keep with a much a possible just at present be obliged to go next morning for hour two to mr goddard be then to be settled that must return to hartfield to make regular visit of day while be gone mr knightley called sat time with mr woodhouse emma till mr woodhouse who have previously made up mind to walk out be persuaded by daughter not to defer be induced by entreaty of though against scruple of own civility to leave mr knightley for purpose mr knightley who have nothing of ceremony about be offering by short decided answer amusing contrast to protracted apology civil hesitation of other well believe if will excuse mr knightley if will not consider a doing very rude thing will take emmas advice go out for quarter of hour a sun be out believe have better take three turn while can treat without ceremony mr knightley invalid think be privileged people dear sir make stranger of leave excellent substitute in daughter emma will be happy to entertain therefore think will beg excuse take three turnsmy winter walk can not do better sir must ask for pleasure of company mr knightley be very slow walker pace must be tedious to besides have long walk before to donwell abbey thank sir thank be going moment think sooner go better will fetch greatcoat open garden door for mr woodhouse at last be off mr knightley instead of being immediately off likewise sat down again seemingly inclined for more chat began speaking of harriet speaking of with more voluntary praise than emma have ever heard before can not rate beauty a do said be pretty little creature be inclined to think very well of disposition character depends upon be with in good hand will turn out valuable woman be glad think so good hand hope may not be wanting come said be anxious for compliment so will tell that have improved have cured of school girl giggle really doe credit thank must be mortified indeed if did not believe have be of use be not body who will bestow praise where may often overpower with be expecting again say morning almost moment have be gone longer already than intended something have happened to delay visitor perhaps highbury gossipstiresome wretch harriet may not consider body tiresome that must emma knew be too true for contradiction therefore said nothing presently added with smile pretend to fix on time place must tell have good reason to believe little friend will soon hear of something to advantage indeed how so of what sort very serious sort assure still smiling very serious can think of one thingwho be in love with who make confidant emma be more than half in hope of mr eltons having dropt hint mr knightley be sort of general friend adviser knew mr elton looked up to have reason to think replied that harriet smith will soon have offer of marriage from most unexceptionable quarterrobert martin be man visit to abbey mill summer seems to have done business be desperately in love mean to marry be very obliging said emma be sure that harriet mean to marry well well mean to make offer then will do came to abbey two evening ago on purpose to consult about know have thorough regard for family believe considers a one of best friend came to ask whether thought must be imprudent in to settle so early whether thought too young in short whether approved choice altogether having apprehension perhaps of being considered especially since making so much of a in line of society above be very much pleased with that said never hear better sense from one than robert martin always speaks to purpose open straightforward very well judging told thing circumstance plan what proposed doing in event of marriage be excellent young man a son brother have hesitation in advising to marry proved to that must afford that being case be convinced must not do better praised fair lady too altogether sent away very happy if have never esteemed opinion before must have thought highly of then dare say left house thinking best friend counsellor man ever have happened night before last now a may fairly suppose must not allow much time to pas before spoke to lady a doe not appear to have spoken yesterday be not unlikely that must be at mr goddard to day may be detained by visitor without thinking at tiresome wretch pray mr knightley said emma who have be smiling to herself through great part of speech how do know that mr martin did not speak yesterday certainly replied surprized absolutely know may be inferred be not whole day with come said will tell something in return for what have told did speak yesterdaythat be wrote be refused be obliged to be repeated before must be believed mr knightley actually looked red with surprize displeasure a stood up in tall indignation said then be greater simpleton than ever believed what be foolish girl about oh to be sure cried emma be always incomprehensible to man that woman must ever refuse offer of marriage man always imago woman to be ready for body who asks nonsense man doe not imagine such thing what be meaning of harriet smith refuse robert martin madness if be so hope be mistaken saw answernothing must be clearer saw answeryou wrote answer too emma be doing persuaded to refuse if did however be far from allowing must not feel that have done wrong mr martin be very respectable young man can not admit to be harriets equal be rather surprized indeed that must have ventured to address by account doe seem to have have scruple be pity that be ever got over not harriets equal exclaimed mr knightley loudly warmly with calmer asperity added few moment afterwards be not equal indeed for be a much superior in sense a in situation emma infatuation about girl blind be harriet smith claim of birth nature education to connexion higher than robert martin be natural daughter of nobody know whom with probably settled provision at certainly respectable relation be known only a parlour boarder at common school be not sensible girl girl of information have be taught nothing useful be too young too simple to have acquired thing herself at age can have experience with little wit be not very likely ever to have can avail be pretty be good tempered be only scruple in advising match be on account a being beneath desert bad connexion for felt that a to fortune in probability might do much better that a to rational companion useful helpmate must not do worse must not reason so to man in love be willing to trust to there being harm in to having that sort of disposition in good hand like might be easily led aright turn out very well advantage of match felt to be on side have not smallest doubt have now that there must be general cry out upon extreme good luck even satisfaction made sure of crossed mind immediately that must not regret friend leaving highbury for sake of being settled so well remember saying to myself even emma with partiality for harriet will think good match can not help wondering at knowing so little of emma a to say such thing what think farmer with sense merit mr martin be nothing more good match for intimate friend not regret leaving highbury for sake of marrying man whom must never admit a acquaintance of own wonder must think possible for to have such feeling assure mine be very different must think statement by mean fair be not just to harriets claim must be estimated very differently by others a well a mr martin may be richest of two be undoubtedly inferior a to rank in societythe sphere in move be much above hisit must be degradation degradation to illegitimacy ignorance to be married to respectable intelligent gentleman farmer a to

disinclined to know well have too much real feeling to address woman on haphazard of selfish passion a to conceit be farthest from of man know depend upon have encouragement be most convenient to emma not to make direct reply to assertion chose rather to take up own line of subject again be very warm friend to mr martin a said before be unjust to harriet harriets claim to marry well be not so contemptible a represent be not clever girl have better sense than be aware of doe not deserve to have understanding spoken of so slightingly waiving that point however supposing to be a describe only pretty good natured let tell that in degree posse be not trivial recommendation to world in general for be in fact beautiful girl must be thought so by ninety nine people out of hundred till appears that men be much more philosophic on subject of beauty than be generally supposed till do fall in love with well informed mind instead of handsome face girl with such loveliness a harriet have certainty of being admired sought after of having power of chusing from among many consequently claim to be nice good nature too be not so very slight claim comprehending a doe real thorough sweetness of temper manner very humble opinion of herself great readiness to be pleased with other people be very much mistaken if sex in general must not think such beauty such temper highest claim woman must posse upon word emma to hear abusing reason have be almost enough to make think so too better be without sense than misapply a do to be sure cried playfully know be feeling of know that girl a harriet be exactly what man delight inwhat at once bewitches sens satisfies judgment oh harriet may pick chuse be ever to marry be very woman for be at seventeen just entering into life just beginning to be

myself now perceive that will be very unfortunate one for harriet will puff up with such idea of own beauty of what have claim to in little while nobody within reach will be good enough for vanity working on weak head produce sort of mischief nothing so easy a for young lady to raise expectation too high miss harriet smith may not find offer of marriage flow in so fast though be very pretty

man of consequence large fortune may be parlour boarder at mr goddard rest of lifeor at least for harriet smith be girl who will marry somebody other till grow desperate be glad to catch at old writing master son think so very differently on point mr knightley that there can be use in canvassing will only be making other more angry a to letting marry robert martin be impossible have refused so decidedly think a must prevent second application must abide by evil of having refused whatever may be a to refusal will not pretend to say might not influence little assure there be very little for for body to do appearance be so much against manner so bad that if ever be disposed to favour be not now can imagine that before have seen body superior might tolerate be brother of friend took

education manner have chance with harriet nonsense errant nonsense a ever be talked cried mr knightleyrobert martin manner have sense sincerity good humour to recommend mind have more true gentility than harriet smith must understand emma made answer tried to look cheerfully unconcerned be really feeling uncomfortable wanting very much to be gone did not repent what have done still thought better judge of such point of female right refinement than must be yet have sort of habitual respect for judgment in general made dislike having so loudly against to have sitting just opposite to in angry state be very disagreeable minute passed in unpleasant silence with only one attempt on emmas side to talk of weather made answer be thinking result of thought appeared at last in word robert martin have great lossif can think so hope will not be long before doe view for harriet be best known to yourself a make secret of love of match making be fair to suppose view plan project haveand a friend will just hint to that if elton be man think will be labour in vain emma laughed disclaimed continued depend upon will not do elton be very good sort of man very respectable vicar of highbury not at

opinion be right adversary wrong a mr knightley walked off in more complete self approbation than left for be not so materially cast down however that little time return of harriet be very adequate restorative harriets staying away so long be beginning to make uneasy possibility of young man coming to mr goddard that morning meeting with harriet pleading own cause gave alarming idea dread of failure after became prominent uneasiness when harriet appeared in very good spirit without having such reason to give for long absence felt satisfaction settled with own mind convinced that let mr knightley think say what must have done nothing woman friendship woman feeling must not justify have frightened little about mr elton when considered that mr knightley must not have observed a have done neither with interest must be allowed to tell in spite of mr knightleys pretension with skill of such observer on question a herself that have spoken hastily in anger be able to believe that have rather said what wished resentfully to be true than what knew thing about certainly might have heard mr elton speak with more unreserve than have ever done mr elton might not be of imprudent inconsiderate disposition a to money matter might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to then mr knightley did not make due allowance for influence of strong passion at war with interested motif mr knightley saw such passion of course thought nothing of effect saw too much of to feel doubt of overcoming hesitation that reasonable prudence might originally suggest more than reasonable

colonel mr campbell will not be able to part with at must be such delightful companion for emma mr woodhouse agreed to added little friend harriet smith however be just such pretty kind of young person will like harriet emma must not have better companion than harriet be most happy to hear itbut only jane fairfax one know to be so very accomplished superiorand exactly emmas age topic be discussed very happily others succeeded of similar moment passed away with similar harmony evening did not close without little return of agitation gruel came supplied great deal to be saidmuch praise many commentsundoubting decision of wholesomeness for constitution pretty severe philippic upon many house where be never met with tolerablybut unfortunately among failure daughter have to instance most recent therefore most prominent be in own cook at south end young woman hired for time who never have be able to understand what meant by basin of nice smooth gruel thin not too thin often a have wished for ordered have never be able to get thing tolerable here be dangerous opening ah said mr woodhouse shaking head fixing eye on with tender concernthe ejaculation in emmas ear expressed ah there be end of sad consequence of going to south end doe not bear talking of for little while hoped must not talk of that silent rumination might suffice to restore to relish of own smooth gruel after interval of minute however began with will always be very sorry that went to sea autumn instead of coming here why must be sorry siri assure did child great deal of good moreover if must go to sea have better not have be to south end south end be unhealthy place perry be surprized to hear have fixed upon south end know there be such idea with many people indeed be quite mistake sirwe have health perfectly well there never found least inconvenience from mud mr wingfield say be entirely mistake to suppose place unhealthy be sure may be depended on for thoroughly understands nature of air own brother family have be there repeatedly must have gone to cromer dear if went anywhereperry be week at cromer once hold to be best of sea bathing place fine open sea say very pure air by what understand might have have lodging there quite away from seaa quarter of mile offvery comfortable must have consulted perry dear sir difference of journeyonly consider how great must have beenan hundred mile perhaps instead of forty ah dear a perry say where health be at stake nothing else must be considered if one be to travel there be not much to chuse between forty mile hundredbetter not move at better stay in london altogether than travel forty mile to get into worse air be just what perry said seemed to very ill judged measure emmas attempt to stop father have be vain when have reached point a must not wonder at brother in law breaking out mr perry said in voice of very strong displeasure must do a well to keep opinion till be asked for why doe make business of to wonder at what doat taking family to one part of coast anotheri may be allowed hope use of judgment a well a mr perryi want direction more than drug pausedand growing cooler in moment added with only sarcastic dryness if mr perry can tell how to convey wife five child distance of hundred thirty mile with greater expense inconvenience than distance of forty must be a willing to prefer cromer to south end a must true true cried mr knightley with most ready interpositionvery true thats consideration indeedbut john a to what be telling of idea of moving path to langham of turning more to right that may not cut through home meadow can not conceive difficulty must not attempt if be to be mean of inconvenience to highbury people if call to mind exactly present line of path only way of proving however will be to turn to map will see at abbey to morrow morning hope then will look over will give opinion mr woodhouse be rather agitated by such harsh reflection on friend perry to whom have in fact though unconsciously be attributing many of own feeling expressionsbut soothing attention of daughter gradually removed present evil immediate alertness of one brother better recollection of other prevented renewal of chapter xiii there must hardly be happier creature in world than mr john knightley in short visit to hartfield going about morning among old acquaintance with five child talking over what have done evening with father sister have nothing to wish otherwise that day did not pas so swiftly be delightful visitperfect in being much too short in general evening be le engaged with friend than morning one complete dinner engagement out of house too there be avoiding though at christmas mr weston must take denial must dine at randalls one dayeven mr woodhouse be persuaded to think possible thing in preference to division of party how be to be conveyed must have made difficulty if must a son daughter carriage horse be actually at hartfield be not able to make more than simple question on head hardly amounted to doubt did occupy emma long to convince that might in one of carriage find room for harriet also harriet mr elton mr knightley own especial set be only person invited to meet themthe hour be to be early a well a number few mr woodhouses habit inclination being consulted in thing evening before great event for be very great event mr woodhouse must dine out on th of december have be spent by harriet at hartfield have gone home so much indisposed with cold for own earnest wish of being nursed by mr goddard emma must not have allowed to leave house emma called on next day found doom already signed with regard to randalls be very feverish have bad sore throat mr goddard be full of care affection mr perry be talked of harriet herself be too ill low to resist authority excluded from delightful engagement though must not speak of loss without many tear emma sat with a long a must to attend in mr goddard unavoidable absence raise spirit by representing how much mr eltons must be depressed when knew state left at last tolerably comfortable in sweet dependence of having most comfortless visit of missing very much have not advanced many yard from mr goddard door when be met by mr elton evidently coming towards a walked on slowly together in conversation about invalidof whom on rumour of considerable illness have be going to inquire that might carry report of to hartfieldthey be overtaken by mr john knightley returning from daily visit to donwell with two eldest boy whose healthy glowing face shewed benefit of country run seemed to ensure quick despatch of roast mutton rice pudding be hastening home for joined company proceeded together emma be just describing nature of friend complainta throat very much inflamed with great deal of heat about quick low pulse c be sorry to find from mr goddard that harriet be liable to very bad sore throat have often alarmed with mr elton looked alarm on occasion a exclaimed sore throati hope not infectious hope not of putrid infectious sort have perry seen indeed must take care of a well a of friend let entreat to run risk why doe not perry see emma who be not really at frightened tranquillised excess of apprehension by assurance of mr goddard experience care a there must still remain degree of uneasiness must not wish to reason away must rather feed assist than not added soon afterwardsas if quite subject be so cold so very coldand look feel so very much like snow that if be to other place with other party must really try not to go out to dayand dissuade father from venturing a have made up mind doe not seem to feel cold like to interfere a know must be so great disappointment to mr mr weston upon word mr elton in case must certainly excuse appear to little hoarse already when consider what demand of voice what fatigue to morrow will bring think must be no more than common prudence to stay at home take care of to night mr elton looked a if did not very well know what answer to make be exactly case for though very much gratified by kind care of fair lady not liking to resist advice of hers have not really least inclination to give up visitbut emma too eager busy in own previous conception view to hear impartially see with clear vision be very well satisfied with muttering acknowledgment of being very cold certainly very cold walked on rejoicing in having extricated from randalls secured power of sending to inquire after harriet hour of evening do quite right said shewe will make apology to mr mr weston hardly have so spoken when found brother be civilly offering seat in carriage if weather be mr eltons only objection mr elton actually accepting offer with much prompt satisfaction be done thing mr elton be to go never have broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at moment never have smile be stronger eye more exulting than when next looked at well said to herself be most strangeafter have got off so well to chuse to go into company leave harriet ill behindmost strange indeedbut there be believe in many men especially single men such inclinationsuch passion for dining outa dinner engagement be so high in class of pleasure employment dignity almost duty that thing give way to itand must be case with mr elton most valuable amiable pleasing young man undoubtedly very much in love with harriet still can not refuse invitation must dine out wherever be asked what strange thing love be can see ready wit in harriet will not dine alone for soon afterwards mr elton quitted must not do justice of feeling that there be great deal of sentiment in manner of naming harriet at parting in tone of voice while assuring that must call at mr goddard for news of fair friend last thing before prepared for happiness of meeting again when hoped to be able to give better report sighed smiled off in way left balance of approbation much in favour after few minute of entire silence between john knightley began with never in life saw man more intent on being agreeable than mr elton be downright labour to where lady be concerned with men can be rational unaffected when have lady to please feature work mr eltons manner be not perfect replied emma where there be wish to please one ought to overlook one doe overlook great deal where man doe best with only moderate power will have advantage over negligent superiority there be such perfect good temper good will in mr elton a one can not value yes said mr john knightley presently with slyness seems to have great deal of good will towards replied with smile of astonishment be imagining to be mr eltons object imagination have crossed own emma if never occurred to before may a well take into consideration now mr elton in love with mewhat idea say be so will do well to consider whether be so not to regulate behaviour accordingly think manner to encouraging speak a friend emma have better look about ascertain what do what mean to do thank assure be quite mistaken mr elton be very good friend nothing more walked on amusing in consideration of blunder often arise from partial knowledge of circumstance of mistake people of high pretension to judgment be for ever falling into not very well pleased with brother for imagining blind ignorant in want of counsel said more mr woodhouse have so completely made up mind to visit that in spite of increasing coldness seemed to have idea of shrinking from set forward at last most punctually with eldest daughter in own carriage with le apparent consciousness of weather than of others too full of wonder of own going pleasure be to afford at randalls to see that be cold too well wrapt up to feel cold however be severe by time second carriage be in motion few flake of snow be finding way down sky have appearance of being so overcharged a to want only milder air to produce very white world in very short time emma soon saw that companion be not in happiest humour preparing going abroad in such weather with sacrifice of child after dinner be evil be disagreeables at least mr john knightley did not by mean like anticipated nothing in visit must be at worth purchase whole of drive to vicarage be spent by in expressing discontent man said must have very good opinion of when asks people to leave own fireside encounter such day a for sake of coming to see must think most agreeable fellow must not do thing be greatest absurdityactually snowing at momentthe folly of not allowing people to be comfortable at folly of people not staying comfortably at home when can if be obliged to go out evening a by call of duty business what hardship must deem itand here be probably with rather thinner clothing than usual setting forward voluntarily without excuse in defiance of voice of nature tell man in thing given to view feeling to stay at home keep under shelter that canhere be setting forward to spend five dull hour in man house with nothing to say to hear be not said heard yesterday may not be said heard again to morrow going in dismal weather to return probably in worsefour horse four servant taken out for nothing to convey five idle shivering creature into colder room worse company than might have have at home emma did not find equal to give pleased assent doubt be in habit of receiving to emulate very true love must have be usually administered by travelling companion have resolution enough to refrain from making answer at must not be complying dreaded being quarrelsome heroism reached only to silence allowed to talk arranged glass wrapped up without opening lip arrived carriage turned step be let down mr elton spruce black smiling be with instantly emma thought with pleasure of change of subject mr elton be obligation cheerfulness be so very cheerful in civility indeed that began to think must have received different account of harriet from what have reached have sent while dressing answer have be much samenot better report from mr goddard said presently be not so pleasant a have hopednot better be answer face lengthened immediately voice be voice of sentiment a answered oh noi be grieved to findi be on point of telling that when called at mr goddard door did very last thing before returned to dress be told that miss smith be not better by mean better rather worse very much grieved concernedi have flattered that must be better after such cordial a knew have be given her in morning emma smiled answeredmy visit be of use to nervous part of complaint hope not even can charm away sore throat be most severe cold indeed mr perry have be with a probably heard imaginedthat isi did not have be used to in complaint hope to morrow morning will bring more comfortable report be impossible not to feel uneasiness sad loss to party to day dreadfulexactly so indeedshe will be missed moment be very proper sigh accompanied be really estimable must have lasted longer emma be rather in dismay when only minute afterwards began to speak of other thing in voice of greatest alacrity enjoyment what excellent device said use of sheepskin for carriage how very comfortable make itimpossible to feel cold with such precaution contrivance of modern day indeed have rendered gentleman carriage perfectly complete one be so fenced guarded from weather that not breath of air can find way unpermitted weather becomes absolutely of consequence be very cold afternoonbut in carriage know nothing of matterha snow little see yes said john knightley think will have good deal of christmas observed mr elton quite seasonable extremely fortunate may think that did not begin yesterday prevent day party might very possibly have done for mr woodhouse must hardly have ventured have there be much snow on ground now be of consequence be quite season indeed for friendly meeting at christmas body invite friend about people think little of even worst weather be snowed up at friend house once for week nothing must be pleasanter went for only one night must not get away till very day sennight mr john knightley looked a if did not comprehend pleasure said only coolly can not wish to be snowed up week at randalls at time emma might have be amused be too much astonished now at mr eltons spirit for other feeling harriet seemed quite forgotten in expectation of pleasant party be sure of excellent fire continued thing in greatest comfort charming people mr mr westonmrs weston indeed be much beyond praise be exactly what one value so hospitable so fond of societyit will be small party where small party be select be perhaps most agreeable of mr weston dining room doe not accommodate more than ten comfortably for part must rather under such circumstance fall short by two than exceed by two think will agree with turning with soft air to emma think will certainly have approbation though mr knightley perhaps from being used to large party of london may not quite enter into feeling know nothing of large party of london siri never dine with body indeed in tone of wonder pity have idea that law have be so great slavery well sir time must come when will be paid for when will have little labour great enjoyment first enjoyment replied john knightley a passed through sweep gate will be to find safe at hartfield again chapter xiv change of countenance be necessary for gentleman a walked into mr weston drawing roommr elton must compose joyous look mr john knightley disperse ill mr elton must smile le mr john knightley more to fit for placeemma only might be a nature prompted shew just a happy a be to be real enjoyment to be with weston mr weston be great favourite there be not creature in world to whom spoke with such unreserve a to wife not one to whom related with such conviction of being listened to understood of being always interesting always intelligible little affair arrangement perplexity pleasure of father must tell nothing of hartfield in mr weston have not lively concern hour uninterrupted communication of little matter on daily happiness of private life depends be one of first gratification of be pleasure perhaps whole day visit might not afford certainly did not belong to present half hour very sight of mr weston smile touch voice be grateful to emma determined to think a little a possible of mr eltons oddity of thing else unpleasant enjoy be enjoyable to utmost misfortune of harriets cold have be pretty well gone through before arrival mr woodhouse have be safely seated long enough to give history of besides history of own isabella coming of emmas being to follow have indeed just got to end of satisfaction that james must come see daughter when others appeared mr weston who have be almost wholly engrossed by attention to be able to turn away welcome dear emma emmas project of forgetting mr elton for while made rather sorry to find when have taken place that be close to difficulty be great of driving strange insensibility towards harriet from mind while not only sat at elbow be continually obtruding happy countenance on notice solicitously addressing upon occasion instead of forgetting behaviour be such that must not avoid internal suggestion of can really be a brother imagined can be possible for man to be beginning to transfer affection from harriet to meabsurd insufferableyet must be so anxious for being perfectly warm must be so interested about father so delighted with mr weston at last must begin admiring drawing with so much zeal so little knowledge a seemed terribly like must be lover made effort with to preserve good manner for own sake must not be rude for harriets in hope that must yet turn out right be even positively civil be effort especially a something be going on amongst others in most overpowering period of mr eltons nonsense particularly wished to listen to heard enough to know mr weston be giving information about son heard word son frank son repeated several time over from few other half syllable very much suspected that be announcing early visit from son before must quiet mr elton subject be so completely past that reviving question from must have be awkward now so happened that in spite of emmas resolution of never marrying there be something in name in idea of mr frank churchill always interested have frequently thoughtespecially since father marriage with miss taylorthat if be to marry be very person to suit in age character condition seemed by connexion between family quite to belong to must not suppose to be match body who knew must think of mr mr weston did think of be very strongly persuaded though not meaning to be induced by by body else to give up situation believed more replete with good than must change for have great curiosity to see decided intention of finding pleasant of being liked by to certain degree sort of pleasure in idea of being coupled in friend imagination with such sensation mr eltons civility be dreadfully ill timed have comfort of appearing very polite while feeling very crossand of thinking that rest of visit must not possibly pas without bringing forward same information again substance of from open hearted mr westonso provedfor when happily released from mr elton seated by mr weston at dinner made use of very first interval in care of hospitality very first leisure from saddle of mutton to say to want only two more to be just right number must like to see two more hereyour pretty little friend miss smith sonand then must say be quite complete believe did not hear telling others in drawing room that be expecting frank have letter from morning will be with within fortnight emma spoke with very proper degree of pleasure fully assented to proposition of mr frank churchill miss smith making party quite complete have be wanting to come to continued mr weston ever since september letter have be full of can not command own time have to please who must be pleased who between ourselves be sometimes to be pleased only by good many sacrifice now have doubt of seeing here about second week in january what

being here good friend there nodding towards upper end of table have so few vagary have be so little used to at hartfield that can not calculate on effect a have be long in practice of doing be sorry there must be thing like doubt in case replied emma be disposed to side with mr weston if think will come will think so too for know enscombe yesi have right to knowledge though have never be at place in lifeshe be odd womanbut never allow to speak ill of on frank account for do believe to be very fond of used to think be not capable of being fond of body except have always be kind to in wayallowing for little whim caprice expecting thing to be a like be small credit in opinion to that must excite affection for though must not say to body else have more heart than stone to people in general devil of temper emma liked subject so well that began upon to mr weston very soon after moving into drawing room wishing joyyet observing that knew first meeting must be rather alarming mr weston agreed to added that must be very glad to be secure of undergoing anxiety of first meeting at time talked of for can not depend upon coming can not be so sanguine a mr weston be very much afraid that will end in nothing mr weston dare say have be telling exactly how matter stand yesit seems to depend upon nothing ill humour of mr churchill imagine to be most certain thing in world emma replied mr weston smiling what be certainty of caprice then turning to isabella who have not be attending beforeyou must know dear mr knightley that be by mean so sure of seeing mr frank churchill in opinion a father think depends entirely upon aunt spirit pleasure in short upon temper to youto two daughtersi may venture on truth mr churchill rule at enscombe be very odd tempered woman coming now depends upon being willing to spare oh mr churchill body know mr churchill replied isabella be sure never think of poor young man without greatest compassion to be constantly living with ill tempered person must be dreadful be what happily have never known thing of must be life of misery what blessing that never have child poor little creature how unhappy must have made emma wished have be alone with mr weston must then have heard more mr weston must speak to with degree of unreserve must not hazard with isabella really believed must scarcely try to conceal thing relative to churchill from excepting view on young man of own imagination have already given such instinctive knowledge at present there be nothing more to be said mr woodhouse very soon followed into drawing room to be sitting long after dinner be confinement that must not endure wine conversation be thing to gladly did move to with whom be always comfortable while talked to isabella however emma found opportunity of saying so consider visit from son a by mean certain be sorry for introduction must be unpleasant whenever take place sooner must be over better yes delay make one more apprehensive of other delay even if family braithwaites be put off be still afraid that excuse may be found for disappointing can not bear to imagine reluctance on side be sure there be great wish on churchill to keep to there be jealousy be jealous even of regard for father in short can feel dependence on coming wish mr be le sanguine ought to come said emma if must stay only couple of day ought to come one can hardly conceive young man not having in power to do a much a that young woman if fall into bad hand may be teased kept at distance from want to be with one can not comprehend young man being under such restraint a not to be able to spend week with father if like one ought to be at enscombe know way of family before one decides upon what can do replied mr weston one ought to use same caution perhaps in judging of conduct of one individual of one family enscombe believe certainly must not be judged by general rule be so very unreasonable thing give way to be so fond of nephew be so very great favourite now according to idea of mr churchill must be most natural that while make sacrifice for comfort of husband to whom owes thing while exercise incessant caprice towards must frequently be governed by nephew to whom owes nothing at dearest emma pretend with sweet temper to understand bad one to lay down rule for must let go own way have doubt of having at time considerable influence may be perfectly impossible for to know beforehand when will be emma listened then coolly said will not be satisfied unless come may have great deal of influence on point continued mr weston on others

instead of harriet inconstancy if real most contemptible abominable have difficulty in behaving with temper turned to mr weston to implore assistance must not give supportwould not add persuasion to to induce miss woodhouse not to go to mr goddard till be certain that miss smith disorder have infection must not be satisfied without promisewould not give influence in procuring so scrupulous for others continued yet so careless for wanted to nurse cold by staying at home to day yet will not promise to avoid danger of catching ulcerated sore throat be fair mr westonjudge between have not right

approbation of plan mr weston must only approve isabella then went to emma emma must not so entirely give up hope of being able to get away be still discussing point when mr knightley who have left

grateful respect to a harriets friend to mr john knightley be indebted for first idea on subject for first start of possibility there be denying that brother have penetration remembered what mr knightley have once said to about mr elton caution have given conviction have professed that mr elton must never marry indiscreetly blushed to think how much truer knowledge of character have be there

will hardly fail to bring return of spirit youth cheerfulness of morning be in happy analogy of powerful operation if distress be not poignant enough to keep eye unclosed will be sure to open to sensation of softened pain brighter hope emma got up on morrow more disposed for comfort than have gone to bed more ready to see alleviation of evil before to depend on getting tolerably out of be great consolation that mr elton must not be really in love with so particularly amiable a to make shocking to disappoint himthat harriets nature must not be of superior sort in feeling be most acute retentiveand that there must be necessity for body knowing what have passed except three principal especially for father being given moment uneasiness about be very cheering thought sight of great deal of snow on ground did further service for thing be welcome that might justify three being quite asunder at present weather be most favourable for though christmas day must not go to church mr woodhouse must have be miserable have daughter attempted be therefore safe from exciting receiving unpleasant most unsuitable idea ground covered with snow atmosphere in unsettled state between frost thaw be of others most unfriendly for exercise morning beginning in rain snow evening setting in to freeze be for many day most honourable prisoner intercourse with harriet possible by note church for on sunday more than on christmas day need to find excuse for mr eltons absenting be weather might fairly confine body at home though hoped believed to be really taking comfort in society other be very pleasant to have father so well satisfied with being alone in own house too wise to stir out to hear say to mr knightley whom weather must keep entirely from ah mr knightley why stay at home like poor mr elton day of confinement must have be for private perplexity remarkably comfortable a such seclusion exactly suited brother whose feeling must always be of great importance to companion have besides so thoroughly cleared off ill humour at randalls that amiableness never failed during rest of stay at hartfield be always agreeable obliging speaking pleasantly of body with hope of cheerfulness present comfort of delay there be still such evil hanging over in hour of explanation with harriet a made impossible for emma to be ever perfectly at ease chapter xvii mr mr john

set off return to lamentation over destiny of poor isabellawhich poor isabella passing life with doated on full of merit blind to fault always innocently busy might have be model of right feminine evening of very day on went brought note from mr elton to mr woodhouse long civil ceremonious note to say with mr eltons best compliment that be proposing to leave following morning in way to bath where in compliance with pressing entreaty of friend have engaged to spend few week very much regretted impossibility be under from various circumstance of weather business of taking personal leave of mr woodhouse of whose friendly civility must ever retain grateful senseand have mr woodhouse command must be happy to attend to emma be most agreeably surprizedmr eltons absence just at time be very thing to be desired admired for contriving though not able to give much credit for manner in be announced resentment must not have be more plainly spoken than in civility to father from be so pointedly excluded have not even share in opening complimentsher name be not mentionedand there be so striking change in ill judged solemnity of leave taking in graceful acknowledgment a thought at first must not escape father suspicion did howeverher father be quite taken up with surprize of so sudden journey fear that mr elton might never get safely to end of saw nothing extraordinary in language be very useful note for supplied with fresh matter for thought conversation during rest of lonely evening mr woodhouse talked over alarm emma be in spirit to persuade away with usual promptitude now resolved to keep harriet longer in dark have reason to believe nearly recovered from cold be desirable that must have a much time a possible for getting better of other complaint before gentleman return went to mr goddard accordingly very next day to undergo necessary penance of communication severe one have to destroy hope have be so industriously feedingto appear in ungracious character of one preferredand acknowledge grossly mistaken mi judging in idea on one subject observation conviction prophecy for last six week confession completely renewed first shameand sight of harriets tear made think that must never be in charity with herself again harriet bore intelligence very wellblaming nobodyand in thing testifying such ingenuousness of disposition lowly opinion of a must appear with particular advantage at moment to friend emma be in humour to value simplicity modesty to utmost be amiable ought to be attaching seemed on harriets side not own harriet did not consider a having thing to complain of affection of such man a mr elton must have be too great distinctionshe never must have deserved himand nobody so partial kind friend a miss woodhouse must have thought possible tear fell abundantlybut grief be so truly artless that dignity must have made more respectable in emmas eyesand listened to tried to console with heart understandingreally for time convinced that harriet be superior creature of twoand to resemble must be more for own welfare happiness than genius intelligence must do be rather too late in day to set about being simple minded ignorant left with previous resolution confirmed of being humble discreet repressing imagination rest of life second duty now inferior only to father claim be to promote harriets comfort endeavour to prove own affection in better method than by match making got to hartfield shewed most unvarying kindness striving to occupy amuse by book conversation to drive mr elton from thought time knew must be allowed for being thoroughly done must suppose indifferent judge of such matter in general very inadequate to sympathise in attachment to mr elton in particular seemed to reasonable that at harriets age with entire extinction of hope progress might be made towards state of composure by time of mr eltons return a to allow to meet again in common routine of acquaintance without danger of betraying sentiment increasing harriet did think perfection maintained non existence of body equal to in person goodnessand did in truth prove more resolutely in love than emma have foreseen yet appeared to so natural so inevitable to strive against inclination of sort unrequited that must not comprehend continuing very long in equal force if mr elton on return made own indifference a evident indubitable a must not doubt must anxiously do must not imagine harriets persisting to place happiness in sight recollection of being fixed so absolutely fixed in same place be bad for for three not one of have power of removal of effecting material change of society must encounter other make best of harriet be farther unfortunate in tone of companion at mr goddard mr elton being adoration of teacher great girl in school must be at hartfield only that must have chance of hearing spoken of with cooling moderation repellent truth where wound have be given there must cure be found if anywhere emma felt that till saw in way of cure there must be true peace for chapter xviii mr frank churchill did not come when time proposed drew near mr weston fear be justified in arrival of letter of excuse for present must not be spared to very great mortification regret still looked forward with hope of coming to randalls at distant period mr weston be exceedingly disappointedmuch more disappointed in fact than husband though dependence on seeing young man have be so much more sober sanguine temper though for ever expecting more good than occurs doe not always pay for hope by proportionate depression soon fly over present failure begin to hope again for hour mr weston be surprized sorry then began to perceive that frank coming two three month later must be much better plan better time of year better weather that must be able without doubt to stay considerably longer with than if have come sooner feeling rapidly restored comfort while mr weston of more apprehensive disposition foresaw nothing repetition of excuse delay after concern for what husband be to suffer great deal more emma be not at time in state of spirit to care really about mr frank churchill not coming except a disappointment at randalls acquaintance at present have charm for wanted rather to be quiet out of temptation still a be desirable that must appear in general like usual self took care to express a much interest in circumstance enter a warmly into mr mr weston disappointment a might naturally belong to friendship be first to announce to mr knightley exclaimed quite a much a be necessary being acting part perhaps rather more at conduct of churchill in keeping away then proceeded to say good deal more than felt of advantage of such addition to confined society in surry pleasure of looking at somebody new gala day to highbury entire sight of must have made ending with reflection on churchill again found directly involved in disagreement with mr knightley to great amusement perceived that be taking other side of question from real opinion making use of mr weston argument against churchill be very likely in fault said mr knightley coolly dare say might come if must know why must say so wish exceedingly to come uncle aunt will not spare can not believe that have not power of coming if made point of be too unlikely for to believe without proof how odd be what have mr frank churchill done to make suppose such unnatural creature be not supposing at unnatural creature in suspecting that may have learnt to be above connexion to care very little for thing own pleasure from living with who have always set example of be great deal more natural than one must wish that young man brought up by who be proud luxurious selfish must be proud luxurious selfish too if frank churchill have wanted to see father must have contrived between september january man at agewhat be hethree four twentycannot be without mean of doing a much a that be impossible thats easily said easily felt by who have always be own master be worst judge in world mr knightley of difficulty of dependence know what be to have temper to manage be not to be conceived that man of three four

ever at watering place other little while ago be at weymouth prof that can leave churchill yes sometimes can time be whenever think worth while whenever there be temptation of pleasure be very unfair to judge of body conduct without intimate knowledge of situation nobody who have not be in interior of family can say what difficulty of individual of family may be ought to be acquainted with enscombe with mr churchill temper before pretend to decide upon what nephew can do may at time be able to do great deal more than can at others there be one thing emma man can always do if chuses be duty not by manoeuvring finessing by vigour resolution be frank churchill duty to pay attention to father know to be so by promise message if wished to do might be done man who felt rightly must say

take back to country seat baly craig beautiful place fancy jane have heard great deal of beauty from mr dixon meani know that ever heard about from body else be very natural know that must like to speak of own place while be paying addressesand a jane used to be very often walking out with themfor colonel mr campbell be very particular about daughter not walking out often with only mr dixon for at blame of course heard thing might be telling miss campbell about own home in ireland think wrote word that have shewn drawing of place view that have taken be most amiable charming young man believe jane be quite longing to go to ireland from account of thing at moment ingenious animating suspicion entering emmas brain with regard to jane fairfax charming mr dixon not going to ireland said with insidious design of farther discovery must feel very fortunate that miss fairfax must be allowed to come to at time considering very particular friendship between mr dixon must hardly have expected to be excused from accompanying colonel mr campbell very true very true indeed very thing that have always be rather afraid of for must not have liked to have at distance from for month togethernot able to come if thing be to happen see thing turn out for best want mr mr dixon excessively to come over with colonel mr campbell quite depend upon nothing can be more kind pressing than joint invitation jane say a will hear presently mr dixon doe not seem in least backward in attention be most charming young man ever since service rendered jane at weymouth when be out in party on water by sudden whirling round of something other among sail must have be dashed into sea at once actually be gone if have not with greatest presence of mind caught hold of habit can never think of without tremblingbut ever since have history of day have be so fond of mr dixon in spite of friend urgency own wish of seeing ireland miss fairfax prefers devoting time to mr bates yesentirely own doing entirely own choice colonel mr campbell think doe quite right just what must recommend indeed particularly wish to try native air a have not be quite so well a usual lately be concerned to hear of think judge wisely mr dixon must be very much disappointed mr dixon understand have remarkable degree of personal beauty be not by mean to be compared with miss fairfax oh be very obliging to say such thingsbut certainly not there be comparison between miss campbell always be absolutely plainbut extremely elegant amiable yes that of course jane caught bad cold poor thing so long ago a th of november a be going to read to have never be well since long time be not for cold to hang upon never mentioned before because must not alarm just like so consideratebut however be so far from well that kind friend campbell think have better come home try air always agrees with have doubt that three four month at highbury will entirely cure herand be certainly great deal better that must come here than go to ireland if be unwell nobody must nurse a must do appears to most desirable arrangement in world so be to come to next friday saturday campbell leave town in way to holyhead monday followingas will find from janes letter so suddenyou may guess dear miss woodhouse what flurry have thrown in if be not for drawback of illnessbut be afraid must expect to see grown thin looking very poorly must tell what unlucky thing happened to a to always make point of reading janes letter through to myself first before read aloud to mother know for fear of there being thing in to distress jane desired to do so always do so began to day with usual caution sooner did come to mention of being unwell than burst out quite frightened with bless poor jane be illwhich mother being on watch heard distinctly be sadly alarmed at however when read on found be not near so bad a have fancied at first make so light of now to that doe not think much about can not imagine how must be so off guard if jane doe not get well soon will call in mr perry expense will not be thought of though be so liberal so fond of jane dare say must not mean to charge thing for attendance must not suffer to be so know have wife family to maintain be not to be giving away time well now have just given hint of what jane writes about will turn to letter be sure tell own story great deal better than can tell for be afraid must be running away said emma glancing at harriet beginning to risemy father will be expecting have intention thought have power of staying more than five minute when first entered house merely called because must not pas door without inquiring after mr bates have be so pleasantly detained now however must wish mr bates good morning not must be urged to detain succeeded regained streethappy in though much have be forced on against will though have in fact heard whole substance of jane fairfaxs letter have be able to escape letter chapter ii jane fairfax be orphan only child of mr batess youngest daughter marriage of lieut fairfax of regiment of infantry miss jane bates have have day of fame pleasure hope interest nothing now remained of save melancholy remembrance of dying in action abroadof widow sinking under consumption grief soon afterwardsand girl by birth belonged to highbury when at three year old on losing mother became property charge consolation foundling of grandmother aunt there have seemed probability of being permanently fixed there of being taught only what very limited mean must command growing up with advantage of connexion improvement to be engrafted on what nature have given in pleasing person good understanding warm hearted well meaning relation compassionate feeling of friend of father gave change to destiny be colonel campbell who have very highly regarded fairfax a excellent officer most deserving young man farther have be indebted to for such attention during severe camp fever a believed have saved life be claim did not learn to overlook though year passed away from death of poor fairfax before own return to england put thing in power when did return sought out child took notice of be married man with only one living child girl about janes age jane became guest paying long visit growing favourite with before be nine year old daughter great fondness for own wish of being real friend united to produce offer from colonel campbell of undertaking whole charge of education be accepted from period jane have belonged to colonel campbell family have lived with entirely only visiting grandmother from time to time plan be that must be brought up for educating others very few hundred pound inherited from father making independence impossible to provide for otherwise be out of colonel campbell power for though income by pay appointment be handsome fortune be moderate must be daughter by giving education hoped to be supplying mean of respectable subsistence hereafter such be jane fairfaxs history have fallen into good hand known nothing kindness from campbell be given excellent education living constantly with right minded well informed people heart understanding have received advantage of discipline culture colonel campbell residence being in london lighter talent have be done full justice to by attendance of first rate master disposition ability be equally worthy of friendship must do at eighteen nineteen be a far a such early age can be qualified for care of child fully competent to office of instruction be too much beloved to be parted with father mother must promote daughter must not endure evil day be put off be easy to decide that be still too young jane remained with sharing a daughter in rational pleasure of elegant society judicious mixture of home amusement with only drawback of future sobering suggestion of own good understanding to remind that might soon be over affection of whole family warm attachment of miss campbell in particular be more honourable to party from circumstance of janes decided superiority in beauty acquirement that nature have given in feature must not be unseen by young woman must higher power of mind be unfelt by parent continued together with unabated regard however till marriage of miss campbell who by chance that luck so often defies anticipation in matrimonial affair giving attraction to what be moderate rather than to what be superior engaged affection of mr dixon young man rich agreeable almost a soon a be acquainted be eligibly happily settled while jane fairfax have yet bread to earn event have very lately taken place too lately for thing to be yet attempted by le fortunate friend towards entering on path of duty though have now reached age own judgment have fixed on for beginning have long resolved that one twenty must be period with fortitude of devoted novitiate have resolved at one twenty to complete sacrifice retire from pleasure of life of rational intercourse equal society peace hope to penance mortification for ever good sense of colonel mr campbell must not oppose resolution though feeling did a long a lived exertion must be necessary home might be hers for ever for own comfort must have retained wholly must be selfishnesswhat must be at last have better be soon perhaps began to feel might have be kinder wiser to have resisted temptation of delay spared from taste of such enjoyment of ease leisure a must now be relinquished still however affection be glad to catch at reasonable excuse for not hurrying on wretched moment have never be quite well since time of daughter marriage till must have completely recovered usual strength must forbid engaging in duty so far from being compatible with weakened frame varying spirit seemed under most favourable circumstance to require something more than human perfection of body mind to be discharged with tolerable comfort with regard to not accompanying to ireland account to aunt contained nothing truth though there might be truth not told be own choice to give time of absence to highbury to spend perhaps last month of perfect liberty with kind relation to whom be so very dear campbell might be motive motif whether single double treble gave arrangement ready sanction said that depended more on few month spent in native air for recovery of health than on thing else certain be that be to come that highbury instead of welcoming that perfect novelty have be so long promised itmr frank churchillmust put up for present with jane fairfax who must bring only freshness of two year absence emma be sorryto have to pay civility to person did not like through three long monthsto be always doing more than wished le than ought why did not like jane fairfax might be difficult question to answer mr knightley have once told be because saw in really accomplished young woman wanted to be thought though accusation have be eagerly refuted at time there be moment of self examination in conscience must not quite acquit must never get acquainted with did not know how be there be such coldness reservesuch apparent indifference whether pleased notand then aunt be such eternal talkerand be made fuss with by bodyand have be always imagined that be to be so intimatebecause age be same body have supposed must be so fond of other be reasonsshe have better be dislike so little justevery imputed fault be so magnified by fancy that never saw jane fairfax first time after considerable absence without feeling that have injured now when due visit be paid on arrival after two year interval be particularly struck with very appearance manner for two whole year have be depreciating jane fairfax be very elegant remarkably elegant have highest value for elegance height be pretty just such a almost body must think tall nobody must think very tall figure particularly graceful size most becoming medium between fat thin though slight appearance of ill health seemed to point out likeliest evil of two emma must not feel then faceher featuresthere be more beauty in altogether than have remembered be not regular be very pleasing beauty eye deep grey with dark eye lash eyebrow have never be denied praise skin have be used to cavil at a wanting colour have clearness delicacy really needed fuller bloom be style of beauty of elegance be reigning character a such must in honour by principle admire itelegance whether of person of mind saw so little in highbury there not to be vulgar be distinction merit in short sat during first visit looking at jane fairfax with twofold complacency sense of pleasure sense of rendering justice be determining that must dislike no longer when took in history indeed situation a well a beauty when considered what elegance be destined to what be going to sink from how be going to live seemed impossible to feel thing compassion respect especially if to well known particular entitling to interest be added highly probable circumstance of attachment to mr dixon have so naturally started to herself in case nothing must be more pitiable more honourable than sacrifice have resolved on emma be very willing now to acquit of having seduced mr dixons affection from wife of thing mischievous imagination have suggested at first if be love might be simple single successless love on side alone might have be unconsciously sucking in sad poison while sharer of conversation with friend from best purest of motif might now be denying visit to ireland resolving to divide effectually from connexion by soon beginning career of laborious duty upon whole emma left with such softened charitable feeling a made look around in walking home lament that highbury afforded young man worthy of giving independence nobody that must wish to scheme about for be charming feelingsbut not lasting before have committed by public profession of eternal friendship for jane fairfax done more towards recantation of past prejudice error than saying to mr knightley certainly be handsome be better than handsome jane have spent evening at hartfield with grandmother aunt thing be relapsing much into usual state former provocation reappeared aunt be a tiresome a ever more tiresome because anxiety for health be now added to admiration of power have to listen to description of exactly how little bread butter ate for breakfast how small slice of mutton for dinner a well a to see exhibition of new cap new workbag for mother janes offence rose again have music emma be obliged to play thanks praise necessarily followed appeared to affectation of candour air of greatness meaning only to shew off in higher style own very superior performance be besides be worst of so cold so cautious there be getting at real opinion wrapt up in cloak of politeness seemed determined to hazard nothing be disgustingly be suspiciously reserved if thing must be more where be most be more reserved on subject of weymouth dixons than thing seemed bent on giving real insight into mr dixons character own value for company opinion of suitableness of match be general approbation smoothness nothing delineated distinguished did service however caution be thrown away emma saw artifice returned to first surmise there probably be something more to conceal than own preference mr dixon perhaps have be very near changing one friend for other be fixed only to miss campbell for sake of future twelve thousand pound like reserve prevailed on other topic mr frank churchill have be at weymouth at same time be known that be little acquainted not syllable of real information must emma procure a to what truly be be handsomeshe believed be reckoned very fine young man be agreeablehe be generally thought so did appear sensible young man young man of informationat watering place in common london acquaintance be difficult to decide on such point manner be must be safely judged of under much longer knowledge than have yet have of mr churchill believed body found manner pleasing emma must not forgive chapter iii emma must not forgive herbut a provocation resentment be discerned by mr knightley who have be of party have seen only proper attention pleasing behaviour on side be expressing next morning being at hartfield again on business with mr woodhouse approbation of whole not so openly a might have done have father be out of room speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to emma have be used to think unjust to jane have now great pleasure in marking improvement very pleasant evening began a soon a mr woodhouse have be talked into what be necessary told

half attention wanted by while lamented that young people must be in such hurry to marryand to marry stranger tooand other half must give to own view of subject be to herself amusing very welcome piece of news a proving that mr elton must not have suffered long be sorry for harriet harriet must feel itand that must hope be by giving first information to save from hearing abruptly from others be now about time that be likely to call if be to meet miss bates in wayand upon beginning to rain emma be obliged to expect that weather must be detaining at mr goddard that intelligence must undoubtedly rush upon without preparation shower be heavy short have not be over five minute when in came harriet with just heated agitated look hurrying thither with full heart be likely to give oh miss woodhouse what do think have happened instantly burst forth have evidence of corresponding perturbation a blow be given emma felt that must not now shew greater kindness than in listening harriet unchecked ran eagerly through what have to tell have set out from mr goddard hour agoshe have be afraid must rainshe have be afraid must pour down momentbut thought might get to hartfield firstshe have hurried on a fast a possible then a be passing by house where young woman be making up gown for thought must just step in see how went on though did not seem to stay moment there soon after came out began to rain did not know what to do so ran on directly a fast a must took shelter at fordsfords be principal woollen draper linen draper haberdasher shop united shop first in size fashion in placeand so there have set without idea of thing in world full ten minute perhapswhen of sudden who must come into be sure be so very oddbut always dealt at fordswho must come in martin brotherdear miss woodhouse only think thought must have fainted did not know what to do be sitting near doorelizabeth saw directly did not be busy with umbrella be sure saw looked away directly took notice went to quite farther end of shop kept sitting near dooroh dear be so miserable be sure must have be a white a gown must not go away know because of rain did so wish anywhere in world thereoh dear miss woodhousewell at last fancy looked round saw for instead of going on with buying began whispering to one be sure be talking of must not help thinking that be persuading to speak to medo think be miss woodhousefor presently came forwardcame quite up to asked how did seemed ready to shake hand if must did not do of in same way that used must see be altered however seemed to try to be very friendly shook hand stood talking time know more what saidi be in such tremblei remember said be sorry never met now thought almost too kind dear miss woodhouse be absolutely miserable by time be beginning to hold up be determined that nothing must stop from getting awayand thenonly thinki found be coming up towards tooslowly know a if did not quite know what to do so came spoke answeredand stood for minute feeling dreadfully know one cant tell how then took courage said did not rain must go so off set have not got three yard from door when came after only to say if be going to hartfield thought have much better go round by mr cole stable for must find near way quite floated by rain oh dear thought must have be death of so said be very much obliged to know must not do le then went back to elizabeth came round by stablesi believe didbut hardly knew where be thing about oh miss woodhouse must rather done thing than have happen yet know there be sort of satisfaction in seeing behave so pleasantly so kindly elizabeth too oh miss woodhouse do talk to make comfortable again very sincerely did emma wish to do so be not immediately in power be obliged to stop think be not thoroughly comfortable young man conduct sister seemed result of real feeling must not pity a harriet described there have be interesting mixture of wounded affection genuine delicacy in behaviour have believed to be well meaning worthy people before what difference did make in evil of connexion be folly to be disturbed by of course must be sorry to lose herthey must be sorry ambition a well a love have probably be mortified might have hoped to rise by harriets acquaintance besides be value of harriets descriptionso easily pleasedso little discerningwhat signified praise exerted did try to make comfortable by considering have passed a mere trifle quite unworthy of being dwelt on might be distressing for moment said seem to have behaved extremely well be overand may nevercan never a first

pondering over what must be done in return wishing to do more than dared to confess mr elton in person have driven away such care while staid martin be forgotten on very morning of setting off for bath again emma to dissipate of distress occasioned judged best for to return elizabeth martin visit how visit be to be acknowledgedwhat must be necessaryand what might be safest have be point of doubtful consideration absolute neglect of mother sister when invited to come must be ingratitude must not be yet danger of renewal of acquaintance after much thinking must determine on nothing better than harriets returning visit in way that if have understanding must convince that be to be only formal acquaintance meant to take in carriage leave at abbey mill while drove little farther call for

travel earlier later quicker that might gain day told yesterday cried mr weston with exultation told that must be here before time named remembered what used to do one can not creep upon journey one can not help getting on faster than one have planned pleasure of coming in upon one friend before look out begin be worth great deal more than little exertion need be great pleasure where one can indulge in said young man though there be not many house must presume on so far in coming home felt might do thing word home made father look on with fresh complacency emma be directly sure that knew how to make agreeable conviction be strengthened by what followed be very much pleased with randalls thought most admirably arranged house must hardly allow even to be very small admired situation walk to highbury highbury hartfield still more professed to have always felt sort of interest in country none one own country give greatest curiosity to visit that must never have be able to indulge

engaged with other of introducing mother in law speaking of with so much handsome praise so much warm admiration so much gratitude for happiness secured to father very kind reception of a be additional proof of knowing how to pleaseand of certainly thinking worth while to try to please did not advance word of praise beyond what knew to be thoroughly deserved by mr weston undoubtedly must

beauty of person elegant agreeable manner be prepared for said confess that considering thing have not expected more than very tolerably well looking woman of certain age did not know be to find pretty young woman in mr weston can not see too much perfection in mr weston for feeling said emma be to guess to be eighteen must listen with pleasure must be ready to quarrel with for using such word dont let imagine that have spoken of a pretty young woman hope must know better replied depend upon with gallant bow that in addressing mr weston must understand whom might praise without danger of being thought extravagant in term emma wondered whether same suspicion of what might be expected from knowing other have taken strong possession of mind have ever crossed whether compliment be to be considered a mark of acquiescence proof of defiance must see more of to understand way at present only felt be agreeable have doubt of what mr weston be often thinking about quick eye detected again again glancing towards with happy expression even when might have determined not to look be confident that be often listening own father perfect exemption from thought of kind entire deficiency in of such sort of penetration suspicion be most comfortable circumstance happily be not farther from approving matrimony than from foreseeing itthough always objecting to marriage be arranged never suffered beforehand from apprehension of seemed a if must not think so ill of two person understanding a to suppose meant to marry till be proved against blessed favouring blindness must now without drawback of single unpleasant surmise without glance forward at possible treachery in guest give way to natural kind hearted civility in solicitous inquiry after mr frank churchill accommodation on journey through sad evil of sleeping two night on road express very genuine unmixed anxiety to know that have certainly escaped catching coldwhich however must not allow to feel quite assured of till after night reasonable visit paid mr weston began to movehe must be going have business at crown about hay great many errand for mr weston at ford need not hurry body else son too well bred to hear hint rose immediately also saying a be going farther on business sir will take opportunity of paying visit must be paid day other therefore may a well be paid now have honour of being acquainted with neighbour of yours turning to emma lady residing in near highbury family of name of fairfax will have difficulty suppose in finding house though fairfax believe be not proper namei must rather say barnes bates do know family of name to be sure do cried father mr bateswe passed housei saw miss bates at window true true be acquainted with miss fairfax remember knew at weymouth fine girl be call upon by mean there be necessity for calling morning said young man day must do a well there be that degree of acquaintance at weymouth oh go to day go to day defer what be right to be done can not be done too soon besides must give hint frank want of attention to here must be carefully avoided saw with campbell when be equal of body mixed with here be with poor old grandmother who have barely enough to live on if call early will be slight son looked convinced have heard speak of acquaintance said emma be very elegant young woman agreed to with so quiet yes a inclined almost to doubt real concurrence yet there must be very distinct sort of elegance for fashionable world if jane fairfax must be thought only ordinarily gifted with if be never particularly struck by manner before said think will to day will see to advantage see hear herno be afraid will not hear at for have aunt who never hold tongue be acquainted with miss jane fairfax sir be said mr woodhouse always last to make way in conversation then give leave to assure that will find very agreeable young lady be staying here on visit to grandmama aunt very worthy people have known life will be extremely glad to see be sure one of servant will go with to shew way dear sir upon account in world father can direct father be not going so far be only going to crown quite on other side of street there be great many house might be very much at loss be very dirty walk unless keep on footpath coachman can tell where have best cross street mr frank churchill still declined looking a serious a must father gave hearty support by calling out good friend be quite unnecessary frank know puddle of water when see a to mr batess may get there from crown in hop step jump be permitted to go alone with cordial nod from one graceful bow from other two gentleman took leave emma remained very well pleased with beginning of acquaintance must now engage to think of at randalls hour of day with full confidence in comfort chapter vi next morning brought mr frank churchill again came with mr weston to whom to highbury seemed to take very cordially have be sitting with appeared most companionably at home till usual hour of exercise on being desired to chuse walk immediately fixed on highburyhe did not doubt there being very pleasant walk in direction if left to must always chuse same highbury that airy cheerful happy looking highbury must be constant attractionhighbury with mr weston stood for hartfield trusted to bearing same construction with walked thither directly emma have hardly expected for mr weston who have called in for minute in order to hear that son be very handsome knew nothing of plan be agreeable surprize to therefore to perceive walking up to house together arm in arm be wanting to see again especially to see in company with mr weston upon behaviour to whom opinion of be to depend if be deficient there nothing must make amends for on seeing together became perfectly satisfied be not merely in fine word hyperbolical compliment that paid duty nothing must be more proper pleasing than whole manner to hernothing must more agreeably denote wish of considering a friend securing affection there be time enough for emma to form reasonable judgment a visit included rest of morning be three walking about together for hour twofirst round shrubbery of hartfield afterwards in highbury be delighted with thing admired hartfield sufficiently for mr woodhouses ear when going farther be resolved on confessed wish to be made acquainted with whole village found matter of commendation interest much oftener than emma must have supposed of object of curiosity spoke very amiable feeling begged to be house father have lived in so long have be home of father father on recollecting that old woman who have nursed be still living walked in quest of cottage from one end of street to other though in point of pursuit observation there be positive merit shewed altogether good will towards highbury in general must be very like merit to be with emma watched decided that with such feeling a be now shewn must not be fairly supposed that have be ever voluntarily absenting that have not be acting part making parade of insincere profession mr knightley certainly have not done justice first pause be at crown inn inconsiderable house though principal one of sort where couple of pair of post horse be kept more for convenience of neighbourhood than from run on road companion have not expected to be detained by interest excited there in passing gave history of large room visibly added have be built many year ago for ball room while neighbourhood have be in particularly populous dancing state have be occasionally used a suchbut such brilliant day have long passed away now highest purpose for be ever wanted be to accommodate whist club established among gentleman half gentleman of place be immediately interested character a ball room caught instead of passing on stopt for several minute at two superior sashed window be open to look in contemplate capability lament that original purpose must have ceased saw fault in room must acknowledge none suggested be long enough broad enough handsome enough must hold very number for comfort ought to have ball there at least fortnight through winter why have not miss woodhouse revived former good old day of roomshe who must do thing in highbury want of proper family in place conviction that none beyond place immediate environs must be tempted to attend be mentioned be not satisfied must not be persuaded that so many good looking house a saw around must not furnish number enough for meeting even when particular be given family described be still unwilling to admit that inconvenience of such mixture must be thing that there must be smallest difficulty in body returning into proper place next morning argued like young man very much bent on dancing emma be rather surprized to see constitution of weston prevail so decidedly against habit of churchill seemed to have life spirit cheerful feeling social inclination of father nothing of pride reserve of enscombe of pride indeed there be perhaps scarcely enough indifference to confusion of rank bordered too much on inelegance of mind must be judge however of evil be holding cheap be effusion of lively spirit at last be persuaded to move on from front of crown being now almost facing house where bateses lodged emma recollected intended visit day before asked if have paid yes oh yeshe replied be just going to mention very successful visiti saw three lady felt very much obliged to for preparatory hint if talking aunt have taken quite by surprize must have be death of a be be only betrayed into paying most unreasonable visit ten minute must have be be necessary perhaps be proper have told father must certainly be at home before himbut there be getting away pause to utter astonishment found when finding nowhere else joined there at last have be actually sitting with very nearly three quarter of hour good lady have not given possibility of escape before how did think miss fairfax looking ill very illthat be if young lady can ever be allowed to look ill expression be hardly admissible mr weston be lady can never look ill seriously miss fairfax be naturally so pale a almost always to give appearance of ill healtha most deplorable want of complexion emma must not agree to began warm defence of miss fairfaxs complexion be certainly never brilliant must not allow to have sickly hue in general there be softness delicacy in skin gave peculiar elegance to character of face listened with due deference acknowledged that have heard many people say samebut yet must confess that to nothing must make amends for want of fine glow of health where feature be indifferent fine complexion gave beauty to where be good effect wasfortunately need not attempt to describe what effect be well said emma there be disputing about tasteat least admire except complexion shook head laughedi can not separate miss fairfax complexion did see often at weymouth be often in same society at moment be approaching ford hastily exclaimed have must be very shop that body attends day of life a father informs come to highbury say six day out of seven have always business at ford if be not inconvenient to pray let go in may prove to belong to place to be true citizen of highbury must buy something at ford will be taking out freedomi dare say sell glove oh yes glove thing do admire patriotism will be adored in highbury be very popular before came because be mr weston sonbut lay out guinea at ford popularity will stand upon own virtue went in while sleek well tied parcel of men beaver york tan be bringing down displaying on counter saidbut beg pardon miss woodhouse be speaking to be saying something at very moment of burst of amor patriae let lose assure utmost stretch of public fame must not make amends for loss of happiness in private life merely asked whether have known much of miss fairfax party at weymouth now that understand question must pronounce to be very unfair one be always lady right to decide on degree of acquaintance miss fairfax must already have given accounti will not commit by claiming more than may chuse to allow upon word answer a discreetly a must do account of thing leaf so much to be guessed be so very reserved so very unwilling to give least information about body really think may say what like of acquaintance with may indeedthen will speak truth nothing suit so well met frequently at weymouth have known campbell little in town at weymouth be very much in same set colonel campbell be very agreeable man mr campbell friendly warm hearted woman like know miss fairfaxs situation in life conclude what be destined to be yesrather hesitatinglyi believe do get upon delicate subject emma said mr weston smiling remember that be heremr frank churchill hardly know what to say when speak of miss fairfaxs situation in life will move little farther off certainly do forget to think of said emma a having ever be thing friend dearest friend looked a if fully understood honoured sentiment when glove be bought have quitted shop again did ever hear young lady be speaking of play said frank churchill ever hear repeated emma forget how much belongs to highbury have heard year of life since began play charmingly think so do youi wanted opinion of one who must really judge appeared to to play well be with considerable taste know nothing of matter myselfi be excessively fond of music without smallest skill right of judging of body performancei have be used to hear hers admired remember one proof of being thought to play wella man very musical man in love with womanengaged to heron point of marriagewould yet never ask that other woman to sit down to instrument if lady in question must sit down insteadnever seemed to like to hear one if must hear other thought in man of known musical talent be proof proof indeed said emma highly amusedmr dixon be very musical be will know more about in hour from than miss fairfax must have vouchsafed in year yes mr dixon miss campbell be person thought very strong proof certainlyvery strong be to own truth great deal stronger than if have be miss campbell must have be at agreeable to must not excuse man having more music than lovemore ear than eyea more acute sensibility to fine sound than to feeling how did miss campbell appear to like be very particular friend know poor comfort said emma laughing one must rather have stranger preferred than one very particular friendwith stranger might not recur againbut misery of having very particular friend always at hand to do thing better than one doe oneselfpoor mr dixon well be glad be gone to settle in ireland be right be not very flattering to miss campbell really did not seem to feel so much betteror so much worsei know be sweetness be stupidity in herquickness of friendship dulness of feelingthere be one person think who must have felt miss fairfax must have felt improper dangerous distinction a to thati oh imagine expect account of miss fairfaxs sensation from from body else be known to human being guess if continued to play whenever be asked by mr dixon one may guess what one chuses there appeared perfectly good understanding among began rather quickly checking added however be impossible for to say on what term really werehow might all be behind scene can only say that there be smoothness outwardly who have known miss fairfax from child must be better judge of character of how be likely to conduct in critical situation than can be have known from child undoubtedly have be child woman together be natural to suppose that must be intimatethat must have taken to other whenever visited friend never did hardly know how have happened little perhaps from wickedness on side be prone to take disgust towards girl so idolized so cried up a always be by aunt grandmother set then reservei never must attach to one so completely reserved be most repulsive quality indeed said oftentimes very convenient doubt never pleasing there be safety in reserve attraction one can not love reserved person not till reserve cease towards then attraction may be greater must be more in want of friend agreeable companion than have yet be to take trouble of conquering body reserve to procure one intimacy between miss fairfax be quite out of question have reason to think ill of hernot leastexcept that such extreme perpetual cautiousness of word manner such dread of giving distinct idea about body be apt to suggest suspicion of there being something to conceal perfectly agreed with after walking together so long thinking so much alike emma felt so well acquainted with that must hardly believe to be only second meeting be not exactly what have expected le of man of world in of notion le of spoiled child of fortune therefore better than have expected idea seemed more moderatehis feeling warmer be particularly struck by manner of considering mr eltons house a well a church must go look at must not join in finding much fault with must not believe bad house not house a man be to be pitied for having if be to be shared with woman loved must not think man to be pitied for having house there must be ample room in for real comfort man must be blockhead who wanted more mr weston laughed said did not know what be talking about used only to large house without ever thinking how many advantage accommodation be attached to size must be judge of privation inevitably belonging to small one emma in own mind determined that did know what be talking about that shewed very amiable inclination to settle early in life to marry from worthy motif might not be aware of inroad on domestic peace to be occasioned by housekeeper room bad butler pantry doubt did perfectly feel that enscombe must not make happy whenever be attached must willingly give up much of wealth to be allowed early establishment chapter vii emmas very good opinion of frank churchill be little shaken following day by hearing that be gone off to london merely to have hair cut sudden freak seemed to have seized at breakfast have sent for chaise set off intending to return to dinner with more important view that appeared than having hair cut there be certainly no harm in travelling sixteen mile twice over on such errand there be air of foppery nonsense in must not approve did not accord with rationality of plan moderation in expense even unselfish warmth of heart have believed to discern in yesterday vanity extravagance love of change restlessness of temper must be doing something good bad heedlessness a to pleasure of father mr weston indifferent a to how conduct might appear in general became liable to charge father only called coxcomb thought very good story that mr weston did not like be clear enough by passing over a quickly a possible making other comment than young people must have little whim with exception of little blot emma found that visit hitherto have given friend only good idea of mr weston be very ready to say how attentive pleasant companion made himselfhow much saw to like in disposition altogether appeared to have very open tempercertainly very cheerful lively one must observe nothing wrong in notion great deal decidedly right spoke of uncle with warm regard be fond of talking of himsaid must be best man in world if be left to though there be being attached to aunt acknowledged kindness with gratitude seemed to mean always to speak of with respect be very promising for such unfortunate fancy for having hair cut there be nothing to denote unworthy of distinguished honour imagination have given honour if not of being really in love with her of being at least very near saved only by own indifferencefor still resolution held of never marryingthe honour in short of being marked out for by joint acquaintance mr weston on side added virtue to account must have weight gave to understand frank admired extremelythought very beautiful very charming with so much to be said for altogether found must not judge harshly a mr weston observed young people must have little whim there be one person among new acquaintance in surry not so leniently disposed in general be judged throughout parish of donwell highbury with great candour liberal allowance be made for little excess of such handsome young manone who smiled so often bowed so well there be one spirit among not to be softened from power of censure by bow smilesmr knightley circumstance be told at hartfield for moment be silent emma heard almost immediately afterwards say to over newspaper held in hand hum just trifling silly fellow took for have mind to resent instant observation convinced that be really said only to relieve own feeling not meant to provoke therefore let pas although in one instance bearer of not good tidings mr mr weston visit morning be in respect particularly opportune something occurred while be at hartfield to make emma want advice be still more lucky wanted exactly advice gave be occurrencethe cole have be settled year in highbury be very good sort of peoplefriendly liberal unpretending on other hand be of low origin in trade only moderately genteel on first coming into country have lived in proportion to income quietly keeping little company little unexpensively last year two have brought considerable increase of meansthe house in town have yielded greater profit fortune in general have smiled on with wealth view increased want of larger house inclination for more company added to house to number of servant to expense of sort by time be in fortune style of living second only to family at love of society new dining room prepared body for keeping dinner company few party chiefly among single men have already taken place regular best family emma must hardly suppose must presume to inviteneither donwell hartfield randalls nothing must tempt to go if did regretted that father known habit must be giving refusal le meaning than must wish cole be very respectable in way ought to be taught that be not for to arrange term on superior family must visit lesson very much feared must receive only from have little hope of mr knightley none of mr weston have made up mind how to meet presumption so many week before appeared that when insult came at last found very differently affected donwell randalls have received invitation none have come for father mr weston accounting for with suppose will not take liberty with know dine out be not quite sufficient felt that must like to have have power of refusal afterwards a idea of party to be assembled there consisting precisely of whose society be dearest to occurred again again did not know that might not have be tempted to accept harriet be to be there in evening bateses have be speaking of a walked about highbury day before frank churchill have most earnestly lamented absence might not evening end in dance have be question of bare possibility of acted a farther irritation on spirit being left in solitary grandeur even supposing omission to be intended a compliment be poor comfort be arrival of very invitation while weston be at hartfield made presence so acceptable for though first remark on reading be that of course must be declined so very soon proceeded to ask what advised to do advice for going be most prompt successful owned that considering thing be not absolutely without inclination for party cole expressed so properlythere be so much real attention in manner of itso much consideration for father must have solicited honour earlier have be waiting arrival of folding screen from london hoped might keep mr woodhouse from draught of air therefore induce more readily to give honour of company upon whole be very persuadable being briefly settled among how might be done without neglecting comforthow certainly mr goddard if not mr bates might be depended on for bearing companymr woodhouse be to be talked into acquiescence of daughter going out to dinner on day now near at hand spending whole evening away from a for

so certainly silly thing do cease to be silly if be done by sensible people in impudent way wickedness be always wickedness folly be not always follyit depends upon character of who handle mr knightley be not trifling silly young man if be must have done differently must either have gloried in achievement be ashamed of there must have be ostentation of coxcomb evasion of mind too weak to defend own vanitiesno be perfectly sure that be not trifling silly with tuesday came agreeable prospect of seeing again for longer time than hitherto of judging of general manner by inference of meaning of manner towards herself of guessing how soon might be necessary for to throw coldness into air of fancying what observation of might be who be now seeing together for first time meant to be very happy in spite of scene being laid at mr cole without being able to forget that among failing of mr elton even in day of favour none have disturbed more than propensity to dine with mr cole father comfort be amply secured mr bates a well a mr goddard being able to come last pleasing duty before left house be to pay respect to a sat together after dinner while father be fondly noticing beauty of dress to make two lady amends in power by helping to large slice of cake full glass of wine for unwilling denial care of constitution might have obliged to practise during mealshe have provided plentiful dinner for wished must know that have be allowed to eat followed carriage to mr cole door be pleased to see that be mr knightleys for mr knightley keeping horse having little spare money great deal of health activity independence be too apt in emmas opinion to get about a must not use carriage so often a became owner of donwell abbey have opportunity now of speaking approbation while warm from heart for stopped to hand out be coming a must do said like gentlemani be quite glad to see thanked observing how lucky that must arrive at same moment for if have met first in drawing room doubt whether must have discerned to be more of gentleman than usualyou might not have distinguished how came by look manner yes must be sure must there be always look of consciousness bustle when people come in way know to be beneath think carry off very well dare say with be sort of bravado air of affected unconcern always observe whenever meet under circumstance now have nothing to try for be not afraid of being supposed ashamed be not striving to look taller than body else now will really be very happy to walk into same room with nonsensical girl be reply not at in anger emma have a much reason to be satisfied with rest of party a with mr knightley be received with cordial respect must not please given consequence must wish for when weston arrived kindest look of love strongest of admiration be for from husband wife son approached with cheerful eagerness marked a peculiar object at dinner found seated by herand a firmly believed not without dexterity on side party be rather large a included one other family proper unobjectionable country family whom cole have advantage of naming among acquaintance male part of mr cox family lawyer of highbury le worthy female be to come in evening with miss bates miss fairfax miss smith already at dinner be too numerous for subject of conversation to be general while politics mr elton be talked over emma must fairly surrender attention to pleasantness of neighbour first remote sound to felt obliged to attend be name of jane fairfax mr cole seemed to be relating something of be expected to be very interesting listened found well worth listening to very dear part of emma fancy received amusing supply mr cole be telling that have be calling on miss bates a soon a entered room have be struck by sight of pianofortea very elegant looking instrumentnot grand large sized square pianoforte substance of story end of dialogue ensued of surprize inquiry congratulation on side explanation on miss batess be that pianoforte have arrived from broadwoods day before to great astonishment of aunt nieceentirely unexpected that at first by miss batess account jane be quite at loss quite bewildered to think who must possibly have ordered itbut now be perfectly satisfied that must be from only one quarterof course must be from colonel campbell one can suppose nothing else added mr cole be only surprized that there must ever have be doubt jane seems have letter from very lately not word be said about know way best must not consider silence a reason for not meaning to make present might chuse to surprize mr cole have many to agree with body who spoke on subject be equally convinced that must come from colonel campbell equally rejoiced that present have be made there be enough ready to speak to allow emma to think own way still listen to mr cole declare know when have heard thing have given more satisfactionit always have quite hurt that jane fairfax who play so delightfully must not have instrument seemed quite shame especially considering how many house there be where fine instrument be absolutely thrown away be like giving slap to be sure be yesterday be telling mr cole really be ashamed to look at new grand pianoforte in drawing room while know one note from little girl who be just beginning perhaps may never make thing of there be poor jane fairfax who be mistress of music have not thing of nature of instrument not even pitifullest old spinet in world to amuse be saying to mr cole yesterday quite agreed with only be so particularly fond of music that must not help indulging in purchase hoping that of good neighbour might be so obliging occasionally to put to better use than can really be reason why instrument be boughtor else be sure ought to be ashamed of itwe be in great hope that miss woodhouse may be prevailed with to try evening miss woodhouse made proper acquiescence finding that nothing more be to be entrapped from communication of mr cole turned to frank churchill why do smile said nay why do mei suppose smile for pleasure at colonel campbell being so rich so liberalit be handsome present very rather wonder that be never made before perhaps miss fairfax have never be staying here so long before that did not give use of own instrumentwhich must now be shut up in london untouched by body be grand pianoforte might think too large for mr batess house may say what chusebut countenance testifies that thought on subject be very much like mine know rather believe be giving more credit for acuteness than deserve smile because smile will probably suspect find suspect at present see what there be to question if colonel campbell be not person who can be what do say to mr dixon mr dixon very true indeed have not thought of mr dixon must know a well a father how acceptable instrument must be perhaps mode of mystery surprize be more like young woman scheme than elderly man be mr dixon dare say told that suspicion must guide mine if so must extend suspicion comprehend mr dixon in mr dixonvery well yes immediately perceive that must be joint present of mr mr dixon be speaking other day know of being so warm admirer of performance yes what told on head confirmed idea have entertained beforei mean to reflect upon good intention of mr dixon miss fairfax can not help suspecting that after making proposal to friend have misfortune to fall in love with that became conscious of little attachment on side one might guess twenty thing without guessing exactly right be sure there must be particular cause for chusing to come to highbury instead of going with campbell to ireland here must be leading life of privation penance there must have be enjoyment a to pretence of trying native air look upon a mere excusein summer might have passed what can body native air do for in month of january february march good fire carriage must be much more to purpose in most case of delicate health dare say in hers require to adopt suspicion though make so noble profession of doing honestly tell what be upon word have air of great probability mr dixons preference of music to friend can answer for being very decided then saved life did ever hear of thata water party by accident be falling overboard caught did be thereone of party be reallywellbut observed nothing of course for seems to be new idea to youif have be there think must have made discovery dare say must simple saw nothing fact that miss fairfax be nearly dashed from vessel that mr dixon caught herit be work of moment though consequent shock alarm be very great much more durableindeed believe be hour before of be comfortable againyet be too general sensation for thing of peculiar anxiety to be observable mean to say however that might not have made discovery conversation be here interrupted be called on to share in awkwardness of rather long interval between course obliged to be a formal a orderly a others when table be again safely covered when corner dish be placed exactly right occupation ease be generally restored emma said arrival of pianoforte be decisive with wanted to know little more tell quite enough depend upon will soon hear that be present from mr mr dixon if dixons must absolutely deny knowledge of must conclude to come from campbell be sure be not from campbell miss fairfax know be not from campbell must have be guessed at first must not have be puzzled have dared fix on may not have convinced perhaps be perfectly convinced that mr dixon be principal in business indeed injure if suppose unconvinced reasoning carry judgment along with entirely at first while supposed satisfied that colonel campbell be giver saw only a paternal kindness thought most natural thing in world when mentioned dixon felt how much more probable that must be tribute of warm female friendship now can see in other light than a offering of love there be occasion to press matter farther conviction seemed real looked a if felt said more other subject took turn rest of dinner passed away dessert succeeded child came in be talked to admired amid usual rate of conversation few clever thing said few downright silly by much larger proportion one othernothing worse than everyday remark dull repetition old news heavy joke lady have not be long in drawing room before other lady in different division arrived emma watched entree of own particular little friend if must not exult in dignity grace must not only love blooming sweetness artless manner must most heartily rejoice in light cheerful unsentimental disposition allowed so many alleviation of pleasure in midst of pang of disappointed affection there satand who must have guessed how many tear have be lately shedding to be in company nicely dressed seeing others nicely dressed to sit smile look pretty say nothing be enough for happiness of present hour jane fairfax did look move superior emma suspected might have be glad to change feeling with harriet very glad to have purchased mortification of having lovedyes of having loved even mr elton in vainby surrender of dangerous pleasure of knowing beloved by husband of friend in so large party be not necessary that emma must approach did not wish to speak of pianoforte felt too much in secret herself to think appearance of curiosity interest fair therefore purposely kept at distance by others subject be almost immediately introduced saw blush of consciousness with congratulation be received blush of guilt accompanied name of excellent friend colonel campbell mr weston kind hearted musical be particularly interested by circumstance emma must not help being amused at perseverance in dwelling on subject having so much to ask to say a to tone touch pedal totally unsuspicious of wish of saying a little about a possible plainly read in fair heroine countenance be soon joined by of gentleman very first of early be frank churchill in walked first handsomest after paying compliment en passant to miss bates niece made way directly to opposite side of circle where sat miss woodhouse till must find seat by must not sit at emma divined what body present must be thinking be object body must perceive introduced to friend miss smith at convenient moment afterwards heard what thought of other have never seen so lovely face be delighted with navet only to be sure be paying too great compliment did think there be look little like mr elton emma restrained indignation only turned from in silence smile of intelligence passed between gentleman on first glancing towards miss fairfax be most prudent to avoid speech told that have be impatient to leave dining roomhated sitting longwas always first to move when couldthat father mr knightley mr cox mr cole be left very busy over parish businessthat a long a have staid however have be pleasant enough a have found in general set of gentlemanlike sensible men spoke so handsomely of highbury altogetherthought so abundant in agreeable familiesthat emma began to feel have be used to despise place rather too much questioned a to society in yorkshirethe extent of neighbourhood about enscombe sort must make out from answer that a far a enscombe be concerned there be very little going on visiting be among range of great family none very near that even when day be fixed invitation accepted be even chance that mr churchill be not in health spirit for going that made point of visiting fresh person that though have separate engagement be not without difficulty without considerable address at time that must get away introduce acquaintance for night saw that enscombe must not satisfy that highbury taken at best might reasonably please young man who have more retirement at home than liked importance at enscombe be very evident did not boast naturally betrayed that have persuaded aunt where uncle must hing on laughing noticing owned that believed excepting one two point must with time persuade to thing one of point on influence failed then mentioned have wanted very much to go abroadhad be very eager indeed to be allowed to travelbut must not hear of have happened year before now said be beginning to have no longer same wish unpersuadable point did not mention emma guessed to be good behaviour to father have made most wretched discovery said after short pause have be here week to morrowhalf time never knew day fly so fast week to morrowand have hardly begun to enjoy just got acquainted with mr weston othersi hate recollection perhaps may now begin to regret that spent one whole day out of so few in having hair cut said smiling be subject of regret at have pleasure in seeing friend unless can believe fit to be seen rest of gentleman being now in room emma found obliged to turn from for few minute listen to mr cole when mr cole have moved away attention must be restored a before saw frank churchill looking intently across room at miss fairfax who be sitting exactly opposite what be matter said started thank for rousing replied believe have be very rude really miss fairfax have done hair in so odd wayso very odd can not keep eye from never saw thing so outrethose curlsthis must be fancy of own see nobody else looking like heri must go ask whether be irish fashion will iyes willi declare willand will see how take itwhether colour be gone immediately emma soon saw standing before miss fairfax talking to a to effect on young lady a have improvidently placed exactly between exactly in front of miss fairfax must absolutely distinguish nothing before must return to chair be taken by mr weston be luxury of large party said sheone can get near body say thing dear emma be longing to talk to have be making discovery forming plan just like must tell while idea be fresh do know how miss bates niece came here howthey be invited be not oh yesbut how be conveyed hitherthe manner of coming walked conclude how else must come very truewell little while ago occurred to how very sad must be to have jane fairfax walking home again late at night cold a night be now a looked at though never saw appear to more advantage struck that be heated must therefore be particularly liable to take cold poor girl must not bear idea of so a soon a mr weston came into room must get at spoke to about carriage may guess how readily came into wish having approbation made way directly to miss bates to assure that carriage must be at service before took home for thought must be making comfortable at once good soul be a grateful a possible may be sure nobody be ever so fortunate a herselfbut with many many thanksthere be occasion to trouble for mr knightleys carriage have brought be to take home again be quite surprizedvery glad be sure really quite surprized very kind attentionand so thoughtful attentionthe sort of thing so few men must think of in short from knowing usual way be very much inclined to think that be for accommodation carriage be used at do suspect must not have have pair of horse for that be only a excuse for assisting very likely said emmanothing more likely know man more likely than mr knightley to do sort of thingto do thing really good natured useful considerate benevolent be not gallant man be very humane one considering jane fairfaxs ill health must appear case of humanity to himand for act of unostentatious kindness there be nobody whom must fix on more than on mr knightley know have horse to dayfor arrived together laughed at about said not word must betray well said mr weston smiling give credit for more simple disinterested benevolence in instance than do for while miss bates be speaking suspicion darted into head have never be able to get out again more think of more probable appears in short have made match between mr knightley jane fairfax see consequence of keeping companywhat do say to mr knightley jane fairfax exclaimed emma dear mr weston how must think of thingmr knightleymr knightley must not marryyou must not have little henry cut out from donwelloh henry must have donwell can not at consent to mr knightleys marrying be sure be not at likely be amazed that must think of thing dear emma have told what led to think of want matchi want to injure dear little henrybut idea have be given by circumstance if mr knightley really wished to marry must not have refrain on henry account boy of six year old who know nothing of matter yes must must not bear to have henry supplantedmr knightley marryno have never have such idea can not adopt now jane fairfax too of woman nay have always be first favourite with a very well know imprudence of such match be not speaking of prudence merely probability see probability in unless have better foundation than what mention good nature humanity a tell must be quite enough to account for horse have great regard for bateses know independent of jane fairfaxand be always glad to shew attention dear mr weston take to match making do very ill jane fairfax mistress of abbeyoh noevery feeling revolt for own sake must not have do so mad thing imprudent if pleasebut not mad excepting inequality of fortune perhaps little disparity of age can see nothing unsuitable mr knightley doe not want to marry be sure have not least idea of put into head why must marryhe be a happy a possible by with farm sheep library parish to manage be extremely fond of brother child have occasion to marry to fill up time heart dear emma a long a think so be so if really love jane fairfax nonsense doe not care about jane fairfax in way of love be sure doe not must do good to family well said mr weston laughing perhaps greatest good must do must be to give jane respectable home if must be good to be sure must be evil to very shameful degrading connexion how must bear to have miss bates belonging to himto have haunting abbey thanking day long for great kindness in marrying janeso very kind obligingbut always have be such very kind neighbour then fly off through sentence to mother old petticoat not that be such very old petticoat eitherfor still must last great whileand indeed must thankfully say that petticoat be very strong for shame emma mimic divert against conscience upon word think mr knightley must be much disturbed by miss bates little thing irritate might talk on if wanted to say thing must only talk louder drown voice question be not whether must be bad connexion for whether wish think doe have heard speak so must so very highly of jane fairfax interest take in herhis anxiety about healthhis concern that must have happier prospect have heard express so warmly on pointssuch admirer of performance on pianoforte of voice have heard say that must listen to for ever oh have almost forgotten one idea occurred to methis pianoforte have be sent here by somebodythough have be so well satisfied to consider present from campbell may not be from mr knightley can not help suspecting think be just person to do even without being in love then can be argument to prove that be in love think be at likely thing for to do mr knightley doe nothing mysteriously have heard lamenting having instrument repeatedly oftener than must suppose circumstance must in common course of thing occur to very well if have intended to give one must have told so there might be scruple of delicacy dear emma have very strong notion that come from be sure be particularly silent when mr cole told of at dinner take up idea mr weston run away with a have many time reproached with doing see sign of attachmenti believe nothing of pianoforteand proof only will convince that mr knightley have thought of marrying jane fairfax combated point time longer in same way emma rather gaining ground over mind of friend for mr weston be most used of two to yield till little bustle in room shewed that tea be over instrument in preparationand at same moment mr cole approaching to entreat miss woodhouse must do honour of trying frank churchill of whom in eagerness of conversation with mr weston have be seeing nothing except that have found seat by miss fairfax followed mr cole to add very pressing entreaty a in respect suited emma best to lead gave very proper compliance knew limitation of own power too well to attempt more than must perform with credit wanted taste spirit in little thing be generally acceptable must accompany own voice well one accompaniment to song took agreeably by surprizea second slightly correctly taken by frank churchill pardon be duly begged at close of song thing usual followed be accused of having delightful voice perfect knowledge of music be properly denied that knew nothing of matter have voice at roundly asserted sang together once more emma must then resign place to miss fairfax whose performance vocal instrumental never must attempt to conceal from herself be infinitely superior to own with mixed feeling seated at little distance from number round instrument to listen frank churchill sang again have sung together once twice appeared at weymouth sight of mr knightley among most attentive soon drew away half emmas mind fell into train of thinking on subject of mr weston suspicion to sweet sound of united voice gave only momentary interruption objection to mr knightleys marrying did not in least subside must see nothing evil in must be great disappointment to mr john knightley consequently to isabella real injury to childrena most mortifying change material loss to alla very great deduction from father daily comfortand a to herself must not at endure idea of jane fairfax at donwell abbey mr knightley for to give way tonomr knightley must never marry little henry must remain heir of donwell presently mr knightley looked back came sat down by talked at first only of performance admiration be certainly very warm yet thought for mr weston must not have struck a sort of touchstone however began to speak of kindness in conveying aunt niece though answer be in spirit of cutting matter short believed to indicate only disinclination to dwell on kindness of own often feel concern said dare not make carriage more useful on such occasion be not that be without wish know how impossible father must deem that james must put to for purpose quite out of question quite out of question repliedbut must often wish be sure smiled with such seeming pleasure at conviction that must proceed step present from campbell said shethis pianoforte be very kindly given yes replied without smallest apparent embarrassmentbut must have done better have given notice of surprizes be foolish thing pleasure be not enhanced inconvenience be often considerable must have expected better judgment in colonel campbell from moment emma must have taken oath that mr knightley have have concern in giving instrument whether be entirely free from peculiar attachmentwhether there be actual preferenceremained little longer doubtful towards end of janes second song voice grew thick will do said when be finished thinking aloudyou have sung quite enough for one eveningnow be quiet song however be soon begged for one morethey must not fatigue miss fairfax on account must only ask for one more frank churchill be heard to say think must manage without effort first part be so very trifling strength of song fall on second mr knightley grew angry that fellow said indignantly think of nothing shewing off own voice must not be touching miss bates who at moment passed nearmiss bates be mad to let niece sing hoarse in manner go interfere have mercy on miss bates in real anxiety for jane must hardly stay even to be grateful before stept forward put end to farther singing here ceased concert part of evening for miss woodhouse miss fairfax be only young lady performer soon within five minute proposal of dancingoriginating nobody exactly knew wherewas so effectually promoted by mr mr cole thing be rapidly clearing away to give proper space mr weston capital in country dance be seated beginning irresistible waltz frank churchill coming up with most becoming gallantry to emma have secured hand led up to top while waiting till other young people must pair off emma found time in spite of compliment be receiving on voice taste to look about see what became of mr knightley must be trial be dancer in general if be to be very alert in engaging jane fairfax now might augur something there be immediate appearance no be talking to mr colehe be looking on unconcerned jane be asked by somebody else be still talking to mr cole emma have longer alarm for henry interest be yet safe led off dance with genuine spirit enjoyment not more than five couple must be mustered rarity suddenness of made very delightful found well matched in partner be couple worth looking at two dance unfortunately be must be allowed be growing late miss bates became anxious to get home on mother account after attempt therefore to be permitted to begin again be obliged to thank mr weston look sorrowful have done perhaps be a well said frank churchill a attended emma to carriage must have asked miss fairfax languid dancing must not have agreed with after yours chapter ix emma did not repent condescension in going to cole visit afforded many pleasant recollection next day might be supposed to have lost on side of dignified seclusion must be amply repaid in splendour of popularity must have delighted colesworthy people who deserved to be made happyand left name behind must not soon die away perfect happiness even in memory be not common there be two point on be not quite easy doubted whether have not transgressed duty of woman by woman in betraying suspicion of jane fairfaxs feeling to frank churchill be hardly right have be so strong idea that must escape submission to that told be compliment to penetration made difficult for to be quite certain that ought to have held tongue other circumstance of regret related also to jane fairfax there have doubt did unfeignedly unequivocally regret inferiority of own playing singing did most heartily grieve over idleness of childhoodand sat down practised vigorously hour half be then interrupted by harriets coming in if harriets praise must have satisfied might soon have be comforted oh if must play a well a miss fairfax dont class together harriet playing be more like hers than lamp be like sunshine oh deari think play best of two think play quite a well a doe be sure have much rather hear body last night said how well played who knew thing about must have felt difference truth be harriet that playing be just good enough to be praised jane fairfaxs be much beyond well always will think that play quite a well a doe that if there be difference nobody must ever find out mr cole said how much taste have mr frank churchill talked great deal about taste that valued taste much more than execution ah jane fairfax have harriet be sure saw have execution did not know have taste nobody talked about hate italian singingthere be understanding word of besides if doe play so very well know be more than be obliged to do because will have to teach cox be wondering last night whether must get into great family how did think cox looked just a always dovery vulgar told something said harriet

asked to stay to dinner oh talked great deal about especially anne cox know what meant asked if thought must go stay there again next summer meant to be impertinently curious just a such anne cox must be said be very agreeable day dined there sat by at dinner miss nash think of cox must be very glad to marry very likelyi think be without exception most vulgar girl in highbury harriet have business at fordsemma thought most prudent to go with accidental meeting with martin be possible in present state must be dangerous harriet tempted by thing swayed by word be always very long at purchase while be still hanging over muslin changing mind emma went to door for amusementmuch must not be hoped from traffic of even busiest part of highburymr perry walking hastily by mr william cox letting in at office door mr cole carriage horse returning from exercise stray letter boy on obstinate mule be liveliest object must presume to expect when eye fell only on butcher with tray tidy old woman

month successively without being at ball of description material injury accrue to body mindbut when beginning be felicity of rapid motion have once be though slightly feltit must be very heavy set doe not ask for more frank churchill have danced once at highbury longed to dance again last half hour of evening mr woodhouse be persuaded to spend with daughter at randalls be passed by two young people in scheme on subject frank be first idea greatest zeal in pursuing for lady be best judge of difficulty most solicitous for accommodation appearance still have inclination enough for shewing people again how delightfully mr frank churchill miss woodhouse dancedfor doing that in need not blush to compare with jane fairfaxand even for simple dancing without of wicked aid of vanityto assist first in pacing out room be in to see what must be made to holdand then in taking dimension of other parlour in hope of discovering in spite of mr weston must say of exactly equal size that be little largest first proposition request that dance begun at mr cole must be finished therethat same party must be collected same musician engaged met with readiest acquiescence mr weston entered into idea with thorough enjoyment mr weston most willingly undertook to play a long a must wish to dance interesting employment have followed of reckoning up exactly who there must be portioning out indispensable division of space to couple miss smith miss fairfax will be three two miss cox five have be repeated many time over there will be two gilbert young cox father besides mr knightley yes will be quite enough for pleasure miss smith miss fairfax will be three two miss cox five for five couple there will be plenty of room soon came to be on one side will there be good room for five couplei really think there will on after five couple be not enough to make worth while to stand up five couple be nothing when one think seriously about will not do to invite five couple can be allowable only a thought of moment somebody said that miss gilbert be expected at brother must be invited with rest somebody else believed mr gilbert must have danced other evening if have be asked word be put in for second young cox at last mr weston naming one family of cousin who must be included of very old acquaintance who must not be left out became certainty that five couple must be at least ten very interesting speculation in what possible manner must be disposed of door of two room be just opposite other might not use room dance across passage seemed best scheme yet be not so good that many of wanted better emma said must be awkward mr weston be in distress about supper mr woodhouse opposed earnestly on score of health made so very unhappy indeed that must not be persevered in oh said must be extreme of imprudence must not bear for emmaemma be not strong must catch dreadful cold so must poor little harriet so must all mr weston must be quite laid up let talk of such wild thing pray let talk of that young man speaking lower be very thoughtless tell father that young man be not quite thing have be opening door very often evening keeping open very inconsiderately doe not think of draught mean to set against indeed be not quite thing mr weston be sorry for such charge knew importance of said thing in power to do away door be now closed passage plan given up first scheme of dancing only in room be in resorted to again with such good will on frank churchill part that space quarter of hour before have be deemed barely sufficient for five couple be now endeavoured to be made out quite enough for ten be too magnificent said allowed unnecessary room ten couple may stand here very well emma demurred must be crowda sad crowd what must be worse than dancing without space to turn in very true gravely replied be very bad still went on measuring still ended with think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple said be quite unreasonable must be dreadful to be standing so close nothing can be farther from pleasure than to be dancing in crowdand crowd in little room there be denying replied agree with exactly crowd in little roommiss woodhouse have art of giving picture in few word exquisite quite exquisitestill however having proceeded so far one be unwilling to give matter up must be disappointment to fatherand altogetheri know thati be rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very well emma perceived that nature of gallantry be little self willed that must rather oppose than lose pleasure of dancing with took compliment forgave rest have intended ever to marry might have be worth while to pause consider try to understand value of preference character of temper for purpose of acquaintance be quite amiable enough before middle of next day be at hartfield entered room with such agreeable smile a certified continuance of scheme soon appeared that came to announce improvement well miss woodhouse almost immediately began inclination for dancing have not be quite frightened away hope by terror of father little room bring new proposal on subjecta thought of father wait only approbation to be acted upon may hope for honour of hand for two first dance of little projected ball to be given not at randalls at crown inn crown yes if mr woodhouse see objection trust can not father hope friend will be so kind a to visit there better accommodation can promise not le grateful welcome than at randalls be own idea mr weston see objection to provided be satisfied be what feel oh be perfectly right ten couple in of randalls room must have be insufferabledreadfuli felt how right be whole time be too anxious for securing thing to like to yield be not good exchangeyou consenti hope consent appears to plan that nobody can object to if mr mr weston think admirable a far a can answer for will be most happyit seems only improvement must be papa do not think excellent improvement be obliged to repeat explain before be fully comprehended then being quite new farther representation be necessary to make acceptable no thought very far from improvementa very bad planmuch worse than other room at inn be always damp dangerous never properly aired fit to be inhabited if must dance have better dance at randalls have never be in room at crown in lifedid not know people who kept by sightoh noa very bad plan must catch worse cold at crown than anywhere be going to observe sir said frank churchill that one of great recommendation of change must be very little danger of body catching coldso much le danger at crown than at randalls mr perry might have reason to regret alteration nobody else must sir said mr woodhouse rather warmly be very much mistaken if suppose mr perry to be sort of character mr perry be extremely concerned when of be ill understand how room at crown can be safer for than father house from very circumstance of being larger sir will have occasion to open window at allnot once whole evening be that dreadful habit of opening window letting in cold air upon heated body a well know sir doe mischief open windowsbut surely mr churchill nobody must think of opening window at randalls nobody must be so imprudent never heard of such thing dancing with open windowsi be sure father mr weston poor miss taylor be must suffer ah sirbut thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind window curtain throw up sash without being suspected have often known done have indeed sirbless never must have supposed live out of world be often astonished at what hear however doe make difference perhaps when come to talk overbut sort of thing require good deal of consideration one can not resolve upon in hurry if mr mr weston will be so obliging a to call here one morning may talk over see what can be done unfortunately sir time be so limited oh interrupted emma there will be plenty of time for talking thing over there be hurry at if can be contrived to be at crown papa will be very convenient for horse will be so near own stable so will dear be great thing not that james ever complains be right to spare horse when can if must be sure of room being thoroughly airedbut be mr stokes to be trusted doubt know even by sight can answer for thing of nature sir because will be under mr weston care mr weston undertakes to direct whole there papanow must be satisfiedour own dear mr weston who be carefulness remember what mr perry said so many year ago when have measles if miss taylor undertakes to wrap miss emma up need not have fear sir how often have heard speak of a such compliment to aye very true mr perry did say so will never forget poor little emma be very bad with measles be must have be very bad for perry great attention came four time day for week said from first be very good sortwhich be great comfort measles be dreadful complaint hope whenever poor isabella little one have measles will send for perry father mr weston be at crown at moment said frank churchill examining capability of house left there came on to hartfield impatient for opinion hoping might be persuaded to join give advice on spot be desired to say so from must be greatest pleasure to if must allow to attend there can hing satisfactorily without emma be most happy to be called to council father engaging to think over while be gone two young people set off together without delay

randalls by candlelight never see thing of on club night lady here probably exchanged look meant men never know when thing be dirty not gentleman perhaps thought to woman will have little nonsense needle care one perplexity however arose gentleman did not disdain regarded supper room at time of ballroom being built supper have not be in question small card room adjoining be only addition what be to be done card room must be wanted a card room now if card be conveniently voted unnecessary by four self still be not too small for comfortable supper room of much better size might be secured for purpose be at other end of house long awkward passage must be gone through to get at made difficulty mr weston be afraid of draught for young people in passage emma gentleman must tolerate prospect of being miserably crowded at supper mr weston proposed having regular supper merely sandwich c set out in little room be scouted a wretched suggestion private dance without sitting down to supper be pronounced infamous fraud upon right of men woman mr weston must not speak of again then took line of expediency looking into doubtful room observed think be so very small will not be many know mr weston at same time walking briskly with long step through passage be calling out talk great deal of length of passage dear be mere nothing after not least draught from stair wish said mr weston one must know arrangement guest in general must like best to do what must be most generally pleasing must be objectif one must tell what must be yes very true cried frank very true want

lady no young lady to be sure will think great blockhead frank if bring aunt without niece oh beg pardon sir did not immediately recollect undoubtedly if wish will endeavour to persuade away ran long before reappeared attending short neat brisk moving aunt elegant niecemrs weston like sweet tempered woman good wife have examined passage again found evil of much le than have supposed beforeindeed very trifling here ended difficulty of decision rest in speculation at least be perfectly smooth minor arrangement of table chair light music tea supper made be left a mere trifle to be settled at time between mr weston mr stokesevery body invited be certainly to come frank have already written to enscombe to propose staying few day beyond fortnight must not possibly be refused delightful dance be to be most cordially when miss bates arrived did agree that must a counsellor be not wanted a approver much safer character be truly welcome approbation at once general minute warm incessant must not please for half hour be walking to fro between different room suggesting attending in happy enjoyment of future party did not break up without emmas being positively secured for two first dance by hero of evening without overhearing mr weston whisper to wife have asked dear thats right knew must chapter xii one thing only be wanting to make prospect of ball completely satisfactory to emmaits being fixed for day within granted term of frank churchill stay in surry for in spite of mr weston confidence must not think so very impossible that churchill might not allow nephew to remain day beyond fortnight be not judged feasible preparation must take time nothing must be properly ready till third week be entered on for few day must be planning proceeding hoping in uncertaintyat riskin opinion great risk of being in vain enscombe however be gracious gracious in fact if not in word wish of staying longer evidently did not please be not opposed be safe prosperous a removal of one solicitude generally make way for emma being now certain of ball began to adopt a next vexation mr knightleys provoking indifference about either because did not dance because plan have be formed without being consulted seemed resolved that must not interest determined against exciting present curiosity affording future amusement to voluntary communication emma must get more approving reply than very well if weston think worth while to be at trouble for few hour of noisy entertainment have nothing to say against that will not chuse pleasure for meoh yes must be there must not refuse will keep a much awake a can must rather be at home looking over william larkinss week account much rather confesspleasure in seeing dancingnot indeedi never look at iti know who doesfine dancing believe like virtue must be own reward who be standing by be usually thinking of something very different emma felt be aimed at made quite angry be not in compliment to jane fairfax however that be so indifferent so indignant be not guided by feeling in reprobating ball for enjoyed thought of to extraordinary degree made animatedopen heartedshe voluntarily said oh miss woodhouse hope nothing may happen to prevent ball what disappointment must be do look forward to own with very great pleasure be not to oblige jane fairfax therefore that must have preferred society of william larkins be more more convinced that mr weston be quite mistaken in surmise there be great deal of friendly of compassionate attachment on sidebut love ala there be soon leisure for quarrelling with mr knightley two day of joyful security be immediately followed by over throw of thing letter arrived from mr churchill to urge nephew instant return mr churchill be unwellfar too unwell to do without have be in very suffering state so said husband when writing to nephew two day before though from usual unwillingness to give pain constant habit of never thinking of herself have not mentioned now be too ill to trifle must entreat to set off for enscombe without delay substance of letter be forwarded to emma in note from mr weston instantly a to going be inevitable must be gone within few hour though without feeling real alarm for aunt to lessen repugnance knew illness never occurred for own convenience mr weston added that must only allow time to hurry to highbury after breakfast take leave of few friend there whom must suppose to feel interest in that might be expected at hartfield very soon wretched note be finale of emmas breakfast when once have be read there be doing thing lament exclaim loss of ballthe loss of young manand that young man might be feelingit be too wretchedsuch delightful evening a must have beenevery body so happy partner happiesti said must be so be only consolation father feeling be quite distinct thought principally of mr churchill illness wanted to know how be treated a for ball be shocking to have dear emma disappointed must all be safer at home emma be ready for visitor time before appeared if reflected at upon impatience sorrowful look total want of spirit when did come might redeem felt going away almost too much to speak of dejection be most evident sat really lost in thought for first few minute when rousing be only to say of horrid thing leave taking be worst will come again said emma will not be only visit to randalls ahshaking headthe uncertainty of when may be able to returni will try for with zealit will be object of thought caresand if uncle aunt go to town springbut be afraidthey did not stir last springi be afraid be custom gone for ever poor ball must be quite given up ah that ballwhy did wait for thingwhy not seize pleasure at oncehow often be happiness destroyed by preparation foolish preparationyou told must be sooh miss woodhouse why be always so right indeed be very sorry to be right in instance must much rather have be merry than wise if can come again be still to have ball father depends on forget engagement emma looked graciously such fortnight a have be continued day more precious more delightful than day day making le fit to bear other place happy who can remain at highbury a do such ample justice now said emma laughing will venture to ask whether did not come little doubtfully at first rather surpass expectation be sure do be sure did not much expect to like must not have be so long in coming if have have pleasant idea of highbury laughed rather consciously though denying sentiment emma be convinced that have be so must be off very morning yes father be to join here will walk back together must be off immediately be almost afraid that moment will bring not five minute to spare even for friend miss fairfax miss bates how unlucky miss batess powerful argumentative mind might have strengthened yours yesi have called there passing door thought better be right thing to do went in for three minute be detained by miss batess being absent be out felt impossible not to wait till came in be woman that one may one must laugh at that one must not wish to slight be better to pay visit then hesitated got up walked to window in short said perhaps miss woodhousei think can hardly be quite without suspicion looked at a if wanting to read thought hardly knew what to say seemed like forerunner of something absolutely serious did not wish forcing to speak therefore in hope of putting by calmly said be quite in right be most natural to pay visit then be silent believed be looking at probably reflecting on what have said trying to understand manner heard sigh be natural for to feel that have cause to sigh must not believe to be encouraging few awkward moment passed sat down again in more determined manner said be something to feel that rest of time might be given to hartfield regard for hartfield be most warm stopt again rose again seemed quite embarrassedhe be more in love with than emma have supposed who can say how might have ended if father have not made appearance mr woodhouse soon followed necessity of exertion made composed very few minute more however completed present trial mr weston always alert when business be to be done a incapable of procrastinating evil be inevitable a of foreseeing be doubtful said be time to go young man though might did sigh must not agree to take leave will hear about said be chief consolation will hear of thing be going on among have engaged mr weston to correspond with have be so kind a to promise oh blessing of female correspondent when one be really interested in absentshe will tell thing in letter will be at dear highbury again very friendly shake of hand very earnest good bye closed speech door have soon shut out frank churchill short have be noticeshort meeting be gone emma felt so sorry to part foresaw so great loss to little society from absence a to begin to be afraid of being too sorry feeling too much be sad change have be meeting almost day since arrival certainly being at randalls have given great spirit to last two weeksindescribable spirit idea expectation of seeing morning have brought assurance of attention liveliness manner have be very happy fortnight forlorn must be sinking from into common course of hartfield day to complete other recommendation have almost told that loved what strength what constancy of affection might be subject to be point at present must not doubt having decidedly warm admiration conscious preference of herself persuasion joined to rest made think that must be little in love with in spite of previous determination against certainly must said sensation of listlessness weariness stupidity disinclination to sit down employ feeling of thing being dull insipid about house must be in love must be oddest creature in world if be notfor few week at least well evil to be always good to others will have many fellow mourner for ball if not for frank churchill mr knightley will be happy may spend evening with dear william larkins now if like mr knightley however shewed triumphant happiness must not say that be sorry on own account very cheerful look must have contradicted if have said very steadily that be sorry for disappointment of others with considerable kindness added emma who have so few opportunity of dancing be really out of luck be very much out of luck be day before saw jane fairfax to judge of honest regret in woeful change when did meet composure be odious have be particularly unwell however suffering from headache to degree made aunt declare have ball taken place did not think jane must have attended be charity to impute of unbecoming indifference to languor of ill health chapter xiii emma continued to entertain doubt of being in love idea only varied a to how much at first thought be good deal afterwards little have

struck that must not be very much in love for in spite of previous fixed determination never to quit father never to marry strong attachment certainly must produce more of struggle than must foresee in own feeling find making use of word sacrifice said shein not one of clever reply delicate negative be there allusion to making sacrifice do suspect that be not really necessary to happiness so much better certainly will not persuade to feel more than do be quite enough in love must be sorry to be more upon whole be equally contented with view of feeling be undoubtedly very much in loveevery thing denotes itvery much in love indeedand when come again if affection continue must be on guard not to encourage itit must be most inexcusable to do otherwise a own mind be quite made up not that imagine can think have be encouraging hitherto if have believed at to share feeling must not have be so wretched must have thought encouraged look language at parting must have be differentstill however must be on guard be in supposition of attachment continuing what now be know that expect will look upon to be quite sort of mani altogether build upon steadiness constancyhis feeling be warm

of gallantry yet must discern effect of influence acknowledge greatest compliment perhaps of conveyed compressed into very lowest vacant corner be wordsi have not spare moment on tuesday a know for miss woodhouses beautiful little friend pray make excuse adieu to emma must not doubt be for harriet be remembered only from being friend information prospect a to enscombe be worse better than have

word of eager exclamation emma continued have not said exert harriet for sake think le talk le of mr elton for sake because for own sake rather must wish to be done for sake of what be more important than comfort habit of self command in consideration of what be duty attention to propriety endeavour to avoid suspicion of others to save health credit restore tranquillity be motif have be pressing on be very importantand sorry be that can not feel sufficiently to act upon being saved from pain be very secondary consideration want to save from greater pain perhaps may sometimes have felt that harriet must not forget what be dueor rather what must be kind by appeal to affection did more than rest idea of wanting gratitude consideration for miss woodhouse whom really loved extremely made wretched for while when violence of grief be comforted away still remained powerful enough to prompt to what be right support in very tolerably who have be best friend ever have in lifewant gratitude

not be satisfied by bride in pew must be left for visit in form be then to be paid to settle whether be very pretty indeed only rather pretty not pretty at emma have feeling le of curiosity than of pride propriety to make resolve on not being last to pay respect made point of harriets going with that worst of business might be gone through a soon a possible must not enter house again must not be in same room to have with such vain artifice retreated three month ago to lace up boot without recollecting thousand vexatious thought must recur compliment charade horrible blunder be not to be supposed that poor harriet must not be recollecting too behaved very well be only rather pale silent visit be of course short there be so much embarrassment occupation of mind to shorten that emma must not allow entirely to form opinion of lady on account to give one beyond nothing meaning term of being elegantly dressed very pleasing did not really like must not be in hurry to find fault suspected that there be eleganceease not elegance be almost sure that for young woman stranger bride there be too much ease person be rather good face not unpretty feature air voice manner be elegant emma thought at least must turn out so a for mr elton manner did not appearbut must not permit hasty witty word from about manner be awkward ceremony at time to be receiving wedding visit man have need be grace to acquit well through woman be better off might have assistance of fine clothes privilege of bashfulness man have only own good sense to depend on when considered how peculiarly unlucky poor mr elton be in being in same room at once with woman have just married woman have wanted to marry woman whom have be expected to marry must allow to have right to look a little wise to be a much affectedly a little really easy a must be well miss woodhouse said harriet when have quitted house after waiting in vain for friend to begin well miss woodhouse with gentle sigh what do think of heris not very charming there be little hesitation in emmas answer oh yesverya very pleasing young woman think beautiful quite beautiful very nicely dressed indeed remarkably elegant gown be not at surprized that must have fallen in love oh nothere be nothing to surprize one at alla pretty fortune came in way dare say returned harriet sighing again dare say be very much attached to perhaps might be not man fate to marry woman who love best miss hawkins perhaps wanted home thought best offer be likely to have yes said harriet earnestly well might nobody must ever have better well wish happy with heart now miss woodhouse think will mind seeing again be just a superior a everbut being married know be quite different thing indeed miss woodhouse need not be afraid can sit admire now without great misery to know that have not thrown away be such comfortshe doe seem charming young woman just what deserves happy creature called augusta how delightful when visit be returned emma made up mind must then see more judge better from harriets happening not to be at hartfield father being present to engage mr elton have quarter of hour of lady conversation to herself must composedly attend to quarter of hour quite convinced that mr elton be vain woman extremely well satisfied with thinking much of own importance that meant to shine be very superior with manner have be formed in bad school pert familiar that notion be drawn from one set of people one style of living that if not foolish be ignorant that society must certainly do mr elton good harriet must have be better match if not wise refined must have connected with who be miss hawkins might be fairly supposed from easy conceit have be best of own set rich brother in law near bristol be pride of alliance place carriage be pride of very first subject after being seated be maple grove brother mr suckling seata comparison of hartfield to maple grove ground of hartfield be small neat pretty house be modern well built mr elton seemed most favourably impressed by size of room entrance that must see imagine very like maple grove indeedshe be quite struck by likenessthat room be very shape size of morning room at maple grove sister favourite roommr elton be appealed towas not astonishingly likeshe must really almost fancy at maple grove staircaseyou know a came in observed how very like staircase be placed exactly in same part of house really must not help exclaiming assure miss woodhouse be very delightful to to be reminded of place be so extremely partial to a maple grove have spent so many happy month there with little sigh of sentiment charming place undoubtedly body who see be struck by beauty to have be quite home whenever be transplanted like miss woodhouse will understand how very delightful be to meet with thing at like what one have left behind always say be quite one of evil of matrimony emma made a slight reply a must be fully sufficient for mr elton who only wanted to be talking so extremely like maple grove be not merely housethe ground assure a far a must observe be strikingly like laurel at maple grove be in same profusion a here stand very much in same wayjust across lawn have glimpse of fine large tree with bench round put so exactly in mind brother sister will be enchanted with place people who have extensive ground be always pleased with thing in same style emma doubted truth of sentiment have great idea people who have extensive ground cared very little for extensive ground of body else be not worth while to attack error so double dyed therefore only said in reply when have seen more of country be afraid will think have overrated hartfield surry be full of beauty oh yes be quite aware of that be garden of england know surry be garden of england yes must not rest claim on distinction many county believe be called garden of england a well a surry fancy not replied mr elton with most satisfied smile never heard county surry called so emma be silenced brother sister have promised visit in spring summer at farthest continued mr elton will be time for exploring while be with will explore great deal dare say will have barouche landau of course hold four perfectly therefore without saying thing of carriage must be able to explore different beauty extremely well must hardly come in chaise think at season of year indeed when time draw on will decidedly recommend bringing barouche landau will be so very much preferable when people come into beautiful country of sort know miss woodhouse one naturally wish to see a much a possible mr suckling be extremely fond of exploring explored to king weston twice last summer in way most delightfully just after first having barouche landau have many party of kind here suppose miss woodhouse summer not immediately here be rather out of distance of very striking beauty attract sort of party speak of be very quiet set of people believe more disposed to stay at home than engage in scheme of pleasure ah there be nothing like staying at home for real comfort nobody can be more devoted to home than be be quite proverb for at maple grove many time have selina said when have be going to bristol really can not get girl to move from house absolutely must go in by though hate being stuck up in barouche landau without companion augusta believe with own good will must never stir beyond park paling many time have said so yet be advocate for entire seclusion think on contrary when people shut up entirely from society be very bad thing that be much more advisable to mix in world in proper degree without living in either too much too little perfectly understand situation however miss woodhouselooking towards mr woodhouse father state of health must be great drawback why doe not try bathindeed must let recommend bath to assure have doubt of doing mr woodhouse good father tried more than once formerly without receiving benefit mr perry whose name dare say be not unknown to doe not conceive must be at more likely to be useful now ah thats great pity for assure miss woodhouse where water do agree be quite wonderful relief give in bath life have seen such instance of be so cheerful place that must not fail of being of use to mr woodhouses spirit understand be sometimes much depressed a to recommendation to fancy need not take much pain to dwell on advantage of bath to young be pretty generally understood must be charming introduction for who have lived so secluded life must immediately secure of best society in place line from must bring little host of acquaintance particular friend mr partridge lady have always resided with when in bath must be most happy to shew attention must be very person for to go into public with be a much a emma must bear without being idea of being indebted to mr elton for what be called introductionof going into public under auspex of friend of mr eltonsprobably vulgar dashing widow who with help of boarder just made shift to livethe dignity of miss woodhouse of hartfield be sunk indeed restrained however from of reproof must have given only thanked mr elton coolly going to bath be quite out of question be not perfectly convinced that place might suit better than father then to prevent farther outrage indignation changed subject directly ask whether be musical mr elton upon occasion lady character generally precedes highbury have long known that be superior performer oh indeed must protest against such idea superior performervery far from assure consider from how partial quarter information came be doatingly fond of musicpassionately fondand friend say be not entirely devoid of taste a to thing else upon honour performance be mediocre to last degree miss woodhouse well know play delightfully assure have be greatest satisfaction comfort delight to to hear what musical society be got into absolutely can not do without music be necessary of life to having always be used to very musical society at maple grove in bath must have be most serious sacrifice honestly said a much to mr e when be speaking of future home expressing fear lest retirement of must be disagreeable inferiority of house tooknowing have be accustomed toof course be not wholly without apprehension when be speaking of in way honestly said that world must give upparties ball playsfor have fear of retirement blessed with so many resource within world be not necessary to must do very well without to who have resource be different thing resource made quite independent a to smaller sized room than have be used to really must not give thought hoped be perfectly equal to sacrifice of description certainly have be accustomed to luxury at maple grove did assure that two carriage be not necessary to happiness be spacious apartment said to be quite honest think can live without something of musical society condition for nothing else without music life must be blank to can not suppose said emma smiling mr elton must hesitate to assure of there being very musical society in highbury hope will not find have outstepped truth more than may be pardoned in consideration of motive indeed have doubt at on head be delighted to find in circle hope will have many sweet little concert together think miss woodhouse must establish musical club have regular weekly meeting at house ours will not be good plan if exert think will not be long in want of ally something of nature must be particularly desirable for a inducement to keep in practice for married woman knowthere be sad story against in general be too apt to give up music who be so extremely fond of itthere can be no danger surely must hope not really when look around among acquaintance tremble selina have entirely given up musicnever touch instrumentthough played sweetly same may be said of mr jeffereysclara partridge that wasand of two milmans now mr bird mr james cooper of more than can enumerate upon word be enough to put one in fright used to be quite angry with selina really begin now to comprehend that married woman have many thing to call attention believe be hour morning shut up with housekeeper thing of kind said emma will soon be in so regular train well said mr elton laughing will see emma finding so determined upon neglecting music have nothing more to say after moment pause mr elton chose subject have be calling at randalls said found at home very pleasant people seem to be like extremely mr weston seems excellent creaturequite first rate favourite with already assure appears so truly goodthere be something so motherly kind hearted about that win upon one directly be governess think emma be almost too much astonished to answer mr elton hardly waited for affirmative before went on having understood a much be rather astonished to find so very lady like be really quite gentlewoman mr weston manner said emma be always particularly good propriety simplicity elegance must make safest model for young woman who do think came in while be there emma be quite at loss tone implied old acquaintanceand how must possibly guess knightley continued mr elton knightley himselfwas not luckyfor not being within when called other day have never seen before of course a so particular friend of mr e have great curiosity friend knightley have be so often mentioned be really impatient to see must do caro sposo justice to say that need not be ashamed of friend knightley be quite gentleman like very much decidedly think very gentleman like man happily be now time to be gone be off emma must breathe insufferable woman be immediate exclamation worse than have supposed absolutely insufferable knightleyi must not have believed knightleynever seen in life before call knightleyand discover that be gentleman little upstart vulgar being with mr e caro sposo resource air of pert pretension underbred finery actually to discover mr knightley be gentleman doubt whether will return compliment discover to be lady must not have believed to propose that must unite to form musical club one must fancy be bosom friend mr westonastonished that person who have brought up must be gentlewoman worse worse never met with equal much beyond hope harriet be disgraced by comparison oh what must frank churchill say to if be here how angry how diverted must be ah there amthinking of directly always first person to be thought of how catch out frank churchill come a regularly into mind ran so glibly through thought that by time father have arranged after bustle of eltons departure be ready to speak be very tolerably capable of attending well dear deliberately began considering never saw before seems very pretty sort of young lady dare say be very much pleased with speaks little too quick little quickness of voice there be rather hurt ear believe be nice like strange voice nobody speaks like poor miss taylor however seems very obliging pretty behaved young lady doubt will make very good wife though think have better not have married made best excuse must for not having be able to wait on mr elton on happy occasion said that hoped must in course of summer ought to have gone before not to wait upon bride be very remiss ah shews what sad invalid be like corner into vicarage lane dare say apology be accepted sir mr elton know yes young ladya bridei ought to have paid respect to if possible be being very deficient dear papa be friend to matrimony therefore why must be so anxious to pay respect to bride ought to be recommendation to be encouraging people to marry if make so much of dear never encouraged body to marry must always wish to pay proper attention to ladyand bride especially be never to be neglected more be avowedly due to bride know dear be always first in company let others be who may well papa if be not encouragement to marry know what be must never have expected to be lending sanction to such vanity bait for poor young lady dear understand be matter of mere common politeness good breeding have nothing to do with encouragement to people to marry emma have done father be growing nervous must not understand mind returned to mr eltons offence long very long did occupy chapter xv emma be not required by subsequent discovery to retract ill opinion of mr elton observation have be pretty correct such a mr elton appeared to on second interview such appeared whenever met important presuming familiar ignorant ill bred have little beauty little accomplishment so little judgment that thought coming with superior knowledge of world to enliven improve country neighbourhood conceived miss hawkins to have held place in society a mr eltons consequence only must surpass there be reason to suppose mr elton thought at differently from wife seemed not merely happy with proud have air of congratulating on having brought woman to highbury a not even miss woodhouse must equal greater part of new acquaintance disposed to commend not in habit of judging following lead of miss batess good will taking for granted that bride must be a clever a agreeable a professed be very well satisfied so that mr eltons praise passed from one mouth to a ought to do unimpeded by miss woodhouse who readily continued first contribution talked with good grace of being very pleasant very elegantly dressed in one respect mr elton grew even worse than have appeared at first feeling altered towards emmaoffended probably by little encouragement proposal of intimacy met with drew back in turn gradually became much more cold distant though effect be agreeable ill will produced be necessarily increasing emmas dislike manner tooand mr eltons be unpleasant towards harriet be sneering negligent emma hoped must rapidly work harriets cure sensation must prompt such behaviour sunk very muchit be not to be doubted that poor harriets attachment have be offering to conjugal unreserve own share in story under colouring least favourable to most soothing to have in likelihood be given also be of course object of joint dislikewhen have nothing else to say must be always easy to begin abusing miss woodhouse enmity dared not shew in open disrespect to found broader vent in contemptuous treatment of harriet mr elton took great fancy to jane fairfax from first not merely when state of warfare with one young lady might be supposed to recommend other from very first be not satisfied with expressing natural reasonable admirationbut without solicitation plea privilege must be wanting to assist befriend herbefore emma have forfeited confidence about third time of meeting heard mr eltons knight errantry on subject jane fairfax be absolutely charming miss woodhousei quite rave about jane fairfaxa sweet interesting creature so mild ladylikeand with such talentsi assure think have very extraordinary talent scruple to say that play extremely well know enough of music to speak decidedly on point oh be absolutely charming will laugh at warmthbut upon word talk of nothing jane fairfaxand situation be so calculated to affect onemiss woodhouse must exert endeavour to do something for must bring forward such talent a hers must not be suffered to remain unknowni dare say have heard charming line of poet full many flower be born to blush unseen waste fragrance on desert air must not allow to be verified in sweet jane fairfax can not think there be danger of be emmas calm answerand when be better acquainted with miss fairfaxs situation understand what home have be with colonel mr campbell have idea that will suppose talent can be unknown oh dear miss woodhouse be now in such retirement such obscurity so thrown awaywhatever advantage may have enjoyed with campbell be so palpably at end think feel be sure doe be very timid silent one can see that feel want of encouragement like better for must confess be recommendation to be great advocate for timidityand be sure one doe not often meet with itbut in who be at inferior be extremely prepossessing oh assure jane fairfax be very delightful character interest more than can express appear to feel great dealbut be not aware how of miss fairfaxs acquaintance here of who have known longer than can shew other attention than dear miss woodhouse vast deal may be done by who dare to act need not be afraid if set example many will follow a far a can though have not situation have carriage to fetch convey home live in style must not make addition of jane fairfax at time least inconvenienti must be extremely displeased if wright be to send up such dinner a must make regret having asked more than jane fairfax to partake of have idea of sort of thing be not likely that must considering what have be used to greatest danger perhaps in housekeeping may be quite other way in doing too much being too careless of expense maple grove will probably be model more than ought to befor at affect to equal brother mr suckling in incomehowever resolution be taken a to noticing jane fairfaxi will certainly have very often at house will introduce wherever can will have musical party to draw out talent will be constantly on watch for eligible situation acquaintance be so very extensive have little doubt of hearing of something to suit shortlyi will introduce of course very particularly to brother sister when come to be sure will like extremely when get little acquainted with fear will completely wear off for there really be nothing in manner of what be highly conciliatingi will have very often indeed while be with dare say will sometimes find seat for in barouche landau in of exploring party poor jane fairfaxthought emmayou have not deserved may have done wrong with regard to mr dixon be punishment beyond what can have meritedthe kindness protection of mr eltonjane fairfax jane fairfax heaven let not suppose that dare go about emma woodhouse ing mebut upon honour there seems limit to licentiousness of woman tongue emma have not to listen to such paradings againto so exclusively addressed to herselfso disgustingly decorated with dear miss woodhouse change on mr eltons side soon afterwards appeared be left in peaceneither forced to be very particular friend of mr elton under mr eltons guidance very active patroness of jane fairfax only sharing with others in general way in knowing what be felt what be meditated what be done looked on with amusementmiss batess gratitude for mr eltons attention to jane be in first style of guileless simplicity warmth be quite one of worthiesthe most amiable affable delightful womanjust a accomplished condescending a mr elton meant to be considered emmas only surprize be that jane fairfax must accept attention tolerate mr elton a seemed to do heard of walking with eltons sitting with eltons spending day with eltons be astonishingshe must not have believed possible that taste pride of miss fairfax must endure such society friendship a vicarage have to offer be riddle quite riddle said sheto chuse to remain here month after month under privation of sort now to chuse mortification of mr eltons notice penury of conversation rather than return to superior companion who have always loved with such real generous affection jane have come to highbury professedly for three month campbell be gone to ireland for three month now campbell have promised daughter to stay at least till midsummer fresh invitation have arrived for to join there according to miss batesit came from hermrs dixon have written most pressingly must jane go mean be to be found servant sent friend contrivedno travelling difficulty allowed to exist still have declined must have motive more powerful than appears for refusing invitation be emmas conclusion must be under sort of penance inflicted either by campbell there be great fear great caution great resolution somewhereshe be not to be with dixons decree be issued by somebody why must consent to be with eltonshere be quite separate puzzle upon speaking wonder aloud on part of subject before few who knew opinion of mr elton mr weston ventured apology for jane can not suppose that have great enjoyment at vicarage dear emmabut be better than being always at home aunt be good creature a constant companion must be very tiresome must consider what miss fairfax quits before condemn taste for what go to be right mr weston said mr knightley warmly miss fairfax be a capable a of of forming just opinion of mr elton must have chosen with whom to associate must not have chosen with reproachful smile at emma receives attention from mr elton nobody else pay emma felt that mr weston be giving momentary glance be struck by warmth with faint blush presently replied such attention a mr eltons must have imagined must rather disgust than gratify miss fairfax mr eltons invitation must have imagined thing inviting must not wonder said mr weston if miss fairfax be to have be drawn on beyond own inclination by aunt eagerness in accepting mr eltons civility for poor miss bates may very likely have committed niece hurried into greater appearance of intimacy than own good sense must have dictated in spite of very natural wish of little change felt rather anxious to hear speak again after few minute silence said thing must be taken into consideration toomrs elton doe not talk to miss fairfax a speaks of know difference between pronoun thou plainest spoken amongst feel influence of something beyond common civility in personal intercourse with othera something more early implanted can not give body disagreeable hint that may have be very full of hour before feel thing differently besides operation of a general principle may be sure that miss fairfax awe mr elton by superiority of mind manner face to face mr elton treat with respect have claim to woman a jane fairfax probably never fell in mr eltons way beforeand degree of vanity can prevent acknowledging own comparative littleness in action if not in consciousness know how highly think of jane fairfax said emma little henry be in thought mixture of alarm delicacy made irresolute what else to say yes replied body may know how highly think of yet said emma beginning hastily with arch look soon stoppingit be better however to know worst at onceshe hurried onand yet perhaps may hardly be aware how highly be extent of admiration may take by surprize day other mr knightley be hard at work upon lower button of thick leather gaiter exertion of getting together other cause brought colour into face a answered oh be therebut be miserably behindhand mr cole gave hint of six week ago stoppedemma felt foot pressed by mr weston did not herself know what to think in moment went on will never be however can assure miss fairfax dare say must not have if be to ask herand be very sure will never ask emma returned friend pressure with interest be pleased enough to exclaim be not vain mr knightley will say that for seemed hardly to hear be thoughtfuland in manner shewed not pleased soon afterwards said so have be settling must marry jane fairfax indeed have not have scolded too much for match making for to presume to take liberty with said just now meant nothing one say sort of thing of course without idea of serious meaning oh upon word have not smallest wish for marrying jane fairfax jane body must not come in sit with in comfortable way if be married mr knightley be thoughtful again result of reverie be emma think extent of admiration for will ever take by surprizei never have thought of in way assure soon afterwards jane fairfax be very charming young womanbut not even jane fairfax be perfect have fault have not open temper man must wish for in wife emma must not rejoice to hear that have fault well said soon silenced mr cole suppose yes very soon gave quiet hint told be mistaken asked pardon said more cole doe not want to be wiser wittier than neighbour in respect how unlike dear mr elton who want to be wiser wittier than world wonder how speaks of coleswhat call how can find appellation for deep enough in familiar vulgarity call knightleywhat can do for mr cole so be not to be surprized that jane fairfax accepts civility consent to be with mr weston argument weighs most with can much more readily enter into temptation of getting away from miss bates than can believe in triumph of miss fairfaxs mind over mr elton have faith in mr eltons acknowledging inferior in thought word deed in being under restraint beyond own scanty rule of good breeding can not imagine that will not be continually insulting visitor with praise encouragement offer of service that will not be continually detailing magnificent intention from procuring permanent situation to including in delightful exploring party be to take place in barouche landau jane fairfax have feeling said mr knightleyi accuse of want of feeling sensibility suspect be strongand temper excellent in power of forbearance patience self control want openness be reserved more reserved think than used to beand love open temper notill cole alluded to supposed attachment have never entered head saw jane fairfax conversed with with admiration pleasure alwaysbut with thought beyond well mr weston said emma triumphantly when left what do say now to mr knightleys marrying jane fairfax why really dear emma say that be so very much occupied by idea of not being in love with must not wonder if be to end in being so at last beat chapter xvi body in about highbury who have ever visited mr elton be disposed to pay attention on marriage dinner party evening party be made for lady invitation flowed in so fast that have soon pleasure of apprehending be never to have disengaged day see how be said see what life be to lead among upon word will be absolutely dissipated really seem quite fashion if be living in country be nothing very formidable from monday next to saturday assure have not disengaged daya woman with fewer resource than have need not have be at loss invitation came amiss to bath habit made evening party perfectly natural to maple grove have given taste for dinner be little shocked at want of two drawing room at poor attempt at rout cake there being ice in highbury card party mr bates mr perry mr goddard others be good deal behind hand in knowledge of world must soon shew how thing ought to be arranged in course of spring must return civility by one very superior partyin card table must be set out with separate candle unbroken pack in true styleand more waiter engaged for evening than own establishment must furnish to carry round refreshment at exactly proper hour in proper order emma in meanwhile must not be satisfied without dinner at hartfield for eltons must not do le than others must be exposed to odious suspicion imagined capable of pitiful resentment dinner there must be after emma have talked about for ten minute mr woodhouse felt unwillingness only made usual stipulation of not sitting at bottom of table with usual regular difficulty of deciding who must do for person to be invited required little thought besides eltons must be weston mr knightley so far be of courseand be hardly le inevitable that poor little harriet must be asked to make eighthbut invitation be not given with equal satisfaction on many account emma be particularly pleased by harriets begging to be allowed to decline must rather not be in company more than must help be not yet quite able to see charming happy wife together without feeling uncomfortable if miss woodhouse must not be displeased must rather stay at home be precisely what emma must have wished have deemed possible enough for wishing be delighted with fortitude of little friendfor fortitude knew be in to give up being in company stay at home must now invite very person whom really wanted to make eighth jane fairfax since last conversation with mr weston mr knightley be more conscience stricken about jane fairfax than have often beenmr knightleys word dwelt with have said that jane fairfax received attention from mr elton nobody else paid be very true said at least a far a relates to be be meantand be very shamefulof same ageand always knowing heri ought to have be more friendshe will never like now have neglected too long will shew greater attention than have done invitation be successful be disengaged happythe preparatory interest of dinner however be not yet over circumstance rather unlucky occurred two eldest little knightleys be engaged to pay grandpapa aunt visit of week in spring papa now proposed bringing staying one whole day at hartfieldwhich one day must be very day of partyhis professional engagement did not allow of being put off father daughter be disturbed by happening so mr woodhouse considered eight person at dinner together a utmost that nerve must bearand here must be ninthand emma apprehended that must be ninth very much out of humour at not being able to come even to hartfield for forty eight hour without falling in with dinner party comforted father better than must comfort by representing that though certainly must make nine yet always said so little that increase of noise must be very immaterial thought in reality sad exchange for herself to have with grave look reluctant conversation opposed to instead of brother event be more favourable to mr woodhouse than to emma john knightley came mr weston be unexpectedly summoned to town must be absent on very day might be able to join in evening certainly not to dinner mr woodhouse be quite at ease seeing so with arrival of little boy philosophic composure of brother on hearing fate removed chief of even vexation day came party be punctually assembled mr john knightley seemed early to devote to business of being agreeable instead of drawing brother off to window while waited for dinner be talking to miss fairfax mr elton a elegant a lace pearl must make looked at in silencewanting only to observe enough for isabella informationbut miss fairfax be old acquaintance quiet girl must talk to have met before breakfast a be returning from walk with little boy when have be just beginning to rain be natural to have civil hope on subject said hope did not venture far miss fairfax morning be sure must

never worth going through rain for there be little blush then answer must not hope to be ever situated a be in midst of dearest connexion therefore can not expect that simply growing older must make indifferent about letter indifferent oh noi never conceived must become indifferent letter be matter of indifference be generally very positive curse be speaking of letter of business mine be letter of friendship have often thought worst of two replied coolly business know may bring money friendship hardly ever doe ah be not serious now know mr john knightley too welli be very sure understands value of friendship a well a body can easily believe that letter be very little to much le than to be not being ten year older than make difference be not age situation have body dearest to always at hand probably never will again therefore till have outlived affection post office think must always have power to draw out in worse weather than to day when talked of being altered by time by progress of year said john knightley meant to imply change of situation time usually brings consider one a including other time will generally lessen interest of attachment not within daily circlebut be not change have in view for a old friend will allow to hope miss fairfax ten year hence may have a many concentrated object a have be kindly said very far from giving offence pleasant thank seemed meant to laugh off blush quivering lip tear in eye shewed that be felt beyond laugh attention be now claimed by mr woodhouse who being according to custom on such occasion making circle of guest paying

degree of agitation rather thought be considerable mr weston however too eager to be very observant too communicative to want others to talk be very well satisfied with what did say soon moved away to make rest of friend happy by partial communication of what whole room must have overheard already be well that took body joy for granted might not have thought either mr woodhouse mr knightley particularly delighted be first entitled after mr weston emma to be made happyfrom must have proceeded to miss fairfax be so deep in conversation with john knightley that must have be too positive interruption finding close to mr elton attention disengaged necessarily began on subject with chapter xviii hope will soon have pleasure of introducing son to said mr weston mr elton very willing to suppose particular compliment intended by such hope smiled most graciously have heard of certain frank churchill presume continuedand know to be son though doe not bear name oh yes will be very happy

again with four horse evil of distance from enscombe said mr weston be that mr churchill a understand have not be able to leave sofa for week together in frank last letter complained said of being too weak to get into conservatory without having arm uncle know speaks great degree of weaknessbut now be so impatient to be in town that mean to sleep only two night on roadso frank writes word certainly delicate lady have very extraordinary constitution mr elton must grant that indeed will grant nothing always take part of own sex do indeed give noticeyou will find formidable antagonist on point always stand up for womenand assure if knew how selina feel with respect to sleeping at inn must not wonder at mr churchill making incredible exertion to avoid say be quite horror to herand believe

to lady in land for mr elton eagerly interposed with oh mr weston mistake selina be fine lady assure run away with such idea be not then be rule for mr churchill who be a thorough fine lady a body ever beheld mr elton began to think have be wrong in disclaiming so warmly be by mean object to have believed that sister be not fine lady perhaps there be want of spirit in pretence of itand be considering in what way have best retract when mr went on mr churchill be not much in good grace a may suspectbut be quite between ourselves be very fond of frank therefore must not speak ill of besides be out of health now that indeed by own account have always be must not say so to body mr elton have not much faith in mr churchill illness if be really ill why not go to bath mr westonto bath to clifton have taken into head that enscombe be too cold for fact be suppose that be tired of enscombe have now be longer time stationary there than ever be before begin to want change be retired place fine place very retired ayelike maple grove dare say nothing can stand more retired from road than maple grove immense plantation round seem shut out from thingin most complete retirementand mr churchill probably have not health spirit like selina to enjoy sort of seclusion perhaps may not have resource enough in to be qualified for country life always say woman can not have too many resourcesand feel very thankful have so many a to be quite independent of society frank be here in february for fortnight so remember to have heard will find addition to society of highbury when come again be if may presume to call addition perhaps may never have heard of there being such creature in world be too loud call for compliment to be passed by mr weston with very good grace immediately exclaimed dear madam nobody must imagine thing possible not heard of youi believe mr weston letter lately have be full of very little else than mr elton have done duty must return to son when frank left continued be quite uncertain when might see again make day news doubly welcome have be completely unexpected that be always have strong persuasion must be here again soon be sure something favourable must turn upbut nobody believed mr weston be dreadfully desponding how must contrive to come how must be supposed that uncle aunt must spare again so forthi always felt that something must happen in favour so have see have observed mr elton in course of life that if thing be going untowardly one month be sure to mend next very true mr weston perfectly true be just what used to say to certain gentleman in company in day of courtship when because thing did not go quite right did not proceed with rapidity suited feeling be apt to be in despair exclaim that be sure at rate must be may before hymen saffron robe must be put on for oh pain have be at to dispel gloomy idea give cheerfuller view carriagewe have disappointment about carriageone morning remember came to quite in despair be stopped by slight fit of coughing mr weston instantly seized opportunity of going on be mentioning may may be very month mr churchill be ordered have ordered to spend in warmer place than enscombein short to spend in london so that have agreeable prospect of frequent visit from frank whole springprecisely season of year one must have chosen for day almost at longest weather genial pleasant always inviting one out never too hot for exercise when be here before made best of there be good deal of wet damp cheerless weather there always be in february know must not do half that intended now will be time will be complete enjoyment know mr elton whether uncertainty of meeting sort of constant expectation there will be of coming in to day to morrow at hour may not be more friendly to happiness than having actually in house think be so think be state of mind give most spirit delight hope will be pleased with son must not expect prodigy be generally thought fine young man expect prodigy mr weston partiality for be very great a may suppose most gratifying to think nobody equal to assure mr weston have very little doubt that opinion will be decidedly in favour have heard so much in praise of mr frank churchillat same time be fair to observe be one of who always judge for be by mean implicitly guided by others give notice that a find son so will judge of himi be flatterer mr weston be musing hope said presently have not be severe upon poor mr churchill if be ill must be sorry to do injustice there be trait in character make difficult for to speak of with forbearance must wish can not be ignorant mr elton of connexion with family of treatment have met with between whole blame of be to be laid to be instigator frank mother must never have be slighted a be for mr churchill have pride pride be nothing to wife be quiet indolent gentlemanlike sort of pride must harm nobody only make little helpless tiresome pride be arrogance insolence what incline one le to bear have fair pretence of family blood be nobody when married barely daughter of gentleman ever since being turned into churchill have out churchilld in high mighty claim in assure be upstart only think well that must be infinitely provoking have horror of upstart maple grove have given thorough disgust to people of sort for there be family in neighbourhood who be annoyance to brother

footing with old established family year half be very utmost that can have lived at west hall how got fortune nobody know came from birmingham be not place to promise much know mr weston one have not great hope from birmingham always say there be something direful in sound nothing more be positively known of tupmans though good many thing assure be suspected yet by manner evidently think equal

be almost sure that old mr suckling have completed purchase before death be interrupted tea be carrying round mr weston having said that wanted soon took opportunity of walking away after tea mr mr weston mr elton sat down with mr woodhouse to card remaining five be left to own power emma doubted getting on very well for mr knightley seemed little disposed for conversation mr elton be wanting notice nobody have inclination to pay be in worry of spirit must have made prefer being silent mr john knightley proved more talkative than brother be to leave early next day soon began with well emma believe have thing more to say about boy have sister letter thing be down at full length there may be sure charge must be much more concise than hers probably not much in same spirit have to recommend being comprised in spoil physic rather hope to satisfy said emma for will do in power to make happy will be enough for isabella happiness must preclude false indulgence physic if find troublesome must send home again be very likely think so hope be aware that may be too noisy for fatheror even may be encumbrance to if visiting engagement continue to increase a much a have done lately increase

to little boy amazing engagement of minewhat have be dining once with colesand having ball talked of never took place can understand younodding at mr john knightleyyour good fortune in meeting with so many of friend at once here delight too much to pas unnoticed turning to mr knightley who know how very very seldom be ever two hour from hartfield why must foresee series of dissipation for can not imagine a to dear little boy must say that if aunt emma have not time for think must fare much better with uncle knightley who be absent from home about five hour where be absent oneand who when be at home be either reading to settling account mr knightley seemed to be trying not to smile succeeded without difficulty upon mr eltons beginning to talk to volume iii chapter very little quiet reflection be enough to satisfy emma a to nature of agitation on hearing news of frank churchill be soon convinced that be not for be feeling at apprehensive embarrassed be for own attachment have really subsided into mere nothing be not worth thinking ofbut if who have undoubtedly be always so much most in love of two be to be returning with same warmth of sentiment have taken away must be very distressing if separation of two month must not have cooled there be danger evil before hercaution for for must be necessary did not mean to have own affection entangled again must be incumbent on to avoid encouragement of wished might be able to keep from absolute declaration must be so very painful conclusion of present acquaintance yet must not help rather anticipating something decisive felt a if spring must not pas without bringing crisis event something to alter present composed tranquil state be not very long though rather longer than mr weston have foreseen before have power of forming opinion of frank churchill feeling enscombe family be not in town quite so soon a have be imagined be at highbury very soon afterwards rode down for couple of hour must not yet do more a came

staying only quarter of hour hurrying away to make other call in highbury have seen group of old acquaintance in street a passedhe have not stopped must not stop for more than wordbut have vanity to think must be disappointed if did not call much a wished to stay longer at hartfield must hurry off have doubt a to being le in lovebut agitated spirit hurrying away seemed like perfect cure be rather inclined to think implied dread of returning power discreet resolution of not trusting with long be only visit from frank churchill in course of ten day be often hoping intending to comebut be always prevented aunt must not bear to have leave such be own account at randalls if be quite sincere if really tried to come be to be inferred that mr churchill removal to london have be of service to wilful nervous part of disorder that be really ill be very certain have declared convinced of at randalls though much might be fancy must not doubt when looked back that be in weaker state of health than have be year ago did not believe to proceed from thing care medicine might not remove at least that might not have many year of existence before must not be prevailed on by father doubt to say

not exactly true for be perfectly well harriet not much otherwise emma must not interfere with have unhappy state of health in general for child of such man for hardly knew what indisposition be if did not invent illness for must make figure in message gipsy did not wait for operation of justice took off in hurry young lady of highbury might have walked again in safety before panic began whole history dwindled soon into matter of little importance to emma nephewsin imagination maintained ground henry john be still asking day for story of harriet gipsy still tenaciously setting right if varied in slightest particular from original recital chapter iv very few day have passed after adventure when harriet came one morning to emma with small parcel in hand after sitting down hesitating thus began miss woodhouseif be at leisurei have something must like to tell youa sort of confession to makeand then know will be over be good deal surprized begged to speak there be seriousness in harriets manner prepared quite a much a word for something more than ordinary be duty be sure be wish continued to have reserve with on subject a be happily quite altered creature in one respect be very fit that must have satisfaction of knowing want to say more than be necessaryi be too much ashamed of having given way a have done dare say understand yes said emma hope do how must so long time be fancying cried harriet warmly seems like madness can see nothing at extraordinary in nowi care whether meet notexcept of two have rather not see himand indeed must go distance round to avoid himbut envy wife in least neither admire envy a have done be very charming dare say think very ill tempered disagreeablei will never forget look other nighthowever assure miss woodhouse wish evilno let be ever so happy together will not give moment pang to convince have be speaking truth be now going to destroywhat ought to have destroyed long agowhat ought never to have kepti know very well blushing a spokehowever now will destroy alland be particular wish to do in presence that may see how rational be grown can not guess what parcel hold said with conscious look not least in worlddid ever give thing noi can not call gift be thing have valued very much held parcel towards emma read word most precious treasure on top curiosity be greatly excited harriet unfolded parcel looked on with impatience within abundance of silver paper be pretty little tunbridge ware box harriet opened be well lined with softest cotton excepting cotton emma saw only small piece of court plaister now said harriet must recollect indeed dear must not have thought possible must forget what passed in very room about court plaister one of very last time ever met in itit be very few day before have sore throatjust before mr mr john knightley camei think very evening remember cutting finger with new penknife recommending court plaisterbut a have none about knew have desired to supply so took mine out cut piece be great deal too large cut smaller kept playing time with what be left before gave back to so then in nonsense must not help making treasure of itso put by never to be used looked at now then a great treat dearest harriet cried emma putting hand before face jumping up make more ashamed of than can bear remember aye remember now except saving relici knew nothing of till momentbut cutting finger recommending court plaister saying have none about meoh sin sinsand have while in pocketone of senseless tricksi deserve to be under continual blush rest of lifewellsitting down againgo onwhat else have really at hand be sure never suspected did so naturally so actually put piece of court plaister by for sake said emma recovering from state of shame feeling divided between wonder amusement secretly added to herself lord bless when must ever have thought of putting by in cotton piece of court plaister frank churchill have be pulling about never be equal to here resumed harriet turning to box again here be something still more valuable mean have be more valuable because be what did really once belong to court plaister never did emma be quite eager to see superior treasure be end of old pencilthe part without lead be really said harriet remember one morningno dare say one morningi forget exactly daybut perhaps be tuesday wednesday before evening wanted to make memorandum in pocket book be about spruce beer mr knightley have be telling something about brewing spruce beer wanted to put down when took out pencil there be so little lead that soon cut away must not do so lent be left upon table a good for nothing kept eye on a soon a dared caught up never parted with again from moment do remember cried emma perfectly remember ittalking about spruce beeroh yesmr knightley saying liked mr eltons seeming resolved to learn to like too perfectly remember itstop mr knightley be standing just here be not have idea be standing just here ah know can not recollectit be very odd can not recollectmr elton be sitting here remember much about where be now well go on oh thats have nothing more to shew to sayexcept that be now going to throw behind fire wish to see do poor dear harriet have actually found happiness in treasuring up thing yes simpleton a wasbut be quite ashamed of now wish must forget a easily a can burn be very wrong of know to keep remembrance after be married knew wasbut have not resolution enough to part with harriet be necessary to burn court plaisteri have not word to say for bit of old pencil court plaister might be useful will be happier to burn replied harriet have disagreeable look to must get rid of thingthere go there be end thank heaven of mr elton when thought emma will there be beginning of mr churchill have soon afterwards reason to believe that beginning be already made must not hope that gipsy though have told fortune might be proved to have made harrietsabout fortnight after alarm came to sufficient explanation quite undesignedly emma be not thinking of at moment made information received more valuable merely said in course of trivial chat well harriet whenever marry must advise to do so soand thought more of till after minute silence heard harriet say in very serious tone will never marry emma then looked up immediately saw how be after moment debate a to whether must pas unnoticed not replied never marrythis be new resolution be one will never change however after short hesitation hope doe not proceed fromi hope be not in compliment to mr elton mr elton indeed cried harriet indignantlyoh noand emma must just catch word so superior to mr elton then took longer time for consideration must proceed farthershould let pas seem to suspect nothingperhaps harriet might think cold angry if did perhaps if be totally silent might only drive harriet into asking to hear too much against thing like unreserve a have be such open frequent discussion of hope chance be perfectly resolvedshe believed must be wiser for to say know at once that meant to say know plain dealing be always best have previously determined how far must proceed on application of sort must be safer for to have judicious law of own brain laid down with speedshe be decided thus spoke harriet will not affect to be in doubt of meaning resolution rather expectation of never marrying result from idea that person whom might prefer must be too greatly superior in situation to think of be not so oh miss woodhouse believe have not presumption to suppose indeed be not so madbut be pleasure to to admire at distanceand to think of infinite superiority to rest of world with gratitude wonder veneration be so proper in especially be not at surprized at harriet service rendered be enough to warm heart service oh be such inexpressible obligationthe very recollection of felt at timewhen saw cominghis noble lookand wretchedness before such change in one moment such change from perfect misery to perfect happiness be very natural be natural be honourableyes honourable think to chuse so well so gratefullybut that will be fortunate preference be more than can promise advise to give way to harriet by mean engage for being returned consider what be about perhaps will be wisest in to check feeling while can at rate let carry far unless be persuaded of liking be observant of let behaviour be guide of sensation give caution now because will never speak to again on subject be determined against interference henceforward know nothing of matter let name ever pas lip be very wrong before will be cautious nowhe be superior doubt there do seem objection obstacle of very serious nature yet harriet more wonderful thing have taken place there have be match of greater disparity take care of must not have too sanguine though however may end be assured raising thought to be mark of good taste will always know how to value harriet kissed hand in silent submissive gratitude emma be very decided in thinking such attachment bad thing for friend tendency must be to raise refine mindand must be saving from danger of degradation chapter v in state of scheme hope connivance june opened

campbell from ireland be again delayed august instead of midsummer fixed for be likely to remain there full two month longer provided at least be able to defeat mr eltons activity in service save from being hurried into delightful situation against will mr knightley who for reason best known to have certainly taken early dislike to frank churchill be only growing to dislike more began to suspect of double dealing in pursuit of emma that emma be object appeared indisputable thing declared own attention father hint mother in law guarded silence be in unison word conduct discretion indiscretion told same story while so many be devoting to emma emma making over to harriet mr knightley began to suspect of inclination to trifle with jane fairfax must not understand there be symptom of intelligence between themhe thought so at leastsymptoms of admiration on side having once observed must not persuade to think entirely void of meaning however might wish to escape of emmas error of imagination be not present when suspicion first arose be dining with randalls family jane at eltons have seen look more than single look at miss fairfax from admirer of miss woodhouse seemed somewhat out of place when be again in company must not help remembering what have seen must avoid observation unless be like cowper fire at twilight creating what saw brought yet stronger suspicion of there being something of private liking of private understanding even between frank churchill jane have walked up one day after dinner a very often did to spend evening at hartfield emma harriet be going to walk joined on returning fell in with larger party who like judged wisest to take exercise early a weather threatened rain mr mr weston son miss bates niece who have accidentally met united on

regular connected dream about people whom be not very likely must be thinking of at enscombe perry setting up carriage wife persuading to out of care for healthjust what will happen have doubt time other only little premature what air of probability sometimes run through dream at others what heap of absurdity be well frank dream certainly shews that highbury be in thought when be absent emma be great dreamer think emma be out of hearing have hurried on before guest to prepare father for appearance be beyond reach of mr weston hint why to own truth cried miss bates who have be trying in vain to be heard last two minute if must speak on subject there be denying that mr frank churchill might havei mean to say that did not dream iti be sure have sometimes oddest dream in worldbut if be questioned about must acknowledge that there be such idea last spring for mr perry mentioned to mother cole knew of a well a ourselvesbut be quite secret known to nobody else only thought of about

be something judged proper to appear to censure for said nonsense for shame heard frank churchill next say with glance towards jane will give to herwill iand a clearly heard emma opposing with eager laughing warmth must not will not indeed be done however gallant young man who seemed to love without feeling to recommend without complaisance directly handed over word to miss fairfax with

acquaintance rued rest of life miss fairfax who have seldom spoken before except among own confederate spoke now such thing do occur undoubtedlyshe be stopped by cough frank churchill turned towards to listen be speaking said gravely recovered voice be only going to observe though such unfortunate circumstance do sometimes occur to men woman can not imagine to be very frequent hasty imprudent attachment may arisebut there be generally time to recover from afterwards must be understood to mean that can be only weak irresolute character whose happiness must be always at mercy of chance who

knightley mr weston son emma harriet only remained young man spirit now rose to pitch almost unpleasant even emma grew tired at last of flattery merriment wished rather walking quietly about with of others sitting almost alone quite unattended to in tranquil observation of beautiful view beneath appearance of servant looking out for to give notice of carriage be joyful sight even bustle of collecting preparing to depart solicitude of mr elton to have carriage first be gladly endured in prospect of quiet drive home be to close very questionable enjoyment of day of pleasure such scheme composed of so many ill assorted people hoped never to be betrayed into again while waiting for carriage found mr knightley by side looked around a if to see that one be near then said emma must once more speak to a have be used to do privilege rather endured than allowed perhaps must still use can not see acting wrong without remonstrance how must be so unfeeling to miss bates how must be so insolent in wit to woman of character age situationemma have not thought possible emma recollected blushed be sorry tried to laugh off nay how must help saying what didnobody must have helped be not so very bad dare say did not understand assure did felt full meaning have talked of since wish must have heard how talked of itwith what candour generosity wish must have heard honouring forbearance in being able to pay such attention a be for ever receiving from father when society must be so irksome oh cried emma know there be not better creature in world must allow what be good what be ridiculous be most unfortunately blended in be blended said acknowledge be prosperous must allow much for occasional prevalence of ridiculous over good be woman of fortune must leave harmless absurdity to take chance must not quarrel with for liberty of manner be equal in situationbut emma consider how far be from being case be poor have sunk from comfort be born to if live to old age must probably sink more situation must secure compassion be badly done indeed whom have known from infant whom have seen grow up from period when notice be honour to have now in thoughtless spirit pride of moment laugh at humble herand before niece tooand before others many of whom certainly must be entirely guided by treatment of herthis be not pleasant to emmaand be very far from pleasant to must willi will tell truth while can satisfied with proving friend by very faithful counsel trusting that will time other do greater justice than can do now while talked be advancing towards carriage be ready before must speak again have handed in have misinterpreted feeling have kept face averted tongue motionless be combined only of anger against mortification deep concern have not be able to speak on entering carriage sunk back for moment overcomethen reproaching for having taken leave making acknowledgment parting in apparent sullenness looked out with voice hand eager to shew difference be just too late have turned away horse be in motion continued to look back in vain soon with what appeared unusual speed be half way down hill thing left far behind be vexed beyond what must have be expressedalmost beyond what must conceal never have felt so agitated mortified grieved at circumstance in life be most forcibly struck truth of representation there be denying felt at heart how must have be so brutal so cruel to miss bates how must have exposed to such ill opinion in one valued how suffer to leave without saying one word of gratitude of concurrence of common kindness time did not compose a reflected more seemed to feel more never have be so depressed happily be not necessary to speak there be only harriet who seemed not in spirit fagged very willing to be silent emma felt tear running down cheek almost way home without being at trouble to check extraordinary a be chapter viii wretchedness of scheme to box hill be in emmas thought evening how might be considered by rest of

be so unfeeling to fatheri must will tell truth while can miss bates must never againno never if attention in future must do away past might hope to be forgiven have be often remiss conscience told so

pain must try temper be sad eventa great shockwith fault what must mr churchill do without mr churchill loss must be dreadful indeed mr churchill must never get over iteven mr weston shook head looked solemn said ah poor woman who must have thought resolved that mourning must be a handsome a possible wife sat sighing moralising over broad hem with commiseration good sense true steady how must affect frank be among earliest thought of be also very early speculation with character of mr churchill grief of husbandher mind glanced over with awe compassionand then rested with lightened feeling on how frank might be affected by event how benefited how freed saw in moment possible good now attachment to harriet smith must have nothing to encounter mr churchill independent of wife be feared by nobody easy guidable man to be persuaded into thing by nephew remained to be wished be that nephew must form attachment a with goodwill in cause emma must feel certainty of being already formed harriet behaved extremely well on occasion with great self command what ever might feel of brighter hope betrayed nothing emma be gratified to observe proof in of strengthened character refrained from allusion might endanger maintenance spoke therefore of mr churchill death with mutual forbearance short letter from frank be received at randalls communicating be immediately important of state plan mr churchill be better than must be expected first removal on departure of funeral for yorkshire be to be to house of very old friend in windsor to whom mr churchill have be promising visit last ten

consideration resolved to prevail on to spend day at note be written to urge invitation be refused by verbal message miss fairfax be not well enough to write when mr perry called at hartfield same morning appeared that be so much indisposed a to have be visited though against own consent by that be suffering under severe headache nervous fever to degree made doubt possibility of going to mr smallridges at time proposed health seemed for moment completely derangedappetite quite goneand though there be absolutely alarming symptom nothing touching pulmonary complaint be standing apprehension of family mr perry be uneasy about thought have undertaken more than be equal to that felt so though must not own spirit seemed overcome present home must not observe be unfavourable to nervous disorderconfined always to one roomhe must have wished otherwiseand good aunt though very old friend must acknowledge to be not best companion for invalid of description care attention must not be questioned be in fact only too great very much feared that miss fairfax derived more evil than good from emma listened with warmest concern grieved for more more looked around eager to discover way of being useful to take herbe only hour twofrom aunt to give change of air scene quiet rational conversation even for hour two might do good following morning wrote again to say in most feeling language must command that must call for in carriage at hour that jane must namementioning that have mr perry decided opinion in favour of such exercise for patient answer be only in short note miss fairfaxs compliment thanks be quite unequal to exercise emma felt that own note have deserved something better be impossible to quarrel with word whose tremulous inequality shewed indisposition so plainly thought only of how might best counteract unwillingness to be seen assisted in spite of answer therefore ordered carriage drove to mr batess in hope that jane must be induced to join herbut must not domiss bates came to carriage door gratitude agreeing with most earnestly in thinking airing might be of greatest serviceand thing message must do be triedbut in vain miss bates be obliged to return without success jane be quite unpersuadable mere proposal of going out seemed to make worseemma wished must have seen tried own power almost before must hint wish miss bates made appear that have promised niece on account to let miss woodhouse in indeed truth be that poor dear jane must not bear to see bodyany body at allmrs elton indeed must not be deniedand mr cole have made pointand mr perry have said so muchbut except jane must really see nobody emma did not want to be classed with mr eltons mr perry mr cole who must force anywhere neither must feel right of preference herselfshe submitted therefore only questioned miss bates farther a to niece appetite diet longed to be able to assist on subject poor miss bates be very unhappy very communicative jane must hardly eat thingmr perry recommended nourishing food thing must command never have body such good neighbour be distasteful emma on reaching home called housekeeper directly to examination of store arrowroot of very superior quality be speedily despatched to miss bates with most friendly note in hour arrowroot be returned with thousand thanks from miss bates dear jane must not be satisfied without being sent back be thing must not takeand moreover insisted on saying that be not at in want of thing when emma afterwards heard that jane fairfax have be seen wandering about meadow at distance from highbury on afternoon of very day on have under plea of being unequal to exercise so peremptorily refused to go out with in carriage must have doubtputting thing togetherthat jane be resolved to receive kindness from be sorry very sorry heart be grieved for state seemed more pitiable from sort of irritation of spirit inconsistency of action inequality of power mortified that be given so little credit for proper feeling esteemed so little worthy a friend have consolation of knowing that intention be good of being able to say to herself must mr knightley have be privy to attempt of assisting jane fairfax must even have seen into heart must not on occasion have found thing to reprove chapter x one morning about ten day after mr churchill decease emma be called downstairs to mr weston who must

much worseif walk fast will soon be at randalls emma found that must wait now required little effort asked more question therefore merely employed own fancy soon pointed out to probability of being money concernsomething just come to light of disagreeable nature in circumstance of familysomething late event at richmond have brought forward fancy be very active half dozen natural child perhapsand poor frank cut offthis though very undesirable must be matter of agony to inspired little more than animating curiosity who be gentleman on horseback said a proceededspeaking more to assist mr weston in keeping secret than with other view knowone of otwaysnot frankit be not frank assure will not see be half way to windsor by time have son be with then oh yesdid not knowwell well never mind for

know directly what be have be walking way in complete suspense abhor suspense let mine continue longer will do good to speak of distress whatever may be have indeed idea said mr weston in trembling voice can not dear emmacannot form guess a to what be to hear so far a that relates to mr frank churchill do guess be right doe relate to will tell directly resuming work seeming resolved against looking up have be here very morning on most extraordinary errand be impossible to express surprize came to speak to father on subjectto announce attachment stopped to breathe emma thought first of herself then of harriet more than attachment indeed resumed mr weston engagementa positive engagementwhat will say will body say when be known that frank churchill miss fairfax be engagednay that have be long engaged emma even jumped with surprizeand horror struck exclaimed jane fairfaxgood god be not serious mean may well be amazed returned mr weston still averting eye talking on with eagerness emma might have time to recover may well be amazed be even so there have be solemn engagement between ever since octoberformed at weymouth kept secret from body not creature knowing themselvesneither campbell family hisit be so wonderful that though perfectly convinced of fact be yet almost incredible to myself can hardly believe iti thought knew emma scarcely heard what be saidher mind be divided between two ideasher own former conversation with about miss fairfax poor harrietand for time must only exclaim require confirmation repeated confirmation well said at last trying to recover be circumstance must think of at least day before can at comprehend whatengaged to winterbefore of came to highbury engaged since octobersecretly engagedit have hurt emma very much have hurt father equally part of conduct can not excuse emma pondered moment then replied will not pretend not to understand to give relief in power be assured that such effect have followed attention to a be apprehensive of mr weston looked up afraid to believe countenance be a steady a word that may have le difficulty in believing boast of present perfect indifference continued will farther tell that there be period in early part of acquaintance when did like when be very much disposed to be attached to himnay be attachedand how came to cease be perhaps wonder fortunately however did cease have really for time past for at least three month cared nothing about may believe mr weston be simple truth mr weston kissed with tear of joy when must find utterance assured that protestation have done more good than thing else in world must do mr weston will be almost a much relieved a myself said on point have be wretched be darling wish that might be attached to otherand be persuaded that be so imagine what have be feeling on account have escaped must escape may be matter of grateful wonder to doe not acquit mr weston must say that think greatly to blame what right have to come among with affection faith engaged with manner so very disengaged what right have to endeavour to please a certainly didto distinguish one young woman with persevering attention a certainly didwhile really belonged to anotherhow must tell what mischief might be doinghow must tell that might not be making in love with himvery wrong very wrong indeed from something that said dear emma rather imagine how must bear such behaviour composure with witness to look on while repeated attention be offering to woman before face not resent itthat be degree of placidity can comprehend respect there be misunderstanding between emma said so expressly have not time to enter into much explanation be here only quarter of hour in state of agitation did not allow full use even of time must staybut that there have be misunderstanding decidedly said present crisis indeed seemed to be brought on by misunderstanding might very possibly arise from impropriety of conduct impropriety oh mr westonit be too calm censure much much beyond improprietyit have sunk can not say how have sunk in opinion so unlike what man must benone of upright integrity strict adherence to truth principle that disdain of trick littleness man must display in transaction of life nay dear emma now must take part for though have be wrong in instance have known long enough to answer for having many very many good quality good god cried emma not attending to hermrs smallridge too jane actually on point of going a governess what must mean by such horrible indelicacy to suffer to engage herselfto suffer even to think of measure knew nothing about emma on article can fully acquit be private resolution of hers not communicated to himor at least not communicated in way to carry convictiontill yesterday know said be in dark a to plan burst on know how by letter messageand be discovery of what be doing of very project of hers determined to come forward at once own to uncle throw on kindness in short put end to miserable state of concealment have be carrying on so long emma began to listen better be to hear from soon continued mr weston told at parting that must soon write spoke in manner seemed to promise many particular must not be given now let wait therefore for letter may bring many extenuation may make many thing intelligible excusable now be not to be understood dont let be severe dont let be in hurry to condemn let have patience must love now that be satisfied on one point one material point be sincerely anxious for turning out well ready to hope that may must have suffered great deal under system of secresy concealment suffering replied emma dryly appear to have done much harm well how did mr churchill take most favourably for nephewgave consent with scarcely difficulty conceive what event of week have done in family while poor mr churchill lived suppose there must not have be hope chance possibilitybut scarcely be remains at rest in family vault than husband be persuaded to act exactly opposite to what must have required what blessing be when undue influence doe not survive gravehe gave consent with very little persuasion ah thought emma must have done a much for harriet be settled last night frank be off with light morning stopped at highbury at batess fancy timeand then came on hither be in such hurry to get back to uncle to whom be just now more necessary than ever that a tell must stay with quarter of hourhe be very much agitatedvery much indeedto degree made appear quite different creature from thing have ever seen beforein addition to rest there have be shock of finding so very unwell have have no previous suspicion ofand there be appearance of having be feeling great deal do really believe affair to have be carrying on with such perfect secresythe campbell dixons did none of know of engagement emma must not speak name of dixon without little blush none not one positively said that have be known to being in world two self well said emma suppose will gradually grow reconciled to idea wish very happy will always think very abominable sort of proceeding have be system of hypocrisy deceitespionage treacheryto come among with profession of openness simplicity league in secret to judge allhere have be whole winter spring completely duped fancying on equal footing of truth honour with two people in midst of who may have be carrying round comparing sitting in judgment on sentiment word be never meant for to hearthey must take consequence if have heard other spoken of in way not perfectly agreeable be quite easy on head replied mr weston be very sure that never said thing of to other might not have heard be in luckyour only blunder be confined to ear when imagined certain friend of ours in love with lady true a have always have thoroughly good opinion of miss fairfax never must under blunder have spoken ill of a to speaking ill of there must have be safe at moment mr weston appeared at little distance from window evidently on watch wife gave look invited in while be coming round added now dearest emma let intreat to say look thing may set heart at ease incline to be satisfied with match let make best of itand indeed almost thing may be fairly said in favour be not connexion to gratify if mr churchill doe not feel that why must may be very fortunate circumstance for for frank mean that must have attached to girl of such steadiness of character good judgment a have always given credit forand still be disposed to give credit for in spite of one great deviation from strict rule of right how much may be said in situation for even error much indeed cried emma feelingly if woman can ever be excused for thinking only of herself be in situation like jane fairfaxsof such one may almost say that world be not theirs world law met mr weston on entrance with smiling countenance exclaiming very pretty trick have be playing upon word be device suppose to sport with curiosity exercise talent of guessing really frightened thought have lost half property at least here instead of being matter of condolence turn out to be one of congratulationi congratulate mr weston with heart on prospect of having one of most lovely accomplished young woman in england for daughter glance two between wife convinced that be a right a speech proclaimed happy effect on spirit be immediate air voice recovered usual briskness shook heartily gratefully by hand entered on subject in manner to prove that now only wanted time persuasion to think engagement very bad thing companion suggested only what must palliate imprudence smooth objection by time have talked over together have talked over again with emma in walk back to hartfield be become perfectly reconciled not far from thinking very best thing that frank must possibly have done chapter xi harriet poor harrietthose be word in lay tormenting idea emma must not get rid of constituted real misery of business to frank churchill have behaved very ill by herselfvery ill in many waysbut be not so much behaviour a own made so angry with be scrape have drawn into on harriets account gave deepest hue to offencepoor harriet to be second time dupe of misconception flattery mr knightley have spoken prophetically when once said emma have be friend to harriet smithshe be afraid have done nothing disserviceit be true that have not to charge in instance a in former with being sole original author of mischief with having suggested such feeling a might otherwise never have entered harriets imagination for harriet have acknowledged admiration preference of frank churchill before have ever given hint on subject felt completely guilty of having encouraged what might have repressed might have prevented indulgence increase of such sentiment influence must have be enough now be very conscious that ought to have prevented themshe felt that have be risking friend happiness on most insufficient ground common sense must have directed to tell harriet that must not allow to think of that there be five hundred chance to one against ever caring for herbut with common sense added be afraid have have little to do be extremely angry with if must not have be angry with frank churchill too must have be dreadfulas for jane fairfax might at least relieve feeling from present solicitude on account harriet must be anxiety enough need no longer be unhappy about jane whose trouble whose ill health having of course same origin must be equally under cureher day of insignificance evil be overshe must soon be well happy prosperousemma must now imagine why own attention have be slighted discovery laid many smaller matter open doubt have be from jealousyin janes eye have be rival well might thing must offer of assistance regard be repulsed airing in hartfield carriage must have be rack arrowroot from hartfield storeroom must have be poison understood a far a mind must disengage from injustice selfishness of angry feeling acknowledged that jane fairfax must have elevation happiness beyond desert poor harriet be such engrossing charge there be little sympathy to be spared for body else emma be sadly fearful that second disappointment must be more severe than first considering very superior claim of object ought judging by apparently stronger effect on harriets mind producing reserve self command wouldshe must communicate painful truth however a soon a possible injunction of secresy have be among mr weston parting word for present whole affair be to be completely secret mr churchill have made point of a token of respect to wife have so very recently lost body admitted to be no more than due decorumemma have promised still harriet must be excepted be superior duty in spite of vexation must not help feeling almost ridiculous that must have very same distressing delicate office to perform by harriet mr weston have just gone through by intelligence have be so anxiously announced to be now to be anxiously announcing to heart beat quick on hearing harriets footstep voice so supposed have poor mr weston felt when be approaching randalls must event of disclosure bear equal resemblancebut of unfortunately there must be chance well miss woodhouse cried harriet coming eagerly into roomis not oddest news that ever be what news do mean replied emma unable to guess by look voice whether harriet must indeed have received hint about jane fairfax did ever hear thing so strange ohyou need not be afraid of owning to for mr weston have told met just now told be to be great secret therefore must not think of mentioning to body said knew what did mr weston tell yousaid emma still perplexed oh told about that jane fairfax mr frank churchill be to be married that have be privately engaged to one long while how very odd be indeed so odd harriets behaviour be so extremely odd that emma did not know how to understand character appeared absolutely changed seemed to propose shewing agitation disappointment peculiar concern in discovery emma looked at quite unable to speak have idea cried harriet of being in love with heryou perhaps mightyou blushing a spoke who can see into body heart nobody else upon word said emma begin to doubt having such talent can seriously ask harriet whether imagined attached to woman at very time wastacitly if not openlyencouraging to give way to own feelingsi never have slightest suspicion till within last hour of mr frank churchill having least regard for jane fairfax may be very sure that if have must have cautioned accordingly cried harriet colouring astonished why must caution meyou think care about mr frank churchill be delighted to hear speak so stoutly on subject replied emma smiling mean to deny that there be timeand not very distant eitherwhen gave reason to understand that did care about himnever never dear miss woodhouse how must so mistake turning away distressed harriet cried emma after moment do meangood heaven what do meanmistake youam to suppose then must not speak wordher voice be lost sat down waiting in great terror till harriet must answer harriet who be standing at distance with face turned from did not immediately say thing when did speak be in voice nearly a agitated a emmas must not have thought possible began that must have misunderstood know agreed never to name himbut considering how infinitely superior be to body else must not have thought possible must be supposed to mean other person mr frank churchill indeed know who must ever look at in company of other hope have better taste than to think of mr frank churchill who be like nobody by side that must have be so mistaken be amazingi be sure for believing that entirely approved meant to encourage in attachment must have considered at first too great presumption almost to dare to think of at first if have not told that more wonderful thing have happened that there have be match of greater disparity be very wordsi must not have dared to give way toi must not have thought possiblebut if who have be always acquainted with harriet cried emma collecting resolutelylet understand other now without possibility of farther mistake be speaking ofmr knightley to be sure be never must have idea of body elseand so thought knew when talked about be a clear a possible not quite returned emma with forced calmness for that then said appeared to to relate to different person must almost assert that have named mr frank churchill be sure service mr frank churchill have rendered in protecting from gipsy be spoken of oh miss woodhouse how do forget dear harriet perfectly remember substance of what said on occasion told that did not wonder at attachment that considering service have rendered be extremely naturaland agreed to expressing very warmly a to sense of service mentioning even what sensation have be in seeing come forward to rescuethe impression of be strong on memory oh dear cried harriet now recollect what mean be thinking of something very different at time be not gipsiesit be not mr frank churchill meant with elevation be thinking of much more precious circumstanceof mr knightleys coming asking to dance when mr elton must not stand up with when there be other partner in room be kind action be noble benevolence generosity be service made begin to feel how superior be to other being upon earth good god cried emma have be most unfortunatemost deplorable mistakewhat be to be done must not have encouraged then if have understood at least however can not be worse off than must have be if other have be person nowit be possible paused few moment emma must not speak wonder miss woodhouse resumed that must feel great difference between two a to a to body must think one five hundred million time more above than other hope miss woodhouse that supposingthat ifstrange a may appear know be own word that more wonderful thing have happened match of greater disparity have taken place than between mr frank churchill therefore seems a if such thing even a may have occurred beforeand if must be so fortunate beyond expression a toif mr knightley must reallyif doe not mind disparity hope dear miss woodhouse will not set against try to put difficulty in way be too good for be sure harriet be standing at one of window emma turned round to look at in consternation hastily said have idea of mr knightleys returning affection yes replied harriet modestly not fearfullyi must say have emmas eye be instantly withdrawn sat silently meditating in fixed attitude for few minute few minute be sufficient for making acquainted with own heart mind like hers once opening to suspicion made rapid progress touchedshe admittedshe acknowledged whole truth why be so much worse that harriet must be in love with mr knightley than with frank churchill why be evil so dreadfully increased by harriets having hope of return darted through with speed of arrow mr knightley must marry one own conduct a well a own heart be before in same few minute saw with clearness have never blessed before how improperly have be acting by harriet how inconsiderate how indelicate how irrational how unfeeling have be conduct what blindness what madness have led on struck with dreadful force be ready to give bad name in world portion of respect for however in spite of demeritssome concern for own appearance strong sense of justice by harrietthere must be need of compassion to girl who believed loved by mr knightleybut justice required that must not be made unhappy by coldness now gave resolution to sit endure farther with calmness with even apparent kindnessfor own advantage indeed be fit that utmost extent of harriets hope must be enquired into harriet have done nothing to forfeit regard interest have be so voluntarily formed maintainedor to deserve to be slighted by person whose counsel have never led rightrousing from reflection therefore subduing emotion turned to harriet again in more inviting accent renewed conversation for a to subject have first introduced wonderful story of jane fairfax be quite sunk lostneither of thought of mr knightley harriet who have be standing in unhappy reverie be yet very glad to be called from by now encouraging manner of judge friend a miss woodhouse only wanted invitation to give history of hope with great though trembling delightemmas trembling a asked a listened be better concealed than harriets be not le voice be not unsteady mind be in perturbation that development of self such burst of threatening evil such confusion of sudden perplexing emotion must createshe listened with much inward suffering with great outward patience to harriets detailmethodical well arranged very well delivered must not be expected to be contained when separated from feebleness tautology of narration substance to sink spiritespecially with corroborating circumstance own memory brought in favour of mr knightleys most improved opinion of harriet harriet have be conscious of difference in behaviour ever since two decisive dancesemma knew that have on occasion found much superior to expectation from evening at least from time of miss woodhouses encouraging to think of harriet have begun to be sensible of talking to much more than have be used to do of having indeed quite different manner towards manner of kindness sweetnesslatterly have be more more aware of when have be all walking together have so often come walked by talked so very delightfullyhe seemed to want to be acquainted with emma knew to have be very much case have often observed change to almost same extentharriet repeated expression of approbation praise from himand emma felt to be in closest agreement with what have known of opinion of harriet praised for being without art affectation for having simple honest generous feelingsshe knew that saw such recommendation in harriet have dwelt on to more than oncemuch that lived in harriets memory many little particular of notice have received from look speech removal from one chair to compliment implied preference inferred have be unnoticed because unsuspected by emma circumstance might swell to hour relation contained multiplied proof to who have seen have passed undiscerned by who now heard two latest occurrence to be mentioned two of strongest promise to harriet be not without degree of witness from emma herselfthe first be walking with apart from others in lime walk at donwell where have be walking time before emma came have taken pain a be convinced to draw from rest to himselfand at first

seemed peculiarly cruel necessity be to be placing in such state of unmerited punishment in time of course mr knightley must be forgotten be supplanted must not be expected to happen very early mr knightley must be doing nothing to assist curenot like mr elton mr knightley always so kind so feeling so truly considerate for body must never deserve to be le worshipped than now really be too much

tender subjectshe must not enter on itharriet be very seldom mentioned between on side might merely proceed from not being thought of be rather inclined to attribute to delicacy suspicion from appearance that friendship be declining be aware that parting under other circumstance certainly must have corresponded more that intelligence must not have rested a now almost wholly did on isabella

must be expected on first arrival have thought out of spirit appeared perfectly natural a there be dentist to be consulted since business have be over did not appear to find harriet different from what have known beforeisabella to be sure be very quick observer yet if harriet have not be equal to playing with child must not have escaped emmas comfort hope be most agreeably carried on by
