gentleman elizabeth found much to divert in watching during dinner manoeuvre of miss steele who seated between two bachelor be fully occupied in effort to make equally incessantly agreeable to of dire failure of might have aroused compassion have not be so completely self satisfied confident captain tilney certainly kept up conversation in style be expected of a long a must then turned to miss de bourgh devoted to having be informed by father that be considerable heiress attention to must be regulated accordingly colonel fitzwilliam for part found three cornered discussion carried on with great animation between aunt general tilney who sat opposite on military genius of french general considerably more interesting than miss steele observation on bath assembly openly expressed predilection in favour of officer a partner elizabeth husband be better off in respective companion inanity of robert ferrars pretension of wife be calculated to put severe strain on good intention of lady catherine niece nephew towards guest how elegantly lady catherine dinner party be always carried out remarked lucy to mr darcy in kind of loud aside a unfolded napkin seems to be one of fortunate person who always manage to have everything about a recherche a be at home wherever may be staying think so mr darcy one else must have made apartment what be with lady catherine delightful appointment must daresay easily imagine to be in one of smaller dining parlour at rosings must not mr darcy be rather taken aback by speech hastily making mental review of aunt usual visitor failed

advantage of pause during companion helped to fish to consider what reply must truthfully make to sentiment before mr ferrars must insist upon agreeing with be called upon by aunt from end of table to support in flat contradiction of general tilney who be undoubtedly getting best of somewhat heated argument elizabeth be not more fortunate in companion wearisome description of that friend house habit achievement be that robert ferrars must contribute to conversation be almost more than must be endured with patience throughout long dinner even by one who must derive quiet amusement from almost kind of harmless absurdity be with sigh of relief that elizabeth heard aunt peremptory command that everyone must go put on coat cloak for must not have party arrive late for beginning of concert lady be distributed among various coach while gentleman walked on elizabeth found that companion be to be cousin miss anne steele during drive have leisure to remark with great astonishment

accompanying remark with many giggle mysterious whisper covert reference to favourite colour smart uniform made elizabeth wonder that cousin must tolerate such treatment for instant poor anne de bourgh nature only half developed by reason of ill health mother forcefulness of character have yielded entirely to dominating influence exercised over by person nearer own age one who made effort to understand play upon weakness elizabeth soon began to perceive secret of intimacy miss steele in anxiety to recommend to de bourgh family have discovered that by enlivening flattering daughter might best become person of value to mother anne steele last word before carriage stopped be intended to be inaudible to elizabeth put final touch to disgust dislike lucy will be so miserable if give up now

hesitated to attach importance to friendship thus inaugurated did not care to consider possibility arising out of for engagement between sister cousin have be scheme very near heart when failed be so much disappointed that must not give up idea of fitzwilliam being disappointed too be difficult for to imagine that man who have lost georgiana must console with woman however talented charming therefore followed that elizabeth be compelled to keep satisfaction to herself being very anxious that nothing must be said to dispel refrained from giving account of cousin when carriage assembled before aunt door at eleven o'clock with warning glance at husband replied to lady catherine peremptory inquiry that robert have engagement that morning must join at dinner coming over on horseback engagement repeated lady catherine haughtily be not aware that engagement must have prior claim when party have be made up for day be very annoying result be that have empty seat in carriage if have known captain tilney gig must not have be wanted perhaps captain tilney must not mind giving poor little seat in gig suggested miss steele who since saw that honour of sharing back seat with colonel fitzwilliam be denied have be revolving next most advantageous plan in mind captain tilney who be already in gig hoping that destined companion have not yet appeared looked round for way of escape

party however be not destined to be so successfully divided for whole day while be strolling about at clifton in hour preceding diner elizabeth be taken possession of by aunt to listen to severe stricture upon management of family affair blame exceedingly elizabeth for not using influence with fitzwilliam ought to go about with rest of in ordinary way not wander off by heaven know where be not way to teach to forget affair so unfortunately miscarried under guidance aunt can not control movement a if be child naturally go where like make own friend own friend yes indeed desirable friend

discussion please aunt catherine do assure that breaking of georgiana engagement be for best in way of course know feel bound to defend handiwork be only too glad to think that dear nephew have not suffered more than have from effect perhaps next time will agree that must be guided by advice of older wiser than certainly aunt catherine returned elizabeth who only endured remark by making allowance for aunt disappointment perhaps might be better to let choose wife if want one entirely by must prefer that must choose one of whom must approve must be sure next time engagement be made that be not likely to be broken returned lady catherine when be young girl betrothal be regarded a very serious thing one not lightly to be cast aside because of fancied change of feeling elizabeth have begun to wonder how much longer must bear conversation when opportune arrival of colonel fitzwilliam caused aunt attention to be concentrated upon to exclusion of everyone else elizabeth be pleased to observe contented air cheerful manner while laughingly parried aunt cross examination even submitted to advance of miss steele who delighted to find more approachable than usual continued to address remark to while visited pump room strolled down towards river elizabeth found obliged to pair off with mr ferrars lucy who possessed considerably larger share of adroitness than sister perceived at once different method be necessary to recommend to mr darcy than to lady catherine have for day be endeavouring to show equal to standard of elegance required by young lady on occasion began by expressing warm enjoyment of concert few night before yes said elizabeth be good concert very much above average of thing thought oh be charming know when have be more delighted that exquisite italian song air of run in memory still must have good memory for florid operatic song be most difficult thing to remember ah dear mr darcy fear undervalue power know what accomplished

crawford have great gift play with feeling charm one must expect of know well do not asked lucy not very well do hope to know better lucy meditated upon be not very agreeable news to if mr darcy saw much of miss crawford must mean that colonel fitzwilliam must see good deal of too lucy felt that after poor anne many failure success did not look more probable here result of reflection be question be miss crawford a rich a say know what miss crawford fortune be replied elizabeth in cold surprise sister appear comfortably off oh only meant began lucy confused be said to be such great heiress often wonder why have never married then a companion did not speak added say that perhaps will be next lady elliot must be most suitable must not title fortune must not think such match be very probable scarcely know sir walter elliot replied elizabeth lucy must not help pursuing subject do think miss crawford very pretty inquired be very graceful sweet looking face have great deal of animation be always so attractive answered elizabeth complexion have rather lost bloom though be so unbecomingly thin lucy ventured to say have not remarked returned elizabeth vexed with for having drifted into anything like intimate conversation with mr ferrars will join lady catherine be evidently wanting to collect party must be nearly time to start for home lucy saw that have made mistake covered a well a must by saying oh think miss crawford charming assure so talented wish must have heard harp when be calling on yesterday morning will have opportunity of doing so at aunt reception next week said companion mr darcy have be quite conscious of undercurrent in mr ferrars mind during conversation for have perceived aspiration of miss steele supported a be by sister towards colonel fitzwilliam elizabeth felt extreme importance of preventing hint from being dropped might open cousin eye to situation even to fact that anyone thought there be situation word of raillery from miss steele of archness from mr ferrars must be enough to drive from bath in disgust must resent nothing more deeply than imputation of paying court to heiress person of steele kind elizabeth knew must be able to make remark of character most difficult for to bear friendship between miss crawford be at time in stage when very small incident might affect one way other elizabeth felt miserably uncomfortable until found safely at home again little party of three collected round fireside in lodging mr morland having be dropped at room well robert did not have chance to ask began trying to speak unconcernedly did enjoy ride morning where did go enjoyed very much thank replied colonel though did not go far only about three mile on well road be pity said darcy ought to have have good gallop on down wished to do so said colonel fancied miss crawford be little disinclined for seemed so much afraid must be late in arriving at clifton always talking of turning back must go farther time said elizabeth yes hope so indeed responded cousin be perfect weather for riding miss crawford be horsewoman such a one seldom see talking of horse tilney be not much of driver else took pleasure in frightening that miss steele to day remarked darcy did not see did robert be on way up there let horse gallop down long hill thought gig must have be upset silly girl actually caught hold of one rein thought miss steele seemed very unwilling to drive back with said fitzwilliam with smile by way have noticed what wonderful girl be for asking question almost equal aunt elizabeth felt fear returning inquired did manage to find question to ask robert must think did be trying to extract from why have not arrived earlier have be doing have to admit have be riding in way of own dragged miss crawford name in too simply pretended not to hear began talking vigorously about something else how in world can matter to whether be riding with miss crawford miss anybody fail to understand be inquisitive little minx can not bear elizabeth exclaimed emphatically fitzwilliam do let go home like bath year people in can ask nice one like miss crawford mr morland to stay with at pemberley be quite willing to return dear replied darcy must not do to leave before aunt reception to admit driven away by miss steele of course will stay over sixteenth will go after only mean week two le than ordinary visit wentworths be leaving eleanor portinscale be too unwell for to see anything of aunt catherine have extraordinary friend to amuse there be really nothing to keep will come too will not robert to colonel made reply elizabeth interpreted silence a wish dictated next few day passed without special event to mark elizabeth wished more more to leave bath to be able to persuade colonel fitzwilliam to come too for felt uneasiness must not be stifled a to outcome of various friendship have be inaugurated that year in particular suspected steele ferrars faction of making mischief with aunt be incessantly with seemed to elizabeth lady catherine be becoming what with fault of overbearing pride haughtiness love of flattery have never be before namely suspicious of evil motif thought in around when nephew niece be with must question hardly accept explanation of occupation at other time blamed everybody for what be doing mr morland for accepting hospitality of portinscales lady portinscale for not entertaining captain tilney for not marrying anne steele for wishing to do so colonel fitzwilliam for coming to bath georgiana for staying away mr grant miss crawford be criticized for being in expensive place on whole lady catherine said little about in general way elizabeth regarded a bad sign for be sure that a friend of choice lady catherine must have great deal to say in private in disfavour a to james morland elizabeth felt there be everything to be said in defence of present situation be so anxious for to be known that be on way to obtaining work that wanted to be at home in order to set necessary arrangement in motion though husband laughed at idea of vicar resigning sooner because patron happened to be at pemberley instead of at bath be however in regard to progressing friendship between mary crawford colonel fitzwilliam elizabeth felt most troubled a long a remained in bath most helpless mary mr grant must not come see more often than visited although there be numberless opportunity of meeting at room garden theatre other public place on occasion there always seemed to be something to interfere with enjoyment of little party lady catherine be there with steele who must be depended on to break up rational conversation other amusement worse still sir walter miss elliot must appear on scene assuming privilege of older acquaintance must take possession of mary draw away from newer friend with many protest of having be quite deserted of having so much to say to dear miss crawford whom have missed so terribly lately have of course slight previous acquaintance with darcys whom have intended to become intimate with at one time a people of fashion to miss elliot intense chagrin mr darcy have be quite unresponsive to have instead formed friendship with younger sister mr wentworth although wentworths darcys be frequently together elizabeth must not well confide difficulty to anne when be so evident that sir walter elliot be admirer of miss crawford not at evident in direction lady choice must lie be hard to believe that must find true pleasure in company of sir walter with tedious inanity of miss elliot with artificiality pride yet at time seemed to greet almost with heartiness be glad to join even though might have be moment before in conversation with darcy party showing real self in charming spontaneous gaiety who watched closely might have noticed that time coincided with appearance of lady catherine who on seeing nephew colonel fitzwilliam usually endeavoured to detach from group be in to join to own on part be always most unwilling to relinquish society of miss crawford gave chance to do otherwise gliding away with pleasant word of farewell before lady catherine insistent want fitzwilliam if can spare few moment made heard have key to behaviour sometimes seemed to a if really liked a if might venture to hope must make like more then again sir walter elliot be so frequently at elbow with compliment gallantry seemed to be native language be so foreign colonel fitzwilliam thought to that naturally diffident distrusting power to charm attract often felt a if be hopeless even to think of becoming suitor while at same time deepening love for mary compelled to persevere elizabeth perceived part of longed to help there be something about mary reserve that made impossible to win confidence to do anything more for colonel fitzwilliam than own power be able to do for mary never gave what must be construed into smallest encouragement be only by observing that with seemed to be able to talk more naturally to express real opinion more frankly that elizabeth must surmise interest in to be in slightest degree reciprocated have not be for very strong liking elizabeth have formed for new friend must have be disposed to think that cousin happiness must best be furthered by separating from pleasure might become such great pain after conversation with in briefly admitted growing attachment existence of hope must not advise to give up quest must only assure of sympathy belief in mary being prize worth winning confessed that felt be doing wrong to georgiana to indulge in such thought so short time after leaving reproached with presumption in thinking that so brilliant admired creature a mary must have warmth of feeling for battered old soldier like a styled elizabeth tried to reason out of scruple to give good counsel that knowledge of character suggested found that did not believe have at present remotest chance of being accepted only hoped while remained in bath to win way in miss crawford esteem to be assured that have preference for other man chapter v elizabeth be anxious to see a much of miss crawford a possible before departure from bath be now fixed for th of april day after lady catherine reception accordingly made excuse to walk down to mr grant house on day before with piece of music have occurred to might be arranged with setting for harp found miss crawford in alone mary be wearing bonnet cloak be wrapping up parcel when mr darcy be announced latter exclaimed that must not stay a mary be just going out be not doe not matter be only going to take parcel to miss elliot pray sit down mr darcy can send by boy recalling servant miss crawford handed package with direction to take to camden place then returning threw off cloak said really doe not signify in least be only fan miss elliot lent few evening ago a excuse said for seeing again when brought back be spoken with slight blush on elizabeth repeating regret exclaimed oh must much rather stay talk to so seldom see alone one seldom doe see anyone alone in bath think what have brought music how delightful will play to now elizabeth explained scheme miss crawford examined piece with great interest presently declared thought must make admirable duet a walked across room to harp elizabeth remarked if like might play to morrow night at aunt reception miss crawford appeared to be busily tuning string of harp be after moment pause that replied think will be at lady catherine reception not be there repeated elizabeth concealing dismay a best must be very sorry for will be sorry not to see there thank returned miss crawford seemed unwilling to say more elizabeth however must not bear to leave subject at point after few moment suggested that if mr grant did not feel equal to going must be delighted to call for miss crawford take to pulteney street be very kind mr darcy be not said miss crawford at length turning round showing countenance expressive of embarrassment truth be continued know can speak to friend like that think lady catherine really want such very small rushlight a ourselves in firmament of glittering star can not be said to know have not called here since be introduced to at concert only sent note late one evening asking to come next day to clifton in least mind being invited only on account of music a france always agree since be not paid in money must be in manner oh beg pardon stopped short colouring biting lip must not have said that lady catherine have of course perfect right to do a like daresay have long forgotten having given invitation dear miss crawford exclaimed elizabeth whose colour have also risen say more quite put to shame be there ever such ill mannered family of course thought that aunt have sent sister invitation in due form must let take blame to myself for having omitted to remind have talked have assumed time that must be at reception must account for unpardonable forgetfulness of what must have be early most pleasurable duty miss crawford tried to laugh matter off by saying that be in respect mr darcy fault that whole thing be too trifling to deserve moment consideration besides added mr darcy have presented sister to lady catherine on one occasion must not have done more that be sure mr grant must not be missed at large party that hoped to have other opportunity of meeting mr mr darcy be because fear there will be so few more in bath owing to departure for home be so particularly sorry to lose one also for cause of returned elizabeth can quite enter into feeling miss crawford will do very kind generous thing show that have forgiven by availing yourself of aunt invitation if tender in manner can accept miss crawford must not be persuaded to give definite assent to proposal tried to treat matter of going to party staying away a consequence laughingly protested that must send harp alone must answer purpose a far a lady catherine be concerned utmost must be induced to say be must be very glad to give pleasure with elizabeth be obliged to be content nevertheless elizabeth be so extremely desirous of securing miss crawford presence partly in hope that lady catherine might be more kindly disposed to on closer acquaintance partly in order that colonel fitzwilliam might be enabled to enjoy company without fear of interruption from elliots on leaving mr grant house hastened at once to pulteney street trusting to find lady catherine alone disposed to listen to errand in object be successful for though inevitable miss steele be in house be upstairs with miss de bourgh lady catherine having just have disappointment in hearing that old friend found obliged to quit bath before reception be in mood to demand sympathy to discus matter connected with entertainment really be exceedingly trying said be not prepared for annoyance at age friend must take care to spare be convinced that lady alicia markham son be not so ill that must have done without mother for two day elizabeth condoled warmly listened to description of arrangement for evening in appeared mr ferrars help have be invaluable when lady catherine named musician expected elizabeth took advantage of opening thus afforded by suggesting that more formal invitation must be sent to miss crawford to ensure presence lady catherine stared in tone of offended surprise reminded her of first meeting with miss crawford be present recollect elizabeth when be introduced to gave opportunity of bringing instrument on occasion yes remember being mentioned said elizabeth hardly think took a invitation fancied meant to follow up by calling on sister may have have thought of doing so returned lady catherine haughtily in end decided that did not choose can not take up with new young lady who come to bath least of who be talked of a much a be be greatest flirt imaginable that foolish old beau sir walter elliot men of bath be running after indeed dear madam have be misinformed must defend said elizabeth with more earnestness be not in least flirt though men may run after receive encouragement to do so if like there be more to be said now whom must get in place know other lady there be man at theatre who be said to play harp tolerably well lady catherine be silent for moment with anger then broke out a elizabeth have expected there be one can get in place impudent girl must be glad to come to house like probably be intending to come time if truth be known how can tell be not only that when last saw distinctly said that sister have reason to think expected reason when with own mouth said must like to come play at house on sixteenth nothing must be clearer a to sister if be very ordinary looking person whom believe presented to one morning recollect saying anything to be not who play harp be very agreeable cultured woman widow of canon of westminster miss crawford go nowhere without well be extremely annoying know when have be so upset must have told elizabeth told plainly that be to come really air people give here be card will write name send round afternoon hope after that will have more nonsense by mean satisfied elizabeth next ten minute be spent by in using mean of persuasion must think of to induce aunt to repair previous omission by going to visit mr grant conveying invitation in person lady catherine at first resisted proposal indignantly must have continued to do so for knowledge that miss crawford music be to have be attractive part of evening entertainment uncomfortable recollection of having told many of friend that must hear person scarcely known in whom have discovered remarkable talent did not betray to niece when latter left house be without having secured definite promise elizabeth felt have said a much a safely must walked home pondering on what have passed wondering uneasily whether what have done have be real kindness to mary question be also raised by husband to whom have related affair on return shook head over gave a opinion that a aunt have be rude to miss crawford latter be fully conscious of must not meet in spirit conducive to future good feeling must have be worse said elizabeth if aunt catherine have counted on miss crawford coming have not appeared there must have be healing breach then must have greatly signified if there have be breach inquired darcy never mind dear have done best will be interesting to see result of aunt catherine effort at conciliation first time have ever appeared in such role must think strangely enough lady catherine effort be successful enough although one ever knew precisely how accomplished be partly accounted for by fact that saw mr grant alone miss crawford being out have taken only daughter with not choosing that miss steele must be witness of interview be undoubtedly galling to pride mr grant realizing small part of great lady insolence towards sister nature of mary resentment of only perceived that lady catherine be anxious to have at party be willing to acknowledge remissness in manner of issuing invitation lady catherine be so relieved at not having to apologize directly to object of dislike that became in course of interview more more condescendingly gracious to mr grant whom found a afterwards remarked to daughter amiable unpretentious person actually admitted that ought to have called sooner pressure of engagement in bath at period of season be so great call be strictly limited to quarter of hour mr grant described to mary when came in with much spirit humour mary on hearing that sister have actually accepted be inclined to be defiant to declare that must have headache not go of course be kind mr darcy doing did not care to accept favour thrown at at eleventh hour like by ill tempered old lady who only wanted to make use of mr grant whose pride in love of sister be unbounded who delighted in seeing shine by mean of beauty talent have great difficulty in persuading in fact when met darcy party at lower room following morning mary still declared that coming be so doubtful that be not worth while to give mr darcy trouble of learning duet elizabeth however felt fairly confident of seeing there colonel fitzwilliam confirmed by telling elizabeth with cheerful glance that have not actually said must not go hope be realized by arrival of two sister mary looking lovely sparkling in white with few fine jewel gift of devoted brother elizabeth who have arrived time earlier happened to be near aunt so be able to satisfy that reception by hostess be properly courteous if not cordial lady catherine even took trouble to mention name of daughter who stood close by miss de bourgh actually exerted so far a to make two separate curtsy though remark that be cold evening be taken out of mouth by anne steele who be standing next to evidently considered included in introduction elizabeth saw with delight colonel fitzwilliam be impatiently awaiting turn after formality must be over that immediately placed by miss crawford side seemed to have much to say to one elizabeth after greeting two lady giving mary expressive glance of gratitude conveyed much more than quiet remark be kind of to come began to converse with mr grant until music must be demanded of mary elizabeth be very well amused in watching arrival of guest in noticing of be under special patronage of robert ferrars who appeared to have brought into lady catherine circle number of individual of about same standing in world of fashion a robert ferrars be in element a though found entertaining in person house much more satisfactory matter than when trouble expense have to be incurred by besides having advantage of being able to introduce friend to earl daughter a hostess when who be expected have arrived in company with showy looking young man dressed in extreme of fashion began strolling about room in search of someone upon whom must make impression elizabeth thought that husband might at least have escaped mr ferrars civility great be surprise when young men paused before mr ferrars begged leave to introduce friend mr yates who have newly come from london mr mr darcy thought might be interested to meet mr yates in view of intended journey a mr yates must be able to give information a to state of road mr darcy have scarcely made curtsey be about to frame suitable reply when glance of newcomer happened to fall on mr grant who be seated on low chair close by immediately pronounced name in tone of questioning surprise when looked up exclaimed yes be sure be upon word madam take credit to myself considering length of time be since met hope be so fortunate a to recall to remembrance be very good sir replied mr grant with perceptible effort countenance expressed great pleasure at encounter of course recall perfectly mr yates trust be quite well very well thank madam hope same may be said of fair sister miss crawford perhaps be no longer miss crawford be under alarm yates struck in robert ferrars be still miss crawford can judge for how well be for will see hear to night speech be so offensive to mr grant that cut short mr yates compliment remarking yes be glad to say sister be still with rose prepared to move away elizabeth immediately suggested that must go in search of tea dismayed mr yates saw mr darcy departing before have uttered single word about london about distinguished people have dined with night before last well be very sorry ferrars replied to friend reproach be sure did want to talk to mr grant at seeing be greatest surprise never dreamt of meeting here of course have to speak civil word must have thought so strange dear fellow retorted ferrars what on earth did that matter must have thought must understand that mr darcy be person to make agreeable to here not mr grant who be only clergyman widow suppose a knew before lived down at precious dull place in country where took wife from yes did answered mr yates there be good deal more in than that not through do mean to say that sister of hers be really here going about in bath of course go about why must demanded ferrars be there anything against woman be down on know must hear wife sister only because be such devilish pretty girl proud wo have friend darcys do actually not know have never heard about brother between two of managed to lead wife family pretty dance neither of can ever show face in mansfield again so be lucky thing grant moved when did to think of meeting miss crawford again will tell edmund bertram be uncommonly well prosperous tom bertram be married yet see how look when do amiable intention be frustrated a elizabeth who must readily see that mr grant be disturbed by what have happened did not need even hint dropped by that hoped must not meet mr yates a be connected with bertrams part of life that be painful to to remember in order to make strive in way to protect mary from disagreeableness went to tea room whither colonel fitzwilliam mary have fortunately preceded time before mr yates appearance be there joined by darcy five formed happily conversing group mr grant whispered word to sister whose countenance changed for moment shook off cloud gave up to delight of present once elizabeth received message from aunt requesting to make miss crawford play now escorted friend back to music room did not leave after performance until saw colonel fitzwilliam safely stationed beside command to play second time followed rather to elizabeth surprise having number of friend to take leave of must not give much thought before own departure husband have insisted must be early one in view of journey on following day mr yates did not in fact come near of little party during rest of evening might have be observed conversing earnestly in quiet part of room with lucy ferrars sister who judging by rapt attention animated countenance found what mr yates have to say deeply interesting so much so in fact that when narration be finished two young woman having faithfully promised to repeat word of what have told took first opportunity of slipping away unostentatiously in direction of hostess having drawn aside with hint of having something very important to communicate poured into ear that whole story just heard story a may be imagined lost nothing in version of lady catherine be so exceedingly angry that instantly expressed desire be to have mr yates miss crawford latter being of course heroine of tale brought before with confused idea in mind of proving to world at large that dislike of mary crawford have time be well founded lucy extreme terror of consequence of act part in while mr mr darcy be there to protect friend caused to implore lady catherine to suspend pronouncing judgment till following day there must still be plenty of opportunity of meeting miss crawford lucy assured patroness lady catherine must make promise only necessity of attending to other guest replied delayed from informing miss crawford of strong disapproval must not appear to condone such conduct a miss crawford have be one moment longer than must help lucy sister thought safest to mingle inconspicuously with crowd until storm must break over other head meantime elizabeth husband have made farewell to most of friend be exchanging few last word with mr grant mary latter looked unusually lovely expression of quiet happiness illumined countenance colonel fitzwilliam did not allow yet to adopt easy manner of intimate friend earnestness of glance towards mary eagerness with obeyed slightest request betrayed state of feeling air manner be of man whose thought be wholly pleasant be so sorry that be really good bye elizabeth be saying be consoled by thinking be only for little while will keep promise come to summer will not mary crawford sister

fitzwilliam be sure coach will be there now if must kindly inquire colonel fitzwilliam be so kind a to wish to put into coach added to elizabeth must not be worth while just for to prevent from driving home with mr darcy will go see certainly said colonel moving off wait for elizabeth must just a soon walk back will see darcy at breakfast darcy drew wife arm within made way to lady catherine

peace with lady if have to make own a well a robert can do better by letter by way robert how do stand with aunt parted in anger fear replied fitzwilliam be inevitable after argument have have be immaterial to know now that be advocate for miss crawford will consequently not expect to see again in spite of what say darcy do think might do good elizabeth interrupted let countermand carriage can easily tell landlord wish to keep room till monday fitzwilliam begged cousin not to put to inconvenience on account darcy being also unwilling to change plan at moment when carriage be driving to door elizabeth be obliged to give up idea did with greater reluctance through feeling have not persuaded miss crawford to go to lady catherine reception disaster must not have occurred revolving in mind plan for future when party concerned must be removed from influence at work in bath continued preparation for departure when be ready luggage placed on vehicle walked downstairs with colonel fitzwilliam speaking word of consolation encouragement to promising to write to miss crawford from first stopping place urging to wait patiently not be deterred by mary being reluctant to see again for time after very painful experience promised not to give up hope feared that might cause to lose ground have gained be very good elizabeth said a shook hand happiness come out of will owe to be beyond what can expect there never be much reason why must look at now if connects with wretched affair there be le than ever elizabeth once more earnestly begged to take more cheerful view immediately afterwards darcy started long journey northward cousin having exchanged few word with james morland who have walked round to hotel few moment earlier to take leave of friend returned to own room to thought of mary crawford indeed be never absent from eagerness to be with once more be only exceeded by desire to protect fair name against danger threatened in spite of darcy advice came to conclusion after long thought that be justified in going first to ferrars then if necessary to mr yates to demand be responsible for calumny must retract did not wish to pose a mary champion until have given right to take warmer interest in than might yet assert a must not in case have failed to be aware of insult last night a be at same time miss crawford friend lady catherine nephew felt that must do le than endeavour to right wrong having be unsuccessful in appeal to aunt seemed most direct accordingly repaired at once to ferrars lodging address of have be given to by anne steele on one of many occasion on have begged to call there request hitherto ignored a soon a be shown into room perceived that two errand must be accomplished in one a mr yates be sitting with ferrars miss steele fitzwilliam must neither shake hand take offered seat addressing to ferrars mr yates requested in tone a calm deliberate a must make that must immediately unreservedly withdraw accusation have brought against miss crawford must furthermore go to lady catherine make to same complete denial of previous statement be careful to utter miss crawford name a seldom a possible refrained from demanding apology to be made to personally a felt greatest delicacy about appearing to act on behalf must judge also that be not unkind talk insult from hostess have given such deep offence found present task easier one than have expected have heart be lighter must have derived amusement from witnessing kind of turmoil word immediately created amongst hearer robert ferrars mr yates be of quarrelsome disposition be alike in living only for trifle in being of idle careless gossiping nature tolerably good humoured when did not interfere with pleasure comfort at moment matter of greatest importance to be to set right with extremely distinguished gentleman who came to with air of such authority hastened with utmost zeal to assure protest to deny regret explain away might have happened to annoy friend of robert ferrars who beyond listening eagerly to story have have nothing to do with affair be not long in discovering that wife sister be really responsible for mischief mr yates bitterly reproached lady for having broken promise carried mr yates information to lady catherine anne steele composure be not proof against attack especially in presence of admired colonel fitzwilliam found burst of tear most convenient resource lucy defended with spirit declared that have only told lady catherine what be right for to know a certainly ladyship must not wish to receive miss crawford if half of what mr yates have said be true produced renewed flood of eloquence from mr yates who denied in handsomest manner having said anything to miss crawford disadvantage wound up by boldly asserting that be lady for whom have greatest respect that must not help fault of brother that a for edmund bertram everyone considered that be who have treated badly hanging round always never making offer none of knew what must be at colonel fitzwilliam intimated that did not wish to know of particular that be come simply because have that lady catherine in consequence of what have heard have be led to treat guest with great injustice injustice be strongest word must allow to use that for everyone sake be highly necessary for mind to be disabused of false impression mr yates when be made clear to professed perfectly ready to go to lady catherine give what termed true fact heartily supported colonel fitzwilliam in latter request that mr ferrars must accompany mr ferrars looked from friend to wife extremely ruffled uncomfortable lucy be reduced to such state of anger that must scarcely speak mr yates speedily recovered usual state of easy insouciance volubility be only one of party able to walk with colonel fitzwilliam to door usher out with many bow smile promise to wait on in course of day two to tell result of forthcoming interview mr yates be not man who must long be disconcerted by anything probably looked forward to scene with lady catherine a one in must play leading part colonel fitzwilliam walked away smiling for moment at thought of storm of mutual recrimination be going on in room have just left feared that what have achieved must be of little use for aunt must be much more desirous of believing first version than second everything depended now upon effect of own influence upon mary sister upon whether must succeed in atoning to to extent for what have suffered greatly distrusted own power walked to house in deepest dejection of spirit servant said lady be at home waited for time in drawing room mr grant countenance when at last appeared be not such a to reassure did not ask to sit down remained standing at little distance while explained briefly formally that sister be not at well be unable to receive visitor colonel fitzwilliam heart sank at confirmation of worst fear hastened to reply that knew must not have expected to be willing to see member of family after what have happened night before that brought sincerest most heartfelt apology on own behalf that of cousin be only too sensible that nothing must say must obliterate memory of treatment to mr grant sister have be subjected have be endeavouring to right wrong hoped that when lady catherine must be brought to acknowledge mr grant here interrupted colonel fitzwilliam must tell plainly that be not of slightest use to mention lady name to sister know mean very kindly harm be done now nothing lady catherine can do say can repair wish to go into whole matter be too unspeakably painful if have be aware of language used towards must see that be not thing can ever be forgotten have almost said forgiven colonel fitzwilliam admitted fully told who be real author of calumny a far a regarded lady catherine must guess how have be incited to anger how must have spoken even though have not be present repeated that lady catherine must be enlightened must regret a much a anyone having spoken so hastily none of have effect on mr grant gradually realized colonel fitzwilliam anxiety to spare sister pain thanked for what have endeavoured to do concluded by saying that sympathized with sister in feeling that intercourse between two family have better cease colonel fitzwilliam dismay be extreme felt dismissed rallied energy enough to ask identify mr grant cousin with everything that aunt doe surely must know mr darcy at least better than to include in such condemnation mr grant appeared confused mr darcy have be very kind said hesitatingly have appreciated there seemed behind colonel fitzwilliam gently pressed for further reason when lady at last said truth be colonel fitzwilliam if will have sister feel though not going whole way with do understand point of view feel at present too bitterly about to be able to judge impartially think that must not have allowed mr darcy to over persuade that did wrongly to go to lady catherine on what be practically mr darcy invitation good god broke from fitzwilliam doe not consider cousin in way to blame for behaviour of aunt certainly not returned mr grant blame a have said regret also mr darcy took so many pain to induce lady catherine to show civility lady catherine disliked when opportunity of showing real feeling arrived be glad to take full advantage of mr grant believe be not a think said fitzwilliam earnestly aunt be just now entirely in hand of evil natured unscrupulous person who can make act in way choose may be so try to think so doe not excuse conduct returned mr grant fitzwilliam took two three turn about room wrapped in thought at length approached mr grant in tone scarcely concealed emotion said forgive can not take what say a final be of course for sister to decide can not think that mean to cast off cousin on account of thing have happened thing know deplore a much a condemn may not hope to be allowed to call upon sister if only for few minute not to day know to morrow next day mr grant have right to say anything think can guess what mean to mr grant countenance softened spoke more kindly than have done during interview will not pretend to misunderstand colonel fitzwilliam frankly sister must not see just now must do good to anyone if did see feeling have be deeply wounded more deeply probably than have idea of must be far better for not to think of more be shortly quitting bath too will be leaving for summer at future time may possibly meet again be able then to gather up thread of friendship fitzwilliam have turned very pale for though partly prepared for blow have hoped for mitigating circumstance mr grant word conveyed to at moment nothing counsel of despair must not immediately reply mastering with effort said steadily only care for sister happiness wish will be done then bowed quickly left room mr grant left alone reflected with aching heart upon scene have just closed resentful though felt on mary account own yet have be very unwilling bearer of message have delivered to visitor have liked liked still have observed with keen pleasure growing mutual attraction between mary for considered almost worthy of beloved sister event of night before have not shaken that belief whoever be to blame for knew be not lady catherine nephew when have partly recovered from agitation have tried to persuade mary to do equal justice knowing well that must not let matter rest that must hear from again mary have be unpersuadable shock have be very great not only from incredible insult from sight of buried past risen up again to be undying reproach to that most bitterly regretted of own act of other person that most wished to forget have be revived in mind exactly at time when have allowed to think that new prospect of happiness might be opening up before in midst of set of people circumstance with past must be wholly unconnected now painful memory have intruded into present thrust upon in peculiarly galling manner threatened to mar taint new life mary mind be in state of too great distress tumult for to see power of doing so lay in own hand that only must let fall back into wretched listless discontented condition from have so lately emerged only knew that old influence have returned be bitterly angry at knowledge in response to sister pleading replied that be determined not to see of again be alike proud hard hearted patronized made do thing did not want to do wished have never met one of mr grant ventured to speak word on colonel fitzwilliam behalf mary sore at heart suffering more for knowing be unjust replied that colonel fitzwilliam meant well really ought to keep most terrible old aunt in better order must not confess even to herself far le to sister how much have learned to care for man whom be now sending away through wounded pride perversity anger must hardly have told for what reason mr grant must only endeavour to soothe sympathize saw be better not to continue discussion of subject looked forward to lapse of time change of scene companionship to restore to mary measure of comfort serenity of blessing colonel fitzwilliam be in even greater need walked back to hotel in agony of mind such a have never before in life experienced to pain of disappointment be added hopelessness for felt that cause of repulse lay beyond power to remove be too deeply offended to see to hear what have to say a must not do thing thought must not possibly care for now completely cut off from have chance of ever winning way anger against aunt remained unabated even be persuaded to make reparation in power have be told that must be unavailing there be nothing more that anyone must do called servant gave direction for leaving bath early on following day then made pretence of dining threw into chair for evening of sad solitary reflection be nearly half past nine when card be brought up to be with start of surprise that recollected have be promised visit from mr yates that gentleman well bred easy talkative a usual be shown into room few moment later colonel fitzwilliam have never be more ill disposed to receive guest one must be listened to be relief when passed from compliment observation on weather to business at hand introduced with air of nonchalance a if have only just remembered what have come to say by way colonel began be calling on lady catherine afternoon took opportunity of mentioning to that subject be discussing morning did indeed returned colonel fitzwilliam hope be able to convince why a to proceeded mr yates settling more comfortably in chair hardly know have seldom found lady so hard to convince wishing to oblige dear sir did best in honesty did best explained a told must that have be quite misled miss crawford be not at sort of person assumed to be be very nearly end of conversation for give word colonel with respect to ladyship that became quite violent declared that did not want to hear young lady name word about that be tired to death of whole affair be probable must not like to find have made mistake said fitzwilliam a mr yates paused evidently expecting comment well suppose be what caused sting for seemed a though did not want to have to think well of miss crawford must not be so really know told what have said mean what have intended to convey to ferrars be surprised one knew story about brother added must not imagine how anyone must twist turn remark merely general one made in ill natured spirit to miss crawford disadvantage set off cross questioning a to what there be at back of till hardly knew where be finally have to point out to that owing to connection with family must not enter into detail of affair paused again fitzwilliam forced to say be obliged to for doing what must though feared might not be of much avail true enough thought be not going to be just at end ladyship said evidently with much resentment 'there must be something in though deny why must mr ferrars miss steele concoct story to tell why must be in interest to vilify miss crawford there be reason why must make worst of what have heard ' so of course in reply to simply told truth dear lady catherine ' said ask why reason be a everyone know that mr ferrars be anxious to secure colonel fitzwilliam for sister lady be very much disappointed when paid attention to miss crawford instead why colonel be looking quite annoyed trouble to protest dear sir between friend know be not necessary wish must confine to talking of thing know something about mr yates broke out colonel in extreme vexation be not one of nonsense good sir not know anything about must not fail to see what be before very eye before ever started for aunt reception last night mr ferrars sister be talking of in manner a to make expect that must be who must be in attendance on miss steele evening at event that be what hoped for of course said not word must see that thing turned out very differently if be not enough ferrars told about during evening of miss steele fancy what have planned so on really can hardly suppose being a be such friend of lady catherine must not have have idea of fitzwilliam have not thought that anything be needed to complete disgust annoyance where whole ferrars party be concerned tale of gossip vulgar intrigue have that effect be conscious of strong desire to get rid of visitor hear more of whole nauseous affair rose again thanked mr yates coldly for trouble have taken that gentleman too courteous not to take hint rose also though with evident unwillingness to end conversation drawing near fire stretched out foot towards blaze continued must not leave with impression that lady catherine be not convinced on contrary be inclined to think eventually be for manner quite changed after what have told seemed first astonished at showed considerable incredulity indignation asking how anyone dared to think say such thing though a explained to sorry though be to have given unpleasing intelligence idea did not emanate from upon became calmer seemed to be reflecting then thanked asked to be excused requesting if be going back to lodging to send mr ferrars miss steele to at once be not particularly anxious to be messenger fancy saw for called back said that did not signify must write to instead have gathered said fitzwilliam that mr ferrars did not accompany on occasion oh lord must have mentioned that at first escaped must not persuade to come fancy have private information that wife did not wish be pity a might have confirmed statement afforded further proof to lady catherine observed colonel fitzwilliam might have said something doubt hardly think must have succeeded if have failed be mr yates complacent reply dear sir think may sleep easily if lady catherine be not persuaded of error now never will be at moment be very probably explaining to ferrars how unfortunately have caused to be mistaken colonel fitzwilliam felt tolerably certain that aunt be doing nothing of kind that interview pictured by mr yates be turning upon different subject from miss crawford rehabilitation even if mr yates explanation have caused ferrars to fall into disfavour must not mean that harm have done day before must be wiped out lady catherine must not be more inclined to forgive miss crawford because own friend have made angry angry fitzwilliam guessed that must be at machination mr yates have casually disclosed be always particularly offensive to nephew must conjecture that even tact ready wit of mr ferrars must not be able to avert torrent of displeasure be poor comfort to to feel assured that must disapprove of miss steele a possible wife for quite a much a miss crawford very idea that alternative must have be thought of be so repugnant to that be glad to dismiss from mind people have done worst happened now must not injure miss crawford more blight own prospect more completely mr yates having a considered disposed of subject in hand proceeded to others colonel fitzwilliam contrived to cut short to hasten guest departure by indicating wish to make preparation for early start following morning mr yates be desolated to hear that colonel must actually have left bath by eight o'clock proposed leaving on morrow have come intending to stay with ferrars for week really everything be so infernally upset owning to tiresome affair declared mr ferrars have a good a called liar that be inclined to shorten visit go straight to sister place in berkshire feared must not be ready before twelve noon must not colonel fitzwilliam delay in starting accept of seat in curricle colonel regretted be not in power thought mr yates be doing wisely in going away in own mind added heartily expressed wish that well meaning gentleman have never come chapter vii darcys travelled slowly have not be at home for long before letter from cousin who have gone direct to london from bath be received by darcy colonel fitzwilliam briefly related what have occurred after departure application to ferrars yates with more le successful result totally unsuccessful visit to mr grant omitted of course reference to second part of yates conversation with lady catherine stated few fact with smallest amount of comment adding that be grateful to cousin for kindness in affair in circumstance thought must be better not to return to pemberley for present to try to occupy mind with work have therefore accepted offer made to by one of brother officer to collaborate in writing history of regiment proposed to remain in london where must have access to manuscript authority darcy need have fear that must not correspond a regularly a usual must call in at hursts while remained in town so that must be in continual touch with a said in conclusion best friend man ever have elizabeth sighed over letter consoled presently with thought mr grant miss crawford might possibly be in town during summer darcy on other hand be well satisfied with deeming that cousin have acted with perfect uprightness begged elizabeth to give up idea of trying to bring together at future time fitzwilliam dear be of age when can be trusted to manage own affair a prof to said to think prof much except aunt catherine be cruel domineering old woman always knew to be replied elizabeth poor robert to think of being so abominably treated of course true honest man a be be powerless among insufferable people who have not word of truth amongst elizabeth indeed felt acutely disappointed at disastrous unforeseen ending to hope blamed bitterly for share in disaster again regretted having persuaded miss crawford to come to reception have written to mary according to promise at first opportunity not for more than week after return home be answer received then be disappointment like rest merely note brief tremulous acknowledging mr darcy kindness apology begging that more might be said a to offence breaking off with assurance of writer good will of inability to express at greater length only sign of real mary appeared in postscript will write again by by dear mr darcy if will not mind very stupid letter line of note clearly showed writer shaken health although pride forbade to make excuse elizabeth be grieved felt for time being repulsed resolved to send after time cheerful letter on different subject might re establish friendship on new ground so that painful memory miss crawford at present associated with darcy family might by degree be eradicated anxiety occupying thought time being taken up with child with georgiana who have returned to pemberley in greatly improved health spirit still did not fail to remark absence of news of lady catherine for have fully expected speedy communication announcing lady triumph over miss crawford ignoring have followed when husband therefore in opening letter one morning observed that be from aunt be prepared for something considerably more disagreeable than content proved to be letter began by announcing lady catherine recent return home with daughter extreme pleasure of mr mr collins of neighbour in seeing again worthy rector wife have come up to rosings to pay respect on very first evening mr jenkinson have not yet come back from vacation have in fact written to ask leave to stay for week be excessively inconvenient a dear anne depended upon so much anne sensibility be indeed very great might not have inherited mother strength of character have such warm affection sometimes led to form attachment to people who proved unworthy of such devotion there have just be unfortunate instance of during stay at bath darcy who have be reading letter out loud to wife sister hesitated at point elizabeth urged to go on saying that georgiana knew about ferrars be a anxious a herself to learn whether reign be over elizabeth have probably heard something of regrettable termination to reception on last evening in bath young lady whom elizabeth be so obstinately anxious for to patronize must have acted at former time with extreme imprudence to say least of though really feel to be duty to investigate right wrong of matter still information received be so positive that be bound to act upon to point out to regretted having brought into immediate circle of friend think may say that at rate sister admitted justice of remark there hoped matter must have ended immediately afterwards learned that very person from whom have received friendly warning about miss crawford have be acting towards in scandalously hypocritical underhand manner will guess refer to robert ferrars miss steele can not enter into particular of conduct suffice to say that for latter part of stay in bath have be continual course of deception of nefarious vulgar scheme for own aggrandizement have traded upon kindness upon warm regard poor innocent hearted anne displayed towards miss steele to foster most impudent design never have be so mistaken in people whom regarded a deserving of interest never have met with such vile ingratitude may imagine that lost time in sending for whole family informing that acquaintance be at end for reason have given naturally declined to listen to defence miss steele be utterly confounded mr ferrars seeing that whole plot be exposed showed in true colour lost control of herself used expression more insolent than anyone have ever dared to do in presence indeed be so determined to be heard that be only by leaving room sending footman to show out be able to rid of presence man be mere weak fool must see that by way ineffectually tried to control wife even seemed to have sense of impropriety of conduct sister be easily conjectured that after shock a enjoyment in bath for be entirely at end must have left immediately that anne be too unwell on hearing what have happened to travel for week indignation at whole affair be still beyond word darcy paused elizabeth asked be that letter fitzwilliam yes replied that be sign name there there be postscript be evidently intended for perusal elizabeth took letter handed to read be not that out of pure perversity elizabeth always chooses to act exactly opposite to advice must suggest that proceed very cautiously in further dealing may have with young lady mentioned above elizabeth flushed deeply laid down letter immediately took up again re read lady catherine version of ferrars defeat meanwhile georgiana be eagerly asking what doe aunt catherine mean darcy writes strangely doe not how can people have nefarious scheme design against doe not say how knew have hardly understand said darcy know aunt have often be disappointed in people before when have desired more of favour than be prepared to give yes take great fancy then forgets about people returned georgiana really seems to be dreadfully angry time elizabeth say that did not like people ferrars did not for considered undesirable replied darcy reason aunt have for quarreling with undoubtedly be well must have done so georgiana perceived that be not to hear more about ferrars dropped subject in fact be what darcy wished for be distasteful one to for have aroused dislike more than most of aunt protege be glad to hear have fallen from favour without being interested in reason for elizabeth be quite aware of accordingly refrained from further discussion of aunt letter with husband must not forbear little private smile over exposure of impudent design nature of have quickly surmised in circumstance thought have hardly merited such severe stricture a passed on by lady catherine for mr ferrars unpardonable conduct towards miss crawford elizabeth might have spared pity for manner of dismissal from pulteney street georgiana took early opportunity of asking elizabeth about reference to miss crawford be friend of whom told be not elizabeth wonder what really happened why aunt catherine speaks of so harshly seems very unkind be very unkind georgiana of course aunt catherine be entirely misinformed listened to malicious gossip be terribly rude to miss crawford at end of evening after left about from robert who stayed later than did worst of be that in consequence miss crawford feel deeply wounded fear a regard whole family oh be so sorry what pity be can not anything be done surely will be able to put all right again time will not hope so yes of course will do be possible must be so extremely sorry to lose sight of now must be charming from say commented georgiana then asked rather shyly with deep blush did cousin robert like too yes liked very much think know played harp be so fond of anything to do with music yes know said georgiana added in low voice remember must always much rather have listened to playing than have talked to let grieve georgiana said elizabeth kissing young girl fair brow know that robert have greatest possible regard for will find next time meet that be best of friend georgiana smiled rather sadly often felt that must have not only fallen in estimation of cousin revered that must also be possessed of quality capable of inspiring affection what be even worse of heart of own to give elizabeth understood well tried often to give more self confidence to raise lowly opinion of herself though be growing le reserved more disposed little by little to trust own judgment old habit of timidity of reliance on guidance of whom loved be still strong in elizabeth must often refuse to decide thing for when be helped to weigh in balance to judge by standard available choice must always be recommended for discretion clear sightedness month of may be now nearly half way through time be approaching when james morland be expected to pay visit to friend at pemberley so much of stay at bath have be productive of disappointment that looked back upon acquaintance with young man a one circumstance of unalloyed pleasure darcy whose regard for have grown very warm have received letter from home enabled prior to leaving bath to inform morland that living in gift must shortly be vacant that must have pleasure in offering to morland when time came important communication have be received by young clergyman with depth of joy gratitude have increased darcys satisfaction in being able to assist living though not rich one must suffice for need a possessed capital advanced by father situation in hilly bracing country district made most desirable for person whose health like own have to be considered conversation between darcy have be very short have taken place only day before latter departure morland still scarcely realizing good fortune have hurried round to hotel following morning to repeat acknowledgment to friend to make adieu there be time only for very few word to be exchanged at house door morland found difficult to

climate be exceedingly cold distant cottage be almost inaccessible in stormy weather that of farmer be people of very independent way of thinking difficult to get on with must discover drawback only

to reception stayed only to assure of number of mr annesley house then bowed walked rapidly away a miss bingley approached with evident intention of breaking up conclave georgiana have to submit to certain amount of comment from sister who while condoling with for having have to pas through uncomfortable few minute appeared surprised that must have be able to talk to colonel fitzwilliam felt nothing happiness in having met cousin again found possible to think of being on term with that elizabeth have predicted spent part of afternoon in writing long letter to sister telling what have happened did not like to send account of cousin might alarm at home so contented with saying that be not looking at well that wished elizabeth must persuade to go down to pemberley a must be working too hard in london concluded writing with word will leave open till to morrow dear elizabeth may tell about ball how kitty looked kitty indeed be chief subject of thought when dwelt upon prospect of

thought hope when few day later directed step towards mr annesley residence in han place must scarcely believe be three month since severance of engagement with georgiana seemed to have retreated so

establish old cousinly relation result friend must rejoice in be therefore with tolerably easy mind be ushered into presence of two lady found georgiana in great good look far le shy confused than on previous occasion indeed in few moment awkwardness between seemed to have quite melted away be readily answering question about mr knightley ball certainly seems to have be great success for never

morning mr annesley willingly acceded two lady having attired hackney coach be called conveyed mile on way towards kensington place georgiana be somewhat silent during drive did not wish to speculate on cousin private affair having be innocent cause of recalling painful thought to inevitably produced wish to atone to help found wondering while trying not to wonder what must possibly be connection between mr yates cousin robert lady in bath now said to be in london to be sure be none of business have right to wish to know yet did wish knew whether have anything to do with cousin robert looking so sad worn stay that letter of lady catherine brother have read aloud lady in bath friend of elizabeth misunderstanding georgiana felt for one instant with thrill of fear excitement a though have laid hold of thread be almost glad when stopping of carriage obliged to let go by scattering thought bringing back to present moment reproached for prying into others secret pressing close to mr annesley side eagerly responded to lady eulogy of beautiful scene around garden be indeed looking best in glory of june array crowd of well dressed person strolling gaily about added to general sense of brilliancy festivity have taken few turn fitzwilliam have greeted several of acquaintance while georgiana be beginning to think that too might see someone knew when attention be arrested by comment of mr annesley made in low voice on singular beauty of young lady who be approaching escorted by two gentleman lady be dark extremely animated fine eye seemed to be glancing in direction of party a two group slowly passed other colonel fitzwilliam bow be acknowledged by lady friend half paused a if about to speak passed on without doing so mr annesley seeing recognition made laughing apology to companion beg pardon colonel fitzwilliam did not know knew that lady really be such lovely creature that one can not help remarking on be quite of opinion mr annesley returned colonel georgiana saw that though endeavoured to speak lightly something have happened necessitated exercise of degree of self command be very obliging of to voice sentiment be always wanting to put into word when meet miss crawford although word can exactly describe special charm be expression be not said mr annesley so full of changing life brightness that vivid complexion graceful carriage of head that one can see at glance imagine be not in minority in admiring indeed said fitzwilliam hold quite little court be interrupted by gentleman who detained for moment lady walked on georgiana mind full of tumultuous thought have recollected name crawford in moment a being that of elizabeth friend to whom lady catherine have behaved so unkindly did not like to admit knowledge for fear might be painful to cousin to have whole chain of circumstance discussed what be georgiana must not help longing to know only one be quite clear to be cousin deep admiration for lady heart went out in sympathy to for attachment for difficulty in way if difficulty there be did miss crawford perhaps not care for yet have looked a if wanted to speak be there friend relation influencing have alluded to little court how must anyone separate miss crawford from colonel fitzwilliam if really loved so noble so kind so true georgiana blushed deeply at thought perceiving rapid pace at have led on somewhat inconsistent conclusion that have reached very sincerity reassured in knowledge that own love for colonel fitzwilliam be sisterly love longed to see happily suitably united idea crossed mind of helping towards end have too lowly opinion of own power a force in other person life only wish be for opportunity of showing sympathy towards cousin in practical form in vain tried to plan how might be done for must not speak of until have opened heart to most unlikely thing to happen not at must be mentioned before mr annesley fortune seemed to favour for when colonel fitzwilliam rejoined mr annesley confessed that felt little tired heat be so great must like to rest while come with added a fitzwilliam instantly proposed moving towards chair if be not tired yet be much more amusing for georgiana to walk about probably must like to go nearer to music will go sit by friend mr sackville whom see over there until be ready cousin accordingly found together georgiana hardly knowing how to begin feeling time be to be lost broke silence again after few minute after few minute by saying timidly think have heard elizabeth speak of miss crawford knew in bath did not have indeed be good exclaimed colonel fitzwilliam have forgotten that must know name yes met in bath seemed about to say more after pause concluded with ask elizabeth to tell about georgiana be disappointed told that must not have expected anything else how must make confidant of who have shown unworthy of trust walked on for little distance until fitzwilliam observing two vacant seat in group of chair placed close to edge of grass asked georgiana if must like to sit down for little before turning back be charming spot in shade of tree immediately facing large sheet of artificial water georgiana willingly assented remarking how fortunate that must be able to get two chair seem to be nearly occupied be generally so people come sit here whole morning when be so fine warm returned fitzwilliam placing at side not resuming conversation of few moment before georgiana be not content to be silent cousin be wrapped in thought of miss crawford did not dream of anxious solicitude for in georgiana heart other man in mary party reflected must be brother henry crawford there be slight resemblance besides answered to description mary have given of how well remembered laughing look tone a uttered henry be not tall colonel fitzwilliam allow other imaginable beauty be not tall thin dark rather plain of course to singularly handsome did not say so do think must recognize if saw colonel did see now for second time few step away approaching with sister who walked between sir walter elliot a before mary glanced towards miss darcy in instant colonel be at side how do do miss crawford be sorry to miss other morning when called must allow to present to cousin miss darcy have heard of from brother sister mary coloured deeply a returned salutation immediately complied with request pausing only to say to brother in low voice henry please walk on wait for to georgiana be such surprise delight to see miss crawford being brought towards to find wish granted have scarcely dared to formulate instead of being exceedingly shy a must ordinarily have be forgot to think of herself rising looking into miss crawford lovely expressive face entered fully into what believed cousin to be feeling towards owner in reality shyness be on mary side for must not help in seeing in colonel fitzwilliam action proof of generosity devotion of friend whom have exiled from few word passed between three about beauty of day surroundings then miss crawford turning to georgiana inquired after mr mr darcy be subject to unloose georgiana tongue drew forth animated reply mary still addressing made few civil inquiry about journey to town probable duration of visit be colonel fitzwilliam who presently begged miss crawford to take seat after slight demur other chair being within sight consented to do remained standing near for few moment then moved little distance thinking might be able to talk more comfortably if left to be staying with aunt lady catherine de bourgh asked miss crawford when be out of earshot

like one family georgiana assented to be indeed like one of brother sister be devoted to be oldest friend have replied after own brother be kindest best person have ever met people know for long time how good be because be so modest retiring georgiana be conscious that be perhaps transgressing bound of good taste in vehement praise did not care what miss crawford thought of so long a must think well of cousin at event appeared that miss crawford be not offended for smiled faintly said be fortunate in having mr darcy for advocate be just same said georgiana eagerly with whoever speaks of friend be devoted to be so staunch to do never change fails when want think know one who must not fail miss darcy said miss crawford still smiling indeed added a georgiana turned away head be sure be quite right in say who must know colonel fitzwilliam well if not old friend know that be even loyal to when be angry with be great test georgiana must heartily agree though without understanding mary allusion talk drifted to other subject in midst of colonel returned tried to interest miss crawford in such plan a have suggested to sister mary said be kind of must be pleasant without pledging to anything replied pray do when asked if might call to talk over appeared that sister be so full of engagement that be doubtful if must be at home morning before end of week by time have risen appeared anxious to return to friend mr crawford indeed be seen approaching so colonel fitzwilliam must only bow adieu while promising pleasure of calling early in following week for though must have liked to make henry crawford acquaintance for did not wish to be responsible for introducing to georgiana on part only perceived that miss crawford be taking leave pressed hand that new friend extended to saying in low voice have be pleasure hope will see again indeed hope may meet must like responded mary cordially go about so much have doubt will pray remember to sister mr darcy georgiana promised

driving home than have yet seen look in london discussed detail of plan to go to hampton court dine there seemed to contain element of perfect bliss fitzwilliam be indeed experiencing greater peace of mind than have done since parted from mary in bath though for what reason must scarcely explain to manner have be merely that of courtesy have not contained hint of old friendliness sir walter elliot have be a ever at elbow yet fitzwilliam felt that interview must obtain opened way towards little more have resolved to press straight onward letting such obstacle arise a have formed effectual barrier between in bath rather making use of incident occurred such a georgiana accidental presence ensuing introduction to bring nearer to be keeping object ever in view when joined friend at theatre few evening later in glancing round house after first act observed miss crawford with several other person in box at distance from immediately began to consider possibility of going up to speak to although unacquainted with hostess for mr grant be not there conjectured that party be in charge of sir walter miss elliot by manner in lady gentleman rose to welcome visitor who have just entered box fitzwilliam determined to obtain introduction through friend for purpose to go up to box during third interval be longest of evening second interval however be destined to produce something of disconcerting nature fitzwilliam be conversing with wife of friend general stuart whose guest be learning from name other particular of many of person present for have long lived in london have wide acquaintance be reckoned to be lively companion though information gave manner of imparting be one so positive other so vigorous that hearer be tempted frequently to forget until after have assimilated that might have spoken without best authority have chanced to notice people in elliots box drew colonel fitzwilliam rather unwilling attention to did not wish to discus hear discussed crawford friend implied at once that several of be known to mr stuart be interest inquired if be that charming miss crawford that knew if so whether must explain why be that be going to marry insufferable old coxcomb sir walter elliot colonel fitzwilliam replied concealing apprehension a best must that did not know that be have never heard then be only one in population of london who have not heard dear colonel why where have be to be out of way of such piece of news at least fifty people have told of course of have straight from most reliable source be hard to believe that beautiful creature must throw away like on foolish impecunious old fellow who be old enough to be father have nothing in world title tailor to recommend can not comprehend why girl do thing one can only suppose that be tired of single life want suitable settlement be almost sure there must be mistake mr stuart interposed colonel fitzwilliam saw miss crawford only lately there be nothing said about engagement stopped feeling how very lame such refutation be unsupported by testimony nonsense dear sir have be living in book must have heard of do see that short stout young man over there be mr john thorpe be speaking of at house other evening asserted positively that have heard mentioned in bath month ago be quite certain that miss crawford be not engaged when be in bath be colonel fitzwilliam must permit to say well be very uncivil must say have better obtain someone else assurance if will not accept mine though anyone can see how have come about naturally elliots have pushed forward to utmost of power sir walter want pretty wife a can not support one out of vanished fortune of must choose one who have enough for miss elliot must like to establish connection between family for sake of certain mr henry crawford who be still unmarried be rake of course doe not mind that know be dark young man standing up at back of box colonel fitzwilliam be so excessively disturbed irritated by conversation have endeavoured to check by saying must be quite satisfied now mr stuart with answer have provided to own question that rising of curtain be great relief must sit silent inattentive to play wrapped in own anxious thought mr stuart be certainly not last word on terribly important matter for felt must hear fact from other quarter before must credit fine scene of banquo murder be played a far a be concerned to deaf ear eye continually sought box above where must just see mary white cloak sir walter fashionable attire always seemed in proximity to instant curtain fell again rose from seat made best of way towards exit so many gentleman be leaving seat at same time that found in crowd where be impossible to progress at great rate of speed at moment heard name pronounced behind looking round recognized two friend former brother officer of own who have remained seated near end of one of row impatient of delay nevertheless went to remained few minute in talk finding that one of friend captain ross be lame have difficulty moving along narrow gangway be presently joined by mr palmer whom fitzwilliam knew a man of few word reserved of almost unamiable temper thoroughly trustworthy too little interested in neighbour affair to be possessed of superfluous knowledge concerning fitzwilliam have slight acquaintance with after little consideration asked a if casually do know anything of sir walter elliot palmer a much a want to be reply stupid fellow if be framed glazed must be good deal more useful than now be consider captain ross laughingly agreed with claiming knowledge of sir walter elliot calling on hearer to witness inequality of human justice when man a must find young charming wife be true then asked fitzwilliam summoning fortitude that sir walter elliot be going to be married perfectly true rejoined captain ross companion know to whom lady in box with now colonel fitzwilliam have need to look be enough to know that worst dreaded be about to befall friend seemed to notice nothing in agitated manner of asking be sure in such haste be to pour out information yes have be talked of for long time be quite settled now be in club last night when elliot be having supper there told to drink to health to day for must be happiest man in world so party up there be doubtless celebrating betrothal besides do not recollect added captain ross that when met miss elliot other night told father must probably have legal business to arrange when mr crawford returned from paris then hoped must come announcement of happy event crawford be there now see legal business in case may include settlement to be made on elliot laughed other officer can understand people advertising affair so freely beforehand must have have reason to feel pretty confident well will always think great shame miss crawford be much too good for be not first time have played with man in way now suppose find too much involved to draw back elliot have be sharp enough to make sure of unlike dilatory young bertram why yes besides being presumably better bargain than mere country parson added captain ross imagine will live at kellynch when last saw wentworth told sister tenant be just leaving fitzwilliam felt a if must not bear more of making great effort turned once more to mr palmer asked if thought rumour to be true mr palmer looked at in surprise yes certainly why not there be not slightest reason to doubt have evidence of eye word of one of principal party wife mother be going to call to morrow offer congratulation colonel fitzwilliam hardly knew how got away what three friend thought of what general stuart whom have met outside lobby must comprehend of excuse for abrupt departure only knew that must not return to place watching woman who possessed whole heart in company of lover to whom have promised must be alone in darkness silence to brace to endure shock of what have heard realize must follow from hastened through street shut up in room conscious only that be defeat not mere repulse such a have received at bath defeat completeness finality of admitted rally on losing side long paced room struggling to fight down anguish of mind to see clearly through utter wretchedness what have happened how even in midst of suffering be not difficult for to piece together item of knowledge into connected whole have wearied of at bath must have be beginning of have not be able to gain affection in sufficient degree for to be proof against lady catherine attack that catastrophe have swept equally with cousin away from place have held in mary crawford esteem when met again in london must resume effort to recover place be already occupied be that then why have seemed not to wish to be too friendly because be too late be forced to believe must indeed easily believe anything be proof against consideration goodness of heart have endeavoured to save pain must did believe that have failed to win that must have accepted sir walter elliot left for many hour stunned incredulous that with many gift of mind body true elegance sensibility refinement of breeding placing in almost different world from vulgar pretentiousness of sir walter daughter in bath have so often seemed uncongenial to must now actually find such man sufficient must consent to join life with be outrage madness more so if have drifted into in way onlooker imagined must not know what be doing friend what be about must be warned fitzwilliam impulsively strode to door then stopped flung down with bitter laugh at own folly to be raging through commonplace jealousy of rejected lover like boy of nineteen what must anyone else do miss crawford be perfectly free to choose have brother with whose knowledge be probably acting there be nothing to be alleged against sir walter elliot character recollecting comment have heard that evening fitzwilliam be forced to same conclusion to acknowledging miss elliot mary own friend have in probability promoted match henry crawford weak unstable where woman persuasion be concerned have allowed to be drawn into elliot net that sister though must have little real regard for sir walter wished to settle down fortune making independent of mean in future husband have chosen where fancy title attracted how mean how sordid be whole story not least heartrending of colonel fitzwilliam reflection that night be that must not be mary true mary who have shown to for short time who be now taking step so unworthy of best self for woman knew to be what happiness must be in store chapter xi georgiana be alone in drawing room of mr annesley house on following morning practising pianoforte when expected rap at front door be heard colonel fitzwilliam be presently ushered into room sprang up to welcome prepared for cheerful greeting be unspeakably concerned at sight of haggard face worn exhausted look more so because made attempt to account for forced smile accepted chair offered endeavoured to speak a usual georgiana begged to partake of refreshment expressed fear that be ill not daring to give utterance to real conjecture georgiana thank will not have anything assure be not ill have only come to wish good bye a have changed plan be thinking of going to ireland to ireland repeated georgiana in consternation yes have friend who owns estate there have often invited to come over fish shoot with so will start to night take by surprise arriving early next week to ireland georgiana must only repeat so utterly bewildered be dear cousin robert be so sorry wish need not must not go to pemberley elizabeth darcy must so gladly receive do anything know must there be nothing that goodness kindness suggest must not occur to think must go there just at present will give love georgiana when be next writing tell of movement will write to from ireland give direction indeed indeed will may not tell anything more oh how wish must help in way exclaimed georgiana anxiety showing so acutely in syllable that fitzwilliam be forced to get up to avert face from hers lest self command must be too sorely tried dear kind little cousin will always be grateful to even though fear be not in power to help just now day perhaps may speak of in meantime have have great disappointment think have better go away for awhile so a to be more fit to meet friend when return came back to raised up spoke with resolution cheerfulness come georgiana be sad be not worth while will probably be at pemberley in autumn must do something then to make up for loss of exploration party now think of at least only think of a catching eating great many salmon hope will have great deal of pleasure still in london return to hursts to day do not will make excuse to mr annesley during speech georgiana have striven to recover composure managed at conclusion of to look up at with tolerably calm face to promise to deliver message felt convinced that have be refused by miss crawford situation be to so dreadful so far beyond repair that be relief to see cousin courage to know that did not wish to hear vain spiritless word of consolation word hardly must have be able to utter even have be able to listen from very surcharge of tender feeling burdened heart nevertheless sympathy be reflected in eye in gentle voice with bid adieu wished well fitzwilliam be not insensible to gave only comfort must have received at time pressing hand warmly with very earnest god bless quitted room a footstep died away georgiana sank into chair wept bitterly so brief have be visit few tick of clock have seen arrival departure in few moment aspect of everything have changed since last meeting georgiana have dwelt incessantly upon prospect of happiness allowed to think of a being in fair way to become realized difficulty elizabeth must have referred to mr yates have actually hinted at must surely be cleared away now that miss crawford have met again georgiana have not be able to read cruelty harshness in fair face time only very short time must be necessary once miss crawford knew fitzwilliam a be rest must follow a matter of course for how must woman whom really loved be able to resist so reasoned georgiana collapse of kindly hope brought back old sense of personal guilt too be partly responsible for cousin dire fate for be not one of two woman who have failed to make happy who have not be able to inspire with real love miss crawford who must not respond to now be fully awakened luxury of grief must not be long indulged in for tear stained feature must not be shown to friend be there leisure day to pour out heart in letter to elizabeth georgiana have to keep sorrowful thought to herself fortunately be not necessary to give explanation of colonel fitzwilliam abrupt departure from town to mr simple statement that have gone leaving apology suitable compliment be sufficient with hostess in grosvenor street however be different matter georgiana lacked courage to introduce subject until morning two later at breakfast choosing moment when letter have just be brought in everyone have only that remnant of attention to spare meal correspondence have not absorbed mr hurst asked question two a wife sister be speaking at same time went so long unanswered that quite forgot louisa showed surprise offended dignity that colonel have not paid farewell call on before leaving while caroline with le pride great deal of curiosity attempted at first to draw georgiana into admission beyond mere mention of fact remembering by happy chance to have heard name of friend in ireland even that of estate be able to own satisfaction to convert mysterious journey into engagement of respectably long standing georgiana breathed more freely have dreaded miss bingley cross examination still so dreaded anyone guessing at cousin misfortune that even deviated so far from usual truthfulness a to say yes probably have be intending to go time a soon a weather must be suitable be greatest comfort to feel that with elizabeth there need be concealment already description of meeting with miss crawford have travelled to pemberley with none simplest most obvious comment georgiana asked a directed by fitzwilliam for more particular connected with new acquaintance until have be openly admitted to share in elder knowledge did not like to speak of what be still mere guesswork now although elizabeth answer have not yet be received felt must write more freely only have be allowed glimpse of cousin inmost heart only have witnessed grief have be allowed to surmise origin must be indirect mean of bringing quick sympathy of two best friend be justified in telling sister of knew conjectured have be refused dear elizabeth ran one sentence can be nothing else fear be irrevocable poor cousin robert feel so terribly can nothing be done for know know be sure to tell do help dear elizabeth always help people who be in trouble letter closed dispatched experienced feeling of relief from strain having left cousin affair in more capable hand than own sad face long haunted word have written reminded of person who be now probably calling upon elizabeth for sympathy help not that kitty have be by mean forgotten in silence followed on departure new interest have occupied last few day ball attendant emotion have be rather pushed to one side georgiana have returned to grosvenor street fully expecting to find letter from derbyshire intelligence of kitty in other form own letter to elizabeth concluded morning after ball have contained in addition to account of memorable event paragraph to effect kitty have something extremely interesting to tell will not spoil pleasure by anticipating only add that believe everything be going to turn out just a happily a must like a must like for pray pray give opinion on important matter a soon a can form one be longing to have reply to letter be indeed awaiting did not give desired information a elizabeth though anxious to hear kitty news have not yet have opportunity of seeing kitty have not written be wretched correspondent delight of first few day with jane child doubtless absorbed head hand bingley own note to sister during week be useless one announced kitty safe arrival requested forwarding of stocking have left behind be likely that such communication must have bearing upon important matter like progress of young lady love affair a to mr price georgiana knew nothing be prepared for anything be quite possible that have be unable to wait for shooting of mr bingley pheasant be at moment in derbyshire upon point however elucidation be presently forthcoming at dinner table afternoon miss bingley suddenly inquired did tell georgiana that have call from charles friend mr price one day last week no replied georgiana startled by such abrupt incursion into subject have not heard be at home did see yes be at home be agreeable young fellow manner little too possessed perhaps for age be what naval men acquire asked after rather a if expected to find here georgiana said to herself that wanted latest news of kitty at event must not obtain from mr knightley be glad to be saved necessity of replying aloud by mr hurst beginning to speak yes have quite liked thought of inviting to fill vacant place at dinner be giving following week for young men who have travelled must always talk entertainingly enough to be worth while must like to be assured of character fancied have be good deal run after spoilt certainly be great flirt georgiana heart swelled pulse beat quick at accusation while uttered mild steady protest against mr hurst maintained ground young guest be supported by miss bingley who said nonsense louisa know have told there be really nothing in young officer especially who have seen service be bound to be run after whether will not a to being great flirt have seen once twice going about with very good looking woman be reason have for thinking so how can say such thing caroline mr price be perfectly at liberty to go about with a many handsome woman a like even if brother be notoriously vicious if be engaged to one of from heard saw at emma knightley other night certainly ought to be one have right to expect little more discretion be not at certain that be engaged to kitty bennet believe said caroline know emma knightley great scheme always come to anything georgiana be thereupon appealed to by sister to give denial confirmation of fact alleged must only say that believed at present kitty be not engaged that rather support opinion of said mr hurst will be glad to be proved wrong georgiana if be behind scene must let know a soon a there be anything to be told in meantime unless think mr price likely to injure moral have better invite to dinner added sister georgiana felt unaccountably disturbed by conversation must not bear hearing person ill spoken of whom have wish reason to like esteem though felt sure own impression of mr price differed so widely from mr hurst be far more likely to be correct one timidity in trusting own judgment caused to pause wonder whether have be too hasty in being so impulsively delighted with ought not a kitty friend to be more cautious until have be sure that be not going to disappoint hope of friend that have raised high hope georgiana knew even supposing imagination have be strong ally attention kitty willing acceptance of have clearly be such a to expose to remark georgiana sighed over difficulty of whole problem must not bring to believe that william price be flirt though picture of in constant attendance upon handsome woman who have doubtful relation when must have thought only of kitty be unwelcome one one with countenance that frank smile clear honest eye must surely be other than seemed yet georgiana have not to look far

wentworth well remembered mr mr darcy shy handsome sister prepared for pleasant evening when found in le of former quality even more than have used to posse of latter on other side be seated alarming mr knightley georgiana be glad to find have at event one companion so conversable a captain wentworth who belonged to profession be most interested in even though be not representative of must have chosen talk be lively for captain wentworth have art of treating subject amusingly of drawing from companion profession of opinion have not till then known to hold somehow other have drifted on to topic of inconsistency in sailor captain wentworth gravely undertook defence against charge assure miss darcy be great mistake made only because people be unacquainted with true character be of long standing fallacy just a much a many other accepted fallacy for instance that parrot always talk bad language that lady can not keep account that king can do wrong etc oh stop please captain wentworth interposed georgiana be opening up too many vexed question be going to say added more seriously that doubt be quite right must think if be inconstant must not be so very strange for must have so many temptation not at protest have more excuse on head than other class of man if man be inconstant by nature will be so whether be sailor butcher assistant speak from experience for know tried very hard to be inconstant must not succeed though have a many temptation a mist knowing mr wentworth said georgiana with smile at lady can not help being aware of how strong temptation have to be reverse exactly so must be with anyone who have once given affection have to bestow how have got idea miss darcy that poor men of sea be so fickle indeed have not got replied georgiana trying to speak lightly be merely speculating for know too little about to form judgment be put into mind through hearing someone say that young officer be so much sought after everywhere thought if be so be only natural that amiable one might find eventually that have formed many more friendship than must possibly keep up very considerately put miss darcy in effect what mean be that continually 'love ride away sailor may have more opportunity for kind of living upon word believe have more inclination granting that be so gather that be prepared to forgive little weakness be asking rather too much captain wentworth replied georgiana in same spirit of gaiety have spoken whole truth must have said certainly not if friend of mine be involved not wishing companion to think that chat have personal application continued will be able to tell better when have met with case turned subject off with smile soon after lady returned to drawing room georgiana seated beside mr wentworth whose gentle manner combined with serenity of temper power have of entering unobtrusively none le sincerely into feeling of others have for georgiana strong attraction have not met for so long that there be much to be talked over between mr wentworth presently asked after colonel fitzwilliam explained that happened to know be in town through seeing few night previously at theatre where have be with party invited by father sister georgiana replied that be well have gone away since then so a not to dwell on subject asked for description of play led on to other topic of interest when be interrupted by mr knightley joining errand be merely to ask for news of kitty georgiana rather than resenting smile of mutual understanding with question be put answered a briefly a must without discourtesy mr knightley then began talking of other thing resettled in chair so georgiana despaired of having mr wentworth to herself more that evening perceiving be not wanted elsewhere continued to retain place until gentleman entered room simultaneously with tea coffee servant began to dispense mr price obtained cup immediately brought across room to group of lady at once warmly greeting mr wentworth mr knightley remained beside georgiana indulged in little private regret partly on own account partly on for knew must be wanting to talk to about kitty since there be music during evening present might be only opportunity must have began to think of moving away for mr price seemed quite monopolized by mr knightley who be endeavouring to show off by asking question calling mr wentworth attention to answer though georgiana be grateful to effort to draw in by occasional smiling glance at think so miss darcy there did not seem to be place for fourth in conversation presently however interruption arrived in person of captain wentworth who came with coffee cup in hand to join group a mr price stood aside to give room exclaimed cheerfully well price have wife undertaken conversion of miss darcy yet here have someone be deluding with most horrible picture of sailor 'one foot on sea one on shore to one thing constant never know rest of have be trying to persuade that be wrong georgiana blushing smiling began to protest mr wentworth to spare also treated a joke mr knightley when have comprehended captain wentworth meaning gave look of great goodwill said surely miss darcy doe not take seriously what be merely vulgar tradition been be deceiver ever ' be not written with special reference to sailor imagine to men in general of course not said captain wentworth with mock gravity miss darcy doe not base suspicion on line only on far more serious premise frederick will not have tease miss darcy so unmercifully said mr wentworth be really too bad be sure have placed word in mouth never uttered have not miss darcy georgiana struggling with embarrassment amusement not little real vexation a be conscious of mr price eye being turned silently upon must not protest a intelligibly a must have wished yes mr wentworth be quite untrue never said anything of kind captain wentworth be unfair not that really matter said have opinion on subject only thought must quite understand being changeable if be whether hearer must extract meaning from word did not know be certain that confusion stood in good stead for captain wentworth immediately apologized with just a much seriousness a be needful be very sorry miss darcy pray excuse stupidity be so distressed to feel a class must merit disapproval in even one particular wanted to clear character after be so kind a to imply that needed clearing think miss darcy implied that said mr knightley confess curious to learn why think naval men be likely to be changeable must be interesting to compare note for experience of have led to opposite conclusion georgiana felt double edge in mr knightley word be painful to to be so completely misunderstood even in such trifling matter have hardly recovered composure enough to defend when captain wentworth took matter out of hand miss darcy experience of inconstancy in sailor have be sad one mr knightley said solemnly be drawn entirely from book play know how persistently look on dark side of human nature only need to become acquainted better with real life a personified in mr price with bow to william many other admirable specimen of naval men to form soundest of opinion of pardon miss darcy for assuming role of spokesman fancied fear of offending modesty might have prevented from expressing such sentiment a must wish hope will always interpret a correctly a have done captain wentworth returned georgiana smiling seeing that mr knightley be beginning to speak in low tone to mr price not wishing to hear of comment turned to mr wentworth proposed that must move to chair pianoforte therefore turned in direction mr price must hardly have time to reply to mr knightley for instant later be at georgiana side asking if might find seat mr wentworth being just then drawn away by miss bingley not unwillingly allowed to lead to sofa on opposite side of room to procure cup of coffee own having be removed to sit beside talking quietly agreeably in manner soothed nerve irritated a be by captain wentworth ill timed raillery listened absently without saying much grateful to for not renewing subject have just be dropped hoping have not attached importance to attention be alert when after pause inquired have good account of miss bennet since left town tried to collect scattered idea to remember what kitty expected of yes have have good account thought friend be very well believed enjoying country though probably seemed very quiet to after such long visit to london william price assented said that miss bennet have so much freshness enthusiasm must enjoy many thing

lose be very well thought georgiana get farther be shy of be shy of oh wonder what kitty must like to say if be mr knightley must probably bring in inconstancy of sailor with good effect suppose think that mean to throw doubt on mr price how unlucky that must have have that appearance be assisted in meditation by mr price remarking that have never be in derbyshire imagined to be beautiful county afforded opportunity of descanting on loveliness of scenery particular attraction of country round desborough park added that hoped there must be nothing to prevent from seeing for that autumn replied warmly agreeing saying that if be still own master at time nothing must prevent question two about pemberley followed relative position of two house have heard of a being show place from sister mr

soon a reached home when opening of solo on harp caused to forget everything sound of instrument in have always taken extreme delight mr price too listened with close attention when be over be commending performance exclaimed harp always reminds of one of most charming woman ever knew who used to play still doe daresay at event be associated inseparably with curiosity a well a politeness impelled georgiana to ask for more particular for privately wished very much to know what companion idea of charming woman might be answered readily enough be lady first met year ago at mansfield before sister marriage be friend of whole bertram family in way of sister also circumstance divided miss crawford people left neighbourhood now only see occasionally in town miss darcy start

for confirmation of jane replied yes be good friend kitty seems to enjoy companionship have evidently strong liking for so that sometimes feel afraid lest must develop into anything likely to cause pain hereafter of course a have repeatedly told bingley even in view of contingency have right to betray knowledge of kitty private hope a mr morland dined at desborough elizabeth have opportunity of observing young people thought have seldom seen kitty to greater advantage particularly delicate beauty be heightened partly by excitement partly by healthful country life be at perfect ease happy

elizabeth tried to rest assured that mr morland be aware of kitty attitude towards wished for nothing more that indeed be impression gave longer be with more clearly perceived that now circumstance be more settled quiet contentment evenness of temper have become habitual to without taking away earnestness steadfastness of purpose underlay whole felt that did not yet thoroughly know mr morland following morning in course of brief talk with kitty suggested to in gentlest possible way of desirability of not allowing so excellent young man who be also solitary one to entertain thought of might be so much more easily admitted to mind than expelled from kitty have just be giving wing to imagination in description of mr price elizabeth have felt hard hearted to be obliged to check young girl with difficulty came down to earth again to mr morland to assure elizabeth with haste of indifference that be positive that morland did not think of in way only cared for parish house a for being solitary why sister sarah be coming to live with elizabeth be compelled to be content in addition secured promise from jane that kitty must come to pemberley about middle of september kitty be delighted with arrangement so long a there be one secured return to desborough for shooting party early in eldest sister exhibited almost equal amount of eagerness on behalf to settle important matter

georgiana duly arrived at pemberley be welcomed with warmth that affection must show have be curiously assorted pair of travelling companion relation have speculated with amusement upon chance of congeniality being talker have at least have that in common though after arrival georgiana smilingly reproached mr bennet with having intently studied book of latin poetry throughout whole journey mr bennet gravely apologized for not having selected volume more suitable for reading aloud be sorry have not be at more pain to while away time for young lady who be exceedingly punctual always ready

child be brought in according to time honoured custom everywhere be pronounced to have grown though be to be feared that mr bennet be not ideal grandparent for so far miscalculated a to bring toy must not properly appreciate for year at least elizabeth wanted to hear of little william elizabeth collins with whom georgiana have often played at hunsford parsonage who be described a being strikingly like father mother respectively be not until following day when sister be alone together that word passed between concerning colonel fitzwilliam elizabeth showed georgiana few brief line have received from stating little more than bare fact of departure cause be engaged be over for now at event know worst wrote be too compassionate for elizabeth have be fool to think that anything so bright lovely must become mine yet did not think must bestow where have be laggard suppose threw chance away in bath how must wait until have reinstated dream be over will hear of engagement doubt beg to tell join with in wish for happiness will be with at pemberley before long georgiana be angel did not deserve from one quarter of kindness showed in postscript added will darcy trust to choose horse have seen beautiful pair of bay must suit large carriage besides perfect chestnut hunter georgiana sighed smiled over letter elizabeth said yes evidently doe not wish to think be overwhelmed by though from what doe not say can realize depth of feeling be incredible for of course must be sir walter elliot sir walter be only name to georgiana vague recollection from last year at bath replied that have heard of engagement from source without particular elizabeth gave vigorous description of ended by saying that must wait see if necessity for writing to miss crawford arose for did not feel much disposed to congratulate kitty affair be of course passed under review elizabeth be somewhat surprised to find georgiana be staunch upholder of notion that william price be likely to make offer a have fancied that account might have be exaggerated georgiana must be one to take sober dispassionate view asseveration of belief that mr price truth steadiness in kitty being unlikely to have deceived in case went farther to convince elizabeth than anything have heard before next few week passed in tranquil enjoyment for person in pemberley circle in must be comprised party from desborough a plan of importance must be carried through without joining of force inclusion of mr morland on one side ferrars from pemberley rectory on other bingleys with two young people frequently drove over to spend day two day when mr bennet removed to desborough towards end of august be not felt to be so much of break up a changing of scene of activity boating expedition ride over moor blackberry gathering evening spent quietly at home in game music something must always be found to suit taste of party of people who be bent on finding pleasure in other company even kitty felt that only one thing be wanting to fill cup of happiness to brim for father have sanctioned staying on until november month hoped must see overflow for one person however peaceful time be about to end in pain disappointment mr bingley sister be sitting indoors together one morning in middle of september when mr morland be observed approaching house be such frequent caller that have become habit with to walk straight in lady after waiting for time wondered at non appearance still more at intelligence brought by servant in answer to jane summons that mr morland have asked only for mr bennet have be shown into library what can want with father said jane suspicion of truth shooting across mind checking utterance a glanced anxiously at sister such idea seemed to have occurred to kitty who innocently conjectured interview to be literary conference discussion have arisen out of mr morland sermon making mr bennet on perceiving visitor might have anticipated something of kind mr morland first word corrected young man errand be indeed nothing more le than to make formal proposal for hand of mr bennet daughter to request permission to address be nervous a men in situation be apt to be genuine feeling sound sense enabled to state case well if not very fluently a represented strength of attachment described worldly position prospect mr bennet have long ceased to be surprised at receiving application of kind however unexpected might be certainly one found quite unprepared what little thought have given to subject have certainly not led to supposition of mr morland becoming son in law endeavoured to make answer discouraging one daughter will be much honoured by high opinion of mr morland have reason to think ill of pretension must admit have not remarked on part strong prepossession in favour be one of thing have found most charming in miss bennet character sir replied morland that must not easily give heart away readily suppose man to be enslaved by one else must have failed to perceive depth of admiration have seemed quite unconscious of though at same time be fully aware that there be brilliancy distinction about nothing to attract anyone who posse full measure of quality looked so downcast that mr bennet remarked if be question mr morland might set mind at rest for daughter though very good girl be not brilliant must be comfortable with husband of description observation inspired mr morland to fairly long speech in extolled be amiable quality dwelt on own demerit notwithstanding contrast thereby presented be able to deduce number of excellent reason for being allowed to propose to miss bennet without delay mr bennet heard in silence at end replied that though flattered by mr morland first referring to who be merely father of young lady must not answer for daughter sentiment have found that in matter girl have always made up own mind doubt must continue to do so indeed yes be with miss bennet must plead own cause will not refuse sanction said young man eagerly think so far favourably of suit that will place bar in way of trust may in time say perfect happiness mr morland way to perfect happiness be open a far a be concerned replied mr bennet taking up book morland satisfaction at having father even passively on side be very great spoke gratitude very warmly mingling with such praise of kitty such rosy prognostication of future a caused mr bennet to reply in characteristic fashion let know when time come to wish joy mr morland will do life be so uncertain that think for present have better refrain have ascertained whether kitty can cook make own gown trim hat understand be great promoter of married happiness when wife can do so be not sure whether girl have turned education to such good account mr morland only replied by asking if might be allowed to see miss bennet at once father left room foreseeing that happened must not have one more quiet hour during day anticipation be soon in way to be fulfilled for on finding daughter sending kitty to library have to give jane outline of what have just passed then repeat to bingley who joined listened to exclamation of surprise regret at probable downfall of mr morland hope jane bingley be too convinced of kitty prior attachment to have slightest expectation of success mr bennet be put in full possession of fact relating to while anxiously awaited termination of interview came after minute in glimpse of kitty emerging from library hurrying upstairs with streaming eye while debated a to next move mr morland be seen to cross hall rapidly looking nowhere in front of leave house with precipitation jane almost equally distressed longed to go to kitty bingley questioned whether ought not to hasten after young man while mr bennet be disposed to think must be better left to for time wished heartily that there be only just enough lover in world to go round one to young lady none over in spite of jane be not long in finding way to agitated sister in showing tenderest consideration kitty distress be very great also very sincere for have in truth be far from guessing that mr morland took more than common interest in a be usual in such case declaration of young man love woke in feeling have not known to exist of reciprocal kindness even affection only did not share nature strength of kitty must never have be hard hearted to lover least of to one whom liked a much a did james morland devotion touched a deeply a knowledge that must not accept wounded between regret for what have happened pity for for excited thought of william price incident be bound to evoke be in sad state jane easily prevailed upon to have dinner upstairs go early to bed not so easily must check tear flowed continuously jane to occupy mind body proposed that must go to morrow to pemberley instead of in three day time a arranged must very well be sent over change must be beneficial besides be not really leaving for there be november visit to look forward to kitty caught at suggestion declining office of maid began to busy about packing a jane hoped must do while latter descended to consult with husband father mr bennet bingley approved jane hastily wrote few line to elizabeth to apprise of what have happened that might be prepared for kitty arrival two gentleman walked to nearest post town to convey letter after dinner indefatigable bingley again set out time to rectory to perform same kind office by james morland a wife have be doing by kitty young man though calmer proved far more unreceptive of consolation have felt rebuff acutely for kitty have be too much taken by surprise too sure of herself to make otherwise than decisive even modest hope have ventured to entertain of being able to make more progress with once subject be opened between have be most thoroughly dispelled miss bennet must not hear word of begged never to speak of again with tear reproached for having spoilt everything so that in addition to own disappointment have pain of feeling that thought le well of than before bingley must deny must not affirm anything else likely to give comfort remained for morland to declare did in firm though melancholy tone that regretted having distressed miss bennet must endeavour so to meet in future that must not suffer through being reminded of by act of word of bingley commended courage told of kitty departure begged to continue coming to desborough just same walked home with full report of what have just passed jane shook head over for while sympathizing with be more truly sorry for mr morland since for must see immediate prospect of compensation in spite of father assurance that young clergyman be seldom allowed to remain inconsolable for more than six month if kitty other young man only did what be expected of fate must be certainty in half that time chapter xiii needle to say kitty be heartily welcomed by georgiana elizabeth given opportunity to relieve mind by description of tragical affair in aspect regretted deeply for mr morland sake elizabeth privately did so for kitty sake having such good opinion of a to make wish that kitty must have be persuaded out of fancy for young man who however excellent be comparatively stranger to whose intention at present be extremely uncertain must have rejoiced if kitty morland must have made other happy have entertained slight hope that hint to kitty might perhaps have helped matter in directing thought into channel seemed to be of avail georgiana gave friend warmest support implying entire agreement with point of view must not help now must georgiana know lizzie that never dreamt how must do anything else refuse outright be amazingly grieved to do so know very well georgiana that if must think of one man more than be not that one paused for assent georgiana gave by silent caress then continued be so unfortunate will never be a pleasant at desborough now poor mr morland wish have not have to hurt doe want someone so badly in rectory well dear make ill with vain regret said elizabeth be a say very unfortunate one blame if must not care for must not do someone else will have to inhabit nice rectory kitty looked a if prospect be not very pleasing georgiana seeing what elizabeth wished began to talk cheerfully of something else kitty gradually joined in though whenever two girl be alone together found difficult to abstain long from referring to branch of subject georgiana loyalty patience never failed wished for november almost a earnestly a kitty so that matter might reach definite conclusion for kitty restlessness have considerably increased since have received james morland offer be constantly nervous excitable not mistress of herself on day when bingleys mr bennet came over for latter to take leave before returning to longbourn be specially noticeable in state of anxious flutter when drawing jane aside to inquire after mr morland mr bennet bade farewell gravely more affectionately than be wont telling that left in good hand must only give one piece of advice namely that second thought be sometimes best kitty blushed deeply must not pretend to misunderstand told georgiana afterwards that be impossible to have better second thought when price be first with elder daughter mr bennet be rather more explicit telling elizabeth that considered be great pity so unobjectionable young man must have be sent about business elizabeth entirely agreed with thought must not be going too far to express mr morland praise in even warmer term will never set thames on fire there seems good stuff in be mr bennet reply when proposed for have not taken much notice of except to think tolerably sensible fellow of course have to readjust idea soon began to see that must not be judged by alone have really liked better too for way of taking refusal dear father doe not always indicate want of sense to wish to be married interposed elizabeth perhaps not morland be much better off a be than in marrying girl know so little about kitty be flighty expensive ought to stay longer with jane not think of being married for next ten year elizabeth smiled said thought that be unnecessary that must certainly be better for kitty to marry clergyman than officer in navy who must be compelled to spend long period away from home a to of course be complete absurdity can not think why woman who be so fond of making match did not originate something le ridiculously unsuitable among yourselves elizabeth thought wiser not to explain who actually have originated idea said after pause be saying that have liked mr morland better of late yes have positively shown sort of self command dignity turned up at house day two afterwards apparently not bent on making uncomfortable by sight of misery a most rejected lover do besides bingley have

georgiana in particular being prepared to be miserable for time from belief that cousin instead of being cheered invigorated a formerly by return home must be reminded at turn of failure of experiment

shooting showed interest in minutest detail of life in neighbourhood in way endeavoured to prove that be exactly old self only when walking with elizabeth in park one morning did betray how far be from being case there be doubt that disappointment have coloured whole life have allowed to think of miss crawford to build high upon hope to find again mistaken have be blow cut at foundation of happiness gaiety be feigned pursuit have lost zest friend longer sufficed a said to elizabeth have felt have better adopt country occupation settle down to there grow old a quietly quickly a might be

of subject have not approached with utmost gentleness spoke few word of commiseration then still proceeding with extreme caution told of absence of news assumption that miss crawford marriage with sir walter elliot have be delayed daresay have returned colonel fitzwilliam with kind of listlessness striking with stick at head of tall grass bordered path there can be doubt of suppose pursued

have written to even mr wentworth a must know must be interested colonel fitzwilliam must not immediately recall anything of mr wentworth beyond name on being reminded that be sir walter elliot

to be of service to fitzwilliam gratefully promised to stay for present said that only engagement be to go to friend in leicestershire in november for hunting elizabeth be nevertheless not perfectly

surprise be from mr price mr wentworth never mentioned mr wentworth of course recollect now be sir walter elliot daughter at time never thought of for see did not know sir walter be man very true have also forgotten that did not know said elizabeth must never connect with miss crawford have be thinking must like for own satisfaction to know when wedding be going to take place simplest way will be to write ask mr wentworth wish have done so before did not wish to be in haste felt so convinced must hear from others georgiana agreed that be best course to pursue elizabeth having told darcy of intention to on account of promise to fitzwilliam must no longer object wrote dispatched letter season be now drawing on with shortening day family at pemberley found thrown more upon resource of own

friendship be of particularly sincere well balanced kind be not marred by constant intercourse a knew how to maintain that degree of reserve prevents indiscriminate confidence so greatly strengthens mutual respect kitty be one who perhaps found society of rectory least congenial be to be feared that be extremely difficult to please autumn in impatience with waited for one young man might have

young prefer outdoor expedition to be in dry weather said elinor that reminds that must show what terrible havoc last night rain wind worked in flower border when looked out first be quite in despair thinking must not have nosegay autumn there be gleam of sunshine now so will take turn in garden georgiana gladly walked out with mr jennings kitty followed at distance former questioning young companion about sister abroad hearing lament over gaiety that sister have be able to offer have never be able to accept mr jennings hearty comment of well there now be shame regiment too must have broken heart vow other such remark pleased kitty while knew in heart ought not to do so two girl shortly after took leave while walking homeward naturally compared note upon stranger whom have just met georgiana expressed guardedly not wishing to condemn friend of mr ferrars although feeling a if friend must not be in way accession to party kitty first unfavorable impression seemed to have be obliterated declared frankly that liked mr jennings thought be very merry good natured georgiana must not quite agree with for found mr jennings style of raillery not at to mind admitted that might be pleasanter when one got to know well at dinner opinion be canvassed georgiana found a expected that own be largely shared by elizabeth who however be amused at severity told that must often meet people who with more refined manner be yet at heart far more vulgar than mr jennings have not tenth part of redeeming quality think want to meet then said georgiana be sure be right elizabeth daresay will be great comfort to mr ferrars when lady be together after dinner kitty whose gravity preoccupation have be noticeable for last half hour after wandering several time round room stationed near to sister began in solemn tone lizzie want to ask something very important elizabeth smiling professed attention kitty continued know have never kept promise that made before be married of having ball here for winter something have happened to prevent quite true kitty so ball be in mind what made think of just now never come here without thinking of have somehow not expected to be staying long enough year a imagined must go home directly after shooting party mr jennings said to day supposed sometimes have ball in lovely house be sure georgiana be fond of dancing mr jennings be quite right about latter statement be not georgiana looked up with smile to assent to share of question kitty clasped hand rapturously exclaiming oh lizzie know how much love ball must be so kind of darcy everyone must enjoy be very fond of ball said elizabeth darcy a know be not think even might admit that be sometimes duty to give one idea have crossed own mind confess have not considered whether party number must be suitable kitty joy at favourable reception of proposal be excessive must not refrain from beginning to practise step about room singing while from sheer delight gentleman entering at moment paused in astonishment on threshold what be kitty inquired darcy approaching something mr jennings have taught extreme merriment at idea of mr jennings a instructress of dancing prevented kitty from immediately replying whole matter be presently explained laid before darcy for approval seeing that brother in law did not instantly dismiss whole scheme kitty poured out flood of reason to commend be just right time of year not too cold snowy jane bingley must have party must bring over ball have be given at pemberley since georgiana be grown up house be so conveniently built a if on purpose for ball finally must be most delightful thing for everybody know want time to think over said elizabeth to husband there be hurry at think be quite feasible really owe neighbourhood entertainment of kind darcy declared that did not see why house must be required to furnish neighbour with so called amusement of watching other promenading about polished floor though doubt be great compliment to original architect did not believe that pemberley have really be primarily designed for giving ball in family must perceive that opposition be not intended to be very serious discussion terminated with promising to talk over with elizabeth even to consider middle of november a being date likely to suit convenience of household kitty regarded matter a settled carried news to rectory following morning in highest spirit assuring mr jennings that be owing to suggestion that subject have be brought forward at right moment sincerity of lady delight warmth of congratulation be most gratifying immediately began to ask kitty who partner must be what variety young men of neighbourhood must afford kitty confessed that there be not many living very near with exception of officer of regiment stationed at ashbourne with of whom brother be acquainted that sister mr bingley must bring over one even two who knew for certain danced extremely well aha cried mr jennings very pretty be single men too warrant kitty look of consciousness gave mr jennings far too fine opportunity to resist did not take long to ascertain enough particular about certain young naval officer to convince that ball be going to be occasion for two young people to be made happy friend regaled with interesting news there be need for to hear very minute description of mr price conduct impression have left on beholder mere mention of existence hint of kitty partiality be sufficient material upon to build up whole romance miss bennet might depend upon be only waiting to come down here make acquaintance of rest of family then not moment must be lost although assurance gave pleasure revived sensation elizabeth georgiana have not wished to encourage kitty must not help feeling certain absurdity in accepting from someone whose conviction be based solely on good natured interest in affair be tempted into giving longer version of have happened in london in order that mr jennings might be more fully informed be decided relief to talk to friend whose opinion coincided with of mr knightley a mr ferrars be not in room there be nothing to put check on confidence have however instinctive feeling of delicacy made stop short of divulging more recent experience unconscious mr morland be saved have known many witty sally on deserted condition elizabeth georgiana be amused to notice how willing kitty henceforward became to go to rectory for whereas have formerly rather endured than enjoyed visit there now volunteered to join others whenever went be generally to be found during part of time chatting with mr jennings when good lady called at pemberley be kitty office to escort home again mr jennings have early discovered that miss darcy be grave quiet must on account be induced to join in joking reference to lover while mr darcy general style manner be not such a to warrant intimacy implied by such conversation there be many other topic for mr jennings be thoroughly kind friendly took deepest interest in neighbour concern besides sentimental one child garden poultry house clothes ball too afforded unending subject for discussion there be to be disappointment mr darcy have allowed to be talked into fifteenth of november be fixed for momentous occasion card be sent out officer accepted in body colonel fitzwilliam promised to stay for new dress be ordered from london not least among minor excitement be reckoned arrival of letter from jane expressing pleasure of herself bingley at prospect engaging to bring with at time namely miss bingley mr price tom bertram last name be accounted for by jane explanation that bingley have asked mr price to bring brother with other man who must shoot brother not being available mr price have secured instead cousin elder son of sir thomas bertram of mansfield park perhaps not one of party at breakfast table to whom letter be read aloud must hear altogether unmoved elizabeth husband be naturally deeply interested in concerned kitty be glad to know there be certainty of seeing at last young man of whom have heard so much while georgiana rejoiced in clear proof of anxiety to meet kitty again built upon hope of progress of affair speedily uninterruptedly to desired ending there need not surely be anything to delay on contrary young lover have ever more favourable circumstance own brief stay on shore excuse for apparent haste kitty being surrounded by friend whose approval must be equivalent to of parent making everything easy indeed be impossible to see what obstacle must arise must not be diffident enough to entertain doubt a to whether feeling what be supposed to be feeling be returned georgiana must not help little smile at thought though at same time regretting that kitty must allow heart to be read so clearly to kitty announcement of intended arrival at desborough be scarcely le tremendous than if have walked into room at moment demanding hand a approached latter incident must hardly have caused greater tremor than former did a soon a must get georgiana alone poured out afresh old hope fear anxiety desiring georgiana to confirm own surmise with positive assertion to reply be sure will when kitty said hope will to say of course most certainly when kitty speculated upon various way in mr price might be expected to commit although feeling tolerably confident georgiana tried to confine to assurance of warm sympathy pointed out to kitty that be not prudent delicate to assume so much when actual declaration have be made with mr price coming so nearly in view idea detracted from kitty perfect satisfaction privately found mr jennings arrangement of coming event far more encouraging colonel fitzwilliam attention be caught by name of mr bingley guest in rather different manner mr price recollected a georgiana acquaintance name of bertram awoke association of kind be trying to subdue be name have more than once heard coupled with miss crawford belonged to people who be fatally connected with past life have only right to protect meeting with representative of family might have afforded opportunity of refuting for ever vague scandal be doing so much harm have right privilege belonged to sir walter elliot truest kindness must do be to remain silent in new life have chosen past must be forgotten strove resolutely to put away saddening reflection to throw into general interest of subject by making few inquiry about two young men georgiana be only person who must supply information about mr bertram for mr price have told sister be married to cousin mr edmund bertram also of mansfield be evident that must be older brother fresh excitement be caused shortly afterwards by second letter from mr bingley jane wrote that mr price mr bertram be to arrive at desborough on sixth of november begged that two girl must come over on previous day to spend week there mr morland took care to inform be intending to pas greater part of month with friend portinscales so a elizabeth have doubt already heard must be unable to be present at pemberley ball in kitty intelligence aroused most fleeting of regret others have leisure to feel sorry while commending prudence that circumstance must prevent taking part in general gaiety jane have special reason for feeling kindly towards for have wished to ask kitty to join party have not liked to do so in view of mr morland being at home suspecting that must be occasion for inviting of relative from pemberley have quietly made arrangement without allowing anyone to perceive hardship be to to deny glimpse of miss catherine bennet invitation be rapturously accepted on part of kitty very willingly by georgiana for liked being with jane be pleased at prospect of seeing william again for own sake elizabeth felt most important that girl must be together for georgiana to watch over kitty be check on impulsiveness darcy gave sign of confidence in sister very precious to by saying be good thing be asked georgiana for there be one else who can be trusted to keep kitty in order bring sensible account of young man intention to desborough then be to go to bear with mr mr darcy invitation to mr bingley guest for pemberley ball chapter xiv october be rapidly passing elizabeth have received acknowledgment of letter to mr wentworth occasioned to surprise for anne be punctilious correspondent certainly must not have allowed important question a have be put to to remain long unanswered at last when elizabeth have begun to fear that letter reply must have miscarried wished for packet be discerned among morning post carried to own private room before perusing dear mr darcy like to imagine what must be thinking of for long inexplicable silence letter bear date october second almost month ago will forgive when hear that only just received have be travelling abroad a frederick wished to take advantage of period of comparative peace to visit of old dutch city returned only week after delightful extremely fatiguing tour letter have followed about to continually changing address be little short of miracle so many of have reached have now reappeared at winchester after wandering must be excuse for not writing instantly to correct misconception under grieve to think have be labouring father be not engaged to miss crawford there be probability of marriage between now at future time know that month ago rumour to effect be in existence for indeed must be confessed that father attention to miss crawford be very marked sister be among who be confident that engagement must ultimately result before went abroad elizabeth wrote to from brighton where father have removed to say that affair be at end miss crawford having given father definite refusal think be great deal vexed disappointed be perhaps natural for father have counted upon succeeding must have be very advantageous match for can not help thinking that there must not have be great happiness in for of be not altogether suitable dear mr darcy must not weary with comment in case a everyone can supply own know where mr grant miss crawford be now conclude in bath only news of have reached besides what have stated be be sorry to say that miss crawford have be ill heard particular seems bald unsatisfactory wish must have given better earlier information pray give warm regard to mr darcy sister be great delight to to renew acquaintance with latter to see looking so lovely blooming countenance express so much sensibility that one be convinced must have tender heart one hope that life may always be kind to have great wish to invite to pay visit when returned to winchester from london be disappointed to learn have already travelled north will mention to say how glad must be if ever be disposed to come in direction must try to give pleasant time child must be reaching delightful age ala with what pang do view empty nursery accept very cordial remembrance believe etc be well that elizabeth have taken precaution of being alone to read letter for agitation caused must not easily have be concealed thousand confusing thought surged through mind action of sort felt must take being only person of circle in possession of knowledge what action must be safe prudent productive of result while believing that fitzwilliam have be refused have always found hard to credit that must have be refused for sir walter elliot denial of statement found willing acceptance be so unnatural so horrible almost to think of miss crawford a lady elliot before elizabeth have even time to think of fitzwilliam have rejoiced over miss crawford be not having committed act so unworthy of next tried to recollect exactly what have heard with reference to fitzwilliam dismissal have be confident that be lost to through engagement assumed since have never be engaged clearly there have be indication a darcy have said have forced to believe that be ill disposed towards what then must anyone do for now be not by mean certain that because have rejected sir walter elliot must be induced to accept colonel fitzwilliam yet knowledge that be free free still to be won be reason for not withdrawing utterly until knew what must be fate of own pretension taken on own merit elizabeth must not feel satisfied remembering what have happened at bath that have ever have fair opportunity of pleading cause might indeed have have refusal a definite a sir walter in case there must be kindness in reopening subject must profit little to know that suitor have fared no better than even though suitor might be one who must never have aspired what if have arisen through misunderstanding after long earnest consideration elizabeth determined that step now took towards cousin chance of reconciliation must know nothing of if have finally decided against there be reason why must be put to pain of hearing second time at least seemed clear paved way for next resolution namely to write to mr grant without mentioning anything have heard beyond intimation of miss crawford illness ask for news of darcy entered while be preparing to write immediately handed mr wentworth letter having read handed back to saying gravely what be going to do now elizabeth for suppose be going to do something elizabeth described plan motif darcy listened without giving much encouragement at length said have realized what great responsibility be taking upon in endeavouring to bring two people together again yes said elizabeth dear darcy do not think must be prepared to take will hing must possibly give fitzwilliam moment uneasiness have already suffered too much be changed man a be agreeing other day if there be slightest chance of making happy think ought not to let slip one ourselves can possibly make attempt to reunite miss crawford know be prepared to undertake herculean task in interest of friend dear when man have be so decidedly repulsed be delicate manner to heal breach imagine scheme must be straightaway to invite miss crawford here send off for walk with instruction to return in hour engaged couple be spoken without ghost of smile idea suggested to elizabeth be so brilliant that forgot to remonstrate husband for not being sufficiently serious never thought of will do exclaimed not send off for walk of course invite miss crawford sister to come stay here will come if will a soon a ball be over for robert be leaving next day in course of quiet fortnight will be strange if can not discover whether care in least for after time fitzwilliam be to be summoned home with speed suppose oh can not look so far ahead if endeavour prove unavailing of course must not let know that have be here at well elizabeth be glad be providing for contingency forget most probable one namely that will not be persuaded to accept invitation miss crawford may not want to lend helping hand mr grant to play fitzwilliam game for naturally will tell distinctly that will not be here will be quite to ourselves if have be ill may like to have change decline to be discouraged darcy by may suggest for be convinced that plan can do harm may do great deal of good perhaps be right dear seems to to be considerable risk can not emphasize too strongly need for absolute secrecy know can not wish fitzwilliam anything better than thoroughly happy marriage when think of what mine have done for darcy for to be paying compliment world must be coming to end now here be nurse bringing child so will have to postpone writing for present letter be posted elizabeth have to wait longer than must have wished for answer to one also after about ten day have note in hand did not know be brought to proved to be from mr grant who dated from everingham norfolk said that be writing in place of sister who be still so far from well that be necessary to spare trouble fatigue have be extremely ill during august september have seemed to make so little progress towards recovery that have come to stay with brother few week ago in hope of obtaining benefit from more bracing air unfortunately have not gained good have hoped for be still anxious about on first receiving mr darcy kind invitation have felt be impossible to accept a state of health spirit made languid disinclined for exertion mr grant mr crawford have at length using power of persuasion induced to reconsider decision for felt that to mix with friend once more to be in midst of such agreeable stimulating surroundings a visit to mr darcy must afford must be best possible remedy for nervous complaint from have suffered in case must shortly have to leave everingham a be too cold exposed spot sister be scarcely equal to journey to bath yet so that mr darcy letter have come at most fortunate time miss crawford be very desirous that mr grant must explain that be still invalid to great extent insists on saying tiresome exacting one though can not endorse added mr grant be afraid of giving trouble of being on account of want of health unacceptable visitor say that if be going to trespass upon kindness can not do so on false pretense so wish to know just how will find in case must rather postpone having until future time when be more of rational being elizabeth perceived something of miss crawford old spirit peeping out in message spirit of independence must laugh at own weakness rather than appeal for pity made reluctant to accept kindness might wear aspect of indulgence have not be for recent illness consequent pressure put upon by brother sister be clear must not have come to pemberley elizabeth be conscious in wording of letter of shrinking from earnest way in mr grant on sister behalf begged to be assured that must find mr mr darcy quite alone at home emphasized something more than invalid wish for seclusion in reply elizabeth endeavoured to convey complete assurance of quietness of pemberley suitability for anyone in miss crawford delicate condition there must be one at home said excepting of course mr darcy sister whom miss crawford have met who be one of household patient must have care must lead kind of life preferred must not be troubled in way even be asked to join rest of party until felt stronger a elizabeth hoped believed soon must letter be expressive of writer goodwill trusted that might do away with remaining unwillingness miss crawford might have felt in renewing acquaintance have indirectly caused so much pain elizabeth rejoiced in having accomplished first step miss crawford acceptance might have be wrung from be unlikely must withdraw once be safely established at pemberley whether colonel fitzwilliam be to be made happy not at least there must be no more misunderstanding elizabeth proposed date to mr grant for arrival of two lady decided to maintain reserve on subject towards everyone except husband until ball must be over cousin must have left house for be particularly anxious that hint of must reach ear georgiana discretion must have be depended upon elizabeth felt must be better to postpone telling even of mr wentworth reply until matter must be further advanced chapter xv georgiana found that presence a check on kitty outlet for excitement be very necessary for kitty have come to regard a central figure in little drama be to be played during next few day manner of speaking of mr price during first evening must certainly have betrayed to miss bingley state of feeling towards if lady have not be already possessed of information georgiana felt sorry vexed for must read clearly expression on miss bingley face knew that kitty be exposing to not altogether friendly criticism miss bingley have never learnt to do more than tolerate rest of bennet family in spite of openly professed affection for jane when a in case happened to have taken liking to admirer of one member of evidently found inferiority greater than ever mr price be great deal too good for kitty bennet managed to convey by look tone be not intended for anyone kitty georgiana must not help notice resent to georgiana miss bingley said with great air of frankness now affair have be so much talked of be expected on side trusted must soon become accomplished fact of course be emma knightley doing a kitty be evidently so much in love hoped with good deal of emphasis mr price felt same great day arrived mr tom bertram curricle drove up to door late in afternoon laden with two passenger manservant necessary complement of bag gun case spaniel on chain william price have be staying at mansfield consequently journey for be comparatively easy one there be many greeting to be made introduction to be performed in short half hour before everyone retired to dress for dinner bingley in warmth of welcome must not make enough of guest wanted to be talking to at once look of delighted surprise on william price face when caught sight of two young girl did not escape observation more than remarkable fact of kitty being suddenly struck almost dumb with shyness being unable to reply except in monosyllable with deep blush to inquiry after health georgiana with greater self possession shook hand in own grave manner looked straight in face answered simply bowed with quiet courtesy in acknowledgment of pleasure expressed in meeting again at dinner kitty be placed between georgiana mr price latter being on mr bingley right hand a jane considerately talked for most of time to mr tom bertram who sat on other side kitty be able to enjoy mr price conversation almost uninterruptedly have much to tell to ask of london mutual friend there of stay in portsmouth king visit to review ship of shooting party at mansfield astonishing sagacity of cousin new dog georgiana heard scrap of noticed with satisfaction good understanding seemed to exist be much wisest beginning thought far better to have basis of common interest on to found friendship before love come than to rush blindly into violent attachment may a rapidly subside mr price will gradually bring out best be in kitty will care for same thing doe more moderately will develop finer taste will have so much to make happy that charm of nature will not fade mr price be evidently too sensible to expect to have exclusive enjoyment of kitty company in such small party be ready to reply to anyone who might address seemed to wish to get acquainted with mr bingley always have lively word glance for cousin opposite tom bertram must put up with greater amount of good natured teasing joking from cousin than have ever done from anyone in life illness have sobered though not much le careless selfish than formerly entertained secret admiration for younger man who have already done so much with own life have shown strongly amenable to influence from quarter to exercise influence be last thing william price must have thought of doing yet be entirely through half laughing half serious representation tom have be induced to settle down at home to interest in work of managing estate to show more consideration for parent at moment have allowed to be carried off from home knowing that be part of general scheme to distract mind from matrimonial entanglement in be on verge of becoming involved family cordially disliked there be reason to fear that miss isabella thorpe have played card too well that in spite of effort of friend must eventually reign at mansfield park a next lady bertram when gentleman rejoined lady after dinner william price immediately approached georgiana made few remark upon indifferent subject until attention of others being directed to story narrated by mr bertram inquired if have heard anything more of miss crawford since last meeting owing to elizabeth reticence on subject georgiana be able to answer with truth that have heard nothing when have spoken reply seemed to so curt that added sister mr darcy have written to friend to mr wentworth in fact to make inquiry know with what result to mr wentworth repeated william price then of course mean know what be so churlish a to refuse to tell that evening at mr hurst sir walter elliot name hope have forgiven miss darcy will understand why did not feel at liberty to repeat at time be sure be right mr price indeed have never heard rumour confirmed yet said georgiana wish have seen miss crawford again there be opportunity did not see again said william have to leave town directly after when returned be gone wish must learn something so trust may not be true for miss crawford to marry man must be not one thousand pity be difficult to understand why anyone must make so called marriage of convenience one feel that of people be worthy of better fate one must hope if really be decided upon that be not altogether mere convenience that there be mutual regard also said georgiana oh doubt there be great deal of regard on side be not sort of man to appreciate properly rejoined mr price if knew miss darcy even kindness of heart must fail to find suitable excuse know miss crawford friend be dissatisfied about said georgiana can not help feeling that there be need for to make marriage at unless be confident will conduce to happiness so whatever be doing one must assume that be using judgment put case so admirably miss darcy declare have nearly consoled be just what have tried to remind of that can afford to marry where chooses a there be compulsion except own good nature can hardly believe will make such unwise choice absolutely settle believe have got private information have conveyed to from own mind without speaking word have reassured indeed have private information replied georgiana with faint smile think have reassured by own close knowledge of miss crawford character may know miss crawford better in matter of kind woman be far better judge of one than be men of read other a must yourselves deduce other motif from knowledge of own consequently bring far keener insight to bear than can think that perhaps woman understand other better be natural that must said georgiana after moment reflection then must remember that be expected to acquire habit of entering into feeling of others position a onlooker in active world enables to find pleasure in studying character of around happiness be in proportion to amount of sympathy comprehension be excited in be too modest estimation of quality of sex miss darcy must go further say that person need to acquire habit mention for have naturally such quick generous sympathy power of reading with true kindliness disposition of others drawing out best be in that think be impossible for to receive more happiness than give must have met such be what mean by woman power of insight looked at earnestly a said georgiana have never seen so grave that meant kitty have not moment doubt seemed to be within sentence of name fully expected next word to be there be someone know think miss darcy something similar in confusion did not stop to reflect how unlikely be that must speak so openly when kitty be standing few yard away a

in protesting that must not possibly recite impromptu speech bingley finally settled point by agreeing with mr bertram vehement assertion that must be much more amusing if acted part that must show how to do in way that speaking must be necessary though miss bingley doubted if company must be equal to demand upon capability next point be to choose word matter of prodigious importance for many book be brought out consulted merit possibility of word exhaustively debated be not until renewed consideration of subject at dinner table that made discovery that if of be to appear in different scene of same charade there must be one left to guess meaning becomes really serious said bingley if be play must act to ourselves chair table be perfectly happy very existence of charade be threatened if one be ignorant of from what hear of intended costume will take rest of evening for preparation so that will be ready to begin performance just a lady have to leave to morrow who be

difficulty of such occasion arose have to be smoothed away a for instance when mr bingley positively declined to play part required acting although be only person who looked queen to perfection when miss darcy wanted to give up important part to miss bennet whom did not suit at simply because latter be anxious to wear dress went with when miss bingley desired to represent lady macbeth joan of arc

walked homewards be in glow of delight over vision talk have evoked mr jennings prophecy with regard to georgiana mr bertram fitted into place in same cheerful picture undoubtedly mr jennings be quite right so seldom erred in judgment kitty must not recollect that two have ever seemed specially pleased with other in probability be for now that came to think of there be one else for georgiana mr bertram matched a naturally a mr price did kitty yes be most likely that must soon be engaged perhaps married before to kitty more interesting couple must certainly not do if wedding at longbourn must be le magnificent affair than one at pemberley if kitty must not aspire to wedding dress trimmed with such lace a miss darcy have inherited from mother at event must have honour importance of being married first with smile of satisfaction pictured sending out of invitation have decided on form of number of recipient by time re entered house same subject absorbed attention of two lady have just left mr jennings must not refrain from recounting to hostess conjecture have instantly founded upon knowledge of mr bertram existence though mr ferrars be well acquainted with friend flight of imagination have positive argument to array against one be obliged to content with urging mr jennings to let hint drop of suspicion until something must occur to confirm a must be so painful for young people mr jennings promised caution at same time being evidently unwilling to relinquish idea pleased so much mr ferrars perceived that must be necessary to repeat warning very often before following evening when friend husband must go to pemberley ball without a dreaded over fatigue on first evening occasion of charade intended to be present hoped to be able to control check mr jennings remark must threaten to become embarrassing knowing intense freely expressed interest in fellow creature mr jennings friend must have be glad to bargain for not more than one love affair to be in progress at one time under eye arrival of party from desborough must not fail to bring even to dignified pemberley pleasant sense of bustle excitement in first flood of greeting introduction inquiry elizabeth husband be only aware of generally agreeable impression of mr bingley two young guest of tom bertram good looking fashionable easy talkative of william price with shorter sturdier figure fine open countenance manner with want of animation yet attracted by quiet simplicity even in short time since two set of friend have be parted great deal seemed to have happened must be talked over bingley wished to narrate to anyone who must listen to wonderful achievement of shooting party yesterday who have accounted for incredible number of pheasant mr bertram have taken possession of georgiana in order to propound to at great length scheme for altering improving several of charade scene william price who be somehow established on settee by kitty be telling how far have succeeded in task have bequeathed to of endeavouring to teach mr bingley parrot to talk whole party be comfortably disposed round drawing room fire looked like remaining there until be time to dress for dinner tom bertram not satisfied with explaining wished to demonstrate presently asked if might see acting room after be not long in requesting presence of whole company there to see if understood movement position on new stage kitty have undertaken to show preparation have carried off william price with bingley followed with many good humoured grumbling summoning sister who be not anxious to break off conversation with colonel fitzwilliam in course of be examining closely a to reason for quitting london so abruptly in summer be necessary however to assert position a leading lady so joined others georgiana slipping in with watching for opportunity to make useful while in interval put final stitch in head dress for kitty mr bingley be allowed to excuse pleading fatigue presence of sufficiently large number of person at informal rehearsal reason fully justified by burst of laughter sound of prolonged argument occasionally penetrated through folding door when after hasty toilet actor returned to saloon dinner guest have already arrived kitty be so distressingly conscious of confidence have so freely given that kept in background while two young men be being introduced to mr jennings avoided meeting eye mr jennings shook hand with warmly congratulated upon having discovered delightful form of amusement for young lady a acting charade long evening madam returned tom bertram with bow let hope that amusement will not be entirely on side of performer since hard work be not exclusive share of spectator oh law mr bertram quite mistake a to amusement can assure will be greatest treat to mr ferrars must admit that hard work be not just sort young fellow get soon tired of be now think so because can not see behind scene mr jennings interposed william price assuming air of solemnity imagine cousin must care to have command of troupe of actor such a be for long together have conception of what amount of trouble give mean unruly one mr jennings highly appreciated allusion supposed word to contain tapping william on arm with fan exclaimed ay ay mr price understand mr bertram will have whip hand by by then can get of own back be sure mr bertram be excellent stage manager said mr ferrars who have not heard passed judged by mr price puzzled look mr jennings laughter that be time to intervene can not think how have be able to work up charade be ready for audience within so short time can only be proved that charade be sufficiently worked up when see whether audience be sufficiently perplexed by said bingley if guess word at once will feel that have utterly failed overestimate intellect dear bingley said host a mr jennings say charade be sport to a natural consequence be presumably death to nonsense darcy exclaimed bingley in midst of storm of laughing protest evoked by remark think of acting splendid mise en scene if heart fails within besides can always applaud nowadays be fashion to admire loudest what one understands least darcy led way to dining room with mr jennings a lady of party out numbered gentleman william price found that fell to lot to escort miss darcy miss bennet former seeing stepped on for pace two in advance kitty a took arm murmured how discouraging darcy be always manages to make one feel that despises thing be doing william glanced to see if mr darcy sister have heard rejoined must hardly have thought so be only teasing fancy know be speaking to mr bingley probably understand other particularly well still said kitty must say like sort of teasing be very provoking to be continually laughed at for one best friend to do make worse miss bennet be afraid ca agree with there one can put up with anything from one best friend at event with thing one must not stand for moment from anyone else wonder if miss darcy feel too added a settled into place at table be not quite sure replied georgiana when question have be explained to think that ridicule may be harder to bear from friend than from uninterested person merely because one feel ought to know best what be painful to one if be of painful kind on other hand one may always feel sure that real friend have intention of saying anything of sort must not be much good to cried kitty find be too late when have already be very much vexed with anyone to remember that really did not mean to vex of course be not much consolation when blow have be already dealt said georgiana musingly meant that when one have reason to believe unkind motive exists behind anything one friend say then one be not expecting to be hurt kitty did not want to seem inclined to pursue subject william price after moment pause said imagine that mean by motive general feeling of goodwill in friend mind towards must doubt if people really have distinct motive for little thing do say at event must have difficulty in defining one perhaps miss darcy be student of motif perhaps own action be determined by clear purpose mine oh dear said georgiana looking up at down again with bright blush think be rather interesting to speculate upon other people motif to wonder what hidden impulse make do certain thing seem hard to account for a to myself oh never understand own motif always know what be do understand yours well yes think so not that have ever troubled much about on general principle think always do thing try to do either because want to very much because be matter of professional duty then be decidedly to be congratulated mr price said georgiana smiling must mean most people must think fortunate if have two such burning light to guide suppose way be so clear that need to seek further motif a to why want to do thing so much for instance of course not promptly replied william must be looking back how must one ever steer ship unless one kept one eye fixed on course ahead if suspect there be rock must avoid must be waste of time wondering how came to be where be see that too do not yes see what mean replied georgiana be afraid have not learnt to steer ship quite so well perhaps have too many light be confusing william began to reply be interrupted by kitty tired of conversation in have share mr price do know what have done refused lobster sauce what can be thinking of turbot will not be half so nice without william made proper apology to bearer of lobster sauce who returned at kitty summons be pacified by mr price applying to dinner entering heartily into reminiscence of hers at dinner party at mr knightley when have met for first time when there have also strange coincidence be turbot for dinner georgiana be glad to sit for while in silent thought mr price suggestion that life be governed by distinct purpose appeared sadly wide of mark did not mistake have made in past show that be merely drifting lamentably weak having sound judgment of own whereas people like kitty who have given up to guidance of definite aspiration mr price too who have owned what light be steering by must not soon be in safe harbour seemed so georgiana almost envied of delightful security for of late have allowed to wonder if such height of happiness must ever be attainable by longing have sometimes crept over since have known liked mr price that might meet someone who must be to what be to kitty throughout remainder of dinner did not have further conversation with william price though occasionally appealed to by one other of to give opinion upon point at issue generally connected with charade with mr ferrars who sat on other side enjoyed quiet little talk before left table elinor inquired casually whether mr bertram be nice whether have found pleasant yes think so think like very much replied georgiana who until moment have not formed estimate of be very lively have taken immense deal of trouble about charade mr bingley know considers excellent shot be quite adequate description of in few word said elinor wondered what thought of a know have not met before be not much like cousin be indeed responded georgiana speaking with more animation must imagine greater contrast one can see at glance how different life profession have be how different character must be must be interested to hear said elinor in low tone with smile what take to be chief point of unlikeness in character if be not sitting too near to one of to tell georgiana smiled shook head must not very well be sure can read face a well a anybody understand said elinor that one mentioned first be heir to title large estate believe so replied georgiana other be fortunate in needing title large estate to recommend elinor needed nothing further to convince that mr jennings suspicion a far a georgiana be concerned be perfectly groundless what bingleys might be desiring of mr bertram aiming at be matter certainly onlooker must hardly help thinking of probability of match with handsome wealthy young man on one side girl of georgiana beauty accomplishment high birth on other chapter xviii went well dinner came to end actor retired to dress six

good night interspersed with many complimentary remark to actor william price have hurried back to room have called green room to search for cherished ornament of kitty have mislaid so escaped from congratulation to in case mr jennings must have given double edge kitty contrived to avert share by murmuring a embraced guest will come see to morrow nevertheless mr jennings be not to be entirely baulked of intention long conversation between mr bertram miss darcy have attracted notice so in wishing tom bertram good night managed to add few word felicitating upon success in field besides of drama laughing heartily at look of blank astonishment passed on a never felt quite a well able to approach miss darcy on subject a other people contented with sly glance remarking well miss darcy what delightful evening have be have not heard last of charade yet for many long day have why pleasantest part of be still to come fancy georgiana succeeded in avoiding reply supposed allusion be to kitty always preferred not to understand mr jennings possible visitor directly afterwards went away lady retired gentleman sitting up for time longer chapter xix be impossible for kitty georgiana to think of anything else when first awoke next morning than that be concluding day of william price visit twenty four hour more must be on point of departure twenty four short hour be be left for event of such prodigious importance georgiana knew of friend half formed hope that acting in last scene of charade might have afforded opening for reality kitty have not be little chagrined at william

awaited shortly after breakfast for mr darcy be so barbarous a to propose taking gentleman to see farm horse to actually agreed bingley only stipulating that must return in good time a have made arrangement to ride with damp muddy state of ground must not permit of lady accompanying even most venturesome when have set out kitty found that there be nothing for to do until return to hurry to rectory in search of consolation mr jennings be always ready to offer mr darcy found opportunity during morning for little quiet talk with sister jane so thoroughly liked respected mr price that be delighted to find elizabeth in agreement with related many instance of sterling common sense good taste amiable disposition have have time during longer acquaintance to meet with elizabeth hazarded suggestion a to presumed intention towards kitty that however earnest may be be possible that did not mean to make offer at present for circumstance might not permit of be still young prospect might not be assured enough to warrant in taking wife jane be not inclined to think that such obstacle stood in way cousin have told that have saved considerable sum of money that brother now being out in world family be no longer dependent on help besides knew must be made commander by end of year after that be only matter of short time to officer of experience especially if little interest must be exercised before obtained ship of own bingley have heard of from several person in london agreed that there be not more promising young lieutenant in service be day of quick promotion career so far gave rise to expectation that must be left behind elizabeth heard with pleasure must not give utterance to solitary regret that kitty must have be fated to fall in love with man who in event of marriage must be obliged to spend greater part of year away from gentleman have returned from walk by twelve o'clock fitzwilliam two cousin waited near front door to watch bingley miss darcy starting for ride hardly have horse moved off colonel fitzwilliam be considering what guest might like to do next when tom bertram seized william by arm with word of apology to colonel carried off to distant patch want to speak to william began with abruptness miss bennet will be popping out on if take chance want to know did happen to hear what that gossiping old woman mr jenkins what ever be called said to last night just a be leaving certainly did not hear anything particular be afraid one never doe pay much attention to mr jennings returned william then let tell have impertinence to give broadest hint ever have in life to give if please be paying court to miss darcy never be more astounded forget exactly what said made quite clear yes one remark do recollect something about 'charming future lady bertram good heaven exclaimed william what unpardonable insolence have never heard anything more outrageously offensive be hope hope tom miss darcy did not hear of be nowhere near at time imagine feeling william never having dreamed of such thing then having suddenly brandished in face a be by odiously vulgar woman be disagreeable certainly be thinking more of miss darcy feeling a from what know of can conceive nothing must be more repugnant to than to have subject bandied about in jest well may make mind easy for be certainly not listening be not what wanted to say of course be complete surprise to once have be put into head must not help thinking of indeed have be pondering over ever since have come to conclusion that must not be at bad thing what be exclaimed william do expect to listen to with patience tom when not three week ago be sighing over miss thorpe regretted parent objection to declaring there be not such girl in world need not be so hasty william talk a if be already on knee to miss darcy when have intention towards idea have simply be put into head by circumstance naturally must think out idea have be put into head by foolish chattering old woman if call circumstance coming from quarter be not worth taking seriously for instant know so much about that be true have business to say there be reason in what said miss darcy must make admirable lady bertram imagine father be satisfaction if must present girl to a daughter good god tom exclaimed william tearing arm away cold blooded way in talk be more than one can bear weighing one girl against a if be question of relative merit must throw handkerchief to be not much of compliment to miss darcy to admit that never thought whether have attraction not until mr jennings suggested to be not considering paying compliment to miss darcy see why must get so hot rejoined cousin merely wanted to talk out with quietly ask opinion be perfectly useless if will fly into passion at word well what do want opinion about demanded william trying to speak in ordinary tone tom be easily placated really wanted to be talking so resumed difficulty be that be more le involved with isabella of course be perfectly free nothing have passed between that must construe into engagement have to promise parent that at same time practically promised must do anything until have seen again expect to do in january now for sake of connection must be better for to break off entirely with thorpe by degree know like isabella very much be family that one stick at while darcys be unexceptionable in way be devilishly fine girl with far more style about than miss darcy must admit that think that two lady be not to be mentioned in same breath with other said william with difficulty restraining indignation think not be what wanted to arrive at well perhaps be right though always thought needlessly prejudiced against poor isabella certainly feel more more advantage of such alliance a on worldly side be for disposition fancy that of old friend must suit best tom said william turning to face cousin fully can not think what posse to talk in detestable way can not feel how horrible be if care for miss thorpe can not think of marrying girl meet directly after leaving have only known for week whereas if think for one moment of miss darcy with feeling man ought to have if marriage be in mind how can possibly go on making comparison between miss thorpe way be abominable treatment of one of dear william be going to other extreme just now told not to take anything mr jennings said seriously yet be assuming to be in most sober earnest round when want be to give matter consideration deserves miss darcy be very charming be quite heart whole where be concerned at present so doubt be a regard everything must have beginning if such difficulty be to be put in way of marrying isabella must hardly do better than at rate be worth thinking of will go home see how thing develop in course of week can always come over again know be not end of earth william broke from cousin with impatient gesture hurried away to part of ground mr bertram looked after in surprise shrugged shoulder returned to house to establish by fireside with newspaper many inquiry be made for mr price throughout afternoon to mr bertram must only say that have seen last in garden be not until nearly dinner time that reappeared with heated wearied look confessed to having walked too far missed way in park kitty have be on verge of tear a hour of absence went on even georgiana have begun to look grave explanation revived drooping spirit to great extent anyone might lose way in large park nearly ten mile round on dark foggy afternoon path looked alike stream have so many winding be quite evident that unlucky circumstance alone have caused delay consideration most satisfactory glance at mirror when be dressed for ball renewed kitty bright hope for evening wished lydia must see now how must regimental ball however smart gay compare with splendour importance of occasion at house a have always foreseen be exactly right for ball arrangement space detail be superior to at mr knightley house dress have be given to by elizabeth be even prettier than one have worn in london there seemed to be number of pleasant partner including several officer though gentleman be not person of such consideration to kitty a formerly having now decided that naval uniform be far handsomer than military only remained for mr price to ask for hand in first two dance gentleman of house be so long in appearing that be in utmost terror lest must be obliged to give away before arrived at last among crowd of other men entering room discerned approached passing close to georgiana who be just being led into ball room by neighbour old friend came straight to where kitty stood by mr bingley side how delightful to hear word spoken in own friendly way with own charming smile well miss bennet hope may have honour of two dance if be not too late kitty very joyously accompanied to place next to georgiana partner in set with equal joy made engagement for other dance later in evening chapter xx room filled ball proceeded many present who be frequent visitor to pemberley nevertheless felt that noble room have never before be setting for more brilliant scene mr darcy received innumerable congratulation upon having at last delighted neighbourhood by permitting house to be seen to such advantage not having altogether looked forward to evening surprised by discovering how much with elizabeth at side must enjoy own pleasure in entertaining guest have not previously done on so large scale also pleasure of others who be important to elizabeth georgiana bingleys georgiana in particular watched with affectionate appreciation a moved through crowd handsome stately generally grave occasionally lighting up into shy animation far more admired than knew cared about william price have be dancing for second time with kitty be sitting in corridor on chair placed below cluster of candle in sconce projecting from wall when one of candle guttered few drop of hot wax fell on edge of kitty chair narrowly escaping gown with exclamation of annoyance sprang up withdrawing quickly from post of danger looking above perceived that mischief be caused by candle having loosened in socket fallen little to one side william immediately proposed that must move to other seat must summon servant to replace candle kitty be in wild excitable mood must pay heed laughing calling out that must put right in moment sprang upon chair reaching a high a must to dismay of onlooker thrust hand into midst of candle in order to grasp offending one do pray miss bennet come down exclaimed william several other person joined entreaty to try to do will set dress on fire sleeve be so dangerously near do let help down lest fall hurt mr jennings who have be observing couple during dance have followed at little distance now arrived in time to hear kitty say thank mr price have already done be well gown be quite safe see looking down at with gay triumphant smile gave hand with assistance jumped to ground adding now be that not skilful of if have waited to discus must never have let attend to though be by far best must have tried to prevent running such risk certainly replied william quieter tone be lost in noisy interposition of mr jennings oh dear miss bennet now how very naughty of have given poor mr price quite fright ah mr price be sad girl fear be glad to see petruchio be beginning early to learn to keep in better order rehearsing in charade will come in useful now wo will warrant katherine will be just a apt pupil a other old lady laughed heartily at kitty blush at william blank uncomfortable look there dear wo disturb longer only hope will come talk to whenever feel inclined kitty who have resumed seat be first to break awkward silence followed speech mr jennings be great talker be not said with laugh seems able to think of nothing charade must like to make one believe that acting be something wonderful yes said william after pause have not sat down remained standing with disconcerted air twisting kitty fan about in hand be very complimentary wonder if whether spectator be equally impressed oh think be said kitty eagerly even darcy said word in favour of know be very hard to get sort of praise out of mr mr ferrars be quite delighted sister too mr darcy said several time how much liked thought so clever of mr bertram to have arranged that scene looked anxiously at william face cleared somewhat did not sit down again replied so absentmindedly to few more remark made by kitty when sound of music reached be quite ready to go walked beside to ball room thinking petulantly that mr jennings have spoilt everything by coming just then saying what have that one liked to be hurried must be expected to declare in crowd that perhaps be vexed at having word taken out of mouth a be altogether incident be thoroughly annoying for next dance saw invite georgiana be already engaged to mr bertram did not ask anyone else stood about watching various people occasionally exchanging few word with colonel fitzwilliam mr bingley who be sitting down together during set kitty must see from where be that be trying to induce to find partner laughingly resisted persuasion continued to walk about room until dance be over after stationed within short distance of miss darcy chair when suitable interval have elapsed went up to again made request miss darcy acceded readily mr bertram left with by mean a much readiness have scarcely moved away when william began miss darcy must mind not standing up for one be wondering whether must be so kind a to show of picture in gallery upstairs mr darcy be speaking of at dinner know time be getting very short must be sorry to go away without having seen with greatest pleasure returned georgiana indeed will be glad not to dance more at present must have made brother show picture a be far better judge than be may find up there a sometimes take friend round on occasion picture gallery however proved to be empty of visitor strolled through georgiana pointing out be considered to be best painting william passed by rather hurriedly looking chiefly at family portrait georgiana observing conducted to end of gallery where brother likeness hung william studied for instant glancing at companion a if trying to trace resemblance while georgiana told date of picture repeated that wished have come up before a must have seen others so much better in daylight noticed that william hardly seemed to take in what said be not altogether surprised when turned suddenly to said with scarcely concealed agitation miss darcy be very kind at moment can not think of picture will let speak to for moment have something important to say be going to tell have proposed to kitty flashed through georgiana mind for one instant rush of feeling almost overwhelmed controlling a well a must said aloud certainly mr price do say anything wish will not sit down will do same indicated two chair opposite portrait seated in one william remained standing looking at with deep earnest gaze while tightly clasped hand together that did not seem to have heard word miss darcy must forgive presumption be bad beginning to ask for forgiveness know one better that be not for to speak to at present a must speak must have waited till position till be justified circumstance have made impossible to go away wait in utter uncertainty for unknown future ask anything a yet only hearing only that will let tell how truly devotedly love have loved from first moment of seeing dreadful misgiving have passed over georgiana at beginning of speech only consternation kept silent till close sprang up in horror dismay must scarcely find expression exclaimed mr price to say such word to what can mean what can anything mean be horrible mistake miss darcy indeed be mistake broke in william eagerly earnestly be so distressed beg ask to give definite reply though can guess what perfect joy must be to have one word of hope however slight from lip will wait try to earn right to ask for more next year position will have improved brother will not perhaps think quite out of question nay implore dearest miss darcy to hear only once did not mean to trouble so soon must not bear to go so far away with prospect of seeing again knowing that others might be near others far more eligible desirable than must understand be sure if only knew tithe of what felt mr price said georgiana signing to with hand to stop standing erect before insist that will cease will hear more of can not be in right mind at event will not find so destitute of sense of honour a think paused choked with emotion at thought of kitty destitute of honour when know miss darcy think purest loveliest best of creature forgive if have offended only tell how may correct do wrong in speaking to first will do wish must not grieve for world with great effort georgiana collected sufficiently to reply profession of yours amaze horrify can not tell whether be more painful to if have to regard a true than if a at present seem hypocritical in case be absolutely inexplicable that must use such language to who for month past have be recognized by friend a admirer of friend miss bennet word be out georgiana felt hot with shame a uttered conscious that even with need for openness on terrible occasion betraying of friend hope to object of be shocking thing be so overcome a to be unable to look at william price horror struck face miss bennet be possible that thought be paying attention to miss bennet miss darcy can not be serious be too frightful never thought of doing so never dreamed of expecting if did expect miss bennet be always gay cheerful be charming girl a be excellent companion a for anything more surely must not have be deceived whoever else be when alone be subject of desire hope georgiana shrank from task of answering such appeal took hold of part of sentence to reply to did expect mr price received enough at event to mislead most cruelly have thought of one of meeting again here for month past everything have happened in last week have strengthened in belief in attachment can not deny continued georgiana indignation rising that constant association delight in society have given rise to expectation in mind of friend if dispute existence in own said william can not deny that for have proof of evening in remark dropped by mr jennings though disturbed momentarily dismissed from mind a knew be kind of person whose chief delight lie in teasing young people about other thought miss bennet other friend be too sensible to be continually entertaining such fancy fancy repeated georgiana warmly poor friend be completely wrapped up heart soul in what designate a fancy indeed be very sorry said william looking utterly downcast very grieved ashamed if have caused miss bennet moment uneasiness though can hardly think that others mr bingley mr darcy in particular have so completely failed to perceive be useless to enter into exact degree of misunderstanding at least have be a thoroughly blind a man must wish to be what can do miss darcy to prove to innocence if have occasioned unfortunate error have be through ignorance thoughtlessness nothing more be there one thing incident must tell of by may have be inadvertently misled georgiana idea be so confused be altogether so agitated that at moment felt a if must never be able to collect sufficiently to marshal evidence now be required luckily a tried to think one episode darted into memory have frequently be discussed between kitty have seemed to bear naturally one interpretation painful though be to bring such matter into dispute forced for kitty sake to say did not tell mr knightley after ball took place at house that have never enjoyed evening more that there be one person whose presence there have be everything to did not give to understand that meant miss bennet distress surprise be clearly shown on william countenance began to speak hesitated broke off then resumed know what mean be too bewildering surely mr knightley did not tell that never spoke thought of miss bennet in connection except have pleasant dance with might not have existed for that evening recollect telling mr knightley what delightful evening have have be who suggested that one person presence have contributed more to than other must hing agree with a thought have noticed instant intense admiration of be so evident to that supposed be to others thought of one else when mr bingley invited to stay with be doubtful if must accept directly said that lived in same neighbourhood determined that nothing must prevent coming do recollect anything else miss darcy meeting at hursts captain wentworth saying that believed sailor to be fickle made so uneasy until persuaded that did not mean oh shake head continue to misbelieve entreat in last few day if event have happened to throw more with miss bennet than with have not be doing wish implore to be convinced of to accept assurance of unswerving loyalty devotion towards be impossible for georgiana not to be moved by word though have tried to check passionate flow have remained where be leaning on chair solely because trembling limb must hardly support now however summoning courage strengthening with thought of kitty spoke in tolerably firm voice mr price must believe that unhappy mistake have be made unintentionally since say so wretchedness have caused will not be so easily cleared away assurance of loyalty must not be made to owe to miss bennet only must get further for be interrupted by william with vehemence exceeding that have shown before miss bennet except a friend a lady for whom have great liking respect miss bennet be nothing to never must be oh miss darcy yet understand can forget miss bennet for one moment tell if apart from that there must be slightest hope for at future time least chance of having faith in to enable to strive to win a long to do have made error saw before have finished sentence forget miss bennet repeated georgiana with flash of angry pride a walked away from think understand mr price when have desired friend happiness so long can not lightly see thrown away never never must seek for own if be to be at expense of hers william on hearing made quick pace forward to intercept turning so that stood face to face asked in quieter not le ardent tone only one word more miss darcy forgive for what said tell spoke of happiness did mean that might be happiness to if be cleared up did mean might be able to make happy that there be possibility of ever coming to feel for even smallest part of what feel for georgiana trembling almost weeping anger not subsided other sensation surging strongly up brought to look for one moment into eye of glowing entreaty bent upon hers with almost sob broke away from exclaiming be of use to ask talk to in way must not will not listen can not bear fairly ran out of gallery william stood stunned motionless for minute at last roused with deep sigh from contemplation of ruined hope strove to think of what ought to do next while desiring nothing so much a solitude quiet remembered that georgiana must not have gone straight back to ball room for two of to be absent must give rise to remark to protect georgiana be instinct gave ray of satisfaction in midst of perplexity misery to remind that though have refused love now knew of existence misapprehension there might be a to past must perceive what influence guided action in future slowly descended stair so bewildered still a scarcely to be conscious of what be going on around rehearsing conversation thinking too late of thing might have said must perhaps have be of service to cause crowd of person be streaming into hall from ball room second dance since georgiana went upstairs having just ended supper being now talked of mingled with rest presently manoeuvred into place near mr bingley who be now sitting with mr ferrars greeted with pleasant smile beyond casual inquiry a to whether have seen kitty asked question before long found introduced to young lady directed to find place for at one of supper table what talked of did not know rest of evening passed in same dreamlike manner in desire to attract special attention chatted laughed danced be persuaded that did so a gaily a before must not keep thought from wandering to georgiana whom have seen returning looking very pale about quarter of hour after have parted to kitty whose eye continually anxiously sought be far more painful for to see than georgiana whom of course held blameless even for hard word kitty vaguely felt to be in part responsible for whole trouble though bitterly reproaching for folly blindness must not bring to go near to speak to dance with again when such construction have be put upon previous intercourse angry at pain be giving driven to despair at sight of georgiana pale cheek found length of evening almost unendurable only relief obtained be in going to mr bingley asking to fix a early a possible hour for start on following morning for must be necessary for cousin to be well on long journey towards mansfield by afternoon have be already arranged that three gentleman must return to desborough independently of mr miss bingley who be to remain at pemberley for day two to recover from fatigue of ball mr bingley good naturedly agreed judging that young people have decided that must be better to make adieu night before rather than come down early to painful scene of parting at prosaic breakfast table so went away to consult darcy send out order to stable done william felt more comfortable inaction be intolerable to must have removed from house at once if must have done so since to relieve her of presence have become embarrassing distasteful to be only thing must now do for georgiana have a anticipated sought refuge of own room when fled from gallery even there old habit of self command consideration for others prevailed over longing to give way to grief distress of mind knew must not allow luxury of burst of tear even little quiet thought in order to realize what have occurred decide what if anything must say to kitty there be time for there must be plenty of opportunity soon to readjust view of recent event that meant to kitty shaken unnerved by shock of william price declaration georgiana shrank from immediately facing consequence must only take few moment in to compose endeavour to smooth away trace of emotion that must see again be dreadful thought must be far worse ordeal to have to encounter kitty inquiry lamentation on following day surprise of elizabeth jane georgiana dared not let think of when horrible evening be not yet over hastily bathed face opening window wide leaned out for few minute for night air to cool throbbing temple went down at last feeling a if countenance must betray to observer secret of what have happened took refuge at once by side of elizabeth who made room for with smile did not fail to notice aspect a soon a be at liberty asked georgiana if be very tired took care that be provided with refreshment georgiana owned to good deal of fatigue declared that must sleep off elizabeth who thought lassitude partly attributable to worry about kitty told that might slip away to bed a soon a chose that kitty must not come into room for one of long conversation must wait till to morrow to talk over ball poor georgiana assented with grateful glance have difficulty in restraining tear a thought how little elizabeth dreamt that interview with kitty must be thing to be dreaded not welcomed after supper must not for fear of making conspicuous avoid one two invitation to dance be truly glad when colonel fitzwilliam on hint from elizabeth approached said let take to seat in library georgiana fear be tired will be able to rest quietly there not say one word to unless please be old enough friend for must think there be few person in large library at one end of table have be set out where servant dispensed tea coffee during evening cousin placed on leather covered couch near fire at opposite end true to undertaking colonel fitzwilliam remained silent after have established cousin in comfort screened blaze from face after few minute georgiana roused thinking anything better than being left to own reflection suddenly recollecting thing that have intended to tell elizabeth have be able to see alone during day deciding that there must be harm in communicating to colonel fitzwilliam mentioned having learnt fact of mr bertram acquaintance with miss crawford asked if cousin happened to know admitted informed expressed interest a have not discussed with mr bertram georgiana therefore ventured to give mr bertram description of pointed out rather timidly that seemed to agree entirely with what already knew have heard yes said colonel fitzwilliam thoughtfully after pause added be glad spoke so well of glad have advocate in for a may have gathered from what dropped with regard to brother must not be surprising if bertram family be little prejudiced against crawford be glad that at least have manliness to award blame only where blame be due georgiana listened attentively half expecting that cousin must go on to explain nature of prejudice against crawford have clearly done miss crawford so much harm did not so after little hazarded remark did not seem to know anything about of late year so thought useless to ask about marriage be right must have be useless said colonel elizabeth know trouble good deal about not having heard particular doubtless world will be informed in good time when there be news one may expect will penetrate even to derbyshire smiled a spoke be not cheerful smile voice have ring of something very like bitterness georgiana heart ached for felt that never before have known what disappointment must be colonel fitzwilliam talked of other thing until be interrupted by tom bertram who came hurrying in search of to ask miss darcy to dance with again miss darcy so sorry be tired positively must allow just two people be beginning to go actually know when happens ball always begin to lose of spirit besides who know when will have such delightful evening a again have be telling mr mr bingley can never sufficiently thank for having brought here georgiana suffered to lead to dance to go on talking for be quite unequal to arguing with at conclusion of two dance elizabeth who have be watching came up asked if must not like to retire at once fortified by permission georgiana turned to say good night to partner whose protest against disappearance be a strong a polite tom bertram must make why miss darcy if remove ball may a well break up be really cruel to make say good night when be good bye a well be do start so early to morrow be very sorry said georgiana with effort at cordiality seemed expected of do indeed wild idea of cousin fancy that will take day to get to mansfield even going round desborough to meet curricle will not mr bingley have just informed that william wish to start not moment later than eight lady fear be not likely to be on scene at unearthly hour indeed said elizabeth after such dissipation a charade ball will be remarkable if of be able to leave room for week realize what quiet people be here ordinarily mr bertram chatted on under cover of georgiana managed to say brief adieu glide away must avoid seeing mr price again be standing by foot of stair seemed to be watching for there be escape head be averted foot placed on lowest step when started forward not offering to shake hand in low voice look of intense earnestness said may say good bye to miss darcy georgiana hardly knew if good bye mr price be audible bowed stepped back eye following a went up stair chapter xxi in gloom of following morning at hour seemed exceptionally cheerless by reason of mist fine rain prevailed mr bingley chaise drove round to front entrance of pemberley kitty who after night of weeping wretchedness have fallen into doze be aroused by sound of movement voice when peeped through curtain be too late for anything heartrending glimpse of skirt of william price great coat a stepped into carriage door be shut darcy fitzwilliam waved farewell horse moved off at brisk trot kitty watched listened to a long a must then flung on bed in paroxysm of grief though william avoidance of during latter part of previous evening strange altered look embarrassed way of saying good night have undermined hope to extent that have be all night facing terrible desolation caused by thought if doe not care for after yet have not actually given up in despair until moment of hearing leave house note message might have arrived might still arrive since parting from kitty have not be able to quell horrible fear that be over indication have be so favourable have completely changed since mr jennings have uttered foolish remark in vain have tried to reinstate old relation with william price what must mean time put question to herself gave way afresh to unrestrained tear weakened by fatigue emotion be totally incapable of following out train of thought conjecture have longed to hasten to georgiana night before to pour out heart in appeal for support georgiana have never failed to give elizabeth have checked in intention poor kitty unable to bear pain alone with degree of courage have worked into deplorable condition by time sister arrived at door in morning elizabeth jane have naturally surmised something of state of thing a regarded kitty be not difficult for anyone acquainted with previous development of affair to perceive william price have not fulfilled expectation have be formed of elizabeth accounted for georgiana evident unhappiness by concluding that have become aware that must be case william price have looked much a usual up to last elizabeth suspected that there have be elucidation between georgiana through mr jennings hardly knew how much to blame there be time to talk matter over with jane for felt a soon a be up that immediate visit must be to chief sufferer to comfort sustain if possible to shield from consequence of own error kitty must not admit at first when at length elizabeth persuaded to do so be distressed to see what ravage shock of disappointment hour of weeping have wrought kitty tear broke out anew sense of elizabeth affection companionship somewhat soothed when must speak more coherently begged to see georgiana who must perhaps tell thing who must be able to explain elizabeth must not permit for saw that kitty be in fit state to talk over trouble promised early opportunity of doing so having induced to swallow food cordial soon have satisfaction of seeing fall asleep precautionary measure be fully justified in course of next forty eight hour during time kitty remained really ill attack of strong hysteria alternating with weakness of extreme exhaustion care be lavished on by two sister by georgiana by elizabeth maid naturally anything like rational discussion of cause of illness be out of question indeed kitty after once asking if mr price have left message for spoken of returning at future time receiving negative answer seemed after giving way to torrent of tear unable unwilling to puzzle matter out further georgiana did not escape inquiry speculation of elizabeth jane when descended from room morning after ball at hour little later than usual one to take place in family circle have regained complete control of herself declared entirely refreshed beyond little heaviness of eye paleness of cheek naturally attributable to fatigue of last two day there be nothing in aspect to cause remark one guessed at sense of guilt filled heart when saw what grief disappointment have done for kitty at deep compunction almost unendurable self reproach assailed when others discussed strange defection professed unable to account for curious change in attitude towards kitty change several people have noticed last hour of ball elizabeth jane asked if be at prepared for whether anything have occurred to make suspect that mr price must not propose marriage to kitty after question be hard trial to georgiana for must not bear to be other than straightforward for multitude of reason must not divulge true explanation must only say in low troubled voice with a few word a possible that have learnt in course of evening that expectation be mistaken one that feared kitty must take very much to heart seeing unhappiness on friend two lady forbore to tease with further inquiry though jane still felt that georgiana must have thrown more light on mystery have cared in hearing continually lamented failure of everything for poor kitty who have fallen a be between two stool regrettable ending to pleasant time fickleness of young men rather unfortunate complication arose through not knowing own mind georgiana have to listen to in silence though conscious that last be not accusation must fairly be brought against william price elizabeth more rational way of accounting for thing be not much better when said that did not think mr price guilty of more than thoughtlessness be certainly pity that have not be able to perceive earlier extent of kitty feeling for a doubt when have at last become aware of realized what elizabeth have already surmised to be in mind namely that roving life did not warrant in thinking about matrimony at present georgiana thought might venture to say here william price have indeed expressed great sorrow to on finding that have be cause of disappointment to kitty even went so far into dangerous field of explanation a to add that have have suspicion of until surprised by chance word of raillery from mr jennings be pleased to see that news partly rehabilitated in mind of elizabeth if not of jane for fear of betraying more than ought went away wondering why must be glad for not to be misjudged when really ought to be only thinking of how wrongly have behaved hour of enlightenment for kitty must not be long postponed by third day be well enough to sit up in large chair in own room on being visited by georgiana begged to stay for time to fasten door when assured of freedom from interruption seized friend hand made sit close beside implored to relate everything must must throw light on mr price changed conduct hasty departure georgiana nerved to reply for first few minute kitty be talking cry incessantly pouring out pent up grief of last few day so that georgiana have great difficulty in calming dreaded effect of revelation about to be made dear kitty remonstrated georgiana must not cry must be more composed elizabeth will not let stay with do try to be brave think whether be right to give way so much will make ill again know anyone must be ill after what have be through lamented kitty will never be happy again why doe not care for did tell why not georgiana what have done what have mr jennings done something must have happened to offend for changed in one minute believe anything happened to offend kitty returned georgiana a have gone away now did not do what thought must do be not best to assume that doe not care in way hoped for try to forget about not mind too much dear kitty be deeply grieved for have be fault more than anyone be right to reproach can never forgive for having led into mistake be not answering georgiana cried kitty with petulance of invalid of course know doe not care have gone away want to know why have gone if be not for anything have done might come back georgiana be silent held down shrank still from telling kitty that must not come back kitty began again impatiently be foolish of to talk about reproaching be not more fault than anyone else be not so much a mr jennings if spoke to about at must have said something have given hint did talk to georgiana have not told that yet georgiana gave up what hope have have of concealing from kitty what must make disappointment far more thorough crushing a gently a possible managed to convey fact of william confession of attachment to herself be obliged to say several time in language of unmistakable clearness before kitty must grasp meaning even then a sat crouched on ground face averted cheek burning with shame kitty who have drawn hand away gazed at in mingled horror incredulity in course of three day notion that miss kitty bennet be not object of william price preference have at length penetrated mind of young lady that friend must be chosen one be thing altogether past comprehension first idea occurred to be that there must have be treachery to herself somewhere kitty change of mood lately have be punctuated by burst of tear be exception to rule though be now tear of mortification first angry impulse be to pour out word of blame accusing georgiana of not being satisfied with attention of mr bertram requiring of cousin too georgiana disdained to reply to taunt needed patience tenderness to persuade kitty out of bitter frame of mind to endeavour to heal wound to poor girl vanity have indeed through be more deeply involved than affection little though realized combined with love of importance encouragement given by friend have carried on wave of excitement through past month have helped to fix hope more firmly on william price than knowledge of character real congeniality in nature must have done must not be aware of there be immediate comprehension to make disappointment le acute certainly be consoling to feel that everyone else must have be to blame that everybody have be equally deceived that even georgiana have be taken by surprise be now heaping upon severest reproach while implored be forgiveness not kitty discerned in puzzled way for having received mr price proposal for having helped to foster deception have reacted so cruelly upon friend above must have be relief having discovered that mr price must have acted atrociously to say so more kitty thought of more resented conduct georgiana must not admit must only allow that be utterly inexplicable that must not judge fairly of mr price not being able to see point of view that if be clear to be sure that must be found to have acted honestly way through kitty immediately suspected that georgiana have be won round to said point of view began to question closely a to what have passed between georgiana indignantly repudiated suggestion assured kitty in manner forbade further discussion that have decidedly refused mr price refused even to listen to have not slightest expectation of ever seeing hearing from again added that have refrained from telling elizabeth of others about mr price offer thought must be best if kitty decided to do same to a have expected kitty willingly agreed nothing in fact must have suited kitty better in circumstance than compact of silence at end of long conversation when georgiana left by far more exhausted in spirit of two have begun to have of sensation of injured heroine be much more satisfactory to consider badly treated to have be jilted to intent purpose than if came to be known that have be time in love with wrong man in case position must be shorn of much of dignity sister sympathy be very acceptable to when jane invited to return with to desborough for time gladly promised to do so knowing that must not at first be at comfortable to remain with one person who knew whole story be therefore arranged that jane miss bingley must defer journey for two day more when be hoped must be quite equal to travelling with only drawback to plan a far a be concerned be miss bingley presence for fortnight at desborough that lady have not troubled to make conjecture with regard to william price departure frankly told jane georgiana that be exactly what have expected at least have never be misled have never supposed mr price to be in love with miss bennet anyone else must not imagine why have persuaded of nothing be clearer than that be young man quite heart whole jane protested georgiana made comment only begging friend privately not to refer to subject in kitty hearing day arrived mr bingley carriage again drove to door three lady took seat in be farewell glance being given towards spot where have last seen william price with going whole episode seemed to be finally closed georgiana turned to re enter house to take up duty of life in one short week seemed to have be robbed of almost brightness have be making unsuccessful struggle against low spirit ever since ill omened day of ball being unable to dismiss have tried hard to account for strange sense of depression of loneliness loss assailed continually be not only sorrow for kitty disappointment regret for own share in be estrangement have arisen between be not vision of kitty so constantly obtruded upon thought of very different person one whose ardent look word insisted on being remembered whose voice seemed to hear again pleading for what dared not give detail of conversation in gallery crowded upon georgiana memory once have made confession to kitty must admit thought must not be denied a have denied hearing came back to with vivid clearness irresistible appeal remembered how have described beginning growth of attachment to looking back over course of acquaintance countless incident stood out to verify have said when longer viewed through kitty illusion one of meeting conversation be seen in true light consolidating friendship giving insight into other character why be joy though indescribably painful one to recall thing to live again through moment spent in gallery georgiana heart answered felt that answer must always have be there though have only just awakened to be joy because everything connected with william price must be joy to nobleness true worth knowledge that cared for be pain because sweet though be to hear what have to tell be disloyalty to friend to listen friend whose life have perhaps be spoilt by mistake how must ever think of being happy a long a friend suffered for despite grief at thought that have lost for ever that have refused love must never know now that loved in return yet georgiana felt that must not have acted differently even have known at moment spoke what be to must not have be so traitorous a to take what kitty longed for from under very eye be glad that kitty did not guess at extent of sacrifice chapter xxii departure of lady for desborough left small party at pemberley for several day previously colonel fitzwilliam have gone with horse to leicestershire good account of hunting prospect have be received from darcys be not however to remain for long alone for arrival of mr grant miss crawford have be fixed for date early in following

listened with greatest interest joined warmly in expression of elizabeth hope that colonel fitzwilliam might yet be made happy although for present there be nothing to be done to try to make miss crawford feel at home comfortable among will confine effort solely to said elizabeth laughingly must be useless a well a dangerous to attempt further matchmaking until know extent of feeling on side for want of knowledge have made singularly unsuccessful lately have not georgiana georgiana assented must not smile for just then only tragical side of unrequited love be turned towards brief letter of thanks have be received by hostess from william price saying be necessary in matter simple sincere closing with message of greeting remembrance to family georgiana cheek burned a handed back be glad to turn away take little niece upon lap while darcy glancing over letter said seems agreeable manly young fellow from what saw of must be sorry to think must treat girl ill girl fancy doe not always keep pace with common sense in case a one speak of said wife a told think kitty be very wisely counselled from first probably not said darcy young man at age in profession be likely to flutter dovecote quite unconsciously there be something so frank pleasing about that one must wish to believe thoroughly estimable georgiana through little one chatter heard word with delight william price must have gained brother good opinion be source of rejoicing even though advantage might now avail nothing miss crawford looked very thin ill when arrived first part of visit passed very quietly spent chief of time in own room descending only to join family at dinner during evening when not talking to elizabeth seemed to find greatest pleasure in listening to georgiana music mr grant watched over with unremitting solicitude by mean treated a sick person evidently desiring that must rouse take interest in thing around make exertion felt equal to tranquility of life exactly suited before many day improvement in health spirit became noticeable be able to take drive in mildest part of day go for short walk through pleasure ground when frost of december came in morning be bright invigorating beauty of country around healthiness of air quiet kindness of host hostess gradually have effect upon troubled mind weakened body colonel fitzwilliam name be barely mentioned lady catherine de bourgh never one morning when georgiana mr grant have walked down to rectory elizabeth be sitting with guest with view of entertaining gave description of charade not omitting energetic part played by mr bertram in organizing mary colour changed little on first hearing name gave attention to recital be not until minute later when silence have fallen between that said suddenly wonder if mr bertram mr price spoke of to mr darcy be aware that knew elizabeth replied that have heard from georgiana of mr price acquaintance with miss crawford of mr bertram have not known subject never having be approached while young men be there thought not said miss crawford after moment pause added colouring slightly have have too much experience of kindness to think that must treat differently if did know whole circumstance nevertheless felt sure that did not made up mind before came here that must not be further indebted to while remained in ignorance day have be expecting to ask question about reason for lady catherine hostility to for be fully entitled to explanation after kind generous way in wrote to fear acknowledged so inadequately stopped emotion weakness depriving momentarily of speech elizabeth who have be endeavouring to check took hold of hand with utmost gentleness begged not to continue not to agitate dear miss crawford be entitled to explanation wish for one be who ought to receive fullest apology of whole family for aunt conduct to cousin told happened that evening after left a told in letter can never be sufficiently ashamed grieved on account of what be subjected to if can forgive let revive subject be painful to miss crawford indicated that wished to be allowed to speak after few moment spent in recovering went on in low voice looking away from elizabeth did not mean to refer to part of least of with whose goodness have almost obliterated from mind mean reason for lady catherine attack must have surmised that there be cause for must have told that have heard something to detriment at event have gathered that something of kind exists be that wish to make clear feel that owe to to tell exactly a far a concern what thing be said about in order that when hear from others may be able to separate true from false for of be true know be unfortunate part of a concluded glanced at elizabeth with attempt at smile though hand be trembling elizabeth attempted to calm reassure there be need for to tell anything if feel equal to effort said think do already know greater part of story can assure that have never believed smallest thing disadvantageous to yourself have heard enough of before mr yates appeared to be convinced that be person injured misjudged that maliciously distorted version of event be poured down aunt ear will be very happy if day will give confidence fear might do harm to talk of just now recall thing in person cared for be involved elizabeth manner be so kind that mary be glad to allow to be persuaded lay back on sofa murmuring yes be right looking at same time tired relieved presently added with little more brightness be glad know that think monster a lady catherine described never thought be monster dear miss crawford assured elizabeth smiling studying guest countenance while own mind be busy miss crawford definitely if laughingly expressed desire to be reinstated in good opinion of mr darcy probably included in object rest of family if so then in spite of abrupt separation at bath in spite of have happened since in london colonel fitzwilliam must be among number elizabeth felt a if be groping in dark for have clue to miss crawford present feeling towards though have not intended to speak of yet be at least opportunity of discovering whether be feeling of goodwill accordingly said a if continuing same train of thought cousin be so glad that have happened to remain behind must therefore attempt to do something even though be little to remedy evil caused by objectionable ferrars mary started changed position elizabeth though not looking directly at must perceive variety of expression pas across face did not answer immediately reply when uttered be very kind of colonel fitzwilliam sounded cold reserved regard a kindness said elizabeth regard for indignation on behalf made anxious to do far more told that bitterly regretted having left that evening after have gone away if have stayed near must have prevented much that followed again mary took time to reply when did to elizabeth surprise be with more than touch of scornfulness colonel fitzwilliam have great power of self effacement have not must have practiced art of disappearing unexpectedly with a little warning a magician in fairy story doe so asked elizabeth whose astonishment increased have not noticed think generally staid sober person who doe thing with even more than usual amount of consideration did not return did not see that evening at aunt oh yes that evening said mary believe did see to carriage be not thinking so much of occasion in london saw once twice talked a if be going to remain then vanished a if earth have swallowed of course did not matter have only to please heard several people remark on elizabeth pondered to gain time inquired did speak a though hoped to see again while be there yes at least thought so sister may have misunderstood may have meant nothing people can hardly be expected to account for sudden freak can replied mary speaking with indifference so marked that companion must not help fancying be assumed elizabeth hesitated no longer be about to speak with intention of telling miss crawford why colonel fitzwilliam have left town so suddenly when door opened to admit mr grant georgiana so that be obliged to postpone communication till future time to leave matter in state more than ever seemed to need elucidation opportunity however be long in coming after half finished talk mary crawford appeared to avoid being alone with hostess came downstairs more gradually began to live almost entirely with rest of family constantly kept close to sister georgiana on various pretext latter did not venture to speak to of colonel fitzwilliam mary be not long in discovering that name of william price be welcome one to young friend seeing that georgiana wished to hear without having to ask mary told knew of youth family past career descanting on charm fine quality of character while georgiana sat in silence downcast eye glowing cheek alone betraying interest subject have for mary guessed at meaning of considerately said word to arouse georgiana self consciousness friendship grew almost unawares knowing how much thought of must have liked to help other be not until nearly week after subject have first be broached that elizabeth found possible to renew then only by deliberately engaging attention of miss crawford in inviting to walk with one morning along high road darcy have driven with mr grant georgiana to distant part of estate have be proposed that other two lady must come to meet on return so miss crawford must take seat in barouche must feel tired be such beautiful morning crisp cold bright mr grant over ruled objection sister be beginning to make assured that brisk walk in such weather must do nothing good elizabeth half suspected that must still find way of avoiding expedition when twelve o'clock arrived miss crawford descended into hall saying smilingly ready see mr darcy think be most obedient patient ever saw at rate will soon be able to send away complete cure hardly think of a patient now still le do think of sending away returned a emerged from house mr darcy must be sadly disappointed if left directly be well enough to do so be always so kind said miss crawford fear visit must come to end soon a be le than fortnight to christmas will probably be having large family party for occasion remark must only be interpreted in one way elizabeth after reiterating hope that miss crawford mr grant must make long stay assuring guest that number at christmas must be same a at present went on almost immediately other day be speaking of colonel fitzwilliam sudden departure from london wanted to tell if be not tiresome to to hear what believe to have be reason for be so anxious must not be misunderstood thought capricious oh mr darcy did not seem to imply be be sure have best of reason for what doe anyhow be business of mine elizabeth must not let subject be dismissed continued very gently have good reason in case hope very much will not dislike mentioning a concern left london because cared for have just heard on what believed to be unimpeachable authority that be engaged to man news be such blow to that must not endure to stay where might possibly meet again there be short pause mary grew crimson uttered exclamation then controlling with effort said in tone of suppressed anger if colonel fitzwilliam told that mr darcy be deceiving must be much better to admit candidly that when saw again in london did not care for a much a have thought instead of making supposed engagement excuse for disappearance elizabeth stood still for moment completely taken aback by version of affair must only exclaim miss crawford oh beg pardon know ought not to speak to who be relative said mary walking on with quick impetuous step pray forgive mr darcy know be true who ever else be not can not guess how hard be to be accused of sending person away before have even approached one to be blamed for causing trouble when one have never be free agent when trouble have reacted upon one self must not blame for world said elizabeth must remember know little of fact nothing at of how appear from other side principal object a have said be to prevent cousin from being misjudged not to make accusation against anyone will not tell little more so that between may clear whole matter up elizabeth be obliged to proceed with utmost caution to speak le openly than must have wished for instinct warned that miss crawford be not yet ready to be guided even sympathized with be far too soon to assume special interest on part in colonel fitzwilliam though last speech have admitted existence of trouble not unconnected to there be really nothing to tell mr darcy said miss crawford what happened be simply succession of negative colonel fitzwilliam reappeared in london showed sign of wishing to renew friendship with sister departed without doing so be not engaged to anyone at time have be since a might have easily found out if have asked right people miss crawford cried elizabeth earnestly have reason to believe perhaps did not ask nearest relative be surely aware involves reproach to be talked of assumed to be fact among friend generally mary evidently found difficult to reply at length said yes know be talked of there be never truth in know be foolish went about great deal with people with elliots let be drawn into circle suppose be pleasant to be feted made much of mr darcy daresay hardly know what be to drift into intimacy amuses occupies time while heart be never in smallest degree think understand said elizabeth gently have be with at bath be difficult to free from association when met again yes brother liked liked be always natural for to be where be be not bound to be not enjoyment how often wished that something must happen to take out of how gladly must not have gone cousin hoped think to have made arrangement with sister be not sure if must be acceptable colonel fitzwilliam did not put to much trouble about returned mary extent of plan be that asked permission to come call then did not do so because have heard in meantime of engagement said elizabeth dear miss crawford must must indeed let convince of sincerity cared for in bath know did for told sister so looked anxiously at mary received glance of reluctant assent one more deeply lamented misfortune separated after can wonder that when meet again remembrance of what happened made diffident a to reception uncertain of place still might hold in esteem be a devoted to a ever only longed for chance of showing oh elizabeth broke off impatiently smiling at ought not to be saying to in cold bald word can not plead case a eloquently a must at least can implore to believe in grant that acted with over caution did not consult own best interest be afraid of precipitating matter by speaking before must divine what felt for that affection be there know positively man who have cared le must have stayed must have pretended indifference must have congratulated on engagement wish have said miss crawford trying to smile though tear filled eye for then must have told of mistake asked why be in such hurry to credit think be in hurry said elizabeth sadly must not have believed if must have helped if must see now must know what real grief can do for man of nature be sorry said miss crawford without much warmth moment later exclaimed yes be bad for man to bring unhappiness on through error suppose never occurred to that by going off in way without word might be leaving same thing for someone else if be man must never accept dismissal except from woman must at least have courage to put fate to touch elizabeth weighed word for instant then turning to look in companion face said want to ask one thing need not reply if wish if cousin have put fate to touch while be in london must have have answer hope of answer that desired mary coloured deeply did not turn eye away from mr darcy be hardly fair be to ask question have never asked said with slight smile be useless to try to keep secret from such friend a suppose be answered by now stopped with one accord beside gate stood looking over long furrow of brown earth in field seeing miss crawford blush remained lip be set rather defiantly when elizabeth turned to said with great earnestness said that colonel fitzwilliam be not coming back before christmas be quite true may not tell to come will hing without permission will not even say that be here will not give leave to come speak for try to atone for mistake unhappiness of past indeed though at moment have hope of know that must ask greater privilege mary laid hand on friend replied affectionately without hesitation mr darcy tell to come thought must suggest something of kind must much rather not must be no kindness to of then a elizabeth still looked questioningly at continued really mean since be to be quite frank did feel very much what thought to be colonel fitzwilliam defection france must tell that account for stupid ill health autumn quite agree none le be confident that have better not meet again be too late when people be getting on towards respectable middle life a be smile do know be near thirtieth birthday have recovered from wound of last summer must be wiser not to risk reopening must be healing think not reopening said elizabeth do think so one can not tell colonel fitzwilliam must have be in love with ideal person mary crawford who never really existed must not have be frightened away so easily from actual one if be to see again there might be fresh disappointment in store doe still think be to marry sir walter elliot know darcy have never told otherwise ah well let be undeceived day perhaps in london will be sent in to dinner together imagine surprise dismay at finding be plain miss crawford not lady elliot will give something to talk about through first three course dear mr darcy look disapprovingly at seriously do think if ever be to meet will be best to do so by accident must hardly bear premeditated encounter a must be here of knowing that be expected to play certain part be better must not come of course if be not sure whether must accept said elizabeth that be suppose be not sure because see circumstance have combined to make colonel fitzwilliam appear in light of half hearted admirer though know from be not yet have experience of own power of recommending be angry with let spoil friendship be so glad now that know will let come stay with sometimes when be away will not time honoured custom have ordained that only one reply will be made to appeal of kind elizabeth duly assured friend that must make difference feeling indeed that a have asked for explanation must not resent miss crawford frankness must like high spirited girl le for glimpse have given of heart there be denying however that end of conversation have be good deal of disappointment mary confession have be so much more than elizabeth have ventured to hope for be melancholy to realize that came a have said too late too late for colonel fitzwilliam to be in way gainer by many time during day succeeding one did elizabeth turn over in mind series of plan to bring two friend together again in way entirely unforeseen by have to be discarded for miss crawford have be so decisive be not certain that colonel must make better use of chance unless must be warned of how have failed previously more elizabeth pondered over event of last year in new light now thrown upon better be able to understand mary point of view to comprehend that be not solely lady catherine insulting behaviour cousin want of self confidence mary own pride recklessness something of three have ruined prospect of happiness mourned sincerely over wreck impossibility of restoring while be so obstinately resolved to remain stranger to one if only fitzwilliam have known when in london that prize lay so near hand that have gained mary love almost without trying to do so merely by watching waiting not submitting to rebuff have given at end of stay in bath opportunity have passed have lost more ground now than might ever recover for elizabeth knew well that mary resentment be real obstacle feeling be unaltered hers have striven perhaps with measure of success to harden into indifference chapter xxiii colonel fitzwilliam wrote that intended staying in leicestershire for christmas going to london for first fortnight of january elizabeth did not fail to make information public accordingly when question of two guest departure be again broached miss crawford be more easily persuaded to prolong visit sister approved of chose to do elizabeth have not thought right to speak to mr grant about conversation with mary that lady have opened subject by expressing to mr darcy great relief that affair with colonel fitzwilliam have gone off attributing mary illness to fretting disappointment mr grant blamed one except elliots who asserted have persistently stood between mary other friend lamented whole series of mishap for be evident that one else have ever gained large measure of sister regard now whole endeavour seemed to be to banish from thought mary meantime be recovering health vigour colour came back to cheek light to eye in manner very gratifying to friend to observe have elizabeth not be so much occupied with plan for visitor preparation for christmas must not have failed to note contrast between miss crawford georgiana for younger girl grew paler graver seemed more more spiritless in comparison with mary gay mood georgiana made great effort to throw into what be going on be persuaded that smiled talked a much a ever while took part in hospitality of pemberley in reality weight on mind preoccupation with thought of two people who be suffering through fault prevented from always knowing when be silent constantly pictured kitty grieving in solitude over downfall of hope of many month wearied mind with fruitless speculation a to how must have acted differently in order to have averted blow one must possibly have foreseen mr price must care for not for kitty else latter friend might have persuaded to try like mr morland whose courtship have be under equally auspicious circumstance then georgiana reflected with thrill who must think of morland when have be better attracted by price be glad to be able to pay tribute to friend good taste if affair have not be checked in early stage must have gone on in way have until gentleman spoke poor kitty fate be sealed tear rose to georgiana eye a recalled interview with william price feeling of anger despair have come over at prospect of everything being so utterly wrong then thrown into such confusion since then indignation on kitty behalf have overwhelmed at first have softened into pity shared place in heart equally with regret for mr price for disappointment a sudden a complete a kitty far more bewildering must never perhaps fully understand how came about fully allow for cause for obstacle have necessitated being refused chilled repulsed must think insensible unkind must believe that did not care for did not want to care what wonder if feeling towards underwent change what more probable than now when have learnt that esteem be only thing necessary to happiness earnestly wished must know that no longer blamed have resolved to think of more owing to slight indisposition of mr bingley desborough party have not come over to pemberley at christmas a be custom arrived on new year eve to spend two three day georgiana looked forward rather nervously to meeting with kitty for latter have only written occasional note to elizabeth in constrained style since departure in november georgiana dreaded equally reopening of subject in word coldness between combined with unforgiving reproach kitty knew so well how to convey by look manner seemed however when arrived that kitty be not going to adopt attitude precisely looked very thin jane told sister that have not be eating sleeping well chatted a vigorously a ever be in restless excitable spirit must not sit long to anything when not flying about house playing with child be constantly running down to rectory on plea of wanting to see mr ferrars new baby who have made appearance in world few day before georgiana found that private talk be out of question did not seem to be desired by kitty whose principal topic of conversation be after loveliness of baby charm of newest friend certain mr henry tilney sister of mr morland who have be staying with for week young lady be about kitty age have be married for several year have brought one of child with little girl about age of bingleys second boy there have evidently be great deal of intercourse between park rectory mr tilney be reported by jane husband to be very pleasing gentle amiable woman kitty enthusiasm over knew bound elizabeth have met mr tilney be pleased to hear of again a must have be to hear of anyone connected with mr morland lady portinscale subject offered material for frequent conversation among whole party a mr grant miss crawford have interest in also through acquaintanceship with young clergyman in bath georgiana must not help glancing at kitty occasionally when name be mentioned noticed that slight embarrassment kitty displayed at first soon wore off there have evidently be good many visitor at desborough during past month bingley have have shooting party there have be evening of music even small dance at house of neighbour kitty spoke of thing a if retrospect be one of great enjoyment morland be so often referred to a to lead to supposition that constant meeting be fraught with discomfort on side have not told gaiety kitty said bingley a stood round drawing room fire one morning after breakfast did know elizabeth that went to see amateur theatrical at officer got up among invited everybody be quite spectacle gave supper afterwards in fine great mess room never saw anything better done yes have invitation be sorry not to go to be too far said elizabeth heard performance be very good of course must have be asked ought to have gone for be well worth seeing little charade be quite put in shade kitty can give information about for have splendid young officer sitting by to tell who everybody be be only mr cathcart knew colonel forster once wanted to hear about lydia said kitty colouring becoming deeply interested in pattern of lace handkerchief one who escorted to supper be not mr cathcart be somebody even more gorgeous equally delightful field marshal at least must think continued brother in law in bantering tone altogether kitty did very well that evening expected jane must have have regiment coming up to before be over to ask leave to call nonsense bingley said kitty in confusion getting up going to help mary crawford who be sorting music be making too much of there be reason why mr macdonald must not call if wished to bingley laughed proceeded to give so lively description of theatrical kitty must not help coming back joining in with sparkling eye sign of pleasure in reminiscence georgiana watched in surprise for nothing must be more unlike broken hearted kitty who have gone away six week before bingley forbore to tease longer finding alone with elizabeth georgiana later in morning began at once think neither of need be under more apprehension about kitty be certainly very low spirited when came to be afraid that young sailor departure have have devastating effect have brightened up wonderfully managed to enjoy again just a girl ought be very glad said elizabeth knew have taken good deal to heart at time fresh interest will put fresh life into exactly there be use in pretty young woman like moping about fellow who doe not care for best way to forget be to amuse with others feel partly responsible for encouraging young price so jane have done best to distract thought officer be a pleasant set of fellow a ever stepped kitty by mean disliked unfortunately regiment be just moving on next one doe not come till march have asked bertram down again at end of month for hunting kitty seemed to get on well thought capital fellow did not very agreeable indeed said elizabeth in tone of calmer praise adding have doubt be excellent young man though in spite of must be inclined to adhere to kitty first preference to cousin mr price manner have more to recommend thought georgiana heart bounded turned away face to hide rising colour a bingley responded ah yes elizabeth be right in spite of a say price be man must have liked for there be sterling character do believe must have done most of good to have to begin early make own fortune a youth have done must not be so frank modest at age will wager yes must be only too glad to get back be out of question have letter from last week from copenhagen expect to be cruising about in north sea for month two then will probably have to go to distant station georgiana have turned now to look at bingley complexion changing from red to pale be grateful to elizabeth for keeping conversation going by slight remark for must not have spoken yes continued bingley think great drawback to sailor life that must have to be abroad so much away from friend cruise now be not a long a used to be when man have a much spirit a price be glad to be on move to show authority stuff be made of price be commander on present ship know first since promotion entrance of jane caused bingley to break off georgiana waited little in hope that have more to say on subject of such absorbing nature unfortunately be mr bertram not mr price to whom reverted calling upon jane to confirm expectation of former visit georgiana slipped out of room a jane began to tell elizabeth how have succeeded in obtaining mr bennet permission to keep kitty until easter georgiana needed to think over what have heard even though pain to herself became more intense in proportion a gloried in approval expressed of william price by friend to hear praised to know appreciated be sweet to how bitter by contrast be knowledge that have sacrificed happiness own in vain that kitty have so soon forgotten a to be able to flirt with officer be ready to accept a compensation for loss of william price attention of young men bingley must collect around georgiana must scarcely believe that devotion of year must have died natural death in so short time might almost have thought that kitty be feigning indifference in order to conceal chagrin from experience of kitty nature knew that friend be incapable of acting sustained part that if appeared to enjoy ball flirtation be because have for a much zest a ever georgiana might wonder have inclination to blame kitty for sign of inconsistency be undoubtedly much better for kitty to get over infatuation for william price if must succeed in doing so consequence to georgiana be far more grave suffered more for realizing kitty have not after so greatly valued

saying ought to be with soon after one o'clock word revived courage descended to find darcy georgiana mr bertram standing by hearth darcy completely equipped for journey servant waiting by front door georgiana who have be enduring keen anxiety during elizabeth absence have be exerting to keep gentleman occupied in eating talking so that elizabeth might not be interrupted too soon by darcy haste to depart gave nervous glance be tempered by relief when saw sister draw darcy into library for few parting word must scarcely attend to mr bertram amiable chatter reply to inquiry for mr mr bingley other friend have met on previous visit for picturing in mind what be going on in library trying to decide whether elizabeth have be successful in mission at last door opened reappeared darcy be grave georgiana thought brow have somewhat lightened since went in elizabeth gave bright reassuring look there be time for more carriage be already waiting farewell be quickly spoken in moment darcy have passed out be gone chapter xxv to elizabeth georgiana event of evening seemed like dreadful dream le than hour ago have be sitting at occupation a tranquil secure a if disaster did not exist now bolt have fallen scattering bringing to message of terror dismay georgiana felt a if must be hardest matter in world to settle to pretence of ordinary life again until news reached from brother longed to be able to be alone to think over quietly to go to elizabeth to hear result of appeal to miss crawford instead be obliged to establish in drawing room with mr bertram who showed sign of wishing to go to bed be evidently prepared to sit up talking drinking tea until midnight georgiana took out embroidery frame prepared to be a agreeable listener a must for expected elizabeth who have gone to miss crawford must come back at minute really felt more than common measure of gratitude to mr bertram for service have rendered gratitude again endeavoured to express when mr bertram began discussing heavy state of road consequent delay to darcy might be subjected pray name miss darcy a said be only too glad to have be of slightest assistance be mere chance be there for must have returned home week open weather tempted to stay on for day two longer be indeed fortunate for for must have have information until to morrow if have have to wait for letter tom bertram repeated that be very glad looking into fire in absent minded way that georgiana scarcely noticed so absorbed be in thought paid little more attention when suddenly rose stationed with back to fire little nearer began to speak apparently on same topic for in first few minute must only gather impression of sharing in event following accident telling mr ashley that be friend of colonel fitzwilliam knew relative must be fittest person to bear news to of mr ashley heartily agreeing of haste to get home order carriage start narrative went on georgiana hearing very little after leicestershire be left behind for thought have lingered with poor sufferer there when with start became aware that be directed at mr bertram be trying to explain that have welcomed opportunity of hurrying to pemberley because must doing family service than must have greater satisfaction because must afford privilege of being in presence once more georgiana amazed horrified endeavoured to stop tom be not to be prevented from making speech have be rehearsing for at least four hour on journey word fell from lip appeal to have respect for sad occasion have snatched at a argument most likely to move be of avail that must address at time immediately pointed out to be proof of ardour merited pardon by reason of unquenchable nature for have intended explained to wait until came to desborough at end of month then to have sought interview impatience to throw at foot declare passion must brook delay nothing must have be more distasteful to georgiana than such sentiment to hear word admiration devotion uttered by mr bertram be not only outrage upon present hour occupied a be with gravest solicitude for life of friend also upon past when similar word have be spoken to by william price from one else must bear to hear coming from cousin must almost have called insult of course must not know that almost seemed like trading upon having placed under obligation to that must presume to speak in manner so repugnant to too vexed to choose word when mr bertram stopped for breath having brought peroration to close by offer in correct form of hand heart replied coldly that be much honoured by proposal be entirely out of power to accept bertram have not expected favourable reply on instant have hardly expected so decisive unfavorable one stepped forward with outstretched hand eager miss darcy to only response be to move haughtily away at moment to relief of lady chagrin of gentleman elizabeth entered room only good manner habitual to must have helped to carry off situation tom bertram checked in one of flight of eloquence descended to earth again with observation on weather for next few minute temperature prospect of rain be debated with great earnestness elizabeth must hardly have failed to guess what kind of interview have interrupted out of compassion to georgiana soon recommended to go to bed young girl needed second bidding bertram opened door to with great ceremony be acknowledged by slightest of bow gladly sought shelter of room astonished to find that be not more than half past nine o'clock must be possible that be barely two hour since mr bertram arrival must interminable evening with shock surprise disturbance yet more surprise ever draw to close georgiana be so unnerved that sat down shed few tear few only for with real grief ever present must not spare much consideration for mr bertram unwelcome attack have be bewildering annoying be not going to worry about have acted on silly impulse must not possibly be serious scarcely knew week acquaintance talked of heartfelt devotion expected to be ready to listen to such nonsense must not conceive what have actuated resented greatly that merely because be heir to title fortune have ridden forty five mile in great hurry must suppose to be acceptable suitor expression have used showing that be confident of having approval of family roused special indignation if only have not so unluckily be alone with if mr grant have not gone upstairs mr grant georgiana started violently for until moment have completely forgotten association of mr bertram with two guest have supposed mary agitation to be caused merely by news of colonel fitzwilliam now perceived that sight of messenger must have be painful enough apart from else what miserable complication have resulted from fact that must have be tom bertram of acquaintance who have happened to be hunting with belvoir hound that day must not wish deed of kindness undone believed must miss crawford anyone else whatever present inconvenience to for everything be unimportant compared with what coming have effected now must not matter if only must go away again immediately georgiana sat meditating scheme by mary mr grant might avoid seeing again when knock at door be followed by entrance of elizabeth yes georgiana elizabeth said smiling in response to girl shy glance mr bertram have made confidante be sorry if be upset dear seems to be afraid be something of surprise to hope will take time do honour of thinking over oh elizabeth georgiana burst out cheek crimsoning want time will not think over care for mr bertram in least never will please tell to go away forget about why dear be very determined began in wrong way think certainly at wrong time be very anxious to be allowed to come back set about wooing more gradually told thought be quite unaware of feeling so be want to hear about said georgiana more quietly for be beginning to be little ashamed of anger be very much obliged to mr bertram know be very kind of everything can not possibly marry be sure be entirely out of question asked elizabeth be little startled perhaps be true have not seen much of be very agreeable position be unexceptionable above bear high character a far a know have good heart a action of to day prof cousin mr price spoke very warmly of unless be quite certain think brother must like to give matter due consideration a at other time than might feel more in mood for such subject pray pray elizabeth exclaimed georgiana nervously ask even if be not in trouble to day a be must make difference be sure mr bertram be excellent amiable can not hope fitzwilliam will not be angry dislike idea so very much if be so dear georgiana will not be tormented about more know if be glad sorry have happened so quickly be right that must judge for mr bertram will be greatly disappointed still that can not be helped suppose be to be deputed to get rid of poor man if must be so very kind elizabeth well must break to early to morrow morning since really think have have agitation enough for one evening in case must have have to ask to cut visit short for from what have heard think that miss crawford must care to see again indeed must be prevented if possible now do tell for have be longing for opportunity to ask be result of conversation if may be allowed to hear elizabeth related briefly what have passed between told how husband must scarcely believe at first that miss crawford have yielded have voluntarily sent message that be asked to deliver on being convinced of sincerity willingly promised that if cousin state permitted must convey to word of hope comfort must endeavour to make anything clear that fitzwilliam might not be able to understand of course have so few minute together said elizabeth brother have not thought of for so long quite believed that be over between did not even know that have owned to caring for once be difficult for to realize that always have cared though did not need to tell what happiness must be to poor robert to know if reached in time be so glad so very glad cried georgiana tear of joy standing in eye be a must be brother will see plainly when think over poor miss crawford how must have suffered did not realize suppose be why must not meet again quite understand how happened doe not signify now if life nothing need keep apart at event will have message nothing will make believe that be too late for naturally led back to discussion of accident condition of victim chance possibility of case must not be gone over often enough elizabeth at last prepared to leave room a hour be late struck by passing recollection looked back from door to say with smile must tell georgiana that attitude have surprised more than mr bertram lately when have be looking so pale unlike have occurred to that there must be person of whom be thinking great deal with disturbing effect confess that when interrupted mr bertram evening crossed mind that might be that person elizabeth how must think thing exclaimed georgiana turning away blushing confused thankful that elizabeth have not directly asked whether such person be in existence chapter xxvi disconsolate mr bertram duly took leave following morning having seen one besides mr darcy mr grant brief interview with former have convinced of futility of second application to sister in law be quite unable to account for rebuff vexation combined with awkwardness that felt in mr grant presence made party round breakfast table exceedingly uncomfortable one tom bertram be possessed of great deal more conscience than mr yates must never have used miss crawford name a freely a gentleman have done moreover be quite conscious that own family deserved share of blame for esclandre be usually borne by two chief culprit consequently meeting with of crawford be quite a unwelcome to a to be greatly relieved when after exchange of formal civility must betake to carriage give direction to be conveyed to desborough park to be sure be antedating visit there by ten twelve day knew that must be welcomed by hospitable bingleys must all be eager to hear shocking news lady at pemberley passed next few hour in deepest anxiety suspense tried to talk of other thing must think of little one subject georgiana must have forgotten mr bertram a soon a be out of house for must not believe regard for to be very genuine wound very deep that so dreaded disapprobation of brother when must come to hear of what have happened even elizabeth must not have be surprised if have wished to accept be mortifying in way though relief in that one ever supposed be possible that mr price must have cared for darcy have promised to send off express letter a early a must servant have gone to neighbouring town to meet so avoid delay dinner be just over meal must only make pretence of eating when butler entered saw that have brought longed for dispatch be taken to mr darcy lost not moment in communicating content news be not what have dreaded indeed account be a good a must be expected darcy found cousin condition to be grave not hopeless for colonel fitzwilliam have recovered consciousness before arrival be not permitted to talk be able to understand what be said to surgeon have enjoined perfect quiet though at present must scarcely diagnose injury believed that head have escaped danger be not over patient good constitution must help materially fact that be enduring severe pain be not considered to be altogether unfavorable symptom report be in general intense relief though anxiety still prevailed deep compassion concern must still posse who listened still be much to be thankful for on reflection seemed to be best must have hoped georgiana remained with mr grant talking over while elizabeth drew miss crawford into boudoir said know will like to hear rest of husband letter be meant for only writes 'as soon a be allowed to speak to fitzwilliam have ascertained that be comfortable a must be made told what desired to say respecting miss crawford presence in house confidence made to seemed to be great surprise to feared must excite too much when repeated message in exact word gave must perceive immediate effect on for good seemed slow to believe murmured few syllable about being too great happiness after about hour signed that wished to speak to again whispered send love tell that have given something to live for be not able to say more soon after fell asleep must recollect that there be great deal of fever consequent weakness still be decidedly not worse be more than half inclined to think that stimulus mind have received may help towards recovery know be not given to conjecture be surprisingly ready to do everything be told anxious to think better if be right responsibility will be miss crawford be one think will not be unwilling to bear pray give warmest regard tell hope time be not far distant when will be happily reunited at pemberley ' such letter must not all at once be realized recovered from mary crawford tried to utter word of thanks tear impeded speech only when joy burst upon be fully conscious of misery of last few month light served to make darkness more visible looking back upon mist of pride of resentfulness misunderstanding from have emerged seemed almost incredible for time that have reached clearer air sunshine of love mutual comprehension longed to turn to kind friend to talk freely with over have seemed puzzling when after very few anxious day better account from leicestershire began to come in gloom lifted must venture to let mind dwell on hopeful possibility once more be satisfactory that whole situation be already known to other member of little party georgiana a well a mr grant must freely offer affection sympathy of sister mr darcy said mary one day be possessed with curiosity to know think worst of for keeping colonel fitzwilliam at arm length while in london confession of weakness other day after bold assertion made when spoke to during walk indeed think ill of for of thing returned elizabeth seem to to have be most natural what do think be little bit foolish be allowing sir walter elliot to be so attentive that world concluded be engaged friend ought to have warned that might deter person really esteemed from approaching be afraid be going to say something about exclaimed miss crawford holding hand to ear in mock dismay quite expect that colonel fitzwilliam will spend hour in violent mutual recrimination when arrives will be one of subject seriously mr darcy although know now be unpardonably foolish be not conscious then of comment be being made friendship with elliots have quite aspect for other possibility connected with brother will not interest tolerated sir walter elliot never liked never thought of a having serious intention until good natured friend mr palmer called to congratulate on supposed engagement by way told that mother mr jennings have meant to come by with have be prevented did not know worthy mr jennings then since have met have felt thankful be not present on occasion must have be rather overwhelming must have be sorry to miss opportunity said elizabeth with smile yes poor mr jennings congratulation on thing have not happened be rather difficult to receive at time be not from moment do assure got horrid fright determined to change attitude towards sir walter elliot completely must have be partly successful for precipitated thing to extent at event result be not agreeable really be wretched time colonel fitzwilliam disappeared one knew where why elizabeth have long realized that cousin have not be only sufferer in past year knew that miss crawford lively manner of talking be often assumed to hide deeper emotion truly rejoiced that fear anxiety might have to be endured before lover met again nothing must shake foundation of happiness after about ten day darcy letter made clear that danger be past steady if slow progress might be looked for be of course quite unable to visit georgiana who have written to mr wentworth to postpone visit consulted elizabeth a to whether must be better to abandon altogether elizabeth thought that must be unnecessary to do so also pity for

wentworth on cold windy evening of second week in february mr darcy carriage with mr darcy sister drove up to hotel in st james street where host be to meet said carriage be to return through leicestershire for be hoped that in course of next few day colonel fitzwilliam might be well enough to be brought back in to pemberley inclement weather solitude fatigue have sent georgiana spirit down to low ebb a looked out at wet street recalled last visit to london under such very different circumstance be impossible for not to be thinking of william price occasion when have be together there wondering if be in town at minute must have liked to know that be even though be so utterly improbable that must meet since of must know what other movement be such thought be bad companion for

reach portsmouth bestow baggage on board before ship sailed at seven in evening mr knightley inquired what must happen if arrived too late william must hardly picture consequence of such breach of discipline have never known to happen supposed culprit must be court martialled probably degraded three year imagined that circumstance must possibly be allowed to extenuate so grievous crime mr knightley suggested that breakdown of coach other conveyance might cause inevitable delay william answer to be that one took risk of thing in putting off one return to very last day of one leave

william did not trouble to think of what have suspected only idea being to make way to georgiana with speed must see before sailed be pressing necessity everything else must right what if did not find if be ill out of house gone home again kind of apprehension sprang up in mind to be reasoned away fought down by vigorous action impatience be so great that hardly knew how got through journey beginning with hasty drive to coach office finding there be seat still vacant booking tramping about till time of starting innumerable fret delay along road arrival at guilford bespeaking of post chaise descending before daylight next morning to claim hurried breakfast at farnham last interminable twenty mile until moment when drove down long hill into winchester heard cathedral clock striking

favourite spot of hers for stroll armed with information william be gone on instant be fortunate that have obtained for inquiry in high street be fruitless thereupon retraced step under archway past cathedral turned along college street finally found in old palace garden where seated with book among quiet part of ruin presently came upon georgiana did not see until be close at hand when sprang up scarce able to believe eye colour deepening in cheek william forgetting lengthy explanation have intended to make darted towards impulsively exclaiming how glad be to see again came back must not help everything be all right will let speak now be too late have least chance chance at georgiana unconsciously yielded hand to shrank back little a faltered kitty breathless from haste full of anxiety a to reception william hardly knew whether have be intelligible there be something in georgiana look showed even while hesitated that be understood even more welcomed very question be answer to that quickly disposed of yet in manner entirely satisfactory to must not be doubted making thereby glorious discovery that cause be won when have be almost ready to despair of achieving anything in short time at command seemed at first impossible that must be true surprise of receiving good fortune beyond one desert be one to be easy to grow fact of kitty engagement once realized must be put aside a something delightful to be thought over at leisure for present moment there be only two people in world two must give up unchecked by sense of guilt responsibility to exquisite happiness of love acknowledged returned perfect confidence might now exist between might repeat far more eloquently that have said in picture gallery at pemberley georgiana might now venture to confess feeling in interview have awakened to life to indeed be easier to listen than to talk for after long self repression relief wonderful change be almost overwhelming heart have be too deeply stirred habitual shyness be not soon to be overcome william joy in fruition of hope so infinitely more complete than have dared to hope for gratitude to herself have to be put into word in own frank eager way touched now with earnest gravity befitting so great occasion be one of beautiful morning sometimes occur in ungenial early month of year a reminder that spring be actually on way by noon pale sunshine have warmth lover paced to fro sat in sheltered corner have seen meeting while soft breeze rustled in ivy murmuring of stream must be heard just beyond old wall georgiana lifted face of delight to blue sky watched rook busy in elm tree near while occasionally other sound came to unnoticed at time being woven into picture memory must always hold of hour voice gay with youth spirit of college boy a passed in out of gateway slow sweet chime from tower of cathedral georgiana knew something of william plan to learn that parting must take place almost immediately be indeed blow until consoling reflection came reminded other of what trial of faith patience departure in other circumstance must have meant of course must have made real difference must admit possibility of having caused change in feeling there be comfort in knowing now theirs be attachment separation must only strengthen in light of misunderstanding must no longer exist lamented william being unable to see mr mr darcy before sailed georgiana anticipated opposition on part thought gave perhaps crowning touch to felicity so intense that must hardly believe to be hers captain mr wentworth warmth of kindness be to be expected in view of affection for young people william stayed with until four o'clock gave time for many plan to be made more important letter to be written when at last said farewell buoyed georgiana up with promise that must be no more than six month before returned to claim when have actually gone went to room feeling in need of solitude to compose mind after day of such wonder be impossible that must

who appeared now desired to be even more closely connected with family than have at first be thought though regretting for sister sake profession of man have chosen must not withhold approval when have convinced how completely happiness be bound up in affair indeed must hear nothing on side what be in captain price favour so while lady catherine who have made show of objection be appeased by substantial fortune relationship with bertrams darcy elizabeth found contentment in knowledge of character position went a delightfully a georgiana must have wished darcy who have be inclined to regret mr bertram dismissal when first heard of became so entirely reconciled to idea of cousin a substitute georgiana never heard word of dreaded scolding captain wentworth promised that own brother

to trust so far in fidelity of sailor a actually to be going to marry one of georgiana have many question to ask about kitty engagement from what elizabeth told her of particular given by jane be able to piece story together for herself morland have sincerely tried to forget kitty return to desborough more bewitching than ever have shown how vain have be effort when intimacy between rectory park have be renewed under sister auspex what wonder if kitty feeling towards changed somewhat with changed circumstance if touched by continued devotion little piqued by want of appreciation in quarter have allowed to see that second attempt must not be treated like first georgiana rejoiced to think that kitty have power of consoling that be at moment adoring mr morland a whole heartedly a have ever adored mr price two girl exchanged letter of congratulation be no longer possible to write with quite same openness a of old though georgiana good wish lacked nothing of affectionate sincerity kitty
