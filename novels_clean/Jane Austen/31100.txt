view on sir walter must rather have disagreeable prompted by anybody else excused from offering slightest hint only begged leave to recommend implicit reference to excellent judgement of lady russell from whose known good sense fully expected to have just such resolute measure advised a meant to see finally adopted lady russell be most anxiously zealous on subject gave much serious consideration

acquaintance attentive neighbour obliging landlord husband of very dear friend father of anne sister be a being sir walter in apprehension entitled to great deal of compassion consideration under present difficulty must retrench did not admit of doubt be very anxious to have done with least possible pain to elizabeth drew up plan of economy made exact calculation did what nobody else thought of doing consulted anne who never seemed considered by others a having interest in question consulted in degree be influenced by in marking out scheme of retrenchment be at last submitted to sir walter emendation of anne have be on side of honesty against importance wanted more vigorous measure more complete reformation quicker release from debt much higher tone of indifference for everything justice equity if can persuade father to said lady russell looking over paper much may be done if will adopt regulation in seven year will be clear hope may be able to convince elizabeth kellynch hall have respectability in can not be affected by reduction that true dignity of sir walter elliot will be very far from lessened in eye of sensible people by acting like man of principle what will be doing in fact what very many of first family have done ought to do there will be nothing singular in case be singularity often make worst part of suffering a always doe of conduct have great hope of prevailing must be serious decided for after person who have contracted debt must pay though great deal be due to feeling of gentleman head of house like father there be still more due to character of honest man be principle on anne wanted father to be proceeding friend to be urging considered a act of indispensable duty to clear away claim of creditor with expedition most comprehensive retrenchment must secure saw dignity in anything short of wanted to be prescribed felt a duty rated lady russell influence highly a to severe degree of self denial own conscience prompted believed there might be little more difficulty in persuading to complete than to half reformation knowledge of father elizabeth inclined to think that sacrifice of one pair of horse must be hardly le painful than of so on through whole list of lady russell too gentle reduction how anne more rigid requisition might have be taken be of little consequence lady russell have success at must not be put up with be not to be borne what comfort of life knocked off journey london servant horse table contraction restriction where to live no longer with decency even of private gentleman must sooner quit kellynch hall at once than remain in on such disgraceful term quit kellynch hint be immediately taken up by mr shepherd whose interest be involved in reality of sir walter retrenching who be perfectly persuaded that nothing must be done without change of abode since idea have be started in very quarter ought to dictate have scruple said in confessing judgement to be entirely on side did not appear to that sir walter must materially alter style of living in house have character of hospitality ancient dignity to support in other place sir walter might judge for must be looked up to a regulating mode of life in way might choose to model household sir walter must quit kellynch hall after very few day more of doubt indecision great question of whither must go be settled first outline of important change made out there have be three alternative london bath house in country anne wish have be for latter small house in own neighbourhood where might still have lady russell society still be near mary still have pleasure of sometimes seeing lawn grove of kellynch be object of ambition usual fate of anne attended in having something very opposite from inclination fixed on disliked bath did not think agreed with bath be to be home sir walter have at first thought more of london mr shepherd felt that must not be trusted in london have be skilful enough to dissuade from make bath preferred be much safer place for gentleman in predicament might there be important at comparatively little expense two material advantage of bath over london have of course be given weight more convenient distance from kellynch only fifty mile lady russell spending part of winter there to very great satisfaction of lady russell whose first view on projected change have be for bath sir walter elizabeth be induced to believe that must lose consequence enjoyment by settling there lady russell felt obliged to oppose dear anne known wish must be too much to expect sir walter to descend into small house in own neighbourhood anne must have found mortification of more than foresaw to sir walter feeling must have be dreadful with regard to anne dislike of bath considered a prejudice mistake arising first from circumstance of having be three year at school there after mother death secondly from happening to be not in perfectly good spirit only winter have afterwards spent there with lady russell be fond of bath in short disposed to think must suit a to young friend health by passing warm month with at kellynch lodge danger must be avoided be in fact change must do health spirit good anne have be too little from home too little seen spirit be not high larger society must improve wanted to be more known undesirableness of other house in same neighbourhood for sir walter be certainly much strengthened by one part very material part of scheme have be happily engrafted on beginning be not only to quit home to see in hand of others trial of fortitude stronger head than sir walter have found too much kellynch hall be to be let however be profound secret not to be breathed beyond own circle sir walter must not have borne degradation of being known to design letting house mr shepherd have once mentioned word advertise never dared approach again sir walter spurned idea of being offered in manner forbad slightest hint being dropped of having such intention be only on supposition of being spontaneously solicited by most unexceptionable applicant on own term a great favour that must let at how quick come reason for approving what like lady russell have excellent one at hand for being extremely glad that sir walter family be to remove from country elizabeth have be lately forming intimacy wished to see interrupted be with daughter of mr shepherd who have returned after unprosperous marriage to father house with additional burden of two child be clever young woman who understood art of pleasing art of pleasing at least at kellynch hall who have made so acceptable to miss elliot a to have be already staying there more than once in spite of lady russell who thought friendship quite out of place must hint of caution reserve lady russell indeed have scarcely influence with elizabeth seemed to love rather because must love than because elizabeth deserved have never received from more than outward attention nothing beyond observance of complaisance have never succeeded in point wanted to carry against previous inclination have be repeatedly very earnest in trying to get anne included in visit to london sensibly open to injustice discredit of selfish arrangement shut out on many lesser occasion have endeavoured to give elizabeth advantage of own better judgement experience always in vain elizabeth must go own way never have pursued in more decided opposition to lady russell than in selection of mr clay turning from society of so deserving sister to bestow affection confidence on one who ought to have be nothing to object of distant civility from situation mr clay be in lady russell estimate very unequal in character believed very dangerous companion removal must leave mr clay behind bring choice of more suitable intimate within miss elliot reach be therefore object of first rate importance chapter must take leave to observe sir walter said mr shepherd one morning at kellynch hall a laid down newspaper that present juncture be much in favour peace will be turning rich naval officer ashore will be wanting home must not be better time sir walter for having choice of tenant very responsible tenant many noble fortune have be made during war if rich admiral be to come in way sir walter must be very lucky man shepherd replied sir walter be have to remark prize indeed must kellynch hall be to rather greatest prize of let have taken ever so many before hey shepherd mr shepherd laughed a knew must at wit then added presume to observe sir walter in way of business gentleman of navy be well to deal with have have little knowledge of method of doing business be free to confess that have very liberal notion be a likely to make desirable tenant a set of people one must meet with therefore sir walter what must take leave to suggest be that if in consequence of rumour getting abroad of intention must be contemplated a possible thing because know how difficult be to keep action design of one part of world from notice curiosity of other consequence have tax john shepherd might conceal family matter chose for nobody must think worth while to observe sir walter elliot have eye upon may be very difficult to elude therefore thus much venture upon that will not greatly surprise if with caution rumour of truth must get abroad in supposition of a be going to observe since application will unquestionably follow must think from wealthy naval commander particularly worth attending to beg leave to add two hour will bring over at time to save trouble of replying sir walter only nodded soon afterwards rising pacing room observed sarcastically there be few among gentleman of navy imagine who must not be surprised to find in house of description must look around doubt bless good fortune said mr clay for mr clay be present father have driven over nothing being of so much use to mr clay health a drive to kellynch quite agree with father in thinking sailor might be very desirable tenant have known good deal of profession besides liberality be so neat careful in way valuable picture of yours sir walter if chose to leave must be perfectly safe everything in about house must be taken such excellent care of garden shrubbery must be kept in almost a high order a be now need not be afraid miss elliot of own sweet flower garden being neglected a to rejoined sir walter coolly supposing be induced to let house have by mean made up mind a to privilege to be annexed to be not particularly disposed to favour tenant park must be open to of course few navy officer men of other description can have have range what restriction might impose on use of pleasure ground be thing be not fond of idea of shrubbery being always approachable must recommend miss elliot to be on guard with respect to flower garden be very little disposed to grant tenant of kellynch hall extraordinary favour assure be sailor soldier after short pause mr shepherd presumed to say in case there be established usage make everything plain easy between landlord tenant interest sir walter be in pretty safe hand depend upon for taking care that tenant have more than just right venture to hint sir walter elliot can not be half so jealous for own a john shepherd will be for here anne spoke navy think who have done so much for have at least equal claim with other set of men for comfort privilege home can give sailor work hard enough for comfort must allow very true very true what miss anne say be very true be mr shepherd rejoinder oh certainly be daughter sir walter remark be soon afterwards profession have utility must be sorry to see friend of mine belonging to indeed be reply with look of surprise yes be in two point offensive to have two strong ground of objection to first a being mean of bringing person of obscure birth into undue distinction raising men to honour father grandfather never dreamt of secondly a cut up man youth vigour most horribly sailor grows old sooner than other man have observed life man be in greater danger in navy of being insulted by rise of one whose father father might have disdained to speak to of becoming prematurely object of disgust than in other line one day last spring in town be in company with two men striking instance of what be talking of lord st ives whose father know to have be country curate without bread to eat be to give place to lord st ives certain admiral baldwin most deplorable looking personage can imagine face colour of mahogany rough rugged to last degree line wrinkle nine grey hair of side nothing dab of powder at top 'in name of heaven who be that old fellow ' said to friend of mine who be standing near sir basil morley 'old fellow ' cried sir basil 'it be admiral baldwin what do take age to be ' beixty said perhaps sixty two ' replied sir basil more picture to yourselves amazement will not easily forget admiral baldwin never saw quite so wretched example of what sea faring life can do to degree know be same with be knocked about exposed to climate weather till be not fit to be seen be pity be not knocked on head at once before reach admiral baldwin age nay sir walter cried mr clay be being severe indeed have little mercy on poor men be not born to be handsome sea be beautifier certainly sailor do grow old betimes have observed soon lose look of youth then be not same with many other profession perhaps most other soldier in active service be not at better off even in quieter profession there be toil labour of mind if not of body seldom leaf man look to natural effect of time lawyer plod quite care physician be up at hour travelling in weather even clergyman stopt moment to consider what might do for clergyman even clergyman know be obliged to go into infected room expose health look to injury of poisonous atmosphere in fact a have long be convinced though profession be necessary honourable in turn be only lot of who be not obliged to follow who can live in regular way in country choosing own hour following own pursuit living on own property without torment of trying for more be only lot say to hold blessing of health good appearance to utmost know other set of men what lose something of personableness when cease to be quite young seemed a if mr shepherd in anxiety to bespeak sir walter good will towards naval officer a tenant have be gifted with foresight for very first application for house be from admiral croft with whom shortly afterwards fell into company in attending quarter session at taunton indeed have received hint of admiral from london correspondent by report hastened over to kellynch to make admiral croft be native of somersetshire who having acquired very handsome fortune be wishing to settle in own country have come down to taunton in order to look at advertised place in immediate neighbourhood however have not suited that accidentally hearing be just a have foretold mr shepherd observed sir walter concern must not be kept secret accidentally hearing of possibility of kellynch hall being to let understanding mr shepherd connection with owner have introduced to in order to make particular inquiry have in course of pretty long conference expressed a strong inclination for place a man who knew only by description must feel given mr shepherd in explicit account of proof of being most responsible eligible tenant who be admiral croft be sir walter cold suspicious inquiry mr shepherd answered for being of gentleman family mentioned place anne after little pause followed added be rear admiral of white be in trafalgar action have be in east indie since be stationed there believe several year then take for granted observed sir walter that face be about a orange a cuff cape of livery mr shepherd hastened to assure that admiral croft be very hale hearty well looking man little weather beaten to be sure not much quite gentleman in notion behaviour not likely to make smallest difficulty about term only wanted comfortable home to get into a soon a possible knew must pay for convenience knew what rent ready furnished house of consequence might fetch must not have be surprised if sir walter have asked more have inquired about manor must be glad of deputation certainly made great point of said sometimes took out gun never killed quite gentleman mr shepherd be eloquent on subject pointing out circumstance of admiral family made peculiarly desirable a tenant be married man without child very state to be wished for house be never taken good care of mr shepherd observed without lady did not know whether furniture might not be in danger of suffering a much where there be lady a where there be many child lady without family be very best preserver of furniture in world have seen mr croft too be at taunton with admiral have be present almost time be talking matter over very well spoken genteel shrewd lady seemed to be continued asked more question about house term tax than admiral seemed more conversant with business moreover sir walter found be not quite unconnected in country more than husband be to say be sister to gentleman who did live amongst once told so sister to gentleman who lived few year back at monkford bless what be name at moment can not recollect name though have heard so lately penelope dear can help to name of gentleman who lived at monkford mr croft brother mr clay be talking so eagerly with miss elliot that did not hear appeal have conception whom can mean shepherd remember gentleman resident at monkford since time of old governor trent bless how very odd will forget own name soon suppose name be so very well acquainted with gentleman so well by sight seen hundred time came to consult once remember about trespass of one of neighbour farmer man breaking into orchard wall torn down apple stolen caught in fact afterwards contrary to judgement submitted to amicable compromise very odd indeed after waiting moment mean mr wentworth suppose said anne mr shepherd be gratitude wentworth be very name mr wentworth be very man have curacy of monkford know sir walter time back for two three year came there about year take remember be sure wentworth oh ay mr wentworth curate of monkford misled by term gentleman thought be speaking of man of property mr wentworth be nobody remember quite unconnected nothing to do with strafford family one wonder how name of many of nobility become so common a mr shepherd perceived that connexion of croft did service with sir walter mentioned more returning with zeal to dwell on circumstance more indisputably in favour age number fortune high idea have formed of kellynch hall extreme solicitude for advantage of renting making appear a if ranked nothing beyond happiness of being tenant of sir walter elliot extraordinary taste certainly must have be supposed in secret of sir walter estimate of due of tenant succeeded however though sir walter must ever look with evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit house think infinitely too well off in being permitted to rent on highest term be talked into allowing mr shepherd to proceed in treaty authorising to wait on admiral croft who still remained at taunton fix day for house being seen sir walter be not very wise still have experience enough of world to feel that more unobjectionable tenant in essential than admiral croft bid fair to be must hardly offer so far went understanding vanity supplied little additional soothing in admiral situation in life be just high enough not too high have let house to admiral croft must sound extremely well very much better than to mere mr mr save perhaps half dozen in nation always need note of explanation admiral speaks own consequence at same time can never make baronet look small in dealing intercourse sir walter elliot must ever have precedence nothing must be done without reference to elizabeth inclination be growing so strong for removal that be happy to have fixed expedited by tenant at hand not word to suspend decision be uttered by mr shepherd be completely empowered to act sooner have end be reached than anne who have be most attentive listener to whole left room to seek comfort of cool air for flushed cheek a walked along favourite grove said with gentle sigh few month more perhaps may be walking here chapter be not mr wentworth former curate of monkford however suspicious appearance may be captain frederick wentworth brother who being made commander in consequence of action off st domingo not immediately employed have come into somersetshire in summer of having parent living found home for year at monkford be at time remarkably fine young man with great deal of intelligence spirit brilliancy anne extremely pretty girl with gentleness modesty taste feeling sum of attraction on side might have be enough for have nothing to do have hardly anybody to love encounter of such lavish recommendation must not fail be gradually acquainted when acquainted rapidly deeply in love must be difficult to say have seen highest perfection in other have be happiest in receiving declaration proposal in having accepted short period of exquisite felicity followed short one trouble soon arose sir walter on being applied to without actually withholding consent saying must never be gave negative of great astonishment great coldness great silence professed resolution of doing nothing for daughter thought very degrading alliance lady russell though with more tempered pardonable pride received a most unfortunate one anne elliot with claim of birth beauty mind to throw away at nineteen involve at nineteen in engagement with young man who have nothing to recommend hope of attaining affluence in chance of most uncertain profession connexion to secure even farther rise in profession must be indeed throwing away grieved to think of anne elliot so young known to so few to be snatched off by stranger without alliance fortune rather sunk by into state of most wearing anxious youth killing dependence must not be if by fair interference of friendship representation from one who have almost mother love mother right must be prevented captain wentworth have fortune have be lucky in profession spending freely what have come freely have realized nothing be confident that must soon be rich full of life ardour knew that must soon have ship soon be on station must lead to everything wanted have always be lucky knew must be so still such confidence powerful in own warmth bewitching in wit often expressed must have be enough for anne lady russell saw very differently sanguine temper fearlessness of mind operated very differently on saw in aggravation of evil only added dangerous character to be brilliant be headstrong lady russell have little taste for wit of anything approaching to imprudence horror deprecated connexion in light such opposition a feeling produced be more than anne must combat young gentle a be might yet have be possible to withstand father ill will though unsoftened by one kind word look on part of sister lady russell whom have always loved relied on must not with such steadiness of opinion such tenderness of manner be continually advising in vain be persuaded to believe engagement wrong thing indiscreet improper hardly capable of success not deserving be not merely selfish caution under acted in putting end to have not imagined consulting good even more than own must hardly have given up belief of being prudent self denying principally for advantage be chief consolation under misery of parting final parting consolation be required for have to encounter additional pain of opinion on side totally unconvinced unbending of feeling ill used by so forced relinquishment have left country in consequence few month have seen beginning end of acquaintance not with few month ended anne share of suffering from attachment regret have for long time clouded enjoyment of youth early loss of bloom spirit have be lasting effect more than seven year be gone since little history of sorrowful interest have reached close time have softened down much perhaps nearly of peculiar attachment to have be too dependent on time alone aid have be given in change of place except in one

change name by young man who not long afterwards found more willing mind in younger sister lady russell have lamented refusal for charles be eldest son of man whose landed property general importance be second in country only to sir walter of good character appearance however lady russell might have asked yet for something more while anne be nineteen must have rejoiced to see at twenty two so respectably removed from partiality injustice of father house settled so permanently near in case anne have left nothing for advice to do though lady russell a satisfied a ever with own discretion never wished past undone began now to have anxiety border on hopelessness for anne being tempted by man of talent independence to enter state for held to be peculiarly fitted by warm affection domestic habit knew not other opinion constancy change on one leading point of anne conduct for subject be never alluded to anne at seven twenty thought very differently from what have be made to

made handsome fortune have only navy list newspaper for authority must not doubt being rich in favour of constancy have reason to believe married how eloquent must anne elliot have be how eloquent at least be wish on side of early warm attachment cheerful confidence in futurity against over anxious caution seems to insult exertion distrust providence have be forced into prudence in youth learned romance a grew older natural sequel of unnatural beginning with circumstance recollection feeling must not hear that captain wentworth sister be likely to live at kellynch without revival of former pain many stroll many sigh be necessary to dispel agitation of idea often told be folly before must harden nerve sufficiently to feel continual discussion of croft business evil be assisted however by perfect indifference apparent unconsciousness among only three of own friend in secret of past seemed almost to deny recollection of must do justice to superiority of lady russell motif in over of father elizabeth must honour better feeling of calmness general air of oblivion among be highly important from sprung in event of admiral croft really taking kellynch hall rejoiced anew over conviction have always be most grateful to of past being known to three only among connexion by whom syllable believed must ever be whispered in trust among brother only with whom have be residing have received information of short lived engagement that brother have be long removed from country being sensible man moreover single man at time have fond dependence on human creature having heard of from sister mr croft have then be out of england accompanying husband on foreign station own sister mary have be at school while occurred never admitted by pride of delicacy of others to smallest knowledge of afterwards with support hoped that acquaintance between herself croft with lady russell still resident in kellynch mary fixed only three mile off must be anticipated need not involve particular awkwardness chapter on morning appointed for admiral mr croft seeing kellynch hall anne found most natural to take almost daily walk to lady russell keep out of way till be over when found most natural to be sorry that have missed opportunity of seeing meeting of two party proved highly satisfactory decided whole business at once lady be previously well disposed for agreement saw nothing therefore good manner in other with regard to gentleman there be such hearty good humour open trusting liberality on admiral side a must not influence sir walter who have besides be flattered into very best most polished behaviour by mr shepherd assurance of being known by report to admiral a model of good breeding house ground furniture be approved croft be approved term time thing body be right mr shepherd clerk be set to work without there having be single preliminary difference to modify of that indenture sheweth sir walter without hesitation declared admiral to be best looking sailor have ever met with went so far a to say that if own man might have have arranging of hair must not be ashamed of being seen with where admiral with sympathetic cordiality observed to wife a drove back through park thought must soon come to deal dear in spite of what told at taunton baronet will never set thames on fire there seems to be harm in reciprocal compliment must have be esteemed about equal croft be to have possession at michaelmas a sir walter proposed removing to bath in course of preceding month there be time to be lost in making dependent arrangement lady russell convinced that anne must not be allowed to be of use importance in choice of house be going to secure be very unwilling to have hurried away so soon wanted to make possible for to stay behind till might convey to bath after christmas having engagement of own must take from kellynch for several week be unable to give full invitation wished anne though dreading possible heat of september in white glare of bath grieving to forego influence so sweet so sad of autumnal month in country did not think that everything considered wished to remain must be most right most wise therefore must involve least suffering to go with others something occurred however to give different duty mary often little unwell always thinking great deal of own complaint always in habit of claiming anne when anything be matter be indisposed foreseeing that must not have day health autumn entreated rather required for be hardly entreaty to come to uppercross cottage bear company a long a must want instead of going to bath can not possibly do without anne be mary reasoning elizabeth reply be then be sure anne have better stay for nobody will want in bath to be claimed a good though in improper style be at least better than being rejected a good at anne glad to be thought of use glad to have anything marked out a duty certainly not sorry to have scene of in country own dear country readily agreed to stay invitation of mary removed lady russell difficulty be consequently soon settled that anne must not go to bath till lady russell took that intervening time must be divided between uppercross cottage kellynch lodge so far be perfectly right lady russell be almost startled by wrong of one part of kellynch hall plan when burst on be mr clay being engaged to go to bath with sir walter elizabeth a most important valuable assistant to latter in business before lady russell be extremely sorry that measure must have be resorted to at wondered grieved feared affront contained to anne in mr clay being of so much use while anne must be of none be very sore aggravation anne be become hardened to such affront felt imprudence of arrangement quite a keenly a lady russell with great deal of quiet

clay have freckle projecting tooth clumsy wrist be continually making severe remark upon in absence be young certainly altogether well looking possessed in acute mind assiduous pleasing manner infinitely more dangerous attraction than merely personal might have be anne be so impressed by degree of danger that must not excuse from trying to make perceptible to sister have little hope of success elizabeth who in event of reverse must be so much more to be pitied than must never thought have reason to reproach for giving warning spoke seemed only to offend elizabeth must not conceive how such absurd suspicion must occur to indignantly answered for party perfectly knowing situation mr clay said warmly never forgets who be a be rather better acquainted with sentiment than can be can assure that upon subject of marriage be particularly nice that reprobate inequality of condition rank more strongly than most people a to father really must not have thought that who have kept single so long for sake need be suspected now if mr clay be very beautiful woman grant might be wrong to have so much with not that anything in world be sure must induce father to make degrading match might be rendered unhappy poor mr clay who with merit can never have be reckoned tolerably pretty really think poor mr clay may be staying here in perfect safety one must imagine have never heard father speak of personal misfortune though know must fifty time that tooth of freckle freckle disgust so very much a do have known face not materially disfigured by few abominates must have heard notice mr clay freckle there be hardly personal defect replied anne agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to think very differently answered elizabeth shortly agreeable manner may set off handsome feature can never alter plain one however at rate a have great deal more at stake on point than anybody else can have think rather unnecessary in to be advising anne have done glad that be over not absolutely hopeless of doing good elizabeth though resenting suspicion might yet be made observant by last office of four carriage horse be to draw sir walter miss elliot mr clay to bath party drove

owing to little further perseverance in patience forced cheerfulness on anne side produced nearly cure on mary must soon sit upright on sofa began to hope might be able to leave by dinner time then forgetting to think of be at other end of room beautifying nosegay then ate cold meat then be well enough to propose little walk where will go said when be ready suppose will not like to call at great

a possible ought to feel what be due to a sister however may a well go sit with little while when have over can enjoy walk anne have always thought style of intercourse highly imprudent have ceased to endeavour to check from believing that though there be on side continual subject of offence family must now do without to great house accordingly went to sit full half hour in old fashioned square

half hour be chatted away pleasantly enough be not at surprised at end of to have walking party joined by miss musgroves at mary particular invitation chapter anne have not wanted visit to uppercross to learn that removal from one set of people to though at distance of only three mile will often include total change of conversation opinion idea have never be staying there before without being struck by without wishing that other elliots must have advantage in seeing how unknown unconsidered there be affair at kellynch hall be treated a of such general publicity pervading interest yet with experience believed must now submit to feel that lesson in art of knowing own nothingness beyond own circle be become necessary for for certainly coming a did with heart full of subject have be completely occupying house in kellynch for many week have expected rather more curiosity sympathy than found in separate very similar remark of mr mr musgrove so miss anne sir walter sister be gone what part of bath do think will settle in without much waiting for answer in young lady addition of hope will be in bath in winter remember papa if do go must be in good situation none of queen square for in anxious supplement from mary of upon word will be pretty well off when be gone away to be happy at bath must only resolve to avoid such self delusion in future think with heightened gratitude

of two month mary be not so repulsive unsisterly a elizabeth so inaccessible to influence of hers be there anything among other component part of cottage inimical to comfort be always on friendly term with brother in law in child who loved nearly a well respected great deal more than mother have object of interest amusement wholesome exertion charles musgrove be civil agreeable in sense temper be undoubtedly superior to wife not of power conversation grace to make past a be connected together at dangerous contemplation though at same time anne must believe with lady russell that more equal match might have greatly improved that woman of real understanding might have given more consequence to character more usefulness rationality elegance to habit pursuit a be did nothing with much zeal sport time be otherwise trifled away without benefit from book anything else have very good spirit never seemed much affected by wife occasional lowness bore with unreasonableness sometimes to anne admiration upon whole though there be very often little disagreement in have sometimes more share than wished being appealed to by party might pas for happy couple be always perfectly agreed in want of more money strong inclination for handsome present from father here a on most topic have superiority for while mary thought great shame that present be not made always contended for father having many other us for money right to spend a liked a to management of child theory be much better than wife practice not so bad must manage very well if be not for mary interference be what anne often heard say have good deal of faith in when listening in turn to mary reproach of charles spoil child so can not get into order never have smallest temptation to say very true one of least agreeable circumstance of residence there be being treated with too much confidence by party being too much in secret of complaint of house known to have influence with sister be continually requested at least receiving hint to exert beyond what be practicable wish must persuade mary not to be always fancying ill be charles language in unhappy mood thus spoke mary do believe if charles be to see dying must not think there be anything matter with be sure anne if must might persuade really be very ill great deal worse than ever own mary declaration be hate sending child to great house though grandmamma be always wanting to see for humour indulges to such degree give so much trash sweet thing that be sure to come back sick cross for rest of day mr musgrove took first opportunity of being alone with anne to say oh miss anne can not help wishing mr charles have little of method with child be quite different creature with to be sure in general be so spoilt be pity can not put sister in way of managing be a fine healthy child a ever be seen poor little dear without partiality mr charles know more how must be treated bless how troublesome be sometimes assure miss anne prevents wishing to see at house so often a otherwise must believe mr charles be not quite pleased with not inviting oftener know be very bad to have child with one one be obligated to be checking moment do do that one can only keep in tolerable order by more cake than be good for have communication moreover from mary mr musgrove think servant so steady that must be high treason to call in question be sure without exaggeration that upper house maid laundry maid instead of being in business be gadding about village day long meet wherever go declare never go twice into nursery without seeing something of if jemima be not

again be mary complaint that mr musgrove be very apt not to give precedence be due when dined at great house with other family did not see reason why be to be considered so much at home a to lose place one day when anne be walking with only musgroves one of after talking of rank people of rank jealousy of rank said have scruple of observing to how nonsensical person be about place because world know how easy indifferent be about wish anybody must give mary hint that must be great deal better if be not so very tenacious especially if must not be always putting forward to take place of mamma nobody doubt right to have precedence of mamma must be more becoming in not to be always insisting on be not that mamma care about least in world know be taken notice of by many person how be anne to set matter to right must do little more than listen patiently soften grievance excuse to other give hint of forbearance necessary between such near neighbour make hint broadest be meant for sister benefit in other respect visit began proceeded very well own spirit improved by change of place subject by being removed three mile from kellynch mary ailment lessened by having constant companion daily intercourse with other family since there be superior affection confidence employment in cottage to be interrupted by be rather advantage be certainly carried nearly a far a possible for met morning hardly ever spent evening asunder believed must not have done so well without sight of mr mr musgrove respectable form in usual place without talking laughing singing of daughter played great deal better than of miss musgroves having voice knowledge of harp fond parent to sit by fancy delighted performance be little thought of only out of civility to refresh others a be well aware knew that when played be giving pleasure only to herself be new sensation excepting one short period of life have never since age of fourteen never since loss of dear mother known happiness of being listened to encouraged by just appreciation real taste in music have be always used to feel alone in world mr mr musgrove fond partiality for own daughter performance total indifference to other

dinner party more caller more visitor by invitation by chance than other family there be more completely popular girl be wild for dancing evening ended occasionally in unpremeditated little ball there be family of cousin within walk of uppercross in affluent circumstance who depended on musgroves for pleasure must come at time help play at anything dance anywhere anne very much preferring office of musician to more active post played country dance to by hour together kindness always recommended musical power to notice of mr mr musgrove more than anything else often drew compliment well done miss anne very well done indeed lord bless how little finger of yours fly about so passed first three week michaelmas came now anne heart must be in kellynch again beloved home made over to others precious room furniture grove prospect beginning to own other eye other limb must not think of much else on th of september have sympathetic touch in evening from mary who on having occasion to note down day of month exclaimed dear be not day croft be to come to kellynch be glad did not think of before how low make croft took possession with true naval alertness be to be visited mary deplored necessity for nobody knew how much must suffer must put off a long a must be not easy till have talked charles into driving over on early day be in very animated comfortable state of imaginary agitation when came back anne have very sincerely rejoiced in there being mean of going wished however to see croft be glad to be within when visit be returned came master of house be not at home two sister be together a chanced that mr croft fell to share of anne while admiral sat by mary made very agreeable by good humoured notice of little boy be well able to watch for likeness if failed in feature to catch in voice in turn of sentiment expression mr croft though tall fat have squareness uprightness vigour of form gave importance to person have bright dark eye good teeth altogether agreeable face though reddened weather beaten complexion consequence of having be almost a much at sea a husband made seem to have lived year longer in world than real eight thirty manner be open easy decided like one who have distrust of herself doubt of what to do without approach to coarseness however want of good humour anne gave credit indeed for feeling of great consideration towards in related to kellynch pleased especially a have satisfied in very first half minute in instant even of introduction that there be not smallest symptom of knowledge suspicion on mr croft side to give bias of sort be quite easy on head consequently full of strength courage till for moment electrified by mr croft suddenly saying be not sister find that brother have pleasure of being acquainted with when be in country anne hoped have outlived age of blushing age of emotion certainly have not perhaps may not have heard that be married added mr croft must now answer a ought be happy to feel when mr croft next word explained to be mr wentworth of whom spoke that have said nothing might not do for brother immediately felt how reasonable be that mr croft must be thinking speaking of edward not of frederick with shame at own forgetfulness applied to knowledge of former neighbour present state with proper interest rest be tranquillity till just a be moving heard admiral say to mary be expecting brother of mr croft here soon dare say know by name be cut short by eager attack of little boy clinging to like old friend declaring must not go being too much engrossed by proposal of carrying away in coat pocket c to have moment for finishing recollecting what have begun anne be left to persuade a well a must that same brother must still be in question must not however reach degree of certainty a not to be anxious to hear whether anything have be said on subject at other house where croft have previously be calling folk of great house be to spend evening of day at cottage being now too late in year for such visit to be made on foot coach be beginning to be listened for when youngest miss musgrove walked in be coming to apologize that must have to spend evening by be first black idea mary be quite ready to be affronted when louisa made right by saying that only came on foot to leave more room for harp be bringing in carriage will tell reason added about be come on to give notice that papa mamma be out of spirit evening especially mamma be thinking so much of poor richard agreed must be best to have harp for seems to amuse more than piano forte will tell why be out of spirit when croft called morning called here afterwards did not happened to say that brother captain wentworth be just returned to england paid off something be coming to see almost directly most unluckily came into mamma head when be gone that wentworth something very like be name of poor richard captain at one time know when where great while before died poor fellow upon looking over letter thing found be so be perfectly sure that must be very man head be quite full of of poor richard so must be a merry a can that may not be dwelling upon such gloomy thing real circumstance of pathetic piece of family history be that musgroves have have ill fortune of very troublesome hopeless son good fortune to lose before reached twentieth year that have be sent to sea because be stupid unmanageable on shore that have be very little cared for at time by family though quite a much a deserved seldom heard of scarcely at regretted when intelligence of death abroad have worked way to uppercross two year before have in fact though sister be now doing must for by calling poor richard be nothing better than thick headed unfeeling unprofitable dick musgrove who have never done anything to entitle to more than abbreviation of name living dead have be several year at sea have in course of removal to midshipman be liable especially such midshipman a captain wish to get rid of be six month on board captain frederick wentworth frigate laconia from laconia have under influence of captain written only two letter father mother have ever received from during whole of absence be to say only two disinterested letter rest have be mere application for money in letter have spoken well of captain yet so little be in habit of attending to such matter so unobservant incurious be a to name of men ship that have made scarcely impression at time that mr musgrove must have be suddenly struck very day with recollection of name of wentworth a connected with son seemed one of extraordinary burst of mind do sometimes occur have gone to letter found all a supposed re perusal of letter after so long interval poor son gone for ever strength of fault forgotten have affected spirit exceedingly thrown into greater grief for than have known on first hearing of death mr musgrove be in lesser degree affected likewise when reached cottage be evidently in want first of being listened to anew on subject afterwards of relief cheerful companion must give to hear talking so much of captain wentworth repeating name so often puzzling over past year at last ascertaining that might that probably must turn out to be very same captain wentworth whom recollected meeting once twice after coming back from clifton very fine young man must not say whether be seven eight year ago be new sort of trial to anne nerve found however that be one to must inure since actually be expected in country must teach to be insensible on such point not only did appear that be expected speedily musgroves in warm gratitude for kindness have shewn poor dick very high respect for character stamped a be by poor dick having be six month under care mentioning in strong though not perfectly well spelt praise a fine dashing felow only two perticular about schoolmaster be bent on introducing seeking acquaintance a soon a must hear of arrival resolution of doing so helped to form comfort of evening chapter very few day more captain wentworth be known to be at kellynch mr musgrove have called on come back warm in praise be engaged with croft to dine at uppercross by end of week have be great disappointment to mr musgrove to find that earlier day must be fixed so impatient be to shew gratitude by seeing captain wentworth under own roof welcoming to be strongest best in cellar week must pas only week in anne reckoning then supposed must meet soon began to wish that must feel secure even for week captain wentworth made very early return to mr musgrove civility be calling there in same half hour mary be actually setting forward for great house where a afterwards learnt must inevitably have found when be stopped by eldest boy being at moment brought home in consequence of bad fall child situation put visit entirely aside must not hear of escape with indifference even in midst of serious anxiety afterwards felt on account collar bone be found to be dislocated such injury received in back a roused most alarming idea be afternoon of distress anne have thing to do at once apothecary to send for father to have pursued informed mother to support keep from hysteric servant to control youngest child to banish poor suffering one to attend soothe besides sending a soon a recollected proper notice to other house brought accession rather of frightened enquiring companion than of very useful assistant brother return be first comfort must take best care of wife second blessing be arrival of apothecary till came have examined child apprehension be worse for being vague suspected great injury knew not where now collar bone be soon replaced though mr robinson felt felt rubbed looked grave spoke low word to father aunt still be to hope best to be able to part eat dinner in tolerable ease of mind then be just before parted that two young aunt be able so far to digress from nephew state a to give information of captain wentworth visit staying five minute behind father mother to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted be with how much handsomer how infinitely more agreeable thought than individual among male acquaintance who have be at favourite before how glad have be to hear papa invite to stay dinner how sorry when said be quite out of power how glad again when have promised in reply to papa mamma farther pressing invitation to come dine with on morrow actually on morrow have promised in so pleasant manner a if felt motive of attention just a ought in short have looked said everything with such exquisite grace that must assure head be turned by off ran quite a full of glee a of love apparently more full of captain wentworth than of little charles same story same rapture be repeated when two girl came with father through gloom of evening to make enquiry mr musgrove no longer under first uneasiness about heir must add confirmation praise hope there must be now occasion for putting captain wentworth off only be sorry to think that cottage party probably must not like to leave little boy to give meeting oh a to leaving little boy father mother be in much too strong recent alarm to bear thought anne in joy of escape must not help adding warm protestation to theirs charles musgrove indeed afterwards shewed more of inclination child be going on so well wished so much to be introduced to captain wentworth that perhaps might join in evening must not dine from home might walk in for hour in be eagerly opposed by wife with oh indeed charles can not bear to have go away only think if anything must happen child have good night be going on well next day must be work of time to ascertain that injury have be done to spine mr robinson found nothing to increase alarm charles musgrove began consequently to feel necessity for longer confinement child be to be kept in bed amused a quietly a possible what be there for father to do be quite female case must be highly absurd in who must be of use at home to shut up father very much wished to meet captain wentworth there being sufficient reason against ought to go ended in making bold public declaration when came in from shooting of meaning to dress directly dine at other house nothing can be going on better than child said so told father just now that must come thought quite right sister being with love have scruple at must not like to leave see can be of use anne will send for if anything be matter husband wife generally understand when opposition will be vain mary knew from charles manner of speaking that be quite determined on going that must be of use to teaze said nothing therefore till be out of room a soon a there be only anne to hear so be to be left to shift by with poor sick child not creature coming near evening knew how must be be always luck if there be anything disagreeable going on men be always sure to get out of charles be a bad a of very unfeeling must say be very unfeeling of to be running away from poor little boy talk of being going on so well how doe know that be going on well that there may not be sudden change hour hence did not think charles must have be so unfeeling so here be to go away enjoy because be poor mother be not to be allowed to stir yet be sure be more unfit than anybody else to be about child being mother be very reason why feeling must not be tried be not at equal to saw how hysterical be yesterday be only effect of suddenness of alarm of shock will not be hysterical again dare say will have nothing to distress perfectly understand mr robinson direction have fear indeed mary can not wonder at husband nursing doe not belong to man be not province sick child be always mother property own feeling generally make so hope be a fond of child a mother know that be of more use in sick room than charles for can not be always scolding teazing poor child when be ill saw morning that if told to keep quiet be sure to begin kicking about have not nerve for sort of thing must be comfortable to be spending whole evening away from poor boy yes see papa can why must not jemima be so careful must send word hour how be really think charles might a well have told father must come be not more alarmed about little charles now than be be dreadfully alarmed yesterday case be very different to day well if think too late to give notice for suppose be to go a well a husband leave little charles to care mr mr musgrove can not think wrong while remain with be serious cried mary eye brightening dear be very good thought very good indeed to be sure may just a well go a not for be of use at home be only harasses who have not mother feeling be great deal properest person can make little charles do anything always mind at word will be great deal better than leaving only with jemima oh will certainly go be sure ought if can quite a much a charles for want excessively to be acquainted with captain wentworth know mind being left alone excellent thought of yours indeed anne will go tell charles get ready directly can send for know at moment notice if anything be matter dare say there will be nothing to alarm must not go may be sure if did not feel quite at ease about dear child next moment be tapping at husband dressing room door a anne followed up stair be in time for whole conversation began with mary saying in tone of great exultation mean to go with charles for be of more use at home than be if be to shut up for ever with child must not be able to persuade to do anything did not like anne will stay anne undertakes to stay at home take care of be anne own proposal so will go with will be great deal better for have not dined at other house since tuesday be very kind of anne be husband answer must be very glad to have go seems rather hard that must be left at home by to nurse sick child anne be now at hand to take up own cause sincerity of manner being soon sufficient to convince where conviction be at least very agreeable have farther scruple a to being left to dine alone though still wanted to join in evening when child might be at rest for night kindly urged to let come fetch be quite unpersuadable being case have ere long pleasure of seeing set off together in high spirit be gone hoped to be happy however oddly constructed such happiness might seem a for herself be left with a many sensation of comfort a be perhaps ever likely to be hers knew to be of first utility to child what be to if frederick wentworth be only mile distant making agreeable to others must have liked to know how felt a to meeting perhaps indifferent if indifference must exist under such circumstance must be indifferent unwilling have wished ever to see again need not have waited till time must have done what must not believe that in place must have done long ago when event have be early giving independence alone have be wanting brother sister came back delighted with new acquaintance visit in general there have be music singing talking laughing be most agreeable charming manner in captain wentworth shyness reserve seemed to know other perfectly be coming very next morning to shoot with charles be to come to breakfast not at cottage though have be proposed at first then have be pressed to come to great house instead seemed afraid of being in mr charles musgrove way on account of child therefore somehow hardly knew how ended in charles being to meet to breakfast at father anne understood wished to avoid seeing have inquired after found slightly a might suit former slight acquaintance seeming to acknowledge such a have acknowledged actuated perhaps by same view of escaping introduction when be to meet morning hour of cottage be always later than of other house on morrow difference be so great that mary anne be not more than beginning breakfast when charles came in to say that be just setting off that be come for dog that sister be following with captain wentworth sister meaning to visit mary child captain wentworth proposing also to wait on for few minute if not inconvenient though charles have answered for child being in such state a must make inconvenient captain wentworth must not be satisfied without running on to give notice mary very much gratified by attention be delighted to receive while thousand feeling rushed on anne of be most consoling that must soon be over be soon over in two minute after charles preparation others appeared be in drawing room eye half met captain wentworth bow curtsey passed heard voice talked to mary said be right said something to miss musgroves enough to mark easy footing room seemed full full of person voice few minute ended charles shewed at window be ready visitor have bowed be gone miss musgroves be gone too suddenly resolving to walk to end of village with sportsman room be cleared anne might finish breakfast a must be over be over repeated to herself again again in nervous gratitude worst be over mary talked must not attend have seen have met have be once more in same room soon however began to reason with herself try to be feeling le eight year almost eight year have passed since have be given up how absurd to be resuming agitation interval have banished into distance indistinctness what might not eight year do event of description change alienation removal must be comprised in oblivion of past how natural how certain too included nearly third part of own life ala with reasoning found that to retentive feeling eight year may be little more than nothing now how be sentiment to be read be like wishing to avoid next moment be hating for folly asked question on one other question perhaps utmost wisdom might not have prevented be soon spared suspense for after miss musgroves have returned finished visit at cottage have spontaneous information from mary captain wentworth be not very gallant by anne though be so attentive to henrietta asked what thought of when went away said 'you be so altered must not have known again ' mary have feeling to make respect sister in common way be perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting peculiar wound altered beyond knowledge anne fully submitted in silent deep mortification doubtless be so must take revenge for be not altered not for worse have already acknowledged to herself must not think differently let think of a must no year have destroyed youth bloom have only given more glowing manly open look in respect lessening personal

former captain to captain wentworth oh charles tell captain wentworth need not be afraid of mentioning poor dick before for must be rather pleasure to hear talked of by such good friend charles being somewhat more mindful of probability of case only nodded in reply walked away girl be now hunting for laconia captain wentworth must not deny pleasure of taking precious volume into own hand to save trouble once more read aloud little statement of name rate present non commissioned class observing over that too have be one of best friend man ever have ah be pleasant day when have laconia how fast

of poor richard poor dear fellow continued mr musgrove be grown so steady such excellent correspondent while be under care ah must have be happy thing if have never left assure captain wentworth be very sorry ever left there be momentary expression in captain wentworth face at speech certain glance of bright eye curl of handsome mouth convinced anne instead of sharing in mr musgrove kind wish a to son have probably be at pain to get rid of be too transient indulgence of self amusement to be detected by who understood le than in moment be perfectly collected serious almost instantly afterwards coming up to sofa on mr musgrove be sitting took place by latter entered into conversation with in low voice about son doing with so much sympathy natural grace a shewed kindest consideration for be real unabsurd in parent feeling be actually on same sofa for mr musgrove have most readily made room for be divided only by mr musgrove be insignificant barrier indeed mr musgrove be of comfortable substantial size infinitely more fitted by nature to express good cheer good humour than tenderness sentiment while agitation of anne slender form pensive face may be considered a very completely screened captain wentworth must be allowed credit for self command with attended to large fat sighings over destiny of son whom alive nobody have cared for personal size mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportion large bulky figure have a good right to be in deep affliction a most graceful set of limb in world fair not fair there be unbecoming conjunction reason will patronize in vain taste can not tolerate ridicule will seize admiral after taking two three refreshing turn about room with hand behind being called to order by wife now came up to captain wentworth without observation of what might be interrupting thinking only of own thought began with if have be week later at lisbon last spring frederick must have be asked to give passage to lady mary grierson daughter must be glad be not week later then admiral abused for want of gallantry defended though professing that must never willingly admit lady on board ship of excepting for ball visit few hour might comprehend if know myself said be from want of gallantry towards be rather from feeling how impossible be with one effort one sacrifice to make accommodation on board such a woman ought to have there can be want of gallantry admiral in rating claim of woman to personal comfort high be do hate to hear of woman on board to see on board ship under command will ever convey family of lady anywhere if can help brought sister upon oh frederick can not believe of idle refinement woman may be a comfortable on board a in best house in england believe have lived a much on board a most woman know nothing superior to accommodation of man of war declare have not comfort indulgence about even at kellynch hall with kind bow to anne beyond what always have in most of ship have lived in have be five altogether nothing to purpose replied brother be living with husband be only woman on board brought mr harville sister cousin three child round from portsmouth to plymouth where be superfine extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then merged in friendship sophia must assist brother officer wife must must bring anything of harville from world end if wanted imagine did not feel evil in depend upon be perfectly comfortable might not like better for perhaps number of woman child have right to be comfortable on board dear frederick be talking quite idly pray what must become of poor sailor wife who often want to be conveyed to one port after husband if everybody have feeling feeling see did not prevent taking mr harville family to plymouth hate to hear talking so like fine gentleman a if woman be fine lady instead of rational creature none of expect to be in smooth water day ah dear said admiral when have got wife will sing different tune when be married if have good luck to live to war will see do a great many others have done will have very thankful to anybody will bring wife ay that will now have done cried captain wentworth when once married people begin to attack with 'oh will think very differently when be married ' can only say 'no will not then say again 'yes will ' there be end of got up moved away what great traveller must have be ma'be said mr musgrove to mr croft pretty well ma'be in fifteen year of marriage though many woman have done more have crossed atlantic four time have be once to east indie back again only once besides being in different place about home cork lisbon gibraltar never went beyond streights never be in west indie call bermuda bahama know west indie mr musgrove have not word to say in dissent must not accuse herself of having ever called anything in whole course of life do assure ma'be pursued mr croft that nothing can exceed accommodation of man of war speak know of higher rate when come to frigate of course be more confined though reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of can safely say that happiest part of life have be spent on board ship while be together know there be nothing to be feared thank god have always be blessed with excellent health climate disagrees with little disordered always first twenty four hour of going to sea never knew what sickness be afterwards only time ever really suffered in body mind only time that ever fancied unwell have idea of danger be winter passed by at deal when admiral captain croft then be in north sea lived in perpetual fright at time have manner of imaginary complaint from not knowing what to do with when must hear from next a long a must be together nothing ever ailed never met with smallest inconvenience aye to be sure yes indeed oh yes be quite of opinion mr croft be mr musgrove hearty answer there be nothing so bad a separation be quite of opinion know what be for mr musgrove always attends assize be so glad when be over be safe back again evening ended with dancing on being proposed anne offered service a usual though eye must sometimes fill with tear a sat at instrument be extremely glad to be employed desired nothing in return to be unobserved be merry joyous party one seemed in higher spirit than captain wentworth felt that have thing to elevate general attention deference especially attention of young woman must do miss hayters female of family of cousin already mentioned be apparently admitted to honour of being in love with a for henrietta louisa seemed so entirely occupied by that nothing continued appearance of most perfect good will between must have made credible that be not decided rival if be little spoilt by such universal such eager admiration who must wonder be of thought occupied anne while finger be mechanically at work proceeding for hour together equally without error without consciousness once felt that be looking at observing altered feature perhaps trying to trace in ruin of face have once charmed once knew that must have spoken of be hardly aware of till heard answer then be sure of having asked partner whether miss elliot never danced answer be oh never have quite given up dancing have rather play be never tired of playing once too spoke to have left instrument on dancing being over have sat down to try to make out air wished to give miss musgroves idea of unintentionally returned to part of room saw instantly rising said with studied politeness beg pardon madam be seat though immediately drew back with decided negative be not to be induced to sit down again anne did not wish for more of such look speech cold politeness ceremonious grace be worse than anything chapter captain wentworth be come to kellynch a to home to stay a long a liked being a thoroughly object of admiral fraternal kindness a of wife have intended on first arriving to proceed very soon into shropshire visit brother settled in country attraction of uppercross induced to put off there be so much of friendliness of flattery of everything most bewitching in reception there old be so hospitable young so agreeable that must not resolve to remain where be take charm perfection of edward wife upon credit little longer be soon uppercross with almost day musgroves must hardly be more ready to invite than to come particularly in morning when have companion at home for admiral mr croft be generally out of door together interesting in new possession grass sheep dawdling about in way not endurable to third person driving out in gig lately added to establishment hitherto there have be one opinion of captain wentworth among musgroves dependency be unvarying warm admiration everywhere intimate footing be not more than established when certain charles hayter returned among to be good deal disturbed by to think captain wentworth very much in way charles hayter be eldest of cousin very amiable pleasing young man between whom henrietta there have be considerable appearance of attachment previous to captain wentworth introduction be in order having curacy in neighbourhood where residence be not required lived at father house only two mile from uppercross short absence from home have left fair one unguarded by attention at critical period when came back have pain of finding very altered manner of seeing captain wentworth mr musgrove mr hayter be sister have have money marriage have made material difference in degree of consequence mr hayter have property of own be insignificant compared with mr musgrove while musgroves be in first class of society in country young hayters must from parent inferior retired unpolished way of living own defective education have be hardly in class at for connexion with uppercross eldest son of course excepted who have chosen to be scholar gentleman who be very superior in cultivation manner to rest two family have always be on excellent term there being pride on one side envy on other only such consciousness of superiority in miss musgroves a made pleased to improve cousin charles attention to henrietta have be observed by father mother without disapprobation must not be great match for if henrietta liked henrietta did seem to like henrietta fully thought so before captain wentworth came from time cousin charles have be very much forgotten of two sister be preferred by captain wentworth be a yet quite doubtful a far a anne observation reached henrietta be perhaps prettiest louisa have higher spirit knew not now whether more gentle more lively character be most likely to attract mr mr musgrove from seeing little from entire confidence in discretion of daughter of young men who came near seemed to leave everything to take chance there be not smallest appearance of solicitude remark about in mansion house be different at cottage young couple there be more disposed to speculate wonder captain wentworth have not be above four five time in miss musgroves company charles hayter have just reappeared when anne have to listen to opinion of brother sister a to be one liked best charles gave for louisa mary for henrietta quite agreeing that to have marry must be extremely delightful charles have never seen pleasanter man in life from what have once heard captain wentworth say be very sure that have not made le than twenty thousand pound by war here be fortune at once besides there must be chance of what might be done in future war be sure captain wentworth be a likely man to distinguish a officer in navy oh must be capital match for of sister upon word must replied mary dear if must rise to very great honour if must ever be made baronet wentworth ' sound very well must be noble thing indeed for henrietta must take place of then henrietta must not dislike that sir frederick lady wentworth must be new creation however never think much of new creation suited mary best to think one preferred on very account of charles hayter whose pretension wished to see put end to looked down very decidedly upon hayters thought must be quite misfortune to have existing connection between family renewed very sad for herself child know said can not think at fit match for henrietta considering alliance musgroves have made have right to throw away think young woman have right to make choice may be disagreeable inconvenient to principal part of family be giving bad connection to who have not be used to pray who be charles hayter nothing country curate most improper match for miss musgrove of uppercross husband however must not agree with here for besides having regard for cousin charles hayter be eldest son saw thing a eldest son now be talking nonsense mary be therefore answer must not be great match for henrietta charles have very fair chance through spicers of getting something from bishop in course of year two will please to remember that be eldest son whenever uncle dy step into very pretty property estate at winthrop be not le than two hundred fifty acre besides farm near taunton be of best land in country grant that of charles must be very shocking match for henrietta indeed must not be be only one must be possible be very good natured good sort of fellow whenever winthrop come into hand will make different sort of place of live in very different sort of way with property will never be contemptible man good freehold property henrietta might do worse than marry charles hayter if have louisa can get captain wentworth will be very well satisfied charles may say what plea cried mary to anne a soon a be out of room must be shocking to have henrietta marry charles hayter very bad thing for still worse for therefore be very much to be wished that captain wentworth may soon put quite out of head have very little doubt that have took hardly notice of charles hayter yesterday wish have be there to see behaviour a to captain wentworth liking louisa a well a henrietta be nonsense to say so for certainly doe like henrietta great deal best charles be so positive wish have be with yesterday for then might have decided between be sure must have thought a did unless have be determined to give against dinner at mr musgrove have be occasion when thing must have be seen by anne have staid at home under mixed plea of headache of own return of indisposition in little charles have thought only of avoiding captain wentworth escape from being appealed to a umpire be now added to advantage of quiet evening a to captain wentworth view deemed of more consequence that must know own mind early enough not to be endangering happiness of sister impeaching own honour than that must prefer henrietta to louisa louisa to henrietta of must in probability make affectionate good humoured wife with regard to charles hayter have delicacy must be pained by lightness of conduct in well meaning young woman heart to sympathize in of suffering occasioned if henrietta found mistaken in nature of feeling alternation must not be understood too soon charles hayter have met with much to disquiet mortify in cousin behaviour have too old regard for to be so wholly estranged a might in two meeting extinguish past hope leave nothing to do to keep away from uppercross there be such change a became very alarming when man a captain wentworth be to be regarded a probable cause have be absent only two sunday when parted have left interested even to height of wish in prospect of soon quitting present curacy obtaining that of uppercross instead have then seemed object nearest heart that dr shirley rector who for more than forty year have be zealously discharging duty of office be now growing too infirm for many of must be quite fixed on engaging curate must make curacy quite a good a must afford must give charles hayter promise of advantage of having to come only to uppercross instead of going six mile way of having in respect better curacy of belonging to dear dr shirley of dear good dr shirley being relieved from duty must no longer get through without most injurious fatigue have be great deal even to louisa have be almost everything to henrietta when came back ala zeal of business be gone by louisa must not listen at to account of conversation have just held with dr shirley be at window looking out for captain wentworth even henrietta have at best only divided attention to give seemed to have forgotten former doubt solicitude of negotiation well be very glad indeed always thought must have always thought sure did not appear to that in short know dr shirley must have curate have secured promise be coming louisa one morning very soon after dinner at musgroves at anne have not be present captain wentworth walked into drawing room at cottage where be only little invalid charles who be lying on sofa surprise of finding almost alone with anne elliot deprived manner of usual composure started must only say thought miss musgroves have be here mr musgrove told must find here before walked to window to recollect feel how ought to behave be up stair with sister will be down in few moment dare say have be anne reply in confusion be natural if child have not called to come do something for must have be out of room next moment released captain wentworth a well a herself continued at window after calmly politely saying hope little boy be better be silent be obliged to kneel down by sofa remain there to satisfy patient thus continued few minute when to very great satisfaction heard other person crossing little vestibule hoped on turning head to see master of house proved to be one much le calculated for making matter easy charles hayter probably not at better pleased by sight of captain wentworth than captain wentworth have be by sight of anne only attempted to say how do do will not sit down others will be here presently captain wentworth however came from window apparently not ill disposed for conversation charles hayter soon put end to attempt by seating near table taking up newspaper captain wentworth returned to window minute brought addition younger boy remarkable stout forward child of two year old having got door opened for by one without made determined appearance among went straight to sofa to see what be going on put in claim to anything good might be giving away there being nothing to eat must only have play a aunt must not let tease sick brother began to fasten upon a knelt in such way busy a be about charles must not shake off spoke to ordered entreated insisted in vain once did contrive to push away boy have greater pleasure in getting upon back again directly walter said get down moment be extremely troublesome be very angry with walter cried charles hayter why do not do a be bid hear aunt speak come to walter come to cousin charles not bit did walter stir in moment however found in state of being released from one be taking from though have bent down head so much that little sturdy hand be unfastened from around neck be resolutely borne away before knew that captain wentworth have done sensation on discovery made perfectly speechless must not even thank must only hang over little charles with most disordered feeling kindness in stepping forward to relief manner silence in have passed little particular of circumstance with conviction soon forced on by noise be studiously making with child that meant to avoid hearing thanks rather sought to testify that conversation be last of want produced confusion of varying very painful agitation a must not recover from till enabled by entrance of mary miss musgroves to make over little patient to care leave room must not stay might have be opportunity of watching love jealousy of four be now altogether must stay for none of be evident that charles hayter be not well inclined towards captain wentworth have strong impression of having said in vext tone of voice after captain wentworth interference ought to have minded walter told not to teaze aunt must comprehend regretting captain wentworth must do what ought to have done charles hayter feeling anybody feeling must interest till have little better arranged own be ashamed of quite ashamed of being so nervous so overcome by such trifle so be required long application of solitude reflection to recover chapter other opportunity of making observation must not fail to occur anne have soon be in company with four together often enough to have opinion though too wise to acknowledge a much at home where knew must have satisfied husband wife for while considered louisa to be rather favourite must not think a far a might dare to judge from memory experience captain wentworth be not in love with be more in love with yet there be not love be little fever of admiration might probably must end in love with charles hayter seemed aware of being slighted yet henrietta have sometimes air of being divided between anne longed for power of representing to what be about of pointing out of evil be exposing to did not attribute guile to be highest satisfaction to to believe captain wentworth not in least aware of pain be occasioning there be triumph pitiful triumph in manner have probably never heard never thought of claim of charles hayter be only wrong in accepting attention for accepting must be word of two young woman at once after short struggle however charles hayter seemed to quit field three day have passed without coming once to uppercross most decided change have even refused one regular invitation to dinner having be found on occasion by mr musgrove with large book before mr mr musgrove be sure must not be right talked with grave face of studying to death be mary hope belief that have received positive dismissal from henrietta husband lived under constant dependence of seeing to morrow anne must only feel that charles hayter be wise one morning about time charles musgrove captain wentworth being gone shooting together a sister in cottage be sitting quietly at work be visited at window by sister from mansion house be very fine november day miss musgroves came through little ground stopped for other purpose than to say that be going to take long walk therefore concluded mary must not like to go with when mary immediately replied with jealousy at not being supposed good walker oh yes must like to join very much be very fond of long walk anne felt persuaded by look of two girl that be precisely what did not wish admired again sort of necessity family habit seemed to produce of everything being to be communicated everything being to be done together however undesired inconvenient tried to dissuade mary from going in vain that being case thought best to accept miss musgroves much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise a might be useful in turning back with sister lessening interference in plan of own can not imagine why must suppose must not like long walk said mary a went up stair everybody be always supposing that be not good walker yet must not have be pleased if have refused to join when people come in manner on purpose to ask how can one say just a be setting off gentleman returned have taken out young dog who have spoilt sport sent back early time strength spirit be therefore exactly ready for walk entered into with pleasure must anne have foreseen such junction must have staid at home from feeling of interest curiosity fancied now that be too late to retract whole six set forward together in direction chosen by miss musgroves who evidently considered walk a under guidance anne object be not to be in way of anybody where narrow path across field made many separation necessary to keep with brother sister pleasure in walk must arise from exercise day from view of last smile of year upon tawny leaf withered hedge from repeating to herself few of thousand poetical description extant of autumn that season of peculiar inexhaustible influence on mind of taste tenderness that season have drawn from poet worthy of being read attempt at description line of feeling occupied mind a much a possible in such like musing quotation be not possible that when within reach of captain wentworth conversation with of miss musgroves must not try to hear yet caught little very remarkable be mere lively chat such a young person on intimate footing might fall into be more engaged with louisa than with henrietta louisa certainly put more forward for notice than sister distinction appeared to increase there be one speech of louisa struck after one of many praise of day be continually bursting forth captain wentworth added what glorious weather for admiral sister meant to take long drive morning perhaps may hail from of hill talked of coming into side of country wonder whereabouts will upset to day oh doe happen very often assure sister make nothing of must a lieve be tossed out a not ah make most of know cried louisa if be really so must do just same in place if loved man a love admiral must always be with nothing must ever separate must rather be overturned by than driven safely by anybody else be spoken with enthusiasm have cried catching same tone honour there be silence between for little while anne must not immediately fall into quotation again sweet scene of autumn be for while put by unless tender sonnet fraught with apt analogy of declining year with declining happiness image of youth hope spring gone together blessed memory roused to say a struck by order into path be not one of way to winthrop nobody heard at least nobody answered winthrop however environs for young men be sometimes to be met with strolling about near home be destination after half mile of gradual ascent through large enclosure where plough at work fresh made path spoke farmer counteracting sweet of poetical despondence meaning to have spring again gained summit of most considerable hill parted uppercross winthrop soon commanded full view of latter at foot of hill on other side winthrop without beauty without dignity be stretched before indifferent house standing low hemmed in by barn building of farm yard mary exclaimed bless here be winthrop declare have idea well now think have better turn back be excessively tired henrietta conscious ashamed seeing cousin charles walking along path leaning against gate be ready to do a mary wished said charles musgrove cried louisa more eagerly taking sister aside seemed to be arguing matter warmly charles in meanwhile be very decidedly declaring resolution of calling on aunt now that be so near very evidently though more fearfully trying to induce wife to go too be one of point on lady shewed strength when recommended advantage of resting quarter of hour at winthrop a felt so tired resolutely answered oh indeed walking up hill again must do more harm than sitting down must do good in short look manner declared that go must not after little succession of sort of debate consultation be settled between charles two sister that henrietta must just run down for few minute to see aunt cousin while rest of party waited for at top of hill louisa seemed principal arranger of plan a went little way with down hill still talking to henrietta mary took opportunity of looking scornfully around saying to captain wentworth be very unpleasant having such connexion assure have never be in house above twice in life received other answer than artificial assenting smile followed by contemptuous glance a turned away anne perfectly knew meaning of brow of hill where remained be cheerful spot louisa returned mary finding comfortable seat for herself on step of stile be very well satisfied so long a others stood about when louisa drew captain wentworth away to try for gleaning of nut in adjoining hedge row be gone by degree quite out of sight sound mary be happy no longer quarrelled with own seat be sure louisa have got much better somewhere nothing must prevent from going to look for better also turned through same gate must not see anne found nice seat for on dry sunny bank under hedge row in have doubt of still being in spot other mary sat down for moment must not do be sure louisa have found better seat somewhere else must go on till overtook anne really tired be glad to sit down very soon heard captain wentworth louisa in hedge row behind a if making way back along rough wild sort of channel down centre be speaking a drew near louisa voice be first distinguished seemed to be in middle of eager speech what anne first heard be so made go must not bear that must be frightened from visit by such nonsense what must be turned back from doing thing have determined to do that knew to be right by air interference of person of person may say have idea of being so easily persuaded when have made up mind have made henrietta seemed entirely to have made up hers to call at winthrop to day yet be a near giving up out of nonsensical complaisance must have turned back then for must indeed be almost ashamed to say happy for to have mind a yours at hand after hint gave just now did confirm own observation last time be in company with need not affect to have comprehension of what be going on see that more than mere dutiful morning visit to aunt be in question woe betide too when come to thing of consequence when be placed in circumstance requiring fortitude strength of mind if have not resolution enough to resist idle interference in such trifle a sister be amiable creature yours be character of decision firmness see if value conduct happiness infuse a much of own spirit into a can doubt have be always doing be worst evil of too yielding indecisive character influence over can be depended on be never sure of good impression being durable everybody may sway let who must be happy be firm here be nut said catching one down from upper bough to exemplify beautiful glossy nut blessed with original strength have outlived storm of autumn not puncture not weak spot anywhere nut continued with playful solemnity while so many of brother have fallen be trodden under foot be still in possession of happiness that hazel nut can be supposed capable of then returning to former earnest tone first wish for whom be interested in be that must be firm if louisa musgrove must be beautiful happy in november of life will cherish present power of mind have done be unanswered must have surprised anne if louisa must have readily answered speech word of such interest spoken with such serious warmth must imagine what louisa be feeling for feared to move lest must be seen while remained bush of low rambling holly protected be moving on before be beyond hearing however louisa spoke again mary be good natured enough in many respect said doe sometimes provoke excessively by nonsense pride elliot pride have great deal too much of elliot pride do so wish that charles have married anne instead suppose know wanted to marry anne after moment pause captain wentworth said do mean that refused oh yes certainly when did that happen exactly know for henrietta be at school at time believe about year before married mary wish have accepted must have liked great deal better papa mamma always think be great friend lady russell doing that did not think charles might not be learned bookish enough to please lady russell that therefore persuaded anne to refuse sound be retreating anne distinguished more own emotion still kept fixed have much to recover from before must move listener proverbial fate be not absolutely hers have heard evil of herself have heard great deal of very painful import saw how own character be considered by captain wentworth there have be just degree of feeling curiosity about in manner must give extreme agitation a soon a must went after mary having found walked back with to former station by stile felt comfort in whole party being immediately afterwards collected once more in motion together spirit wanted solitude silence only number must give charles henrietta returned bringing a may be conjectured charles hayter with minutia of business anne must not attempt to understand even captain wentworth did not seem admitted to perfect confidence here that there have be withdrawing on gentleman side relenting on lady that be now very glad to be together again did not admit doubt henrietta looked little ashamed very well pleased charles hayter exceedingly happy be devoted to other almost from first instant of setting forward for uppercross everything now marked out louisa for captain wentworth nothing must be plainer where many division be necessary even where be not walked side by side nearly a much a other two in long strip of meadow land where there be ample space for be thus divided forming three distinct party to party of three boasted least animation least complaisance anne necessarily belonged joined charles mary be tired enough to be very glad of charles other arm charles though in very good humour with be out of temper with wife mary have shewn disobliging to be now to reap consequence consequence be dropping arm almost moment to cut off head of nettle in hedge with switch when mary began to complain of lament being ill used according to custom in being on hedge side while anne be never incommoded on other dropped arm of to hunt after weasel have momentary glance of must hardly get along at long meadow bordered

only doubt be whether anything must persuade to leave parish be so very strict scrupulous in notion over scrupulous must say think anne be being over scrupulous think be quite mistaken point of conscience when clergyman sacrifice health for sake of duty may be just a well performed by person at lyme too only seventeen mile off must be near enough to hear if people thought there be anything to complain of anne smiled more than once to herself during speech entered into subject a ready to do good by entering into feeling of young lady a of young man though here be good of lower standard for what must be offered general acquiescence said be reasonable proper on business felt claim of dr shirley to repose a ought saw how very desirable be that must have active respectable young man a

only true true surgeon instant be darting away when anne eagerly suggested captain benwick must not be better for captain benwick know where surgeon be to be found one capable of thinking felt advantage of idea in moment be done in rapid moment captain benwick have resigned poor corpse like figure entirely to brother care be off for town with utmost rapidity a to wretched party left behind must scarcely be said of three who be completely rational be suffering most captain wentworth anne charles who really very affectionate brother hung over louisa with sob of grief must only turn eye from one sister to see other in state a insensible to witness hysterical agitation of wife calling on for help must not give anne attending with strength zeal thought instinct supplied to henrietta still tried at interval to suggest comfort to others tried to quiet mary to animate charles to assuage feeling of captain wentworth seemed to look to for direction anne anne cried charles what be to be done next what in heaven name be to be done next captain wentworth eye be also turned towards have not better be carried to inn yes be sure carry gently to inn yes yes to inn repeated captain

partially revived be quite helpless in manner anne walking by side charles attending to wife set forward treading back with feeling unutterable ground so lately so very lately so light of heart have passed along be not off cobb before harvilles met captain benwick have be seen flying by house with countenance showed something to be wrong have set off immediately informed directed a passed towards spot shocked a captain harville be brought sens nerve must be instantly useful look between wife decided what be to be done must be taken to house must go to house await surgeon arrival there must not listen to scruple be obeyed be beneath roof while louisa under mr harville direction be conveyed up stair given possession of own bed assistance cordial restorative be supplied by husband to who needed louisa have once opened eye soon closed again without apparent consciousness have be proof of life however of service to sister henrietta though perfectly incapable of being in same room with louisa be kept by agitation of hope fear from return of own insensibility mary too be growing calmer surgeon be with almost before have seemed possible be sick with horror while examined be not head have received severe contusion have seen greater injury recovered from be by mean hopeless spoke cheerfully that did not regard a desperate case that did not say few hour must end be at first felt beyond hope of most ecstasy of such reprieve rejoicing deep silent after few fervent ejaculation of gratitude to heaven have be offered may be conceived tone look with thank god be uttered by captain wentworth anne be sure must never be forgotten by sight of afterwards a sat near table leaning over with folded arm face concealed a if overpowered by various feeling of soul trying by prayer reflection to calm be limb have escaped there be injury to head now became necessary for party to consider what be best to be done a to general situation be now able to speak to other consult that louisa must remain where be however distressing to friend to be involving harvilles in such trouble did not admit doubt removal be impossible harvilles silenced scruple a much a must gratitude have looked forward arranged everything before others began to reflect captain benwick must give up room to get bed elsewhere whole be settled be only concerned that house must accommodate more yet perhaps by putting child away in maid room swinging cot somewhere must hardly bear to think of not finding room for two three besides supposing might wish to stay though with regard to attendance on miss musgrove there need not be least uneasiness in leaving to mr harville care entirely mr harville be very experienced nurse nursery maid who have lived with long gone about with everywhere be just such between two must want possible attendance by day night be said with truth sincerity of feeling irresistible charles henrietta captain be three in consultation for little while be only interchange of perplexity terror uppercross necessity of one going to uppercross news to be conveyed how must be broken to mr mr musgrove lateness of morning hour already gone since ought to have be off impossibility of being in tolerable time at first be capable of nothing more to purpose than such exclamation after while captain wentworth exerting said must be decided without loss of minute minute be valuable one must resolve on being off for uppercross instantly musgrove must go charles agreed declared resolution of not going away must be a little incumbrance a possible to captain mr harville a to leaving sister in such state ought must so far be decided henrietta at first declared same however be soon persuaded to think differently usefulness of staying who have not be able to remain in louisa room to look at without suffering made worse than helpless be forced to acknowledge that must do good yet be still unwilling to be away till touched by thought of father mother gave up consented be anxious to be at home plan have reached point when anne coming quietly down from louisa room must not hear followed for parlour door be open then be settled musgrove cried captain wentworth that stay take care of sister home a to rest a to others if one stay to assist mr harville think need be only one mr charles musgrove will of course wish to get back to child if anne will stay one so proper so capable a anne paused moment to recover from emotion of hearing so spoken of other two warmly agreed with what said then appeared will stay be sure will stay nurse cried turning to speaking with glow yet gentleness seemed almost restoring past coloured deeply recollected moved away expressed most willing ready happy to remain be what have be thinking of wishing to be allowed to do bed on floor in louisa room must be sufficient for if mr harville must think so one thing more seemed arranged though be rather desirable that mr mr musgrove must be previously alarmed by share of delay yet time required by uppercross horse to take back must be dreadful extension of suspense captain wentworth proposed charles musgrove agreed that must be much better for to take chaise from inn leave mr musgrove carriage horse to be sent home next morning early when there must be farther advantage of sending account of louisa night captain wentworth now hurried off to get everything ready on part to be soon followed by two lady when plan be made known to mary however there be end of peace in be so wretched so vehement complained so much of injustice in being expected to go away instead of anne anne who be nothing to louisa while be sister have best right to stay in henrietta stead why be not to be a useful a anne to go home without charles too without husband be too unkind in short said more than husband must long withstand a none of others must oppose when gave way there be help for change of mary for anne be inevitable anne have never submitted more reluctantly to jealous ill judging claim of mary so must be set off for town charles taking care of sister captain benwick attending to gave moment recollection a hurried along to little circumstance same spot have witnessed earlier in morning there have listened to henrietta scheme for dr shirley leaving uppercross farther on have first seen mr elliot moment seemed must now be given to one louisa who be wrapt up in welfare captain benwick be most considerately attentive to united a seemed by distress of day felt increasing degree of good will towards pleasure even in thinking that might perhaps be occasion of continuing acquaintance captain wentworth be on watch for chaise four in waiting stationed for convenience in lowest part of street evident surprise vexation at substitution of one sister for other change in countenance astonishment expression begun suppressed with charles be listened to made mortifying reception of anne must at least convince that be valued only a must be useful to louisa endeavoured to be composed to be just without emulating feeling of emma towards henry must have attended on louisa with zeal above common claim of regard for sake hoped must not long be so unjust a to suppose must shrink unnecessarily from office of friend in mean while be in carriage have handed in placed between in manner under circumstance full of astonishment emotion to anne quitted lyme how long stage must pas how be to affect manner what be to be sort of intercourse must not foresee be quite natural however be devoted to henrietta always turning towards when spoke at always with view of supporting hope raising spirit in general voice manner be studiously calm to spare henrietta from agitation seemed governing principle once only when have be grieving over last ill judged ill fated walk to cobb bitterly lamenting that ever have be thought of burst forth a if wholly overcome talk of talk of cried oh god have not given way to at fatal moment have done a ought so eager so resolute dear sweet louisa anne wondered whether ever occurred to now to question justness of own previous opinion a to universal felicity advantage of firmness of character whether might not strike that like other quality of mind must have proportion limit thought must scarcely escape to feel that persuadable temper might sometimes be a much in favour of happiness a very resolute character got on fast anne be astonished to recognise same hill same object so soon actual speed heightened by dread of conclusion made road appear half a long a on day before be growing quite dusk however before be in neighbourhood of uppercross there have be total silence among for time henrietta leaning back in corner with shawl over face giving hope of having cried to sleep when a be going up last hill anne found at once addressed by captain wentworth in low cautious voice said have be considering what have best do must not appear at first must not stand have be thinking whether have not better remain in

really left nothing for mary to do mary have be persuaded to go early to inn last night mary have be hysterical again morning when came away be going to walk out with captain benwick hoped must do good almost wished have be prevailed on to come home day before truth be that mr harville left nothing for anybody to do charles be to return to lyme same afternoon father have at first mind to go

really be be doing turning to anne fancied that if went with must find close by fancied everybody to be living in uppercross when discovered that lady russell lived three mile off heart failed have not courage to come be fact upon honour mary know be mary did not give into very graciously whether from not considering captain benwick entitled by birth situation to be in love with elliot from not wanting to believe anne greater attraction to uppercross than must be left to be guessed anne good will however be not to be lessened by what heard boldly acknowledged flattered continued enquiry oh talk of cried charles in such term mary interrupted declare charles never heard mention anne twice time be there declare anne never talk of at admitted charles know that ever doe in general way

end of miss elliot charm be sure cried mary warmly be very little to credit if did miss harville only died last june heart be very little worth having be lady russell be sure will agree with must see

of fact a may call have really curiosity to see person who can give occasion to such directly opposite notion wish may be induced to call here when doe mary may depend upon hearing opinion be determined not to judge beforehand will not like will answer for lady russell began talking of something else mary spoke with animation of meeting with rather missing mr elliot so extraordinarily be man said lady russell whom have wish to see declining to be on cordial term with head of family have left very strong impression in disfavour with decision checked mary eagerness stopped short in midst of elliot countenance with regard to captain wentworth though anne hazarded enquiry there be voluntary communication sufficient spirit have be greatly recovering lately a might be expected a louisa improved have improved be now quite different creature from what have be first week have not seen louisa be so extremely fearful of ill consequence to from interview that did not press for at on contrary seemed to have plan of going away for week ten day till head be stronger have talked of going down to plymouth for week wanted to persuade captain benwick to go with a charles maintained to last captain benwick seemed much more disposed to ride over to kellynch there can be doubt that lady russell anne be occasionally thinking of captain benwick from time lady russell must not hear door bell without feeling that might be herald must anne return from stroll of solitary indulgence in father ground visit of charity in village without wondering whether might see hear of captain benwick came not however be either le disposed for than charles have imagined be too shy after giving week indulgence lady russell determined to be unworthy of interest have be beginning to excite musgroves came back to receive happy boy girl from school bringing with mr be little child to improve noise of uppercross lessen that of lyme henrietta remained with louisa rest of family be again in usual quarter lady russell anne paid compliment to once when anne must not feel that uppercross be already quite alive again though henrietta louisa charles hayter captain wentworth be there room presented a strong contrast a must be wished to last state have seen in immediately surrounding mr be little harvilles whom be sedulously guarding from tyranny of two child from cottage expressly arrived to amuse on one side be table occupied by chattering girl cutting up silk gold paper on other be tressels tray bending under weight of brawn cold pie where riotous boy be holding high revel whole completed by roaring christmas fire seemed determined to be heard in spite of noise of others charles mary also came in of course during visit mr musgrove made point of paying respect to lady russell sat down close to for ten minute talking with very raised voice from clamour of child on knee generally in vain be fine family piece anne judging from own temperament must have deemed domestic hurricane bad restorative of nerve louisa illness must have so greatly shaken mr musgrove who got anne near on purpose to thank most cordially again again for attention to concluded short recapitulation of what have suffered by observing with happy glance round room that after have gone through nothing be so likely to do good a little quiet cheerfulness at home louisa be now recovering apace mother must even think of being able to join party at home before brother sister went to school again harvilles have promised to come with stay at uppercross whenever returned captain wentworth be gone for present to see brother in shropshire hope will remember in future said lady russell a soon a be reseated in carriage not to call at uppercross in christmas holiday everybody have taste in noise a well a in other matter sound be quite innoxious most distressing by sort rather than quantity when lady russell not long afterwards be entering bath on wet afternoon driving through long course of street from old bridge to camden place amidst dash of other carriage heavy rumble of cart dray bawling of newspaperman muffin men milkman ceaseless clink of patten made complaint no be noise belonged to winter pleasure spirit rose under influence like mr musgrove be feeling though not saying that after being long in country nothing must be so good for a little quiet cheerfulness anne did not share feeling persisted in very determined though very silent disinclination for bath caught first dim view of extensive building smoking in rain without wish of seeing better felt progress through street to be however disagreeable yet too rapid for who must be glad to see when arrived looked back with fond regret to bustle of uppercross seclusion of kellynch elizabeth last letter have communicated piece of news of interest mr elliot be in bath have called in camden place have called second time third have be pointedly attentive if elizabeth father did not deceive have be taking much pain to seek acquaintance proclaim value of connection a have formerly taken pain to shew neglect be very wonderful if be true lady russell be in state of very agreeable curiosity perplexity about mr elliot already recanting sentiment have so lately expressed to mary of being man whom have wish to see have great wish to see if really sought to reconcile like dutiful branch must be forgiven for having dismembered from paternal tree anne be not animated to equal pitch by circumstance felt that must rather see mr elliot again than not be more than must say for many other person in bath be put down in camden place lady russell then drove to own lodging in river street chapter sir walter have taken very good house in camden place lofty dignified situation such a becomes man of consequence elizabeth be settled there much to satisfaction anne entered with sinking heart anticipating imprisonment of many month anxiously saying to herself oh when will leave again degree of unexpected cordiality however in welcome received did good father sister be glad to see for sake of shewing house furniture met with kindness making fourth when sat down to dinner be noticed a advantage mr clay be very pleasant very smiling courtesy smile be more matter of course anne have always felt that must pretend what be proper on arrival complaisance of others be unlooked for be evidently in excellent spirit be soon to listen to cause have inclination to listen to after laying out for compliment of being deeply regretted in old neighbourhood anne must not pay have only few faint enquiry to make before talk must be own uppercross excited interest kellynch very little be bath have pleasure of assuring bath more than answered expectation in respect house be undoubtedly best in camden place drawing room have many decided advantage over others have seen heard of superiority be not le in style of fitting up taste of furniture acquaintance be exceedingly sought after everybody be wanting to visit have drawn back from many introduction still be perpetually having card left by people of whom knew nothing here be fund of enjoyment must anne wonder that father sister be happy might not wonder must sigh that father must feel degradation in change must see nothing to regret in duty dignity of resident landholder must find so much to be vain of in littleness of town must sigh smile wonder too a elizabeth threw open folding door walked with exultation from one drawing room to other boasting of space at possibility of woman who have be mistress of kellynch hall finding extent to be proud of between two wall perhaps thirty foot asunder be not have to make happy have mr elliot too anne have great deal to hear of mr elliot be not only pardoned be delighted with have be in bath about fortnight have passed through bath in november in way to london when intelligence of sir walter being settled there have of course reached though only twenty four hour in place have not be able to avail of have now be fortnight in bath first object on arriving have be to leave card in camden place following up by such assiduous endeavour to meet when did meet by such great openness of conduct such readiness to apologize for past such solicitude to be received a relation again that former good understanding be completely re established have not fault to find in have explained away appearance of neglect on own side have originated in misapprehension entirely have never have idea of throwing off have feared that be thrown off knew not why delicacy have kept silent upon hint of having spoken disrespectfully carelessly of family family honour be quite indignant who have ever boasted of being elliot whose feeling a to connection be only too strict to suit unfeudal tone of present day be astonished indeed character general conduct must refute must refer sir walter to who knew certainly pain have be taking on first opportunity of reconciliation to be restored to footing of relation heir presumptive be strong proof of opinion on subject circumstance of marriage too be found to admit of much extenuation be article not to be entered on by very intimate friend of colonel wallis highly respectable man perfectly gentleman not ill looking man sir walter added who be living in very good style in marlborough building have at own particular request be admitted to acquaintance through mr elliot have mentioned one two thing relative to marriage made material difference in discredit of colonel wallis have known mr elliot long have be well acquainted also with wife have perfectly understood whole story be certainly not woman of family well educated accomplished rich excessively in love with friend there have be charm have sought without attraction not money must have tempted elliot sir walter be moreover assured of having be very fine woman here be great deal to soften business very fine woman with large fortune in love with sir walter seemed to admit a complete apology though elizabeth must not see circumstance in quite so favourable light allowed be great extenuation mr elliot have called repeatedly have dined with once evidently delighted by distinction of being asked for gave dinner in general delighted in short by proof of cousinly notice placing whole happiness in being on intimate term in camden place anne listened without quite understanding allowance large allowance knew must be made for idea of who spoke heard under embellishment sounded extravagant irrational in progress of reconciliation might have origin in language of relators still however have sensation of there being something more than immediately appeared in mr elliot wishing after interval of so many year to be well received by in worldly view have nothing to gain by being on term with sir walter nothing to risk by state of variance in probability be already richer of two kellynch estate must a surely be hereafter a title sensible man have looked like very sensible man why must be object to must only offer one solution be perhaps for elizabeth sake there might really have be liking formerly though convenience accident have drawn different way now that must afford to please might mean to pay address to elizabeth be certainly very handsome with well bred elegant manner character might never have be penetrated by mr elliot knowing in public when very young how temper understanding might bear investigation of present keener time of life be concern rather fearful one most earnestly did wish that might not be too nice too observant if elizabeth be object that elizabeth be disposed to believe so that friend mr clay be encouraging idea seemed apparent by glance two between while mr elliot frequent visit be talked of anne mentioned glimpse have have of at lyme without being much attended to oh yes perhaps have be mr elliot did not know might be perhaps must not listen to description of be describing sir walter especially did justice to very gentlemanlike appearance air of elegance fashion good shaped face sensible eye at same time must lament being very much under hung defect time seemed to have increased must pretend to say that ten year have not altered almost feature for worse mr elliot appeared to think that sir walter be looking exactly a have done when last parted sir walter have not be able to return compliment entirely have embarrassed did not mean to complain however mr elliot be better to look at than most men have objection to being seen with anywhere mr elliot friend in marlborough building be talked of whole evening colonel wallis have be so impatient to be introduced to mr elliot so anxious that must there be mr wallis at present known only to by description a be in daily expectation of confinement mr elliot spoke of a most charming woman quite worthy of being known in camden place a soon a recovered be to be acquainted sir walter thought much of mr wallis be said to be excessively pretty woman beautiful longed to see hoped might make amends for many very plain face be continually passing in street worst of bath be number of plain woman did not mean to say that there be pretty woman number of plain be out of proportion have frequently observed a walked that one handsome face must be followed by thirty five thirty fright once a have stood in shop on bond street have counted eighty seven woman go by one after without there being tolerable face among have be frosty morning to be sure sharp frost hardly one woman in thousand must stand test of still there certainly be dreadful multitude of ugly woman in bath a for men be infinitely worse such scarecrow a street be full of be evident how little woman be used to sight of anything tolerable by effect man of decent appearance produced have never walked anywhere arm in arm with colonel wallis who be fine military figure though sandy haired without observing woman eye be upon woman eye be sure to be upon colonel wallis modest sir walter be not allowed to escape however daughter mr clay united in hinting that colonel wallis companion might have a good figure a colonel wallis certainly be not sandy haired how be mary looking said sir walter in height of good humour last time saw have red nose hope may not happen day oh must have be quite accidental in general have be in very good health very good look since michaelmas if thought must not tempt to go out in sharp wind grow coarse must send new hat pelisse anne be considering whether must venture to suggest that gown cap must not be liable to such misuse when knock at door suspended everything knock at door so late be ten o'clock must be mr elliot knew be to dine in lansdown crescent be possible that might stop in way home to ask how did must think of one else mr clay decidedly thought mr elliot knock mr clay be right with state butler foot boy must give mr elliot be ushered into room be same very same man with difference of dress anne drew little back while others received compliment sister apology for calling at so unusual hour must not be so near without wishing to know that friend have taken cold day before c c be a politely done a politely taken a possible part must follow then sir walter talked of youngest daughter mr elliot must give leave to present to youngest daughter there be occasion for remembering mary anne smiling blushing very becomingly shewed to mr elliot pretty feature have by mean forgotten instantly saw with amusement at little start of surprise that have not be at aware of who be looked completely astonished not more astonished than pleased eye brightened with most perfect alacrity welcomed relationship alluded to past entreated to be received a acquaintance already be quite a good looking a have appeared at lyme countenance improved by speaking manner be so exactly what ought to be so polished so easy so particularly agreeable that must compare in excellence to only one person manner be not same be perhaps equally good sat down with improved conversation very much there must be doubt of being sensible man ten minute be enough to certify that tone expression choice of subject knowing where to stop be operation of sensible discerning mind a soon a must began to talk to of lyme wanting to compare opinion respecting place especially wanting to speak of circumstance of happening to be guest in same inn at same time to give own route understand something of hers regret that must have lost opportunity of paying respect to gave short account of party business at lyme regret increased a listened have spent whole solitary evening in room adjoining have heard voice mirth continually thought must be most delightful set of people longed to be with certainly without smallest suspicion of

quite young man on principal of being very ungenteel to be curious notion of young man of one two twenty said a to what be necessary in manner to make quite thing be more absurd believe than of other set of being in world folly of mean often employ be only to be equalled by folly of what have in view must not be addressing reflection to anne alone knew be soon diffused again among others be only at interval that must return to lyme enquiry however produced at length account of scene have be engaged in there soon after leaving place having alluded to accident must hear whole when questioned sir walter elizabeth began to question also difference in manner of doing must not be unfelt must only compare mr elliot to lady russell in wish of really comprehending what have passed in degree of concern for what must have suffered in witnessing staid hour with elegant little clock on mantel piece have struck eleven with silver sound watchman be beginning to be heard at distance telling same tale before mr elliot of seemed to feel that have be there long anne must not have supposed possible that first evening in camden place must have passed so well chapter there be one point anne on returning to family must have be more thankful to ascertain even than mr elliot being in love with elizabeth be father not being in love with mr clay be very far from easy about when have be at home few hour on going down to breakfast next morning found there have just be decent pretence on lady side of meaning to leave must imagine mr clay to have said that now miss anne be come must not suppose at wanted for elizabeth be replying in sort of whisper must not be reason indeed assure feel none be nothing to compared with be in full time to hear father say dear madam must not be a yet have seen nothing of bath have be here only to be useful must not run away from now must stay to be acquainted with mr wallis beautiful mr wallis to fine mind well know sight of beauty be real gratification spoke looked so much in earnest that anne be not surprised to see mr clay stealing glance at elizabeth countenance perhaps might express watchfulness praise of fine mind did not appear to excite thought in sister lady must not yield to such joint entreaty promise to stay in course of same morning anne father chancing to be alone together began to compliment on improved look thought le thin in person in cheek skin complexion greatly improved clearer fresher have be using thing in particular nothing merely gowland supposed nothing at have be surprised at added certainly can not do better than to continue a be can not be better than well must recommend gowland constant use of gowland during spring month mr clay have be using at recommendation see what have done for see how have carried away freckle if elizabeth must have heard such personal praise might have struck especially a did not appear to anne that freckle be at lessened everything must take chance evil of marriage must be much diminished if elizabeth be also to marry a for might always command home with lady russell lady russell composed mind polite manner be put to trial on point in intercourse in camden place sight of mr clay in such favour of anne so overlooked be perpetual provocation to there vexed a much when be away a person in bath who drink water get new publication have very large acquaintance have time to be vexed a mr elliot became known to grew more charitable more indifferent towards others manner be immediate recommendation on conversing with found solid so fully supporting superficial that be at first a told anne almost ready to exclaim can be mr elliot must not seriously picture to herself more agreeable estimable man everything united in good understanding correct opinion knowledge of world warm heart have strong feeling of family attachment family honour without pride weakness lived with liberality of man of fortune without display judged for in everything essential without defying public opinion in point of worldly decorum be steady observant moderate candid never run away with by spirit by selfishness fancied strong feeling yet with sensibility to what be amiable lovely value for felicity of domestic life character of fancied enthusiasm violent agitation seldom really posse be sure that have not be happy in marriage colonel wallis said lady russell saw have be no unhappiness to sour mind began pretty soon to suspect to prevent thinking of second choice satisfaction in mr elliot outweighed plague of mr clay be now year since anne have begun to learn that excellent friend must sometimes think differently did not surprise therefore that lady russell must see nothing suspicious inconsistent nothing to require more motif than appeared in mr elliot great desire of reconciliation in lady russell view be perfectly natural that mr elliot at mature time of life must feel most desirable object must very generally recommend among sensible people to be on good term with head of family simplest process in world of time upon head naturally clear only erring in heyday of youth anne presumed however still to smile about at last to mention elizabeth lady russell listened looked made only cautious reply elizabeth very well time will explain be reference to future anne after little observation felt must submit to must determine nothing at present in house elizabeth must be first be in habit of such general observance a miss elliot that particularity of attention seemed almost impossible mr elliot too must be remembered have not be widower seven month little delay on side might be very excusable in fact anne must never see crape round hat without fearing that be inexcusable one in attributing to such imagination for though marriage have not be very happy still have existed so many year that must not comprehend very rapid recovery from awful impression of being dissolved however might end be without question pleasantest acquaintance in bath saw nobody equal to be great indulgence now then to talk to about lyme seemed to have a lively wish to see again to see more of a herself went through particular of first meeting great many time gave to understand that have looked at with earnestness knew well remembered person look also did not always think alike value for rank connexion perceived be greater than hers be not merely complaisance must be liking to cause made enter warmly into father sister solicitude on subject thought unworthy to excite bath paper one morning announced arrival of dowager viscountess dalrymple daughter honourable miss carteret comfort of camden place be swept away for many day for dalrymples in anne opinion most unfortunately be cousin of elliots agony be how to introduce properly anne have never seen father sister before in contact with nobility must acknowledge disappointed have hoped better thing from high idea of own situation in life be reduced to form wish have never foreseen wish that have more pride for cousin lady dalrymple miss carteret cousin dalrymples sounded in ear day long sir walter have once be in company with late viscount have never seen of rest of family difficulty of case arose from there having be suspension of intercourse by letter of ceremony ever since death of said late viscount when in consequence of dangerous illness of sir walter at same time there have be unlucky omission at kellynch letter of condolence have be sent to ireland neglect have be visited on head of sinner for when poor lady elliot died letter of condolence be received at kellynch consequently there be too much reason to apprehend that dalrymples considered relationship a closed how to have anxious business set to right be admitted a cousin again be question be question in more rational manner lady russell mr elliot thought unimportant family connexion be always worth preserving good company always worth seeking lady dalrymple have taken house for three month in laura place must be living in style have be at bath year before lady russell have heard spoken of a charming woman be very desirable that connexion must be renewed if must be done without compromise of propriety on side of elliots sir walter however must choose own mean at last wrote very fine letter of ample explanation regret entreaty to right honourable cousin lady russell mr elliot

from who be beneath looked a spoke to seat mr clay have be lately occupying sufficient explanation of what particularly meant though anne must not believe in having same sort of pride be pleased with

of witnessing be not merely in folly that be well read for see occasionally under circumstance can be most interesting affecting what instance must pas before of ardent disinterested self denying attachment of heroism fortitude patience resignation of conflict sacrifice ennoble most sick chamber may often furnish worth of volume yes said mr smith more doubtingly sometimes may though fear lesson be not often in elevated style describe here there human nature may be great in time of trial generally speaking be weakness not strength that appears in sick chamber be selfishness impatience

have called several time on friend before existence of person be known in camden place at last became necessary to speak of sir walter elizabeth mr clay returned one morning from laura place with sudden invitation from lady dalrymple for same evening anne be already engaged to spend evening in westgate building be not sorry for excuse be only asked be sure because lady dalrymple being kept at home by bad cold be glad to make use of relationship have be so pressed on declined on own account with great alacrity be engaged to spend evening with old schoolfellow be not much interested in anything relative to anne still there be question enough asked to make understood what old schoolfellow be elizabeth be disdainful sir walter severe westgate building said who be miss anne elliot to be visiting in westgate building mr smith widow mr smith who be husband one of five thousand mr smith whose name be to be met with everywhere what be attraction that be old sickly upon word miss anne elliot have most extraordinary taste everything revolt other people low company paltry room foul air disgusting association be inviting to surely may put off old lady till to morrow be not so near end presume that may hope to see day what be age forty sir be not one thirty think can put off engagement because be only evening for time will at once suit go into warm bath to morrow for rest of week know be engaged what doe lady russell think of acquaintance asked elizabeth see nothing to blame in replied anne on contrary approves have generally taken when have called on mr smith westgate

doubt be well known to convey miss elliot widow mr smith lodging in westgate building poor widow barely able to live between thirty forty mere mr smith day mr smith of people name in world to be chosen friend of miss anne elliot to be preferred by to own family connection among nobility of england ireland mr smith name mr clay who have be present while passed now thought advisable to leave room anne must have said much did long to say little in defence of friend be not very dissimilar claim to theirs sense of personal respect to father prevented made reply left to to recollect mr smith be not only widow in bath between thirty forty with little to live on surname of dignity anne kept appointment others kept theirs of course heard next morning that have have delightful evening have be only one of set absent for sir walter elizabeth have not only be quite at ladyship service have actually be happy to be employed by in collecting others have be at trouble of inviting lady russell mr elliot mr elliot have made point of leaving colonel wallis early lady russell have fresh arranged evening engagement in order to wait on anne have whole history of evening must supply from lady russell to greatest interest must be in having be very much talked of between friend mr elliot in having be wished for regretted at same time honoured for staying away in such cause kind compassionate visit to old schoolfellow sick reduced seemed to have quite delighted mr elliot thought most extraordinary young woman in temper manner mind model of female excellence must meet even lady russell in discussion of merit anne must not be given to understand so much by friend must not know to be so highly rated by sensible man without many of agreeable sensation friend meant to create lady russell be now perfectly decided in opinion of mr elliot be a much convinced of meaning to gain anne in time a of deserving be beginning to calculate number of week must free from remaining restraint of widowhood leave at liberty to exert most open power of pleasing must not speak to anne with certainty felt on subject must venture on little more than hint of what might be hereafter of possible attachment on side of desirableness of alliance supposing such attachment to be real returned anne heard made violent exclamation only smiled blushed gently shook head be match maker a well know said lady russell being much too well aware of uncertainty of human event calculation only mean that if mr elliot must time hence pay address to if must be disposed to accept think there must be possibility of being happy together most suitable connection everybody must consider think might be very happy one mr elliot be exceedingly agreeable man in many respect think highly of said anne must not suit lady russell let pas only said in rejoinder own to be able to regard a future mistress of kellynch future lady elliot to look forward see occupying dear mother place succeeding to right popularity a well a to virtue must be highest possible gratification to be mother self in countenance disposition if might be allowed to fancy such a be in situation name home presiding blessing in same spot only superior to in being more highly valued dearest anne must give more delight than be often felt at time of life anne be obliged to turn away to rise to walk to distant table leaning there in pretended employment try to subdue feeling picture excited for few moment imagination heart be bewitched idea of becoming what mother have be of having precious name of lady elliot first revived in herself of being restored to kellynch calling home again home for ever be charm must not immediately resist lady russell said not word willing to leave matter to own operation believing must mr elliot at moment with propriety have spoken for believed in short what anne did not believe same image of mr elliot speaking for brought anne to composure again charm of kellynch of lady elliot faded away never must accept be not only that feeling be still adverse to man save one judgement on serious consideration of possibility of such case be against mr elliot though have now be acquainted month must not be satisfied that really knew character that be sensible man agreeable man that talked well professed good opinion seemed to judge properly a man of principle be clear enough certainly knew what be right must fix on one article of moral duty evidently transgressed yet must have be afraid to answer for conduct distrusted past if not present name occasionally dropt of former associate allusion to former practice pursuit suggested suspicion not favourable of what have be saw that there have be bad habit that sunday travelling have be common thing that there have be period of life probably not short one when have be at least careless in serious matter though might now think very differently who must answer for true sentiment of clever cautious man grown old enough to appreciate fair character how must ever be ascertained that mind be truly cleansed mr elliot be rational discreet polished be not open there be never burst of feeling warmth of indignation delight at evil good of others to anne be decided imperfection early impression be incurable prized frank open hearted eager character beyond others warmth enthusiasm did captivate still felt that must so much more depend upon sincerity of who sometimes looked said careless hasty thing than of whose presence of mind never varied whose tongue never slipped mr elliot be too generally agreeable various a be temper in father house pleased endured too well stood too well with body have spoken to with degree of openness of mr clay have appeared completely to see what mr clay be about to hold in contempt yet mr clay found a agreeable a body lady russell saw either le more than young friend for saw nothing to excite distrust must not imagine man more exactly what ought to be than mr elliot did ever enjoy sweeter feeling than hope of seeing receive hand of beloved anne in kellynch church in course of following autumn chapter be beginning of february anne having be month in bath be growing very eager for news from uppercross lyme wanted to hear much more than mary have communicated be three week since have heard at only knew that henrietta be at home again that louisa though considered to be recovering fast be still in lyme be thinking of very intently one evening when thicker letter than usual from mary be delivered to to quicken pleasure surprise with admiral mr croft compliment croft must be in bath circumstance to interest be people whom heart turned to very naturally what be cried sir walter croft have arrived in bath croft who rent kellynch what have brought letter from uppercross cottage sir oh letter be convenient passport secure introduction must have visited admiral croft however at rate know what be due to tenant anne must listen no longer must not even have told how poor admiral complexion escaped letter engrossed have be begun several day back february st dear anne make apology for silence because know how little people think of letter in such place a bath must be great deal too happy to care for uppercross a well know affords little to write about have have very dull christmas mr mr musgrove have not have one dinner party holiday reckon hayters a anybody holiday however be over at last believe child ever have such long one be sure have not house be cleared yesterday except of little harvilles will be surprised to hear have never gone home mr harville must be odd mother to part with so long understand be not at nice child in opinion mr musgrove seems to like quite a well if not better than grandchild what dreadful weather have have may not be felt in bath with nice pavement in country be of consequence have not have creature call on since second week in january except charles hayter who have be calling much oftener than be welcome between think great pity henrietta did not remain at lyme a long a louisa must have kept little out of way carriage be gone to day to bring louisa harvilles to morrow be not asked to dine with however till day after mr musgrove be so afraid of being fatigued by journey be not very likely considering care will be taken of must be much more convenient to to dine there to morrow be glad find mr elliot so agreeable wish must be acquainted with too have usual luck be always out of way when thing desirable be going on always last of family to be noticed what immense time mr clay have be staying with elizabeth doe never mean to go away perhaps if be to leave room vacant might not be invited let know what think of expect child to be asked know can leave at great house very well for month six week have moment heard that croft be going to bath almost immediately think admiral gouty charles heard quite by chance have not have civility to give notice of offering to take anything think improve at a neighbour see nothing of be really instance of gross inattention charles join in love everything proper yours affectionately mary m be sorry to say that be very far from well jemima have just told that butcher say there be bad sore throat very much about dare say will catch sore throat know be always worse than anybody so ended first part have be afterwards put into envelope containing nearly a much more kept letter open might send word how louisa bore journey now be extremely glad did having great deal to add in first place have note from mr croft yesterday offering to convey anything to very kind friendly note indeed addressed to just a ought will therefore be able to make letter a long a like admiral doe not seem very ill sincerely hope bath will do all good want will be truly glad to have back again neighbourhood can not spare such pleasant family now for louisa have something to communicate will astonish not little harvilles came on tuesday very safely in evening went to ask how did when be rather surprised not to find captain benwick of party for have be invited a well a harvilles what do think be reason more le than being in love with louisa not choosing to venture to uppercross till have have answer from mr musgrove for be settled between before came away have written to father by captain harville true upon honour be not astonished will be surprised at least if ever received hint of for never did mr musgrove protest solemnly that knew nothing of matter be very well pleased however for though be not equal to marrying captain wentworth be infinitely better than charles hayter mr musgrove have written consent captain benwick be expected to day mr harville say husband feel good deal on poor sister account however louisa be great favourite with indeed mr harville quite agree that love better for having nursed charles wonder what captain wentworth will say if remember never thought attached to louisa never must see anything of be end see of captain benwick being supposed to be admirer of yours how charles must take thing into head be always incomprehensible to hope will be more agreeable now certainly not great match for louisa musgrove million time better than marrying among hayters mary need not have feared sister being in degree prepared for news have never in life be more astonished captain benwick louisa musgrove be almost too wonderful for belief be with greatest effort that must remain in room preserve air of calmness answer common question of moment happily for be not many sir walter wanted to know whether croft travelled with four horse whether be likely to be situated in such part of bath a might suit miss elliot to visit in have little curiosity beyond how be mary said elizabeth without waiting for answer pray brings croft to bath come on admiral account be thought to be gouty gout decrepitude said sir walter poor old gentleman have acquaintance here asked elizabeth know can hardly suppose at admiral croft time of life in profession must not have many acquaintance in place a suspect said sir walter coolly that admiral croft will be best known in bath a renter of kellynch hall elizabeth may venture to present wife in laura place oh think not situated a be with lady dalrymple cousin ought to be very careful not to embarrass with acquaintance might not approve if be not related must not signify a cousin must feel scrupulous a to proposal of ours have better leave croft to find own level there be several odd looking men walking about here who be told be sailor croft will associate with be sir walter elizabeth share of interest in letter when mr clay have paid tribute of more decent attention in enquiry after mr charles musgrove fine little boy anne be at liberty in own room tried to comprehend well might charles wonder how captain wentworth must feel perhaps have quitted field have given louisa up have ceased to love have found did not love must not endure idea of treachery levity anything akin to ill usage between friend must not endure that friendship a theirs must be severed unfairly captain benwick louisa musgrove high spirited joyous talking louisa musgrove dejected thinking feeling reading captain benwick seemed of everything must not suit other mind most dissimilar where must have be attraction answer soon presented have be in situation have be thrown together several week have be living in same small family party since henrietta coming away must have be depending almost entirely on other louisa just recovering from illness have be in interesting state captain benwick be not inconsolable that be point anne have not be able to avoid suspecting before instead of drawing same conclusion a mary from present course of event served only to confirm idea of having felt dawning of tenderness toward did not mean however to derive much more from to gratify vanity than mary might have allowed be persuaded that tolerably pleasing young woman who have listened seemed to feel for must have received same compliment have affectionate heart must love somebody saw reason against being happy louisa have fine naval fervour to begin with must soon grow more alike must gain cheerfulness must learn to be enthusiast for scott lord byron nay be probably learnt already of course have fallen in love over poetry idea of louisa musgrove turned into person of literary taste sentimental reflection be amusing have doubt of being so day at fall from cobb might influence health nerve courage character to end of life a thoroughly a appeared to have influenced fate conclusion of whole be that if woman who have be sensible of captain wentworth merit must be allowed to prefer man there be nothing in engagement to excite lasting wonder if captain wentworth lost friend by certainly nothing to be regretted be not regret made anne heart beat in spite of herself brought colour into cheek when thought of captain wentworth unshackled free have feeling be ashamed to investigate be too much like joy senseless joy longed to see croft when meeting took place be evident that rumour of news have yet reached visit of ceremony be paid returned louisa musgrove be mentioned captain benwick too without even smile croft have placed in lodging in gay street perfectly to sir walter satisfaction be not at ashamed of acquaintance did in fact think talk great deal more about admiral than admiral ever thought talked about croft knew quite a many people in bath a wished for considered intercourse with elliots a mere matter of form not in least likely to afford pleasure brought with country habit of being almost always together be ordered to walk to keep off gout mr croft seemed to go share with in everything to walk for life to do good anne saw wherever went lady russell took out in carriage almost morning never failed to think of never failed to see knowing feeling a did be most attractive picture of happiness to always watched a long a must delighted to fancy understood what might be talking of a walked along in happy independence equally delighted to see admiral hearty shake of hand when encountered old friend observe eagerness of conversation when occasionally forming into little knot of navy mr croft looking a intelligent keen a of officer around anne be too much engaged with lady russell to be often walking so happened that one morning about week ten day after croft arrival suited best to leave friend friend carriage in lower part of town return alone to camden place in walking up milsom street have good fortune to meet with admiral be standing by at printshop window with hand behind in earnest contemplation of print not only might have passed unseen be obliged to touch a well a address before must catch notice when did perceive acknowledge however be done with usual frankness good humour have be thank thank be treating like friend here be see staring at picture can never get by shop without stopping what thing here be by way of boat do look at did ever see like what queer fellow fine painter must be to think that anybody must venture life in such shapeless old cockleshell a yet here be two gentleman stuck up in mightily at ease looking about at rock mountain a if be not to be upset next moment certainly must be wonder where boat be built laughing heartily must not venture over horsepond in well turning away now where be bound can go anywhere for with can be of use none thank unless will give pleasure of company little way road lie together be going home will with heart farther too yes yes will have

tied by leg have blister on one of heel a large a three shilling piece if look across street will see admiral brand coming down brother shabby fellow of be glad be not on side of way sophy can not bear played pitiful trick once got away with of best men will tell whole story time there come old sir archibald drew grandson look see kiss hand to take for wife ah peace have come too soon for younker poor old sir archibald how do like bath miss elliot suit very well be always meeting with old friend other street full of morning sure to have plenty of chat then get away from shut ourselves in lodging draw in chair be snug a if be at kellynch ay a used to be even at north yarmouth deal like lodging here worse can tell for putting in mind of first have at north yarmouth wind blow through one of cupboard just in same way when be got little farther anne ventured to press again for what have to communicate hoped when clear of milsom street to have curiosity gratified be still obliged to wait for admiral have made up mind not to begin till have gained greater space quiet of belmont a be not really mr croft must let have own way a soon a be fairly ascending belmont began well now will hear something will surprise first of must tell name of young lady be going to talk about young lady know that have be so concerned for miss musgrove that have be happening to christian name always forget christian name anne have be ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon a really did now must safely suggest name of louisa ay ay miss louisa musgrove be name wish young lady have not such number of fine christian name must never be out if be sophys something of sort well miss louisa thought know be to marry frederick be courting week after week only wonder be what must be waiting for till business at lyme came then indeed be clear enough that must wait till brain be set to right even then there be something odd in way of going on instead of staying at lyme went off to plymouth then went off to see edward when came back from minehead be gone down to edward there have be ever since have seen nothing of since november even sophy must not understand now matter have taken strangest turn of for young lady same miss musgrove instead of being to marry frederick be to marry james benwick know james benwick little be little acquainted with captain benwick well be to marry nay most likely be married already for know what must wait for thought captain benwick very pleasing young man said anne understand that bear excellent character oh yes yes there be not word to be said against james benwick be only commander be true made last summer be bad time for getting on have not fault that know of excellent good hearted fellow assure very active zealous officer too be more than must think for perhaps for soft sort of manner doe not do justice indeed be mistaken there sir must never augur want of spirit from captain benwick manner thought particularly pleasing will answer for must generally please well well lady be best judge james benwick be rather too piano for though very likely be partiality sophy can not help thinking frederick manner better than there be something about frederick more to taste anne be caught have only meant to oppose too common idea of spirit gentleness being incompatible with other not at to represent captain benwick manner a very best must possibly be after little hesitation be beginning to say be not entering into comparison of two friend admiral interrupted with thing be certainly true be not mere bit of gossip have from frederick sister have letter from yesterday in tell of have just have in letter from harville written upon spot from uppercross fancy be at uppercross be opportunity anne must not resist said therefore hope admiral hope there be nothing in style of captain wentworth letter to make mr croft particularly uneasy did seem last autumn a if there be attachment between louisa musgrove hope may be understood to have worn out on side equally without violence hope letter doe not breathe spirit of ill used man not at not at there be not oath murmur from beginning to end anne looked down to hide smile frederick be not man to whine complain have too much spirit for if girl like man better be very fit must have certainly what mean be that hope there be nothing in captain wentworth manner of writing to make suppose think ill used by friend might appear know without being absolutely said must be very sorry that friendship a have subsisted between captain benwick must be destroyed even wounded by circumstance of sort yes yes understand there be nothing at of nature in letter doe not give least fling at benwick doe not so much a say ' wonder at have reason of own for wondering at ' must not guess from way of writing that have ever thought of miss what be name for very handsomely hope will be happy together there be nothing very unforgiving in think anne did not receive perfect conviction admiral meant to convey must have be useless to press enquiry farther therefore satisfied herself with common place remark quiet attention admiral have own way poor frederick said at last now must begin over again with somebody else think must get to bath sophy must write beg to come to bath here be pretty girl enough be sure must be of use to go to uppercross again for other miss musgrove find be bespoke by cousin young parson think miss elliot have better try to get to bath chapter while admiral croft be taking walk with anne expressing wish of getting captain wentworth to bath captain wentworth be already on way thither before mr croft have written be arrived very next time anne walked out saw mr elliot be attending two cousin mr clay be in milsom street began to rain not much enough to make shelter desirable for woman quite enough to make very desirable for miss elliot to have advantage of being conveyed home in lady dalrymple carriage be seen waiting at little distance anne mr clay therefore turned into molland while mr elliot stepped to lady dalrymple to request assistance soon joined again successful of course lady dalrymple must be most happy to take home must call for in few minute ladyship carriage be barouche did not hold more than four with comfort miss carteret be with mother consequently be not reasonable to expect accommodation for three camden place lady there must be no doubt a to miss elliot suffered inconvenience must suffer none occupied little time to settle point of civility between other two rain be mere trifle anne be most sincere in preferring walk with mr elliot rain be also mere trifle to mr clay must hardly allow even to drop at boot be so thick much thicker than miss anne in short civility rendered quite a anxious to be left to walk with mr elliot a anne must be be discussed between with generosity so polite so determined that others be obliged to settle for miss elliot maintaining mr clay have little cold already mr elliot deciding on appeal that cousin anne boot be rather thickest be fixed accordingly that mr clay must be of party in carriage have just reached point when anne a sat near window descried most decidedly distinctly captain wentworth walking down street start be perceptible only to herself instantly felt that be greatest simpleton in world most unaccountable absurd for few minute saw nothing before be confusion be lost when have scolded back sens found others still waiting for carriage mr elliot always obliging just setting off for union street on commission of mr clay now felt great inclination to go to outer door wanted to see if rained why be to suspect herself of motive captain wentworth must be out of sight left seat must go one half of must not be always so much wiser than other half always suspecting other of being worse than be must see if rained be sent back however in moment by entrance of captain wentworth among party of gentleman lady evidently acquaintance whom must have joined little below milsom street be more obviously struck confused by sight of than have ever observed before looked quite red for first time since renewed acquaintance felt that be betraying least sensibility of two have advantage of in preparation of last few moment overpowering blinding bewildering first effect of strong surprise be over with still however have enough to feel be agitation pain pleasure something between delight misery spoke to then turned away character of manner be embarrassment must not have called cold friendly anything so certainly a embarrassed after short interval however came towards spoke again mutual enquiry on common subject passed of probably much wiser for what heard anne continuing fully sensible of being le at ease than formerly have by dint of being so very much together got to speak to other with considerable portion of apparent indifference calmness must not do now time have changed louisa have changed there be consciousness of sort other looked very well not a if have be suffering in health spirit talked of uppercross of musgroves nay even of louisa have even momentary look of own arch significance a named yet be captain wentworth not comfortable not easy not able to feign that be did not surprise grieved anne to observe elizabeth must not know saw that saw that elizabeth saw that there be complete internal recognition on side be convinced that be ready to be acknowledged a acquaintance expecting have pain of seeing sister turn away with unalterable coldness lady dalrymple carriage for miss elliot be growing very impatient now drew up servant came in to announce be beginning to rain again altogether there be delay bustle talking must make little crowd in shop understand lady dalrymple be calling to convey miss elliot at last miss elliot friend unattended by servant for there be cousin returned be walking off captain wentworth watching turned again to anne by manner rather than word be offering service to be much obliged to be answer be not going with carriage must not accommodate so many walk prefer walking rain oh very little nothing regard after moment pause said though came only yesterday have equipped properly for bath already see pointing to new umbrella wish must make use of if be determined to walk though think must be more prudent to let get chair be very much obliged to declined repeating conviction that rain must come to nothing at present adding be only waiting for mr elliot will be here in moment be sure have hardly spoken word when mr elliot walked in captain wentworth recollected perfectly there be difference between man who have stood on step at lyme admiring anne a passed except in air look manner of privileged relation friend came in with eagerness appeared to see think only of apologised for stay be grieved to have kept waiting anxious to get away without further loss of time before rain increased in moment walked off together arm under gentle embarrassed glance good morning to being that have time for a passed away a soon a be out of sight lady of captain wentworth party began talking of mr elliot doe not dislike cousin fancy oh be clear enough one can guess what will happen there be

for tender spirit for gay attention for scientific patience for wearisome have never liked concert better at least during first act towards close of in interval succeeding italian song explained word of song to mr elliot have concert bill between said be nearly sense rather meaning of word for certainly sense of italian love song must not be talked of be a nearly meaning a can give for pretend to

clear comprehensible elegant english need not say anything more of ignorance here be complete proof will not oppose such kind politeness must be sorry to be examined by real proficient have not have pleasure of visiting in camden place so long replied without knowing something of miss anne elliot do regard a one who be too modest for world in general to be aware of half accomplishment too highly accomplished for modesty to be natural in other woman for shame for shame be too much flattery forget what be to have next turning to bill perhaps said mr elliot speaking low have have longer acquaintance with character than be aware of indeed how so can have be acquainted with only since came to bath excepting a might hear previously spoken of in own family knew by report long before came to bath have heard described by who knew intimately have be acquainted with by character many year person disposition accomplishment manner be present to mr elliot be not disappointed in interest hoped to raise one can withstand charm of such mystery to have be described long ago to recent acquaintance by nameless people be irresistible anne be curiosity wondered questioned eagerly in vain delighted in being asked must not tell time other perhaps not now must mention name now such must assure have be fact have many year ago received such description of miss anne elliot a have inspired with highest idea of merit excited warmest curiosity to know anne must think of one so likely to have spoken with partiality of many year ago a mr wentworth of monkford captain wentworth brother might have be in mr elliot company have not courage to ask question name of anne elliot said have long have interesting sound to very long have possessed charm over fancy if dared must breathe wish that name might never change such believed be word scarcely have received sound than attention be caught by other sound immediately behind rendered thing else trivial father lady dalrymple be speaking well looking man said sir walter very well looking man very fine young man indeed said lady dalrymple more air than one often see in bath irish dare say just know name bowing acquaintance wentworth captain wentworth of navy sister married tenant in somersetshire croft who rent kellynch before sir walter have reached point anne eye have caught right direction distinguished captain wentworth standing among cluster of men at little distance a eye fell on seemed to be withdrawn from have that appearance seemed a if have be one moment too late a long a dared observe did not look again performance be recommencing be forced to seem to restore attention to orchestra look straight forward when must give glance have moved away must not have come nearer to if must be so surrounded shut in must rather have caught eye mr elliot speech too distressed have no longer inclination to talk to wished not so near first act be over now hoped for beneficial change after period of nothing saying amongst party of did decide on going in quest of tea anne be one of few who did not choose to move remained in seat so did lady russell have pleasure of getting rid of mr elliot did not mean might feel on lady russell account to shrink from conversation with captain wentworth if gave opportunity be persuaded by lady russell countenance that have seen did not come however anne sometimes fancied discerned at distance never came anxious interval wore away unproductively others returned room filled again bench be reclaimed repossessed hour of pleasure of penance be to be sat out hour of music be to give delight gape a real affected taste for prevailed to anne chiefly wore prospect of hour of agitation must not quit that room in peace without seeing captain wentworth once more without interchange of one friendly look in re settling there be now many change result of be favourable for colonel wallis declined sitting down again mr elliot be invited by elizabeth miss carteret in manner not to be refused to sit between by other removal little scheming of own anne be enabled to place much nearer end of bench than have be before much more within reach of passer by must not do so without comparing with miss larolles inimitable miss larolles still did not with much happier effect though by what seemed prosperity in shape of early abdication in next neighbour found at very end of bench before concert closed such be situation with vacant space at hand when captain wentworth be again in sight saw not far off saw too yet looked grave seemed irresolute only by very slow degree came at last near enough to speak to felt that something must be matter change be indubitable difference between present air what have be in octagon room be strikingly great why be thought of father of lady russell must there have be unpleasant glance began by speaking of concert gravely more like captain wentworth of uppercross owned disappointed have expected singing in short must confess that must not be sorry when be over anne replied spoke in defence of performance so well yet in allowance for feeling so pleasantly that countenance improved replied again with almost smile talked for few minute more improvement held even looked down towards bench a if saw place on well worth occupying when at moment touch on shoulder obliged anne to turn round came from mr elliot begged pardon must be applied to to explain italian again miss carteret be very anxious to have general idea of what be next to be sung anne must not refuse never have sacrificed to politeness with more suffering spirit few minute though a few a possible be inevitably consumed when own mistress again when able to turn look a have done before found accosted by captain wentworth in reserved yet hurried sort of farewell must wish good night be going must get home a fast a must be not song worth staying for said anne suddenly struck by idea made yet more anxious to be encouraging replied impressively there be nothing worth staying for be gone directly jealousy of mr elliot be only intelligible motive captain wentworth jealous of affection must have believed week ago three hour ago for moment gratification be exquisite ala there be very different thought to succeed how be such jealousy to be quieted how be truth to reach how in peculiar disadvantage of respective situation must ever learn of real sentiment be misery to think of mr elliot attention evil be incalculable chapter anne recollected with pleasure next morning promise of going to mr smith meaning that must engage from home at time when mr elliot must be most likely to call for to avoid mr elliot be almost first object felt great deal of good will towards in spite of mischief of attention owed gratitude regard perhaps compassion must not help thinking much of extraordinary circumstance attending acquaintance of right seemed to have to interest by everything in situation by own sentiment by early prepossession be altogether very extraordinary flattering painful there be much to regret how might have felt have there be captain wentworth in case be not worth enquiry for there be captain wentworth be conclusion of present suspense good bad affection must be for ever union believed must not divide more from other men than final separation prettier musing of high wrought love eternal constancy must never have passed along street of bath than anne be sporting with from camden place to westgate building be almost enough to spread purification perfume way be sure of pleasant reception friend seemed morning particularly obliged to for coming seemed hardly to have expected though have be appointment account of concert be immediately claimed be recollection of concert be quite happy enough to animate feature make rejoice to talk of that must tell told most gladly be little for one who have be there unsatisfactory for such enquirer a mr smith who have already heard through short cut of laundress waiter rather more of general success produce of evening than anne must relate who now asked in vain for several particular of company everybody of consequence notoriety in bath be well know by name to mr little durands be there conclude said with mouth open to catch music like unfledged sparrow ready to be fed never miss concert yes did not see heard mr elliot say be in room ibbotsons be there two new beauty with tall irish officer who be talked of for one of know think be old lady mary maclean need not ask after never miss know must have seen must have be in own circle for a went with lady dalrymple be in seat of grandeur round orchestra of course be what dreaded must have be very unpleasant to in respect happily lady dalrymple always chooses to be farther off be exceedingly well placed be for hearing must not say for seeing because appear to have seen very little oh saw enough for own amusement can understand there be sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in crowd have be large party in yourselves wanted nothing beyond ought to have looked about more said anne conscious while spoke that there have in fact be want of looking about that object only have be deficient be better employed need not tell that have pleasant evening see in eye perfectly see how hour passed that have always something agreeable to listen to in interval of concert be conversation anne half smiled said do see that in eye yes do countenance perfectly informs that be in company last night with person whom think most agreeable in world person who interest at present time more than rest of world put together blush overspread anne cheek must say nothing such being case continued mr smith after short pause hope believe that do know how to value kindness in coming to morning be really very good of to come sit with when must have so many pleasanter demand upon time anne heard nothing of be still in astonishment confusion excited by friend penetration unable to imagine how report of captain wentworth must have reached after short silence pray said mr smith be mr elliot aware of acquaintance with doe know be in bath mr elliot repeated anne looking up surprised moment reflection shewed mistake have be under caught instantaneously recovering courage with feeling of safety soon added more composedly be acquainted with mr elliot have be good deal acquainted with replied mr smith gravely seems worn out now be great while since met be not at aware of never mentioned before have known must have have pleasure of talking to about to confess truth said mr smith assuming usual air of cheerfulness be exactly pleasure want to have want to talk about to mr elliot want interest with can be of essential service to if must have goodness dear miss elliot to make object to yourself of course be done must be extremely happy hope can not doubt willingness to be of even slightest use to replied anne suspect that be considering a having higher claim on mr elliot greater right to influence than be really case be sure have somehow other imbibed such notion must consider only a mr elliot relation if in light there be anything suppose cousin might fairly ask of beg must not hesitate to employ mr smith gave penetrating glance then smiling said have be little premature perceive beg pardon ought to have waited for official information now dear miss elliot a old friend do give hint a to when may speak next week to be sure by next week may be allowed to think settled build own selfish scheme on mr elliot good fortune replied anne next week next next assure that nothing of sort be thinking of will be settled week be not going to marry mr elliot must like to know why imagine be mr smith looked at again looked earnestly smiled shook head exclaimed now how do wish understood how do wish knew what be at have great idea that design to be cruel when right moment occurs till doe come know woman never mean to have anybody be thing of course among man be refused till offer why must be cruel let plead for present friend can not call for former friend where can look for more suitable match where must expect more gentlemanlike agreeable man let recommend mr elliot be sure hear nothing good of from colonel wallis who can know better than colonel wallis dear mr smith mr elliot wife have not be dead much above year ought not to be supposed to be paying address to one oh if be only objection cried mr smith archly mr elliot be safe will give more trouble about forget when be married that be let know to be friend of yours then will think little of trouble required be very natural for now with so many affair engagement of own to avoid get rid of a can very natural perhaps ninety nine out of hundred must do same of course can not be aware of importance to well dear miss elliot hope trust will be very happy mr elliot have sense to understand value of such woman peace will not be shipwrecked a mine have be be safe in worldly matter safe in character will not be led astray will not be misled by others to ruin said anne can readily believe that of cousin seems to have calm decided temper not at open to dangerous impression consider with great respect have reason from thing have fallen within observation to do otherwise have not known long be not man think to be known intimately soon will not manner of speaking of mr smith convince that be nothing to surely must be calm enough upon word be nothing to must ever propose to have very little reason to imagine have thought of doing will not accept assure will not assure mr elliot have not share have be supposing in pleasure concert of last night might afford not mr elliot be not mr elliot that stopped regretting with deep blush that have implied so much le must hardly have be sufficient mr smith must hardly have believed so soon in mr elliot failure from perception of there being somebody else a be instantly submitted with semblance of seeing nothing beyond anne eager to escape farther notice be impatient to know why mr smith must have fancied be to marry mr elliot where must have received idea from whom must have heard do tell how first came into head first came into head replied mr smith upon finding how much be together feeling to be most probable thing in world to be wished for by everybody belonging to of may depend upon that acquaintance have disposed of in same way never heard spoken of till two day ago have indeed be spoken of did observe woman who opened door to when called yesterday be not mr speed a usual maid observed one in particular be friend mr rooke nurse rooke who by bye have great curiosity to see be delighted to be in way to let in came away from marlborough building only on sunday be who told be to marry mr elliot have have from mr wallis did not seem bad authority sat hour with on monday evening gave whole history whole history repeated anne laughing must not make very long history think of one such little article of unfounded news mr smith said nothing continued anne presently though there be truth in having claim on mr elliot must be extremely happy to be of use to in way must will mention to being in bath will take message thank certainly not in warmth of moment under mistaken impression might perhaps have endeavoured to interest in circumstance not now thank have nothing to trouble with think spoke of having known mr elliot many year did not before be married suppose yes be not married when knew first be much acquainted intimately indeed then do tell what be at time of life have great curiosity to know what mr elliot be a very young man be at such a appears now have not seen mr elliot three year be mr smith answer given so gravely that be impossible to pursue subject farther anne felt that have gained nothing increase of curiosity be silent mr smith very thoughtful at last beg pardon dear miss elliot cried in natural tone of cordiality beg pardon for short answer have be giving have be uncertain what ought to do have be doubting considering a to what ought to tell there be many thing to be taken into account one hate to be officious to be giving bad impression making mischief even smooth surface of family union seems worth preserving though there may be nothing durable beneath however have determined think be right think ought to be made acquainted with mr elliot real character though fully believe that at present have not smallest intention of accepting there be saying what may happen might time other be differently affected towards hear truth therefore now while be unprejudiced mr elliot be man without heart conscience designing wary cold blooded being who think only of whom for own interest ease must be guilty of cruelty treachery must be perpetrated without risk of general character have feeling for others whom have be chief cause of leading into ruin can neglect desert without smallest compunction be totally beyond reach of sentiment of justice compassion oh be black at heart hollow black anne astonished air exclamation of wonder made pause in calmer manner added expression startle must allow for injured angry woman will try to command will not abuse will only tell have found fact will speak be intimate friend of dear husband who trusted loved thought a good a intimacy have be formed before marriage found most intimate friend too became excessively pleased with mr elliot entertained highest opinion of at nineteen know one doe not think very seriously mr elliot appeared to quite a good a others much more agreeable than most others be almost always together be principally in town living in very good style be then inferior in circumstance be then poor one have chamber in temple be a much a must do to support appearance of gentleman have always home with whenever chose be always welcome be like brother poor charles who have finest most generous spirit in world must have divided last farthing with know that purse be open to know that often assisted must have be about very period of mr elliot life said anne have always excited particular curiosity must have be about same time that became known to father sister never knew only heard of there be something in conduct then with regard to father sister afterwards in circumstance of marriage never must quite reconcile with present time seemed to announce different sort of man know know cried mr smith have be introduced to sir walter sister before be acquainted with heard speak of for ever know be invited encouraged know did not choose to go can satisfy perhaps on point must little expect a to marriage knew about at time be privy to fors againsts be friend to whom confided hope plan though did not know wife previously inferior situation in society indeed rendered that impossible yet knew life afterwards at least till within last two year of life can answer question may wish to put nay said anne have particular enquiry to make about have always understood be not happy couple must like to know why at time of life must slight father acquaintance a did father be certainly disposed to take very kind proper notice of why did mr elliot draw back mr elliot replied mr smith at period of life have one object in view to make fortune by rather quicker process than law be determined to make by marriage be determined at least not to mar by imprudent marriage know be belief whether justly not of course can not decide that father sister in civility invitation be designing match between heir young lady be impossible that match must have answered idea of wealth independence be motive for drawing back can assure told whole story have concealment with be curious that having just left behind in bath first principal acquaintance on marrying must be cousin that through must be continually hearing of father sister described one miss elliot thought very affectionately of other perhaps cried anne struck by sudden idea sometimes spoke of to mr elliot to be sure did very often used to boast of own anne elliot vouch for being very different creature from checked just in time account for something mr elliot said last night cried anne explains found have be used to hear of must not comprehend how what wild imagination one form where dear self be concerned how sure to be mistaken beg pardon have interrupted mr elliot married then completely for money circumstance probably first opened eye to character mr smith hesitated little here oh thing be too common when one life in world man woman marrying for money be too common to strike one a ought be very young associated only with young be thoughtless gay set without strict rule of conduct lived for enjoyment think differently now time sickness sorrow have given other notion at period must own saw nothing reprehensible in what mr elliot be doing do best for ' passed a duty be not very low woman yes objected to must not regard money money be that wanted father be grazier grandfather have be butcher be nothing be fine woman have have decent education be brought forward by cousin thrown by chance into mr elliot company fell in love with not difficulty scruple be there on side with respect to birth caution be spent in being secured of real amount of fortune before committed depend upon esteem mr elliot may have for own situation in life now a young man have not smallest value for chance for kellynch estate be something honour of family held a cheap a dirt have often heard declare that if baronetcy be saleable anybody must have for fifty pound arm motto name livery included will not pretend to repeat half used to hear say on subject must not be fair yet ought to have proof for what be assertion will have proof indeed dear mr smith want none cried anne have asserted nothing contradictory to what mr elliot appeared to be year ago be in confirmation rather of what used to hear believe be more curious to know why must be so different now for satisfaction if will have goodness to ring for mary stay be sure will have still greater goodness of going into bedroom bringing small inlaid box will find on upper shelf of closet anne seeing friend to be earnestly bent on did a be desired box be brought placed before mr smith sighing over a unlocked said be full of paper belonging to to husband small portion only of what have to look over when lost letter be looking for be one written by mr elliot to before marriage happened to be saved why one can hardly imagine be careless immethodical like other men about thing when came to examine paper found with others still more trivial from different people scattered here there while many letter memorandum of real importance have be destroyed here be must not burn because being even then very little satisfied with mr elliot be determined to preserve document of former intimacy have now motive for being glad can produce be letter directed to charles smith esq tunbridge well dated from london a far back a july dear smith have received yours kindness almost overpowers wish nature have made such heart a yours more common have lived three twenty year in world have seen none like at present believe have need of service being in cash again give joy have got rid of sir walter miss be gone back to kellynch almost made swear to visit summer first visit to kellynch will be with surveyor to tell how to bring with best advantage to hammer baronet nevertheless be not unlikely to marry again be quite fool enough if doe however will leave in peace may be decent equivalent for reversion be worse than last year wish have name elliot be sick of name of walter can drop thank god desire will never insult with second w again meaning for rest of life to be only yours truly wm elliot such letter must not be read without putting anne in glow mr smith observing high colour in face said language know be highly disrespectful though have forgot exact term have perfect impression of general meaning show man mark profession to poor husband can thing be stronger anne must not immediately get over shock mortification of finding such word applied to father be obliged to recollect that seeing letter be violation of law of honour that one ought to be judged to be known by such testimony that private correspondence must bear eye of others before must recover calmness enough to return letter have be meditating over say thank be full proof undoubtedly proof of thing be saying why be acquainted with now can explain too cried mr smith smiling can really yes have shewn mr elliot a be dozen year ago will shew a be now can not produce written proof again can give a authentic oral testimony a can desire of what be now wanting what be now doing be hypocrite now truly want to marry present attention to family be very sincere quite from heart will give authority friend colonel wallis colonel wallis be acquainted with doe not come to in quite so direct line a that take bend two nothing of consequence stream be a good a at first little rubbish collect in turning be easily moved away mr elliot talk unreservedly to colonel wallis of view on said colonel wallis imagine to be in sensible careful discerning sort of character colonel wallis have very pretty silly wife to whom tell thing have better not repeat to in overflowing spirit of recovery repeat to nurse nurse knowing acquaintance with very naturally brings to on monday evening good friend mr rooke let thus much into secret of marlborough building when talked of whole history therefore see be not romancing so much a supposed dear mr smith authority be deficient will not do mr elliot having view on will not in least account for effort made towards reconciliation with father be prior to coming to bath found on most friendly term when arrived know did know perfectly indeed mr smith must not expect to get real information in such line fact opinion be to pas through hand of so many to be misconceived by folly in one ignorance in can hardly have much truth left only give hearing will soon be able to judge of general credit due by listening to particular can yourself immediately contradict confirm nobody supposes that be first inducement have seen indeed before came to bath admired without knowing to be so say historian at least be true did see last summer autumn beomewhere down in west to use own word without knowing to be certainly did so far be very true at lyme happened to be at lyme well continued mr smith triumphantly grant friend credit due to establishment of first point asserted saw then at lyme liked so well a to be exceedingly pleased to meet with again in camden place a miss anne elliot from moment have doubt have double motive in visit there there be earlier will now explain if there be anything in story know to be either false improbable stop account state that sister friend lady now staying with whom have heard mention came to bath with miss elliot sir walter a long ago a september in short when first came have be staying there ever since be clever insinuating handsome woman poor plausible altogether such in situation manner a to give general idea among sir walter acquaintance of meaning to be lady elliot a general surprise miss elliot must be apparently blind to danger here mr smith paused moment anne have not word to say continued be light in appeared to who knew family long before returned to colonel wallis have eye upon father enough to be sensible of though did not then visit in camden place regard for mr elliot gave interest in watching be going on there when mr elliot came to bath for day two a happened to do little before christmas colonel wallis made acquainted with appearance of thing report beginning to prevail now be to understand time have worked very material change in mr elliot opinion a to value of baronetcy upon point of blood connexion be completely altered man having long have a much money a must spend nothing to wish for on side of avarice indulgence have be gradually learning to pin happiness upon consequence be heir to thought coming on before acquaintance ceased be now confirmed feeling can not bear idea of not being sir william may guess therefore that news heard from friend must not be very agreeable may guess what produced resolution of coming back to bath a soon a possible of fixing here for time with view of renewing former acquaintance recovering such footing in family a might give mean of ascertaining degree of danger of circumventing lady if found material be agreed upon between two friend a only thing to be done colonel wallis be to assist

collect that income have never be equal to style of living that from first there have be great deal of general joint extravagance from wife account of must discern mr smith to have be man of warm feeling easy temper careless habit not strong understanding much more amiable than friend very unlike led by probably despised by mr elliot raised by marriage to great affluence disposed to gratification of pleasure vanity must be commanded without involving for with self indulgence have become prudent man beginning to be rich just a friend ought to have found to be poor seemed to have

inevitable suffering of situation have be such a must not be related without anguish of spirit listened to without corresponding indignation anne be shewn letter of on occasion answer to urgent application from mr smith breathed same stern resolution of not engaging in fruitless trouble under cold civility same hard hearted indifference to of evil might bring on be dreadful picture of ingratitude inhumanity anne felt at moment that flagrant open crime must have be worse have great deal to listen to particular of past sad scene minutia of distress upon distress in former conversation have be merely hinted at be dwelt on now with natural indulgence anne must perfectly comprehend exquisite relief be only more inclined to wonder at composure of friend usual state of mind there be one circumstance in history of grievance of particular irritation have good reason to believe that property of husband in west indie have be for many year under sort of sequestration for payment of own incumbrance might be recoverable by proper measure property though not large must be enough to make comparatively rich there be nobody to stir in mr elliot must hing must hing equally disabled from personal exertion by state of bodily weakness from employing others by want of money have natural connexion to assist even with counsel must not afford to purchase assistance of law be cruel aggravation of actually straitened mean to feel that ought to be in better circumstance that little trouble in right place might do to fear delay might be even weakening claim be hard to bear be

just possible that might have be persuaded by lady russell under supposition must have be most miserable when time have disclosed all too late be very desirable that lady russell must be no longer deceived one of concluding arrangement of important conference carried through greater part of morning be that anne have full liberty to communicate to friend everything relative to mr smith in conduct be involved chapter anne went home to think over that have heard in one point feeling be relieved by knowledge of mr elliot there be longer anything of tenderness due to stood a opposed to

fear must be to herself found on reaching home that have a intended escaped seeing mr elliot that have called paid long morning visit hardly have congratulated felt safe when heard that be coming again in evening have not smallest intention of asking said elizabeth with affected carelessness gave so many hint so mr clay say at least indeed do say never saw anybody in life spell harder for invitation poor man be really in pain for for hard hearted sister miss anne seems bent on cruelty oh cried elizabeth have be rather too much used to game to be soon overcome by gentleman hint however when found how excessively be regretting that must miss father morning gave way immediately for must never really omit opportunity of bring sir walter together appear to so much advantage in company with other behaving so pleasantly mr elliot looking up with so much respect quite delightful cried mr clay not daring however to turn eye towards anne exactly like father son dear miss elliot may not say father son oh lay embargo on body word if will have such idea upon word be scarcely sensible of attention being beyond of other men dear miss elliot exclaimed mr clay lifting hand eye sinking rest

prime object be impossible mr clay must hate sight of mr elliot yet must assume most obliging placid look appear quite satisfied with curtailed license of devoting only half a much to sir walter a must have done otherwise to anne be most distressing to see mr elliot enter room quite painful to have approach speak to have be used before to feel that must not be always quite sincere now saw insincerity in everything attentive deference to father contrasted with former language be odious when thought of cruel conduct towards mr smith must hardly bear sight of present smile mildness sound of artificial good sentiment meant to avoid such alteration of manner a might provoke remonstrance on side be great object to to escape enquiry eclat be intention to be a decidedly cool to a might be compatible with relationship to retrace a quietly a must few step of unnecessary intimacy have be gradually led along be accordingly more guarded more cool than have be night before wanted to animate

early to lady russell accomplish necessary communication must have gone directly after breakfast that mr clay be also going out on obliging purpose of saving sister trouble determined to wait till

away not know mr elliot indeed seem to have forgot about lyme to pacify mary perhaps screen own embarrassment anne did move quietly to window be just in time to ascertain that really be mr elliot have never believed before disappeared on one side a mr clay walked quickly off on other checking surprise must not feel at appearance of friendly conference between two person of totally opposite interest calmly said yes be mr elliot certainly have changed hour of going suppose be may be mistaken might not attend walked back to chair recomposed with comfortable hope of having acquitted well visitor took leave charles having civilly seen off then made face at abused for coming began with well mother have done something for that will like have be to theatre secured box for to morrow night a' good boy know love play there be room for hold nine have engaged captain wentworth anne will not be sorry to join be sure like play have not done well mother mr musgrove be good humouredly beginning to

engaged to camden place to morrow night that be most particularly asked to meet lady dalrymple daughter mr elliot principal family connexion on purpose to be introduced to how can be so forgetful phoo phoo replied charles what be evening party never worth remembering father might have asked to dinner think if have wanted to see may do a like will go to play oh charles declare will be too abominable if do when promised to go did not promise only smirked bowed said word there be promise must go charles must be unpardonable to fail be asked on purpose to be introduced there be always such great connexion between dalrymples nothing ever happened on side be not announced immediately be quite near relation know mr elliot too whom ought so particularly to be acquainted with attention be due to mr elliot consider father heir future representative of family talk to about heir representative cried charles be not one of who neglect reigning power to bow to rising sun if must not go for sake of father must think scandalous to go for sake of heir what be mr elliot to careless expression be life to anne who saw that captain wentworth be attention looking listening with whole soul that last word brought enquiring eye from charles to herself charles mary still talked on in same style half serious half jesting maintaining scheme for play invariably serious most warmly opposing not omitting to make known that however determined to go to camden place must not think very well used if went to play without mr musgrove interposed have better put off charles have much better go back change box for tuesday must be pity to be divided must be losing miss anne too if there be party at father be sure henrietta must care at for play if miss anne must not be with anne felt truly obliged to for such kindness quite a much so for opportunity gave of decidedly saying if depended only on inclination ma'be party at home excepting on mary account must not be smallest impediment have pleasure in sort of meeting must be too happy to change for play with have better not be attempted perhaps have spoken trembled when be done conscious that word be listened to daring not even to try to observe effect be soon generally agreed that tuesday must be day charles only reserving advantage of still teasing wife by persisting that must go to play to morrow if nobody else must captain wentworth left seat walked to fire place probably for sake of walking away from soon afterwards taking station with le bare faced design by anne have not be long enough in bath said to enjoy evening party of place oh usual character of have nothing for be card player be not formerly know did not use to like card time make many change be not yet so much changed cried anne stopped fearing hardly knew what misconstruction after waiting few moment said a if be result of immediate feeling be period indeed eight year half be period whether must have proceeded farther be left to anne imagination to ponder over in calmer hour for while still hearing sound have uttered be startled to other subject by henrietta eager to make use of present leisure for getting out calling on companion to lose time lest somebody else must come in be obliged to move anne talked of being perfectly ready tried to look felt must henrietta have known regret reluctance of heart in quitting chair in preparing to quit room must have found in own sensation for cousin in very security of affection wherewith to pity preparation however be stopped short alarming sound be heard other visitor approached door be thrown open for sir walter miss elliot whose entrance seemed to give general chill anne felt instant oppression wherever looked saw symptom of same comfort freedom gaiety of room be over hushed into cold composure determined silence insipid talk to meet heartless elegance of father sister how mortifying to feel that be so jealous eye be satisfied in one particular captain wentworth be acknowledged again by by elizabeth more graciously than before even addressed once looked at more than once elizabeth be in fact revolving great measure sequel explained after waste of few minute in saying proper nothing began to give invitation be to comprise remaining due of musgroves to morrow evening to meet few friend formal party be said very gracefully card with have provided miss elliot at home be laid on table with courteous comprehensive smile to one smile one card more decidedly for captain wentworth truth be that elizabeth have be long enough in bath to understand importance of man of such air appearance a past be nothing present be that captain wentworth must move about well in drawing room card be pointedly given sir walter elizabeth arose disappeared interruption have be short though severe ease animation returned to most of left a door shut out not to anne must think only of invitation have with such astonishment witnessed of manner in have be received manner of doubtful meaning of surprise rather than gratification of polite acknowledgement rather than acceptance knew saw disdain in eye must not venture to believe that have determined to accept offering a atonement for insolence of past spirit sank held card in hand after be gone a if deeply considering only think of elizabeth including everybody whispered mary very audibly wonder captain wentworth be delighted see can not put card out of hand anne caught eye saw cheek glow mouth form into momentary expression of contempt turned away that might neither see hear more to vex party separated gentleman have own pursuit lady proceeded on own business met more while anne belonged to be earnestly begged to return dine give rest of day spirit have be so long exerted that at present felt unequal to more fit only for home where might be sure of being a silent a chose promising to be with whole of following morning therefore closed fatigue of present by toilsome walk to camden place there to spend evening chiefly in listening to busy arrangement of elizabeth mr clay for morrow party frequent enumeration of person invited continually improving detail of embellishment be to make most completely elegant of kind in bath while harassing with never ending question of whether captain wentworth must come not be reckoning a certain with be gnawing solicitude never appeased for five minute together generally thought must come because generally thought ought be case must not so shape into positive act of duty discretion a inevitably to defy suggestion of very opposite feeling only roused from brooding of restless agitation to let mr clay know that have be seen with mr elliot three hour after being supposed to be out of bath for having watched in vain for intimation of interview from lady determined to mention seemed to there be guilt in mr clay face a listened be transient cleared away in instant anne must imagine read there consciousness of having by complication of mutual trick overbearing authority of be obliged to attend perhaps for hour to lecture restriction on design on sir walter exclaimed however with very tolerable imitation of nature oh dear very true only think miss elliot to great surprise met with mr elliot in bath street be never more astonished turned back walked with to pump yard have be prevented setting off for thornberry really forget by what for be in hurry must not much attend can only answer for being determined not to be delayed in return wanted to know how early might be admitted to morrow be full of 'to morrow be very evident have be full of too ever since entered house learnt extension of plan have happened seeing must never have gone so entirely out of head chapter one day only have passed since anne conversation with mr smith keener interest have succeeded be now so little touched by mr elliot conduct except by effect in one quarter that became matter of course next morning still to defer explanatory visit in river street have promised to be with musgroves from breakfast to dinner faith be plighted mr elliot character like sultaness scheherazade head must live day must not keep appointment punctually however weather be unfavourable have grieved over rain on friend account felt very much on own before be able to attempt walk when reached white hart made way to proper apartment found arriving quite in time first to arrive party before be mr musgrove talking to mr croft captain harville to captain wentworth immediately heard that mary henrietta too impatient to wait have gone out moment have cleared must be back again soon that strictest injunction have be left with mr musgrove to keep there till returned have only to submit sit down be outwardly composed feel plunged at once in agitation have merely laid account of tasting little before morning closed there be delay waste of time be deep in happiness of such misery misery of such happiness instantly two minute after entering room captain wentworth said will write letter be talking of harville now if will give material material be at hand on separate table went to nearly turning back to be engrossed by writing mr musgrove be giving mr croft history of eldest daughter engagement just in inconvenient tone of voice be perfectly audible while pretended to be whisper anne felt that did not belong to conversation yet a captain harville seemed thoughtful not disposed to talk must not avoid hearing many undesirable particular such a how mr musgrove brother hayter have met again again to talk over what brother hayter have said one day what mr musgrove have proposed next what have occurred to sister hayter what young people have wished what said at first never must consent to be afterwards persuaded to think might do very well great deal in same style of open hearted communication minutia even with advantage of taste delicacy good mr musgrove must not give must be properly interesting only to principal mr croft be attending with great good humour whenever spoke at be very sensibly anne hoped gentleman might be too much self occupied to hear so ma'be thing considered said mr musgrove in powerful whisper though must have wished different yet altogether did not think fair to stand out longer for charles hayter be quite wild about henrietta be pretty near a bad so thought have better marry at once make best of a many others have done before at rate said will be better than long engagement be precisely what be going to observe cried mr croft must rather have young people settle on small income at once have to struggle with few difficulty together than be involved in long engagement always think that mutual oh dear mr croft cried mr musgrove unable to let finish speech there be nothing so abominate for young people a long engagement be what always protested against for child be very well used to say for young people to be engaged if there be certainty of being able to marry in six month even in twelve long engagement yes dear ma'be said mr croft uncertain engagement engagement may be long to begin without knowing at time there will be mean of marrying hold to be very unsafe unwise what think parent must prevent a far a can anne found unexpected interest here felt application to felt in nervous thrill over at same moment that eye instinctively glanced towards distant table captain wentworth pen ceased to move head be raised pausing listening turned round next instant to give look one quick conscious look at two lady continued to talk to re urge same admitted truth enforce with such example of ill effect of contrary practice a have fallen within observation anne heard nothing distinctly be only buzz of word in ear mind be in confusion captain harville who have in truth be hearing none of now left seat moved to window anne seeming to watch though be from thorough absence of mind became gradually sensible that be inviting to join where stood looked at with smile little motion of head expressed come to have something to say unaffected easy kindness of manner denoted feeling of older acquaintance than really be strongly enforced invitation roused went to window at stood be at other

inconceivable vexation on little trifling occurrence catherine interested at once by appearance relationship to mr tilney be desirous of being acquainted with readily talked therefore whenever must think of anything to say have courage leisure for saying hindrance thrown in way of very speedy intimacy by frequent want of one more of requisite prevented doing more than going through first

of perhaps be talking about therefore must advise not to listen may happen to hear something not very agreeable in commonplace chatter lasted time original subject seemed entirely forgotten though

miss morland suppose be to stand up jig together again oh be much obliged to two dance be over besides be tired mean to dance more then let walk about quiz people come along with will show four greatest quizzer in room two younger sister partner have be laughing at half hour again catherine excused at last walked off to quiz sister by rest of evening found very dull mr tilney be drawn away from party at tea to attend of partner miss tilney though belonging to did not sit near james isabella be so much engaged in conversing together that latter have leisure to bestow more on friend than one smile one squeeze one dearest catherine chapter progress of catherine unhappiness from event of evening be a follows appeared first in general dissatisfaction with everybody about while remained in room speedily brought on considerable weariness violent desire to go home on arriving in pulteney street took direction of extraordinary hunger when be appeased changed into earnest longing to be in bed such be extreme point of distress for when there immediately fell into sound sleep lasted nine hour from awoke perfectly revived in excellent spirit with fresh hope fresh scheme first wish of heart be to improve acquaintance with miss tilney almost first resolution to seek for purpose in pump room at noon in pump room one so newly arrived in bath must be met with that building have already found so favourable for discovery of female excellence completion of female intimacy so admirably adapted for secret discourse unlimited confidence that be most reasonably encouraged to expect friend from within wall plan for morning thus settled sat quietly down to book after breakfast resolving to remain in same place same employment till clock struck one from habitude very little incommoded by remark ejaculation of mr allen whose vacancy of mind incapacity for thinking be such that a never talked great deal so must never be entirely silent therefore while sat at work if lost needle broke thread if heard carriage in street saw speck upon gown must observe aloud whether there be anyone at leisure to answer not at about half past twelve remarkably loud rap drew in haste to window scarcely have time to inform catherine of there being two open carriage at door in first only servant brother driving miss thorpe in second before john thorpe came running upstairs calling out well miss morland here be have be waiting long must not come before old devil of coachmaker be such eternity finding out thing fit to be got into now be ten thousand to one break down before be out of street how do do mr allen famous ball last night be not come miss morland be quick for others be in confounded hurry to be off want to get tumble over what do mean said catherine where be going to going to why have not forgot engagement did not agree together to take drive morning what head have be going up claverton down something be said about remember said catherine looking at mr allen for opinion really did not expect not expect be good one what dust must have made if have not come catherine silent appeal to friend meanwhile be entirely thrown away for mr allen not being at in habit of conveying expression by look be not aware of being ever intended by anybody else catherine whose desire of seeing miss tilney again must at moment bear short delay in favour of drive who thought there must be impropriety in going with mr thorpe a isabella be going at same time with james be therefore obliged to speak plainer well ma'be what do say to can spare for hour two will go do just a please dear replied mr allen with most placid indifference catherine took advice ran off to get ready in very few minute reappeared having scarcely allowed two others time enough to get through few short sentence in praise after thorpe have procured mr allen admiration of gig then receiving friend parting good wish hurried downstairs dearest creature cried isabella to whom duty of friendship immediately called before must get into carriage have be at least three hour getting ready be afraid be ill what delightful ball have last night have thousand thing to say to make haste get in for long to be off catherine followed order turned away not too soon to hear friend exclaim aloud to james what sweet girl be quite dote on will not be frightened miss morland said thorpe a handed in if horse must dance about little at first setting off will most likely give plunge two perhaps take rest for minute will soon know master be full of spirit playful a can be there be vice in catherine did not think portrait very inviting one be too late to retreat be too young to own frightened so resigning to fate trusting to animal boasted knowledge of owner sat peaceably down saw thorpe sit down by everything being then arranged servant who stood at horse head be bid in important voice to let go off went in quietest manner imaginable without plunge caper anything like one catherine delighted at so happy escape spoke pleasure aloud with grateful surprise companion immediately made matter perfectly simple by assuring that be entirely owing to peculiarly judicious manner in have then held rein singular discernment dexterity with have directed whip catherine though must not help wondering that with such perfect command of horse must think necessary to alarm with relation of trick congratulated sincerely on being under care of so excellent coachman perceiving that animal continued to go on in same quiet manner without showing smallest propensity towards unpleasant vivacity considering inevitable pace be ten mile hour by mean alarmingly fast gave up to enjoyment of air exercise of most invigorating kind in fine mild day of february with consciousness of safety silence of several minute succeeded first short dialogue be broken by thorpe saying very abruptly old allen be a rich a jew be not catherine did not understand repeated question adding in explanation old allen man be with oh mr allen mean yes believe be very rich child at not famous thing for next heir be godfather be not godfather be always very much with yes very much aye be what meant seems good kind of old fellow enough have lived very well in time dare say be not gouty for nothing doe drink bottle day now bottle day why must think of thing be very temperate man must not fancy in liquor last night lord help woman be always thinking of men being in liquor why suppose man be overset by bottle be sure of if everybody be to drink bottle day there must not be disorder in world there be now must be famous good thing for can not believe lord must be saving of thousand there be not hundredth part of wine consumed in kingdom that there ought to be foggy climate want help yet have heard that there be great deal of wine drunk in oxford oxford there be drinking at oxford now assure nobody drink there must hardly meet with man who go beyond four pint at utmost now for instance be reckoned remarkable thing at last party in room that upon average cleared about five pint head be looked upon a something out of common way mine be famous good stuff to be sure must not often meet with anything like in oxford may account for will just give notion of general rate of drinking there yes doe give notion said catherine warmly be that drink great deal more wine than thought did however be sure james doe not drink so much declaration brought on loud overpowering reply of part be very distinct except frequent exclamation amounting almost to oath adorned catherine be left when ended with rather strengthened belief of there being great deal of wine drunk in oxford same happy conviction of brother comparative sobriety thorpe idea then reverted to merit of own equipage be called on to admire spirit freedom with horse moved along ease pace a well a excellence of spring gave motion of carriage followed in admiration a well a must to go before beyond be impossible knowledge ignorance of subject rapidity of expression diffidence of put that out of power must strike out nothing new in commendation readily echoed whatever chose to assert be finally settled between without difficulty that equipage be altogether most complete of kind in england carriage neatest horse best goer best coachman really think mr thorpe said catherine venturing after time to consider matter a entirely decided to offer little variation on subject that james gig will break down break down oh lord did ever see such little tittuppy thing in life there be not sound piece of iron about wheel have be fairly worn out ten year at least a for body upon soul might shake to piece with touch be most devilish little rickety business ever beheld thank god have got better must not be bound to go two mile in for fifty thousand pound good heaven cried catherine quite frightened then pray let turn back will certainly meet with accident if go on do let turn back mr thorpe stop speak to brother tell how very unsafe be unsafe oh lord what be there in will only get roll if doe break down there be plenty of dirt will be excellent falling oh curse carriage be safe enough if man know how to drive thing of sort in good hand will last above twenty year after be fairly worn out lord bless must undertake for five pound to drive to york back again without losing nail catherine listened with astonishment knew not how to reconcile two such very different account of same thing for have not be brought up to understand propensity of rattle to know to how many idle assertion impudent falsehood excess of vanity will lead own family be plain matter of fact people who seldom aimed at wit of kind father at utmost being contented with pun mother with proverb be not in habit therefore of telling lie to increase importance of asserting at one moment what must contradict next reflected on affair for time in much perplexity be more than once on point of requesting from mr thorpe clearer insight into real opinion on subject checked because appeared to that did not excel in giving clearer insight in making thing plain have before made ambiguous joining to consideration that must not really suffer sister friend to be exposed to danger from might easily preserve concluded at last that must know carriage to be in fact perfectly safe therefore must alarm no longer by whole matter seemed entirely forgotten rest of conversation rather talk began ended with own concern told of horse have bought for trifle sold for incredible sum of racing match in judgment have infallibly foretold winner of shooting party in have killed more bird though without having one good shot than companion together described to famous day sport with fox hound in foresight skill in directing dog have repaired mistake of most experienced huntsman in boldness of riding though have never endangered own life for moment have be constantly leading others into difficulty calmly concluded have broken neck of many little a catherine be in habit of judging for herself unfixed a be general notion of what men ought to be must not entirely repress doubt while bore with effusion of endless conceit of being altogether completely agreeable be bold surmise for be isabella brother have be assured by james that manner must recommend to sex in spite of extreme weariness of company crept over before have be out hour continued unceasingly to increase till stopped in pulteney street again induced in small degree to resist such high authority to distrust power of giving universal pleasure when arrived at mr allen door astonishment of isabella be hardly to be expressed on finding that be too late in day for to attend friend into house past three o'clock be inconceivable incredible impossible must neither believe own watch brother servant must believe assurance of founded on reason reality till morland produced watch ascertained fact to have doubted moment longer then must have be equally inconceivable incredible impossible must only protest over over again that two hour half have ever gone off so swiftly before a catherine be called on to confirm catherine must not tell falsehood even to please isabella latter be spared misery of friend dissenting voice by not waiting for answer own feeling entirely engrossed wretchedness be most acute on finding obliged to go directly home be age since have have moment conversation with dearest catherine though have such thousand of thing to say to appeared a if be never to be together again so with smile of most exquisite misery laughing eye of utter despondency bade friend adieu went on catherine found mr allen just returned from busy idleness of morning be immediately greeted with well dear here be truth have greater inclination than power to dispute hope have have pleasant airing yes ma'be thank must not have have nicer day so mr thorpe said be vastly pleased at going have seen mr thorpe then yes went to pump room a soon a be gone there

mother died be mr tilney partner only son can not be quite positive about dear have idea be however be very fine young man mr hughes say likely to do very well catherine inquired further have heard enough to feel that mr allen have real intelligence to give that be most particularly unfortunate in having missed meeting with brother sister must have foreseen such circumstance nothing must have persuaded to go out with others a be must only lament ill luck think over what have lost till be clear to that drive have by mean be very pleasant john thorpe be quite disagreeable chapter allen thorpe morlands met in evening at theatre a catherine isabella sat together there be then opportunity for latter to utter few of many thousand thing have be collecting within for communication in immeasurable length of time have divided oh heaven beloved catherine have got at last be address on catherine entering box sitting by now mr morland for be close to on other side will not speak word to rest of evening so charge not to expect sweetest catherine how have be long age need not ask for look delightfully really have done hair in more heavenly style than ever mischievous creature do want to attract everybody assure brother be quite in love with already a for mr tilney be settled thing even modesty can not doubt attachment now coming back to bath make too plain oh what must not

till see said catherine be not here can not see anywhere oh horrid be never to be acquainted with how do like gown think doe not look amiss sleeve be entirely own thought do know get so immoderately sick of bath brother be agreeing morning that though be vastly well to be here for few week must not live here for million soon found out that taste be exactly alike in preferring country to other place really opinion be so exactly same be quite ridiculous there be not single point in differed must not have have by for world be such sly thing be sure must have made droll remark other about indeed must not oh yes must indeed know better than know must have told that seemed born for other nonsense of kind must have distressed beyond conception cheek must have be a red a rose must not have have by for world indeed do injustice must not have made so improper remark upon account besides be sure must never have entered head isabella smiled incredulously talked rest of evening to james catherine resolution of endeavouring to meet miss tilney again continued in full force next morning till usual moment of going to pump room felt alarm from dread of second prevention nothing of kind occurred visitor appeared to delay three set off in good time for pump room where ordinary course of event conversation took place mr allen after drinking glass of water joined gentleman to talk over politics of day compare account of newspaper lady walked about together noticing new face almost new bonnet in room female part of thorpe family attended by james morland appeared among crowd in le than quarter of hour catherine immediately took usual place by side of friend james who be now in constant attendance maintained similar position separating from rest of party walked in manner for time till catherine began to doubt happiness of situation confining entirely to friend brother gave very little share in notice of be always engaged in sentimental discussion lively dispute sentiment be conveyed in such whispering voice vivacity attended with so much laughter that though catherine supporting opinion be not unfrequently called for by one other be never able to give from not having heard word of subject at length however be empowered to disengage from friend by avowed necessity of speaking to miss tilney whom most joyfully saw just entering room with mr hughes whom instantly joined with firmer determination to be acquainted than might have have courage to command have not be urged by disappointment of day before miss tilney met with great civility returned advance with equal goodwill continued talking together a long a party remained in room though in probability not observation be made expression used by have not be made used thousand of time before under roof in bath season yet merit of being spoken with simplicity truth without personal conceit might be something uncommon how well brother dance be artless exclamation of catherine towards close of conversation at once surprised amused companion henry replied with smile yes doe dance very well must have thought very odd to hear say be engaged other evening when saw sitting down really have be engaged whole day to mr thorpe miss tilney must only bow can not think added catherine after moment silence how surprised be to see again felt so sure of being quite gone away when henry have pleasure of seeing before be in bath for couple of day came only to engage lodging for never occurred to of course not seeing anywhere thought must be gone be not young lady danced with on monday miss smith acquaintance of mr hughes dare say be very glad to dance do think pretty not very never come to pump room suppose yes sometimes have rid out morning with father mr hughes now joined asked miss tilney if be ready to go hope will have pleasure of seeing again soon said catherine will be at cotillion ball tomorrow perhaps yes think certainly will be glad of for will all be there civility be duly returned parted on miss tilney side with knowledge of new acquaintance feeling on catherine without smallest consciousness of having explained went home very happy morning have answered hope evening of following day be now object of expectation future good what gown what head dress must wear on occasion became chief concern can not be justified in dress be at time frivolous distinction excessive solicitude about often destroys own aim catherine knew very well great aunt have read lecture on subject only christmas before yet lay awake ten minute on wednesday night debating between spotted tamboured muslin nothing shortness of time prevented buying new one for evening must have be error in judgment great though not uncommon from one of other sex rather than own brother rather than great aunt might have warned for man only can be aware of insensibility of man towards new gown must be mortifying to feeling of many lady must be made to understand how little heart of man be affected by what be costly new in attire how little be biased by texture of muslin how unsusceptible of peculiar tenderness towards spotted sprigged mull jackonet woman be fine for own satisfaction alone man will admire more woman will like better for neatness fashion be enough for former something of shabbiness impropriety will be most endearing to latter not one of grave reflection troubled tranquillity of catherine entered room on thursday evening with feeling very different from what have attended thither monday before have then be exulting in engagement to thorpe be now chiefly anxious to avoid sight lest must engage again for though must not dared not expect that mr tilney must ask third time to dance wish hope plan centred in nothing young lady may feel for heroine in critical moment for young lady have at time other known same agitation have be at least have believed to be in danger from pursuit of someone whom wished to avoid have be anxious for attention of someone whom wished to please a soon a be joined by thorpe catherine agony began fidgeted about if john thorpe came towards hid a much a possible from view when spoke to pretended not to hear cotillion be over country dancing beginning saw nothing of tilneys be frightened dear catherine whispered isabella be really going to dance with brother again declare positively be quite shocking tell ought to be ashamed of john must keep in countenance make haste dear creature come to john be just walked off will be back in moment catherine have time inclination to answer others walked away john thorpe be still in view gave up for lost that might not appear however to observe expect kept eye intently fixed on fan self condemnation for folly in supposing that among such crowd must even meet with tilneys in reasonable time have just passed through mind when suddenly found addressed again solicited to dance by mr tilney with what sparkling eye ready motion granted request with how pleasing flutter of heart went with to set may be easily imagined to escape a believed so narrowly escape john thorpe to be asked so immediately on joining asked by mr tilney a if have sought on purpose did not appear to that life must supply greater felicity scarcely have worked into quiet possession of place however when attention be claimed by john thorpe who stood behind heyday miss morland said what be meaning of thought be to dance together wonder must think so for never asked be good one by jove asked a soon a came into room be just going to ask again when turned round be gone be cursed shabby trick only came for sake of dancing with firmly believe be engaged to ever since monday yes remember asked while be waiting in lobby for cloak here have be telling acquaintance be going to dance with prettiest girl in room when see standing up with somebody else will quiz famously oh will never think of after description a by heaven if will kick out of room for blockhead what chap have there catherine satisfied curiosity tilney repeated hum know good figure of man well put together doe want horse here be friend of mine sam fletcher have got one to sell must suit anybody famous clever animal for road only forty guinea have fifty mind to buy for be one of maxim always to buy good horse when meet with one must not answer purpose must not do for field must give money for real good hunter have three now best that ever be backed must not take eight hundred guinea for fletcher mean to get house in leicestershire against next season be so d uncomfortable living at inn be last sentence by must weary catherine attention for be just then borne off by resistless pressure of long string of passing lady partner now drew near said that gentleman must have put out of patience have stayed with minute longer have business to withdraw attention of partner from have entered into contract of mutual agreeableness for space of evening agreeableness belongs solely to other for time nobody can fasten on notice of one without injuring right of other consider country dance a emblem of marriage fidelity complaisance be principal duty of men who choose to dance marry have business with partner wife of neighbour be such very different thing that think can not be compared together to be sure not people that marry can never part must go keep house together people that dance only stand opposite other in long room for hour such be definition of matrimony dancing taken in light certainly resemblance be not striking think must place in view will allow in man have advantage of choice woman only power of refusal that in be engagement between man woman formed for advantage of that when once entered into belong exclusively to other till moment of dissolution that be duty to endeavour to give other cause for wishing that have bestowed elsewhere best interest to keep own imagination from wandering towards perfection of neighbour fancying that must have be better off with anyone else will allow yes to be sure a state sound very well still be so very different can not look upon at in same light think same duty belong to in one respect there certainly be difference in marriage man be supposed to provide for support of woman woman to make home agreeable to man be to purvey be to smile in dancing duty be exactly changed agreeableness compliance be expected from while furnishes fan lavender water that suppose be difference of duty struck a rendering condition incapable of comparison indeed never thought of then be quite at loss one thing however must observe disposition on side be rather alarming totally disallow similarity in obligation may not thence infer that notion of duty of dancing state be not so strict a partner might wish have not reason to fear that if gentleman who spoke to just now be to return if other gentleman be to address there must be nothing to restrain from conversing with a long a chose mr thorpe be such very particular friend of brother that if talk to must talk to again there be hardly three young men in room besides have acquaintance with be to be only security ala ala nay be sure can not have better for if know anybody be impossible for to talk to besides want to talk to anybody now have given security worth having will proceed with courage do find bath a agreeable a when have honour of making inquiry before yes quite more so indeed more so take care will forget to be tired of at proper time ought to be tired at end of six week think must be tired if be to stay here six month bath compared with london have little variety so everybody find out year six week allow bath be pleasant enough beyond that be most tiresome place in world must be told so by people of description who come regularly winter lengthen six week into ten twelve go away at last because can afford to stay no longer well other people must judge for who go to london may think nothing of bath who live in small retired village in country can never find greater sameness in place a than in own home for here be variety of amusement variety of thing to be seen done day long can know nothing of there be not fond of country yes be have always lived there always be very happy certainly there be much more sameness in country life than in bath life one day in country be exactly like then spend time so much more rationally in country do do not believe there be much difference here be in pursuit only of amusement day long so be at home only find so much of walk about here so do there here see variety of people in street there can only go call on mr allen mr tilney be very much amused only go call on mr allen repeated what picture of intellectual poverty however when sink into abyss again will have more to say will be able to talk of bath of that did here oh yes will never be in want of something to talk of again to mr allen anybody else really believe will always be talking of bath when be at home again do like so very much if must have papa mamma rest of here suppose must be too happy james coming eldest brother be quite delightful especially a turn out that very family be just got so intimate with be intimate friend already oh who can ever be tired of bath not who bring such fresh feeling of sort to a do papa mamma brother intimate friend be good deal gone by to most of frequenter of bath honest relish of ball play everyday sight be past with here conversation closed demand of dance becoming now too importunate for divided attention soon after reaching bottom of set catherine perceived to be earnestly regarded by gentleman who stood among looker on immediately behind partner be very handsome man of commanding aspect past bloom not past vigour of life with eye still directed towards saw presently address mr tilney in familiar whisper confused by notice blushing from fear of being excited by something wrong in appearance turned away head while did so gentleman retreated partner coming nearer said see that guess what have just be asked that gentleman know name have right to know be general tilney father catherine answer be only oh be oh expressing everything needful attention to word perfect reliance on truth with real interest strong admiration did eye now follow general a moved through crowd how handsome family be be secret remark in chatting with miss tilney before evening concluded new source of felicity arose to have never taken country walk since arrival in bath miss tilney to whom commonly frequented environs be familiar spoke of in term made eagerness to know too on openly fearing that might find nobody to go with be proposed by brother sister that must join in walk morning other will like cried beyond anything in world let put off let go tomorrow be readily agreed to with only proviso of miss tilney that did not rain catherine be sure must not at twelve o'clock be to call for in pulteney street remember twelve o'clock be parting speech to new friend of other older more established friend isabella of whose fidelity worth have enjoyed fortnight experience scarcely saw anything during evening yet though longing to make acquainted with happiness cheerfully submitted to wish of mr allen took rather early away spirit danced within a danced in chair way home chapter morrow brought very sober looking morning sun making only few effort to appear catherine augured from everything most favourable to wish bright morning so early in year allowed must generally turn to rain cloudy one foretold improvement a day advanced applied to mr allen for confirmation of hope mr allen not having own sky barometer about declined giving absolute promise of sunshine applied to mr allen mr allen opinion be more positive have doubt in world of being very fine day if cloud must only go off sun keep out at

in pump room if rain morning hope mr allen will put on greatcoat when go dare say will not for have rather do anything in world than walk out in greatcoat wonder must dislike must be so comfortable rain continued fast though not heavy catherine went five minute to clock threatening on return that if still kept on raining five minute must give up matter a hopeless clock struck twelve still rained

persuade to go be general cry mr allen be not inattentive to well dear said suppose go in two minute be off catherine feeling a got into carriage be in very unsettled state divided between regret for loss of one great pleasure hope of soon enjoying almost equal in degree however unlike in kind must not think tilneys have acted quite well by in so readily giving up engagement without sending message of excuse be now hour later than time fixed on for beginning of walk in spite of what have heard of prodigious accumulation of dirt in course of hour must not from own observation help thinking that might have gone with very little inconvenience to feel slighted by be very painful on other hand delight of exploring edifice like udolpho a fancy represented blaize castle to be be such counterpoise of good a might console for almost anything passed briskly down pulteney street through laura place without exchange of many word thorpe talked to horse meditated by turn on broken promise broken arch phaeton false hanging tilneys trap door a entered argyle building however be roused by address from companion who be that girl who looked at so hard a went by who where on right hand pavement must be almost out of sight now catherine looked round saw miss tilney leaning on brother arm walking slowly down street saw looking back at stop stop mr thorpe impatiently cried be miss tilney be indeed how must tell be gone stop stop will get out moment go to to what purpose did speak thorpe only lashed horse into brisker trot tilneys who have soon ceased to look after be in moment out of sight round corner of laura place in moment be whisked into marketplace still however during length of street entreated to stop pray pray stop mr thorpe can not go on will not go on must go back to miss tilney mr thorpe only laughed smacked whip encouraged horse made odd noise drove on catherine angry vexed a be having power of getting away be obliged to give up point submit reproach however be not spared how must deceive so mr thorpe how must say that saw driving up lansdown road must not have have happen so for world must think so strange so rude of to go by too without saying word know how vexed be will have pleasure at clifton in anything else have rather ten thousand time rather get out now walk back to how must say saw driving out in phaeton thorpe defended very stoutly declared have never seen two men so much alike in life must hardly give up point of having be tilney drive even when subject be over be not likely to be very agreeable catherine complaisance be no longer what have be in former airing listened reluctantly reply be short blaize castle remained only comfort towards that still looked at interval with pleasure though rather than be disappointed of promised walk especially rather than be thought ill of by tilneys must willingly have given up happiness wall must supply happiness of progress through long suite of lofty room exhibiting remains of magnificent furniture though now for many year deserted happiness of being stopped in way along narrow winding vault by low grated door even of having lamp only lamp extinguished by sudden gust of wind of being left in total darkness in meanwhile proceeded on journey without mischance be within view of town of keynsham when halloo from morland who be behind made friend pull up to know what be matter others then came close enough for conversation morland said have better go back thorpe be too late to go on today sister think so a well a have be exactly hour coming from pulteney street very little more than seven mile suppose have at least eight more to go will never do set out great deal too late have much better put off till day turn round be one to replied thorpe rather angrily instantly turning horse be on way back to bath if brother have not got d beast to drive said soon afterwards might have done very well horse must have trotted to clifton within hour if left to have almost broke arm with pulling in to cursed broken winded jade pace morland be fool for not keeping horse gig of own be not said catherine warmly for be sure must not afford why can not afford because have not money enough whose fault be that nobody know of thorpe then said something in loud incoherent way to have often recourse about being d thing to be miserly that if people who rolled in money must not afford thing did not know who must catherine did not even endeavour to understand disappointed of what be to have be consolation for first disappointment be le le disposed to be agreeable to find companion so returned to pulteney street without speaking twenty word a entered house footman told that gentleman lady have called inquired for few minute after setting off when told be gone out with mr thorpe lady have asked whether message have be left for on saying have felt for card said have none about went away pondering over heart rending tidings catherine walked slowly upstairs at head of be met by mr allen who on hearing reason of speedy return said be glad brother have so much sense be glad be come back be strange wild scheme spent evening together at thorpe catherine be disturbed out of spirit isabella seemed to find pool of commerce in fate of shared by private partnership with morland very good equivalent for quiet country air of inn at clifton satisfaction too in not being at lower room be spoken more than once how pity poor creature be going there how glad be be not amongst wonder whether will be full ball not have not begun dancing yet must not be there for world be so delightful to have evening now then to dare say will not be very good ball know mitchell will not be there be sure pity everybody be dare say mr morland long to be at be sure do well pray let anybody here be restraint on dare say must do very well without men think yourselves of such consequence catherine must almost have accused isabella of being wanting in tenderness towards sorrow so very little did appear to dwell on mind so very inadequate be comfort offered be so dull dearest creature whispered will quite break heart be amazingly shocking to be sure tilneys be entirely to blame why be not more punctual be dirty indeed what did signify be sure john must not have minded never mind going through anything where friend be concerned that be disposition john be just same have amazing strong feeling good heaven what delightful hand have got king vow never be so happy in life must fifty time rather must have than now may dismiss heroine to sleepless couch be true heroine portion to pillow strewed with thorn wet with tear lucky may think if get good night rest in course of next three month chapter mr allen said catherine next morning will there be harm in calling on miss tilney today will not be easy till have explained everything go by mean dear only put on white gown miss tilney always wear white catherine cheerfully complied being properly equipped be more impatient than ever to be at pump room that might inform herself of general tilney lodging for though believed be in milsom street be not certain of house mr allen wavering conviction only made more doubtful to milsom street be directed having made perfect in number hastened away with eager step beating heart to pay visit explain conduct be forgiven tripping lightly through church yard resolutely turning away eye that might not be obliged to see beloved isabella dear family who have reason to believe be in shop hard by reached house without impediment looked at number knocked at door inquired for miss tilney man believed miss tilney to be at home be not quite certain must be pleased to send up name gave card in few minute servant returned with look did not quite confirm word said have be mistaken for miss tilney be walked out catherine with blush of mortification left house felt almost persuaded that miss tilney be at home too much offended to admit a retired down street must not withhold one glance at drawing room window in expectation of seeing there one appeared at at bottom of street however looked back again then not at window issuing from door saw miss tilney be followed by gentleman whom catherine believed to be father turned up towards edgar building catherine in deep mortification proceeded on way must almost be angry at such angry incivility checked resentful sensation remembered own ignorance knew not how such offence a hers might be classed by law of worldly politeness to what degree of unforgivingness might with propriety lead to what rigour of rudeness in return might justly make amenable dejected humbled have even thought of not going with others to theatre night must be confessed that be not of long continuance for soon recollected in first place that be without excuse for staying at home in second that be play wanted very much to see to theatre accordingly went tilneys appeared to plague please feared that amongst many perfection of family fondness for play be not to be ranked perhaps be because be habituated to finer performance of london stage knew on isabella authority rendered everything else of kind quite horrid be not deceived in own expectation of pleasure comedy so well suspended care that one observing during first four act must have supposed have wretchedness about on beginning of fifth however sudden view of mr henry tilney father joining party in opposite box recalled to anxiety distress stage must no longer excite genuine merriment no longer keep whole attention other look upon average be directed towards opposite box for space of two entire scene did thus watch henry tilney without being once able to catch eye no longer must be suspected of indifference for play notice be never withdrawn from stage during two whole scene at length however did look towards bowed bow smile continued observance attended eye be immediately returned to former direction catherine be restlessly miserable must almost have run round to box in sat forced to hear explanation feeling rather natural than heroic possessed instead of considering own dignity injured by ready condemnation instead of proudly resolving in conscious innocence to show resentment towards who must harbour doubt of to leave to trouble of seeking explanation to enlighten on past only by avoiding sight flirting with somebody else took to herself shame of misconduct at least of appearance be only eager for opportunity of explaining cause play concluded curtain fell henry tilney be no longer to be seen where have hitherto sat father remained perhaps might be now coming round to box be right in few minute appeared making way through then thinning row spoke with like calm politeness to mr allen friend not with such calmness be answered by latter oh mr tilney have be quite wild to speak to make apology must have thought so rude indeed be not own fault be mr allen did not tell that mr tilney sister be gone out in phaeton together then what must do have ten thousand time rather have be with now have not mr allen dear tumble gown be mr allen reply assurance however standing sole a did be not thrown away brought more cordial more natural smile into countenance replied in tone retained only little affected reserve be much obliged to at rate for wishing pleasant walk after passing in argyle street be so kind a to look back on purpose indeed did not wish pleasant walk never thought of such thing begged mr thorpe so earnestly to stop called out to a soon a ever saw now mr allen did not oh be not there indeed did if mr thorpe must only have stopped must have jumped out run after be there henry in world who must be insensible to declaration henry tilney at least be not with yet sweeter smile said everything need be said of sister concern regret dependence on catherine honour oh say miss tilney be not angry cried catherine because know be for must not see morning when called saw walk out of house next minute after leaving be hurt be not affronted perhaps did not know have be there be not within at time heard of from eleanor have be wishing ever since to see to explain reason of such incivility perhaps can do a well be nothing more than father be just preparing to walk out being hurried for time not caring to have put off made point of being denied be do assure be very much vexed meant to make apology a soon a possible catherine mind be greatly eased by information yet something of solicitude remained from sprang following question thoroughly artless in though rather distressing to gentleman mr tilney why be le generous than sister if felt such confidence in good intention must suppose to be only mistake why must be so ready to take offence take offence nay be sure by look when came into box be angry angry must have right well nobody must have thought have right who saw face replied by asking to make room for talking of play remained with time be only too agreeable for catherine to be contented when went away before parted however be agreed that projected walk must be taken a soon a possible setting aside misery of quitting box be upon whole left one of happiest creature in world while talking to other have observed with surprise john thorpe who be never in same part of house for ten minute together be engaged in conversation with general tilney felt something more than surprise when thought must perceive object of attention discourse what must have to say of feared general tilney did not like appearance found be implied in preventing admittance to daughter rather than postpone own walk few minute how came mr thorpe to know father be anxious inquiry a pointed out to companion knew nothing about father like military man have very large acquaintance when entertainment be over thorpe came to assist in getting out catherine be immediate object of gallantry while waited in lobby for chair prevented inquiry have travelled from heart almost to tip of tongue by asking in consequential manner whether have seen talking with general tilney be fine old fellow upon soul stout active look a young a son have great regard for assure gentleman like good sort of fellow a ever lived how came to know know there be few people much about town know have met forever at bedford knew face again today moment came into billiard room one of best player have by by have little touch together though be almost afraid of at first odds be five to four against if have not made one of cleanest stroke that perhaps ever be made in world took ball exactly must not make understand without table however did beat very fine fellow a rich a jew must like to dine with dare say give famous dinner what do think have be talking of yes by heaven general think finest girl in bath oh nonsense how can say so what do think said lowering voice well done general said be quite of mind here catherine who be much le gratified by admiration than by general tilney be not sorry to be called away by mr allen thorpe however must see to chair till entered continued same kind of delicate flattery in spite of entreating to have done general tilney instead of disliking must admire be very delightful joyfully thought that there be not one of family whom need now fear to meet evening have done more much more for than must have be expected chapter monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday saturday have now passed in review before reader event of day hope fear mortification pleasure have be separately stated pang of sunday only now remain to be described close week clifton scheme have be deferred not relinquished on afternoon crescent of day be brought forward again in private consultation between isabella james former of whom have particularly set heart upon going latter le anxiously placed upon pleasing be agreed that provided weather be fair party must take place on following morning be to set off very early in order to be at home in good time affair thus determined be approbation secured catherine only remained to be apprised of have left for few minute to speak to miss tilney in interval plan be completed a soon a came again agreement be demanded instead of gay acquiescence expected by isabella catherine looked grave be very sorry must not go engagement ought to have kept from joining in former attempt must make impossible for to accompany now have that moment settled with miss tilney to take proposed walk tomorrow be quite determined must not upon account retract that must must retract be instantly eager cry of thorpe must go to clifton tomorrow must not go without must be nothing to put off mere walk for one day longer must not hear of refusal catherine be distressed not subdued urge isabella be engaged to miss tilney can not go availed nothing same argument assailed again must go must go must not hear of refusal must be so easy to tell miss tilney that have just be reminded of prior engagement must only beg to put off walk till tuesday must not be easy must not do there have be prior engagement isabella became only more more urgent calling on in most affectionate manner addressing by most endearing name be sure dearest sweetest catherine must not seriously refuse such trifling request to friend who loved so dearly knew beloved catherine to have so feeling heart so sweet temper to be so easily persuaded by loved in vain catherine felt to be in right though pained by such tender such flattering supplication must not allow to influence isabella then tried method reproached with having more affection for miss tilney though have known so little while than for best oldest friend with being grown cold indifferent in short towards can not help being jealous catherine when see slighted for stranger who love so excessively when once affection be placed be not in power of anything to change believe feeling be stronger than anybody be sure be too strong for own peace to see supplanted in friendship by stranger doe cut to quick own tilneys seem to swallow up everything else catherine thought reproach equally strange unkind be part of friend thus to expose feeling to notice of others isabella appeared to ungenerous selfish regardless of everything own gratification painful idea crossed mind though said nothing isabella in meanwhile have applied handkerchief to eye morland miserable at sight must not help saying nay catherine think can not stand out longer now sacrifice be not much to oblige friend will think quite unkind if still refuse be first time of brother openly siding against anxious to avoid displeasure proposed compromise if must only put off scheme till tuesday might easily do a depended only on must go with everybody might then be satisfied be immediate answer must not be for thorpe did not know that might not go to town on tuesday catherine be sorry must do more short silence ensued be broken by isabella who in voice of cold resentment said very well then there be end of party if catherine doe not go can not can not be only woman must not upon account in world do so improper thing catherine must go said james why can not mr thorpe drive one of other sister dare say of must like to go thank ye cried thorpe did not come to bath to drive sister about look like fool no if go d if do only go for sake of driving be compliment give pleasure word be lost on thorpe who have turned abruptly away three others still continued together walking in most uncomfortable manner to poor catherine sometimes not word be said sometimes be again attacked with supplication reproach arm be still linked within isabella though heart be at war at one moment be softened at irritated always distressed always steady did not think have be so obstinate catherine said james be not used to be so hard to persuade once be kindest best tempered of sister hope be not le so now replied very feelingly indeed can not go if be wrong be doing what believe to be right suspect said isabella in low voice there be great struggle catherine heart swelled drew away arm isabella made opposition thus passed long ten minute till be again joined by thorpe who coming to with gayer look said well have settled matter now may go tomorrow with safe conscience have be to miss tilney made excuse have not cried catherine have upon soul left moment told have sent to say that having just recollected prior engagement of going to clifton with tomorrow must not have pleasure of walking with till tuesday said very well tuesday be just a convenient to so there be end of difficulty pretty good thought of mine hey isabella countenance be once more smile good humour james too looked happy again most heavenly thought indeed now sweet catherine distress be over be honourably acquitted will have most delightful party will not do said catherine can not submit to must run after miss tilney directly set right isabella however caught hold of one hand thorpe of other remonstrance poured in from three even james be quite angry when everything be settled when miss tilney herself said that tuesday must suit a well be quite ridiculous quite absurd to make further objection care mr thorpe have business to invent such message if have thought right to put off must have spoken to miss tilney be only doing in ruder way how do know that mr thorpe have may be mistaken again perhaps led into one act of rudeness by mistake on friday let go mr thorpe isabella hold thorpe told must be in vain to go after tilneys be turning corner into brock street when have overtaken be at home by time then will go after said catherine wherever be will go after doe not signify talking if must not be persuaded into doing what thought wrong never will be tricked into with word broke away hurried off thorpe must have darted after morland withheld let go let go if will go be a obstinate a thorpe never finished simile for must hardly have be proper one away walked catherine in great agitation a fast a crowd must permit fearful of being pursued yet determined to persevere a walked reflected on what have passed be painful to to disappoint displease particularly to displease brother must not repent resistance setting own inclination apart to have failed second time in engagement to miss tilney to have retracted promise voluntarily made only five minute before on false pretence too must have be wrong have not be withstanding on selfish principle alone have not consulted merely own gratification might have be ensured in degree by excursion by seeing blaize castle have attended to what be due to others to own character in opinion conviction of being right however be not enough to restore composure till have spoken to miss tilney must not be at ease quickening pace when got clear of crescent almost ran over remaining ground till gained top of milsom street so rapid have be movement that in spite of tilneys advantage in outset be just turning into lodging a came within view of servant still remaining at open door used only ceremony of saying that must speak with miss tilney moment hurrying by proceeded upstairs then opening first door before happened to be right immediately found in drawing room with general tilney son daughter explanation defective only in being from irritation of nerve shortness of breath explanation at be instantly given be come in great hurry be mistake never promised to go told from first must not go ran away in great hurry to explain did not care what thought of must not stay for servant business however though not perfectly elucidated by speech soon ceased to be puzzle catherine found that john thorpe have given message miss tilney have scruple in owning greatly surprised by whether brother have still exceeded in resentment catherine though instinctively addressed a much to one a to other in vindication have mean of knowing might have be felt before arrival eager declaration immediately made look sentence a friendly a must desire affair thus happily settled be introduced by miss tilney to father received by with such ready such solicitous politeness a recalled thorpe information to mind made think with pleasure that might be sometimes depended on to such anxious attention be general civility carried that not aware of extraordinary swiftness in entering house be quite angry with servant whose neglect have reduced to open door of apartment what did william mean by must make point of inquiring into matter if catherine have not most warmly asserted innocence seemed likely that william must lose favour of master forever if not place by rapidity after sitting with quarter of hour rose to take leave be then most agreeably surprised by general tilney asking if must do daughter honour of dining spending rest of day with miss tilney added own wish catherine be greatly obliged be quite out of power mr mr allen must expect back moment general declared must say no more claim of mr mr allen be not to be superseded on other day trusted when longer notice must be given must not refuse to spare to friend oh catherine be sure must not have least objection must have great pleasure in coming general attended to street door saying everything gallant a went downstairs admiring elasticity of walk corresponded exactly with spirit of dancing making one of most graceful bow have ever beheld when parted catherine delighted by have passed proceeded gaily to pulteney street walking a concluded with great elasticity though have never thought of before reached home without seeing anything more of offended party now that have be triumphant throughout have carried point be secure of walk began a flutter of spirit subsided to doubt whether have be perfectly right sacrifice be always noble if have given way to entreaty must have be spared distressing idea of friend displeased brother angry scheme of great happiness to destroyed perhaps through mean to ease mind ascertain by opinion of unprejudiced person what own conduct have really be took occasion to mention before mr allen half settled scheme of brother thorpe for following day mr allen caught at directly well said do think of going too have just engaged to walk with miss tilney before told of therefore know must not go with must no certainly not be glad think of scheme be not at thing young men woman driving about country in open carriage now then be very well going to inn public place together be not right wonder mr thorpe must allow be glad think of going be sure mr morland must not be pleased mr allen be not of way of thinking think kind of project objectionable yes very much so indeed open carriage be nasty thing clean gown be not five minute wear in be splashed getting in getting out wind take hair bonnet in direction hate open carriage know do be not question think have odd appearance if young lady be frequently driven about in by young men to whom be not even related yes dear very odd appearance indeed can not bear to see dear madam cried catherine then why did not tell so before be sure if have known to be improper must not have gone with mr thorpe at always hoped must tell if thought be doing wrong so must dear may depend on for a told mr morland at parting must always do best for in power one must not be over particular young people will be young people a good mother say know wanted when first came not to buy that sprigged muslin must young people like to be always thwarted be something of real consequence think must have found hard to persuade a far a have gone hitherto there be harm done said mr allen must only advise dear not to go out with mr thorpe more be just what be going to say added wife catherine relieved for felt uneasy for isabella after moment thought asked mr allen whether must not be proper kind in to write to miss thorpe explain indecorum of must be a insensible a herself for considered that isabella might otherwise perhaps be going to clifton next day in spite of what have passed mr allen however discouraged from doing such thing have better leave alone dear be old enough to know what be about if not have mother to advise mr thorpe be too indulgent beyond doubt however have better not interfere brother choose to go will be only getting ill will catherine submitted though sorry to think that isabella must be doing wrong felt greatly relieved by mr allen approbation of own conduct truly rejoiced to be preserved by advice from danger of falling into error escape from being one of party to clifton be now escape indeed for what must tilneys have thought of if have broken promise to in order to do what be wrong in if have be guilty of one breach of propriety only to enable to be guilty of chapter next morning be fair catherine almost expected attack from assembled party with mr allen to support felt dread of event must gladly be spared contest where victory be painful be heartily rejoiced therefore at seeing hearing anything of tilneys called for her at appointed time new difficulty arising sudden recollection unexpected summons impertinent intrusion to disconcert measure heroine be most unnaturally able to fulfil engagement though be made with hero determined on walking round beechen cliff noble hill whose beautiful verdure hanging coppice render so striking object from almost opening in bath never look at said catherine a walked along side of river without thinking of south of france have be abroad then said little surprised oh only mean what have read about always put in mind of country emily father travelled through in mystery of udolpho never read novel dare say why not because be not clever enough for gentleman read better book person be gentleman lady who have not pleasure in good novel must be intolerably stupid have read mr radcliffe work most of with great pleasure mystery of udolpho when have once begun must not lay down again remember finishing in two day hair standing on end whole time yes added miss tilney remember that undertook to read aloud to that when be called away for only five minute to answer note instead of waiting for took volume into hermitage walk be obliged to stay till have finished thank eleanor most honourable testimony see miss morland injustice of suspicion here be in eagerness to get on refusing to wait only five minute for sister breaking promise have made of reading aloud keeping in suspense at most interesting part by running away with volume be to observe be own particularly own be proud when reflect on think must establish in good opinion be very glad to hear indeed now will never be ashamed of liking udolpho really thought before young men despised novel amazingly be amazingly may well suggest amazement if do for read nearly a many a woman have read hundred hundred imagine that can cope with in knowledge of julias louisas if proceed to particular engage in never ceasing inquiry of 'have read 'have read that ' will soon leave a far behind a what will say want appropriate simile a far a friend emily left poor valancourt when went with aunt into italy consider how many year have have start of have entered on study at oxford while be good little girl working sampler at home not very good be afraid now really think udolpho nicest book in world nicest by suppose mean neatest must depend upon binding henry said miss tilney be very impertinent miss morland be treating exactly a doe sister be forever finding fault with for incorrectness of language now be taking same liberty with word 'nicest a used did not suit have better change a soon a can will be overpowered with johnson blair rest of way be sure cried catherine did not mean to say anything wrong be nice book why must not call so very true said henry be very nice day be taking very nice walk be two very nice young lady oh be very nice word indeed doe for everything originally perhaps be applied only to express neatness propriety delicacy refinement people be nice in dress in sentiment choice now commendation on subject be comprised in one word while in fact cried sister ought only to be applied to without commendation at be more nice than wise come miss morland let leave to meditate over fault in utmost propriety of diction while praise udolpho in term like best be most interesting work be fond of kind of reading to say truth much like other indeed be can read poetry play thing of sort dislike travel history real solemn history can not be interested in can yes be fond of history wish be too read little a duty tell nothing doe not either vex weary quarrel of pope king with war pestilence in page men so good for nothing hardly woman at be very tiresome yet often think odd that must be so dull for great deal of must be invention speech be put into hero mouth thought design chief of must be invention invention be what delight in other book historian think said miss tilney be not happy in flight of fancy display imagination without raising interest be fond of history be very well contented to take false with true in principal fact have source of intelligence in former history record may be a much depended on conclude a anything doe not actually pas under one own observation a for little embellishment speak of be embellishment like a such if speech be well drawn up read with pleasure by whomsoever may be made probably with much greater if production of mr hume mr robertson than if genuine word of caractacus agricola alfred great be fond of history so be mr allen father have two brother who dislike so many instance within small circle of friend be remarkable at rate will not pity writer of history longer if people like to read book be very well to be at so much trouble in filling great volume a used to think nobody must willingly ever look into to be labouring only for torment of little boy girl always struck a hard fate though know be very right necessary have often wondered at person courage must sit down on purpose to do little boy girl must be tormented said henry be what one at acquainted with human nature in civilized state can deny in behalf of most distinguished historian must observe that might well be offended at being supposed to have higher aim that by method style be perfectly well qualified to torment reader of most advanced reason mature time of life use verb torment ' a observed to be own method instead of 'to instruct ' supposing to be now admitted a synonymous think foolish to call instruction torment if have be a much used a to hear poor little child first learning letter then learning to spell if have ever seen how stupid can be for whole morning together how tired poor mother be at end of a be in habit of seeing almost day of life at home must allow 'to torment ' instruct ' might sometimes be used a synonymous word very probably historian be not accountable for difficulty of learning to read even who altogether seem particularly friendly to very severe very intense application may perhaps be brought to acknowledge that be very well worth while to be tormented for two three year of one life for sake of being able to read rest of consider if reading have not be taught mr radcliffe must have written in vain perhaps might not have written at catherine assented very warm panegyric from on lady merit closed subject tilneys be soon engaged in on have nothing to say be viewing country with eye of person accustomed to drawing decided on capability of being formed into picture with eagerness of real taste here catherine be quite lost knew nothing of drawing nothing of taste listened to with attention brought little profit for talked in phrase conveyed scarcely idea to little must understand however appeared to contradict very few notion have entertained on matter before seemed a if good view be no longer to be taken from top of high hill that clear blue sky be no longer proof of fine day be heartily ashamed of ignorance misplaced shame where people wish to attach must always be ignorant to come with well informed mind be to come with inability of administering to vanity of others sensible person must always wish to avoid woman especially if have misfortune of knowing anything must conceal a well a can advantage of natural folly in beautiful girl have be already set forth by capital pen of sister author to treatment of subject will only add in justice to men though to larger more trifling part of sex imbecility in female be great enhancement of personal charm there be portion of too reasonable too well informed to desire anything more in woman than ignorance catherine did not know own advantage did not know that good looking girl with affectionate heart very ignorant mind can not fail of attracting clever young man unless circumstance be particularly untoward in present instance confessed lamented want of knowledge declared that must give anything in world to be able to draw lecture on picturesque immediately followed in instruction be so clear that soon began to see beauty in everything admired by attention be so earnest that became perfectly satisfied of having great deal of natural taste talked of foreground distance second distance side screen perspective light shade catherine be so hopeful scholar when gained top of beechen cliff voluntarily rejected whole city of bath a unworthy to make part of landscape delighted with progress fearful of wearying with too much wisdom at once henry suffered subject to decline by easy transition from piece of rocky fragment withered oak have placed near summit to oak in general to forest enclosure of waste land crown land government shortly found arrived at politics from politics be easy step to silence general pause succeeded short disquisition on state of nation be put end to by catherine who in rather solemn tone of voice uttered word have heard that something very shocking indeed will soon come out in london miss tilney to whom be chiefly addressed be startled hastily replied indeed of what nature know who be author have only heard that be to be more horrible than anything have met with yet good heaven where must hear of such thing particular friend of mine have account of in letter from london yesterday be to be uncommonly dreadful will expect murder everything of kind speak with astonishing composure hope friend account have be exaggerated if such design be known beforehand proper measure will undoubtedly be taken by government to prevent coming to effect government said henry endeavouring not to smile desire dare to interfere in such matter there must be murder government care not how much lady stared laughed added come will make understand other leave to puzzle out explanation a can will be noble

keen perhaps may want observation discernment judgment fire genius wit miss morland mind what say have goodness to satisfy a to dreadful riot riot what riot dear eleanor riot be only in own brain confusion there be scandalous miss morland have be talking of nothing more dreadful than new publication be shortly to come out in three duodecimo volume two hundred seventy six page in with frontispiece to first of two tombstone lantern do understand miss morland stupid sister have mistaken clearest expression talked of expected horror in london instead of instantly conceiving a rational

knocked off horse by brickbat from upper window forgive stupidity fear of sister have added to weakness of woman be by mean simpleton in general catherine looked grave now henry said miss tilney that have made understand other may a well make miss morland understand unless mean to have think intolerably rude to sister great brute in opinion of woman in general miss morland be not used to odd way will be most happy to make better acquainted with doubt be explanation of present what be to do know what ought to do clear character handsomely before tell that think very highly of understanding of woman miss morland think very highly of understanding of woman in world especially of whoever may be with whom happen to be in company be not enough be more serious miss morland one can think more highly of understanding of woman than do in opinion nature have given so much that never find necessary to use more than half will get nothing more serious from now miss morland be not in sober mood

politely received by general tilney kindly welcomed by daughter though henry be at home one else of party found on return without spending many hour in examination of feeling that have gone to appointment preparing for happiness have not afforded instead of finding improved in acquaintance with miss tilney from intercourse of day seemed hardly so intimate with a before instead of seeing henry tilney to greater advantage than ever in ease of family party have never said so little be so little agreeable in spite of father great civility to in spite of thanks invitation compliment have be release to get away from puzzled to account for must not be general tilney fault that be perfectly agreeable good natured altogether very charming man did not admit of doubt for be tall handsome henry father must not be accountable for child want of spirit for want of enjoyment in company former hoped at last might have be accidental latter must only attribute to own stupidity isabella on hearing particular of visit gave different explanation be pride pride insufferable haughtiness pride have long suspected family to be very high made certain such insolence of behaviour a miss tilney have never heard of in life not to do honour of house with common good breeding to behave to guest with such superciliousness hardly even to speak to be not so bad a isabella there be superciliousness be very civil oh defend then brother who have appeared so attached to good heaven well people feeling be incomprehensible so hardly looked once at whole day say so did not seem in good spirit how contemptible of thing in world inconstancy be aversion let entreat never to think of again dear catherine indeed be unworthy of unworthy suppose ever think of be exactly what say never think of such fickleness oh how different to brother to mine really believe john have most constant heart a for general tilney assure must be impossible for anybody to behave to with greater civility attention seemed to be only care to entertain make happy oh know harm of suspect of pride believe be very gentleman like man john think very well of john judgment well will see how behave to evening will meet at room must go intend thought be settled nay since make such point of can refuse nothing insist upon being very agreeable for heart know will be forty mile off a for dancing mention beg be quite out of question charles hodges will plague to death dare say will cut very short ten to one guess reason be exactly what want to avoid so will insist on keeping conjecture to isabella opinion of tilneys did not influence friend be sure there have be insolence in manner of brother sister did not credit there being pride in heart evening rewarded confidence be met by one with same kindness by other with same attention a heretofore miss tilney took pain to be near henry asked to dance having heard day before in milsom street that elder brother captain tilney be expected almost hour be at loss for name of very fashionable looking handsome young man whom have never seen before who now evidently belonged to party looked at with great admiration even supposed possible that people might think handsomer than brother though in eye air be more assuming countenance le prepossessing taste manner be beyond doubt decidedly inferior for within hearing not only protested against thought of dancing even laughed openly at henry for finding possible from latter circumstance may be presumed that might be heroine opinion of admiration of be not of very dangerous kind not likely to produce animosity between brother persecution to lady can not be instigator of three villain in horseman greatcoat by whom will hereafter be forced into traveling chaise four will drive off with incredible speed catherine meanwhile undisturbed by presentiment of such evil of evil at except of having short set to dance down enjoyed usual happiness with henry tilney listening with sparkling eye to everything said in finding irresistible becoming so at end of first dance captain tilney came towards again much to catherine dissatisfaction pulled brother away retired whispering together though delicate sensibility did not take immediate alarm lay down a fact that captain tilney must have heard malevolent misrepresentation of now hastened to communicate to brother in hope of separating forever must not have partner conveyed from sight without very uneasy sensation suspense be of full five minute duration be beginning to think very long quarter of hour when returned explanation be given by henry requesting to know if thought friend miss thorpe must have objection to dancing a brother must be most happy to be introduced to catherine without hesitation replied that be very sure miss thorpe did not mean to dance at cruel reply be passed on to other immediately walked away brother will not mind know said because heard say before hated dancing be very good natured in to think of suppose saw isabella sitting down fancied might wish for partner be quite mistaken for must not dance upon account in world henry smiled said how very little trouble can give to understand motive of other people action why what do mean with be not how be such one likely to be influenced what be inducement most likely to act upon person feeling age situation probable habit of life considered how must be influenced what must be inducement in acting so so understand then be on very unequal term for understand perfectly well yes can not speak well enough to be unintelligible bravo excellent satire on modern language pray tell what mean will indeed do really desire be not aware of consequence will involve in very cruel embarrassment certainly bring on disagreement between no will not do either be not afraid well then only meant that attributing brother wish of dancing with miss thorpe to good nature alone convinced of being superior in good nature to rest of world catherine blushed disclaimed gentleman prediction be verified there be something however in word repaid for pain of confusion that something occupied mind so much that drew back for time forgetting to speak to listen almost forgetting where be till roused by voice of isabella looked up saw with captain tilney preparing to give hand across isabella shrugged shoulder smiled only explanation of extraordinary change must at time be given a be not quite enough for catherine comprehension spoke astonishment in very plain term to partner can not think how must happen isabella be so determined not to dance did isabella never change mind before oh because brother after what told from how must think of going to ask can not take surprise to myself on head bid be surprised on friend account therefore be a for brother conduct in business must own have be no more than believed perfectly equal to fairness of friend be open attraction firmness know must only be understood by be laughing assure isabella be very firm in general be a much a must be said of anyone to be always firm must be to be often obstinate when properly to relax be trial of judgment without reference to brother really think miss thorpe have by mean chosen ill in fixing on present hour friend be not able to get together for confidential discourse till dancing be over then a walked about room arm in arm isabella thus explained wonder at surprise be really fatigued to death be such rattle amusing enough if mind have be disengaged must have given world to sit still then why did not oh dear must have looked so particular know how abhor doing refused a long a possibly must must take denial have idea how pressed begged to excuse get other partner not after aspiring to hand there be nobody else in room must bear to think of be not that wanted merely to dance wanted to be with oh such nonsense told have taken very unlikely way to prevail upon for of thing in world hated fine speech compliment so so then found there must be peace if did not stand up besides thought mr hughes who introduced might take ill if did not dear brother be sure must have be miserable if have sat down whole evening be so glad be over spirit be quite jaded with listening to nonsense then being such smart young fellow saw eye be upon be very handsome indeed handsome yes suppose may dare say people must admire in general be not at all in style of beauty hate florid complexion dark eye in man however be very well amazingly conceited be sure took down several time know in way when young lady next met have far more interesting subject to discus james morland second letter be then received kind intention of father fully explained living of mr morland be patron incumbent of about four hundred pound yearly value be to be resigned to son a soon a must be old enough to take trifling deduction from family income niggardly assignment to one of ten child estate of at least equal value moreover be assured a future inheritance james expressed on occasion with becoming gratitude necessity of waiting between two three year before must marry being however unwelcome no more than have expected be borne by without discontent catherine whose expectation have be a unfixed a idea of father income whose judgment be now entirely led by brother felt equally well satisfied heartily congratulated isabella on having everything so pleasantly settled be very charming indeed said isabella with grave face mr morland have behaved vastly handsome indeed said gentle mr thorpe looking anxiously at daughter only wish must do a much one must not expect more from know if find can do more by by dare say will for be sure must be excellent good hearted man four hundred be small income to begin on indeed wish dear isabella be so moderate consider how little ever want dear be not on own account wish for more can not bear to be mean of injuring dear morland making sit down upon income hardly enough to find one in common necessary of life for myself be nothing never think of know never do dear will always find reward in affection make everybody feel for there never be young woman so beloved a be by everybody know dare say when mr morland see dear child let distress dear catherine by talking of such thing mr morland have behaved so very handsome know always heard be most excellent man know dear be not to suppose what if have have suitable fortune must have come down with something more for be sure must be most liberal minded man nobody can think better of mr morland than do be sure everybody have failing know everybody have right to do what like with own money catherine be hurt by insinuation be very sure said that father have promised to do a much a can afford isabella recollected a to that sweet catherine there can not be doubt know well enough to be sure that much smaller income must satisfy be not want of more money that make just at present little out of spirit hate money if union must take place now upon only fifty pound year must not have wish unsatisfied ah catherine have found out there be sting long long endless two year half be to pas before brother can hold living yes yes darling isabella said mr thorpe perfectly see into heart have disguise perfectly understand present vexation everybody must love better for such noble honest affection catherine uncomfortable feeling began to lessen endeavoured to believe that delay of marriage be only source of isabella regret when saw at next interview a cheerful amiable a ever endeavoured to forget that have for minute thought otherwise james soon followed letter be received with most gratifying kindness chapter allen have now entered on sixth week of stay in bath whether must be last be for time question to catherine listened with beating heart to have acquaintance with tilneys end so soon be evil nothing must counterbalance whole happiness seemed at stake while affair be in suspense everything secured when be determined that lodging must be taken for fortnight what

have got so far a to indulge in secret perhaps in general felicity of being with for present bounded view present be now comprised in three week happiness being certain for period rest of life be at such distance a to excite little interest in course of morning saw business arranged visited miss tilney poured forth joyful feeling be doomed to be day of trial sooner have expressed delight in mr allen lengthened stay than miss tilney told of father having just determined upon quitting bath by end of week here be blow past suspense of morning have be ease quiet to present disappointment catherine countenance fell in voice of most sincere concern echoed miss tilney concluding word by end of week yes father can seldom be prevailed on to give water what think fair trial have be disappointed of friend arrival whom expected to meet here a be now pretty well be in hurry to get home be very sorry for said catherine dejectedly if have known before perhaps said miss tilney in

politeness turned to daughter said well eleanor may congratulate on being successful in application to fair friend be just beginning to make request sir a came in well proceed by mean know how much heart be in daughter miss morland continued without leaving daughter time to speak have be forming very bold wish leave bath a have perhaps told on saturday se'nnight letter from steward tell that presence be wanted at home being disappointed in hope of seeing marquis of longtown general courteney here of very old friend there be nothing to detain longer in bath must carry selfish point with must leave without single regret can in short be prevailed on to quit scene of public triumph oblige friend eleanor with company in gloucestershire be almost ashamed to make request though presumption must certainly appear greater to creature in bath than modesty such a yours not for world must pain by open praise if can be induced to honour with visit will make happy beyond expression 't be true can offer nothing like gaiety of lively place can tempt neither by amusement splendour for mode of living a see be plain unpretending yet endeavour will be wanting on side to make northanger abbey not wholly disagreeable northanger abbey be thrilling word wound up catherine feeling to highest point of ecstasy grateful gratified heart must hardly restrain expression within language of tolerable calmness to receive so flattering invitation to have company so warmly solicited everything honourable soothing present enjoyment future hope be contained in acceptance with only saving clause of papa mamma approbation be eagerly given will write home directly said if object a dare say will not general tilney be not le sanguine having already waited on excellent friend in pulteney street obtained sanction of wish since can consent to part with said may expect philosophy from world miss tilney be earnest though gentle in secondary civility affair became in few minute a nearly settled a necessary reference to fullerton must allow circumstance of morning have led catherine feeling through variety of suspense security disappointment be now safely lodged in perfect bliss with spirit elated to rapture with henry at heart northanger abbey on lip hurried home to write letter mr mr morland relying on discretion of friend to whom have already entrusted daughter felt doubt of propriety of acquaintance have be formed under eye sent therefore by return of post ready consent to visit in gloucestershire indulgence though not more than catherine have hoped for completed conviction of

pleasure of kind have met feeling preference have known happiness of return wherever felt attachment have be able to create affection of isabella be to be secured to in sister tilneys by whom above

against of house hall place park court cottage northanger turned up abbey be to be inhabitant long damp passage narrow cell ruined chapel be to be within daily reach must not entirely subdue hope of traditional legend awful memorial of injured ill fated nun be wonderful that friend must seem so little elated by possession of such home that consciousness of must be so meekly borne power of early habit only must account for distinction to have be born gave pride superiority of abode be more to than superiority of person many be inquiry be eager to make of miss tilney so active be thought that when inquiry be answered be hardly more assured than before of northanger abbey having be richly endowed convent at time of reformation of having fallen into hand of ancestor of tilneys on dissolution of large portion of ancient building still making part of present dwelling although rest be decayed of standing low in valley sheltered from north east by rising wood of oak chapter with mind thus full of happiness catherine be hardly aware that two three day have passed away without seeing isabella for more than few minute together began first to be sensible of to sigh for conversation a walked along pump room one morning by mr allen side without anything to say to hear scarcely have felt five minute longing of friendship before object of appeared inviting to secret conference led way to seat be favourite place said a sat down on bench between door commanded tolerable view of everybody entering at be so out of way catherine observing that isabella eye be continually bent towards one door other a in eager expectation remembering how often have be falsely accused of being arch thought present fine opportunity for being really so therefore gaily said be uneasy isabella james will soon be here psha dear creature replied think simpleton a to be always wanting to confine to elbow must be hideous to be always together must be jest of place so be going to northanger be amazingly glad of be one of finest old place in england understand will depend upon most particular description of will certainly have best in power to give who be looking for be sister coming be not looking for anybody one eye must be somewhere know what foolish trick have of fixing mine when thought be hundred mile off be amazingly absent believe be most absent creature in world tilney say be always case with mind of certain stamp thought isabella have something in particular to tell oh yes so have here be proof of what be saying poor head have quite forgot well thing be have just have letter from john can guess content indeed can not sweet love be so abominably affected what can write about know be over head ear in love with with dear isabella nay sweetest catherine be being quite absurd modesty be very well in way really little common honesty be sometimes quite a becoming have idea of being so overstrained be fishing for compliment attention be such a child must have noticed be hour before left bath that gave most positive encouragement say so in letter say that a good a made offer that received advance in kindest way now want to urge suit say manner of pretty thing to so be in vain to affect ignorance catherine with earnestness of truth expressed astonishment at charge protesting innocence of thought of mr thorpe being in love with consequent impossibility of having ever intended to encourage a to attention on side do declare upon honour never be sensible of for moment except just asking to dance first day of coming a to making offer anything like there must be unaccountable mistake must not have misunderstood thing of kind know a ever wish to be believed solemnly protest that syllable of such nature ever passed between last half hour before went away must be completely mistake for did not see once that whole morning that certainly did for spent whole morning in edgar building be day father consent came be pretty sure that john be alone in parlour time before left house be well if say be so dare say for life of can not recollect do remember now being with seeing a well a rest that be ever alone for five minute however be not worth arguing about for might pas on side must be convinced by having recollection of that never thought expected wished for anything of kind from be excessively concerned that must have regard for indeed have be quite unintentional on side never have smallest idea of pray undeceive a soon a can tell beg pardon be know what ought to say make understand what mean in properest way must not speak disrespectfully of brother of yours isabella be sure know very well that if must think of one man more than be not person isabella be silent dear friend must not be angry with can not suppose brother care so very much about know will still be sister yes yes with blush there be more way than one of being sister where be wandering to well dear catherine case seems to be that be determined against poor john be not so certainly can not return affection a certainly never meant to encourage since be case be sure will not tease further john desired to speak to on subject therefore have confess a soon a read letter thought very foolish imprudent business not likely to promote good of for what be to live upon supposing came together have of something to be sure be not trifle will support family nowadays after that romancers may say there be doing without money only wonder john must think of must not have received last do acquit then of anything wrong be convinced that never meant to deceive brother never suspected of liking till moment oh a to answered isabella laughingly pretend to determine what thought design in time past may have be be best known to yourself little harmless flirtation so will occur one be often drawn on to give more encouragement than one wish to stand by may be assured that be last person in world to judge severely thing must be allowed for in youth high spirit what one mean one day know one may not mean next circumstance change opinion alter opinion of brother never did alter be always same be describing what never happened dearest catherine continued other without at listening to must not for world be mean of hurrying into engagement before knew what be about think anything must justify in wishing to sacrifice happiness merely to oblige brother because be brother who perhaps after know might be just a happy without for people seldom know what must be at young men especially be so amazingly changeable inconstant what say be why must brother happiness be dearer to than friend know carry notion of friendship pretty high above thing dear catherine be in hurry take word for that if be in too great hurry will certainly live to repent tilney say there be nothing people be so often deceived in a state of own affection believe be very right ah here come never mind will not see be sure catherine looking up perceived captain tilney isabella earnestly fixing eye on a spoke soon caught notice approached immediately took seat to movement invited first address made catherine start though spoken low must distinguish what always to be watched in person by proxy psha nonsense be isabella answer in same half whisper why do put such thing into head if must believe spirit know be pretty independent wish heart be independent must be enough for heart indeed what can have to do with heart men have none of heart if have not heart have eye give torment enough do be sorry for be sorry find anything so disagreeable in will look way hope plea turning back on hope eye be not tormented now never more so for edge of blooming cheek be still in view at once too much too little catherine heard quite out of countenance must listen no longer amazed that isabella must endure jealous for brother rose up saying must join mr allen proposed walking for isabella showed inclination be so amazingly tired be so odious to parade about pump room if moved from seat must miss sister be expecting sister moment so that dearest catherine must excuse must sit quietly down again catherine must be stubborn too mr allen just then coming up to propose returning home joined walked out of pump room leaving isabella still sitting with captain tilney with much uneasiness did thus leave seemed to captain tilney be falling in love with isabella isabella unconsciously encouraging unconsciously must be for isabella attachment to james be a certain well acknowledged a engagement to doubt truth good intention be impossible yet during whole of conversation manner have be odd wished isabella have talked more like usual self not so much about money have not looked so well pleased at sight of captain tilney how strange that must not perceive admiration catherine longed to give hint of to put on guard prevent pain too lively behaviour might otherwise create for brother compliment of john thorpe affection did not make amends for thoughtlessness in sister be almost a far from believing a from wishing to be sincere for have not forgotten that must mistake assertion of offer of encouragement convinced that mistake must sometimes be very egregious in vanity therefore gained little chief profit be in wonder that must think worth while to fancy in love with be matter of lively astonishment isabella talked of attention have never be sensible of isabella have said many thing hoped have be spoken in haste must never be said again upon be glad to rest altogether for present ease comfort chapter few day passed away catherine though not allowing to suspect friend must not help watching closely result of observation be not agreeable isabella seemed altered creature when saw indeed surrounded only by immediate friend in edgar building pulteney street change of manner be so trifling that have gone farther might have passed unnoticed something of languid indifference of boasted absence of mind catherine have never heard of before must occasionally come across have nothing worse appeared that might only have spread new grace inspired warmer interest when catherine saw in public admitting captain tilney attention a readily a be offered allowing almost equal share with james in notice smile alteration became too positive to be passed over what must be meant by such unsteady conduct what friend must be at be beyond comprehension isabella must not be aware of pain be inflicting be degree of wilful thoughtlessness catherine must not resent james be sufferer saw grave uneasy however careless of present comfort woman might be who have given heart to be always object for poor captain tilney too be greatly concerned though look did not please name be passport to goodwill thought with sincere compassion of approaching disappointment for in spite of what have believed to overhear in pump room behaviour be so incompatible with knowledge of isabella engagement that must not upon reflection imagine aware of might be jealous of brother a rival if more have seemed implied fault must have be in misapprehension wished by gentle remonstrance to remind isabella of situation make aware of double unkindness for remonstrance opportunity comprehension be always against if able to suggest hint isabella must never understand in distress intended departure of tilney family became chief consolation journey into gloucestershire be to take place within few day captain tilney removal must at least restore peace to heart own captain tilney have at present intention of removing be not to be of party to northanger be to continue at bath when catherine knew resolution be directly made spoke to henry tilney on subject regretting brother evident partiality for miss thorpe entreating to make known prior engagement brother doe know be henry answer doe then why doe stay here made reply be beginning to talk of something else eagerly continued why persuade to go away longer stay worse will be for at last pray advise for own sake for everybody sake to leave bath directly absence will in time make comfortable again can have hope here be only staying to be miserable henry smiled said be sure brother must not wish to do then will persuade to go away persuasion be not at command pardon if can not even endeavour to persuade have told that miss thorpe be engaged know what be about must be own master no doe not know what be about cried catherine doe not know pain be giving brother not james have ever told so be sure be very uncomfortable be sure be brother doing yes very sure be brother attention to miss thorpe miss thorpe admission of give pain be not same thing think mr morland must acknowledge difference man be offended by man admiration of woman love be woman only who can make torment catherine blushed for friend said isabella be wrong be sure can not mean to torment for be very much attached to brother have be in love with ever since first met while father consent be uncertain fretted almost into fever know must be attached to understand be in love with james flirt with frederick oh not flirt woman in love with one man can not flirt with be probable that will neither love so well flirt so well a might do either singly gentleman must give up little after short pause catherine resumed with then believe isabella so very much attached to brother can have opinion on subject what can brother mean if know engagement what can mean by behaviour be very close questioner be only ask what want to be told do only ask what can be expected to tell yes think so for must know brother heart brother heart a term on present occasion assure can only guess at well well nay if be to be guesswork let guess for ourselves to be guided by second hand conjecture be pitiful premise be before brother be lively perhaps sometimes thoughtless young man have have about week acquaintance with friend have known engagement almost a long a have known well said catherine after moment consideration may be able to guess at brother intention from be sure can not be not father uncomfortable about doe not want captain tilney to go away sure if father be to speak to must go dear miss morland said henry in amiable solicitude for brother comfort may not be little mistaken be not carried little too far must thank on own account miss thorpe for supposing that affection at least good behaviour be only to be secured by seeing nothing of captain tilney be safe only in solitude be heart constant to only when unsolicited by anyone else can not think may be sure that must not have think will not say ' be uneasy ' because know that be so at moment be a little uneasy a can have doubt of mutual attachment of brother friend depend upon therefore that real jealousy never can exist between depend upon that disagreement between can be of duration heart be open to other a heart can be to know exactly what be required what can be borne may be certain that one will never tease other beyond what be known to be pleasant perceiving still to look doubtful grave added though frederick doe not leave bath with will probably remain very short time perhaps only few day behind leave of absence will soon expire must return to regiment what will then be acquaintance mess room will drink isabella thorpe for fortnight will laugh with brother over poor tilney passion for month catherine must contend no longer against comfort have resisted approach during whole length of speech now carried captive henry tilney must know best blamed for extent of fear resolved never to think so seriously on subject again resolution be supported by isabella behaviour in parting interview thorpe spent last evening of catherine stay in pulteney street nothing passed between lover to excite uneasiness make quit in apprehension james be in excellent spirit isabella most engagingly placid tenderness for friend seemed rather first feeling of heart at moment be allowable once gave lover flat contradiction once drew back hand catherine remembered henry instruction placed to judicious affection embrace tear promise of parting fair one may be fancied chapter mr mr allen be sorry to lose young friend whose good

impatience for appearance of eldest son by displeasure expressed at laziness when captain tilney at last came down be quite pained by severity of father reproof seemed disproportionate to offence much be concern increased when found principal cause of lecture that tardiness be chiefly resented from being disrespectful to be placing in very uncomfortable situation felt great compassion for captain tilney without being able to hope for goodwill listened to father in silence attempted not defence confirmed in fearing that inquietude of mind on isabella account might by keeping long sleepless have be real cause of rising late be first time of being decidedly in company have hoped to be now able to form opinion of scarcely heard voice while father remained in room even afterwards so much be

dagger in few drop of blood in third remains of instrument of torture there being nothing in out of common way lamp being nearly exhausted will return towards own apartment in repassing through small

farther must no longer command solemnity of subject voice be obliged to entreat to use own fancy in perusal of matilda woe catherine recollecting grew ashamed of eagerness began earnestly to assure that attention have be fixed without smallest apprehension of really meeting with what related miss tilney be sure must never put into chamber a have described be not at afraid a drew near end of journey impatience for sight of abbey for time suspended by conversation on subject very different returned in full force bend in road be expected with solemn awe to afford glimpse of massy wall of grey stone rising amidst grove of ancient oak with last beam of sun playing in beautiful splendour on high gothic window so low did building stand that found passing through great gate of lodge into very ground of northanger without having discerned even antique chimney knew not that have right to be surprised there be something in mode of approach certainly have not expected to pas between lodge of modern appearance to find with such ease in very precinct of abbey driven so rapidly along smooth level road of fine gravel without obstacle alarm solemnity of kind struck a odd inconsistent be not long at leisure however for such consideration sudden scud of rain driving full in face made impossible for to observe anything further fixed thought on welfare of new straw bonnet be actually under abbey wall be springing with henry assistance from carriage be beneath shelter of old porch have even passed on to hall where friend general be waiting to welcome without feeling one awful foreboding of future misery to one moment suspicion of past scene of horror being acted within solemn edifice breeze have not seemed to waft sigh of murdered to have wafted nothing worse than thick mizzling rain having given good shake to habit be ready to be shown into common drawing room capable of considering where be abbey yes be delightful to be really in abbey doubted a looked round room whether anything within observation must have given consciousness furniture be in profusion elegance of modern taste fireplace where have expected ample width ponderous carving of former time be contracted to

smallest division heaviest stone work for painted glass dirt cobweb difference be very distressing general perceiving how eye be employed began to talk of smallness of room simplicity of furniture where everything being for daily use pretended only to comfort etc flattering however that there be apartment in abbey not unworthy notice be proceeding to mention costly gilding of one in particular when taking out watch stopped short to pronounce with surprise within twenty minute of five seemed word of separation catherine found hurried away by miss tilney in such manner a convinced that strictest punctuality to family hour must be expected at northanger returning through large lofty hall ascended broad staircase of shining oak after many flight many landing place brought upon long wide gallery on one side have range of door be lighted on other by window catherine have only time to discover looked into quadrangle before miss tilney led way into chamber scarcely staying to hope must find comfortable left with anxious entreaty that must make a little alteration a possible in dress chapter moment glance be enough to satisfy catherine that apartment be very unlike one henry have endeavoured to alarm by description of be by mean unreasonably large contained tapestry velvet wall be papered floor be carpeted window be neither le perfect more dim than of drawing room below furniture though not of latest fashion be handsome comfortable air of room altogether far from uncheerful heart instantaneously at ease on point resolved to lose time in particular examination of anything a greatly dreaded disobliging general by delay habit therefore be thrown off with possible haste be preparing to unpin linen package chaise seat have conveyed for immediate accommodation when eye suddenly fell on large high chest standing back in deep recess on one side of fireplace sight of made start forgetting everything else stood gazing on in motionless wonder while thought crossed be strange indeed did not expect such sight a immense heavy chest what can hold why must be placed here pushed back too a if meant to be out of sight will look into cost what may will look into directly too by daylight if stay till evening candle may go out advanced examined closely be of cedar curiously inlaid with darker wood raised about foot from ground on carved stand of same lock be silver though tarnished from age at end be imperfect remains of handle also of silver broken perhaps prematurely by strange violence on centre of lid be mysterious cipher in same metal catherine bent over intently without being able to distinguish anything with certainty must not in direction took believe last letter to be t yet that must be anything else in house be circumstance to raise common degree of astonishment if not originally theirs by what strange event must have fallen into tilney family fearful curiosity be moment growing greater seizing with trembling hand hasp of lock resolved at hazard to satisfy at least a to content with difficulty for something seemed to resist effort raised lid few inch at moment sudden knocking at door of room made starting quit hold lid closed with alarming violence ill timed intruder be miss tilney maid sent by mistress to be of use to miss morland though catherine immediately dismissed recalled to sense of what ought to be doing forced in spite of anxious desire to penetrate mystery to proceed in dressing without further delay progress be not quick for thought eye be still bent on object so well calculated to interest alarm though dared not waste moment upon second attempt must not remain many pace from chest at length however having slipped one arm into gown toilette seemed so nearly finished that impatience of curiosity might safely be indulged one moment surely might be spared so desperate must be exertion of strength that unless secured by supernatural mean lid in one moment must be thrown back with spirit sprang forward confidence did not deceive resolute effort threw back lid gave to astonished eye view of white cotton counterpane properly folded reposing at one end of chest in undisputed possession be gazing on with first blush of surprise when miss tilney anxious for friend being ready entered room to rising shame of having harboured for minute absurd expectation be then added shame of being caught in so idle search be curious old chest be not said miss tilney a catherine hastily closed turned away to glass be impossible to say how many generation have be here how came to be first put in room know not have not have moved because thought might sometimes be of use in holding hat bonnet worst of be that weight make difficult to open in corner however be at least out of way catherine have leisure for speech being at once blushing tying gown forming wise resolution with most violent dispatch miss tilney gently hinted fear of being late in minute ran downstairs together in alarm not wholly unfounded for general tilney be pacing drawing room watch in hand having on very instant of entering pulled bell with violence ordered dinner to be on table directly catherine trembled at emphasis with spoke sat pale breathless in most humble mood concerned for child detesting old chest general recovering politeness a looked at spent rest of time in scolding daughter for so foolishly hurrying fair friend who be absolutely out of breath from haste when there be not least occasion for hurry in world catherine must not at get over double distress of having involved friend in lecture be great simpleton till be happily seated at dinner table when general complacent smile good appetite of own restored to peace dining parlour be noble room suitable in dimension to much larger drawing room than one in common use fitted up in style of luxury expense be almost lost on unpractised eye of catherine who saw little more than spaciousness number of attendant of former spoke aloud admiration general with very gracious countenance acknowledged that be by mean ill sized room further confessed though a careless on such subject a most people did look upon tolerably large eating room a one of necessary of life supposed however that must have be used to much better sized apartment at mr allen indeed be catherine honest assurance mr allen dining parlour be not more than half a large have never seen so large room a in life general good humour increased why a have such room thought must be simple not to make use of upon honour believed there might be more comfort in room of only size mr allen house be sure must be exactly of true size for rational happiness evening passed without further disturbance in occasional absence of general tilney with much positive cheerfulness be only in presence that catherine felt smallest fatigue from journey even then even in moment of languor restraint sense of general happiness preponderated must think of friend in bath without one wish of being with night be stormy wind have be rising at interval whole afternoon by time party broke up blew rained violently catherine a crossed hall listened to tempest with sensation of awe when heard rage round corner of ancient building close with sudden fury distant door felt for first time that be really in abbey yes be characteristic sound brought to recollection countless variety of dreadful situation horrid scene such building have witnessed such storm ushered in most heartily did rejoice in happier circumstance attending entrance within wall so solemn have nothing to dread from midnight assassin drunken gallant henry have certainly be only in jest in what have told that morning in house so furnished so guarded must have nothing to explore to suffer might go to bedroom a securely a if have be own chamber at fullerton thus wisely fortifying mind a proceeded upstairs be enabled especially on perceiving that miss tilney slept only two door from to enter room with tolerably stout heart spirit be immediately assisted by cheerful blaze of wood fire how much better be said a walked to fender how much better to find fire ready lit than to have to wait shivering in cold till family be in bed a so many poor girl have be obliged to do then to have faithful old servant frightening one by coming in with faggot how glad be that northanger be what be if have be like other place know that in such night a must have answered for courage now to be sure there be nothing to alarm one looked round room window curtain seemed in motion must be nothing violence of wind penetrating through division of shutter stepped boldly forward carelessly humming tune to assure herself of being so peeped courageously behind curtain saw nothing on low window seat to scare on placing hand against shutter felt strongest conviction of wind force glance at old chest a turned away from examination be not without use scorned causeless fear of idle fancy began with most happy indifference to prepare for bed must take time must not hurry did not care if be last person up in house must not make up fire must seem cowardly a if wished for protection of light after be in bed fire therefore died away catherine having spent best part of hour in arrangement be beginning to think of stepping into bed when on giving parting glance round room be struck by appearance of high old fashioned black cabinet though in situation conspicuous enough have never caught notice before henry word description of ebony cabinet be to escape observation at first immediately rushed across though there must be nothing really in there be something whimsical be certainly very remarkable coincidence took candle looked closely at cabinet be not absolutely ebony gold be japan black yellow japan of handsomest kind a held candle yellow have very much effect of gold key be in door have strange fancy to look into not however with smallest expectation of finding anything be so very odd after what henry have said in short must not sleep till have examined so placing candle with great caution on chair seized key with very tremulous hand tried to turn resisted utmost strength alarmed not discouraged tried way bolt flew believed successful how strangely mysterious door be still immovable paused moment in breathless wonder wind roared down chimney rain beat in torrent against window everything seemed to speak awfulness of situation to retire to bed however unsatisfied on point must be vain since sleep must be impossible with consciousness of cabinet so mysteriously closed in immediate vicinity again therefore applied to key after moving in possible way for instant with determined celerity of hope last effort door suddenly yielded to hand heart leaped with exultation at victory having thrown open folding door second being secured only by bolt of le wonderful construction than lock though in eye must not discern anything unusual double range of small drawer appeared in view with larger drawer above below in centre small door closed also with lock key secured in probability cavity of importance catherine heart beat quick courage did not fail with cheek flushed by hope eye straining with curiosity finger grasped handle of drawer drew forth be entirely empty with le alarm greater eagerness seized second third fourth be equally empty not one be left unsearched in not one be anything found well read in art of concealing treasure possibility of false lining to drawer did not escape felt round with anxious acuteness in vain place in middle alone remained now unexplored though have never from first have smallest idea of finding anything in part of cabinet be not in least disappointed at ill success thus far must be foolish not to examine thoroughly while be about be time however before must unfasten door same difficulty occurring in management of inner lock a of outer at length did open not vain a hitherto be search quick eye directly fell on roll of paper pushed back into further part of cavity apparently for concealment feeling at moment be indescribable heart fluttered knee trembled cheek grew pale seized with unsteady hand precious manuscript for glance sufficed to ascertain written character while acknowledged with awful sensation striking exemplification of what henry have foretold resolved instantly to peruse line before attempted to rest dimness of light candle emitted made turn to with alarm there be danger of sudden extinction have hour to burn that might not have greater difficulty in distinguishing writing than what ancient date might occasion hastily snuffed ala be snuffed extinguished in one lamp must not have expired with more awful effect catherine for few moment be motionless with horror be done completely not remnant of light in wick must give hope to rekindling breath darkness impenetrable immovable filled room violent gust of wind rising with sudden fury added fresh horror to moment catherine trembled from head to foot in pause succeeded sound like receding footstep closing of distant door struck on affrighted ear human nature must support more cold sweat stood on forehead manuscript fell from hand groping way to bed jumped hastily in sought suspension of agony by creeping far underneath clothes to close eye in sleep that night felt must be entirely out of question with curiosity so justly awakened feeling in way so agitated repose must be absolutely impossible storm too abroad so dreadful have not be used to feel alarm from wind now blast seemed fraught with awful intelligence manuscript so wonderfully found so wonderfully accomplishing morning prediction how be to be accounted for what must contain to whom must relate by what mean must have be so long concealed how singularly strange that must fall to lot to discover till have made mistress of content however must have repose comfort with sun first ray be determined to peruse many be tedious hour must yet intervene shuddered tossed about in bed envied quiet sleeper storm still raged various be noise more terrific even than wind struck at interval on startled ear very curtain of bed seemed at one moment in motion at lock of door be agitated a if by attempt of somebody to enter hollow murmur seemed to creep along gallery more than once blood be chilled by sound of distant moan hour after hour passed away wearied catherine have heard three proclaimed by clock in house before tempest subsided unknowingly fell fast asleep chapter housemaid folding back window shutter at eight o'clock next day be sound first roused catherine opened eye wondering that must ever have be closed on object of cheerfulness fire be already burning bright morning have succeeded tempest of night instantaneously with consciousness of existence returned recollection of manuscript springing from bed in very moment of maid going away eagerly collected scattered sheet have burst from roll on falling to ground flew back to enjoy luxury of perusal on pillow now plainly saw that must not expect manuscript of equal length with generality of what have shuddered over in book for roll seeming to consist entirely of small disjointed sheet be altogether of trifling size much le than have supposed to be at first greedy eye glanced rapidly over page started at import must be possible did not sens play false inventory of linen in coarse modern character

waistcoat faced in two others penned by same hand marked expenditure scarcely more interesting in letter hair powder shoe string breech ball larger sheet have enclosed rest seemed by first cramp line to poultice chestnut mare farrier bill such be collection of paper left perhaps a must then suppose by negligence of servant in place whence have taken have filled with expectation alarm robbed of half night rest felt humbled to dust must not adventure of chest have taught wisdom corner of catching eye a lay seemed to rise up in judgment against nothing must now be clearer than absurdity of recent fancy to suppose that manuscript of many generation back must have remained undiscovered in room such a so modern so habitable that must be first to posse skill of unlocking cabinet key of be open to how must have so imposed on heaven forbid that henry tilney must ever know folly be in great measure own doing for have not cabinet appeared so exactly to agree with description of adventure must never have felt smallest curiosity about be only comfort occurred impatient to get rid of hateful evidence of folly detestable paper then scattered over bed rose directly folding up a nearly a possible in same shape a before returned to same spot within cabinet with very hearty wish that untoward accident might ever bring forward again to disgrace even with why lock must have be so difficult to open however be still something remarkable for must now manage with perfect ease in there be surely something mysterious indulged in flattering suggestion for minute till possibility of door having be at first unlocked of being fastener darted into head cost blush got away a soon a must from room in conduct produced such unpleasant reflection found way with speed to breakfast parlour a have be pointed out to by miss tilney evening before henry be alone in immediate hope of having be undisturbed by tempest with arch reference to character of building inhabited be rather distressing for world must not have weakness suspected yet unequal to absolute falsehood be constrained to acknowledge that wind have kept awake little have charming morning after added desiring to get rid of subject storm sleeplessness be nothing when be over what beautiful hyacinth have just learnt to love hyacinth how might learn by accident argument sister taught can not tell how mr allen used to take pain year after year to make like never must till saw other day in milsom street be naturally indifferent about flower now love hyacinth so much better have gained new source of enjoyment be well to have a many hold upon happiness a possible besides taste for flower be always desirable in sex a mean of getting out of door tempting to more frequent exercise than must otherwise take though love of hyacinth may be rather domestic who can tell sentiment once raised may in time come to love rose want such pursuit to get out of door pleasure of walking breathing fresh air be enough for in fine weather be out more than half time mamma say be never within at rate however be pleased that have learnt to love hyacinth mere habit of learning to love be thing teachableness of disposition in young lady be great blessing have sister pleasant mode of instruction catherine be saved embarrassment of attempting answer by entrance of general whose smiling compliment announced happy state of mind whose gentle hint of sympathetic early rising did not advance composure elegance of breakfast set forced on catherine notice when be seated at table lucidly have be general choice be enchanted by approbation of taste confessed to be neat simple thought right to encourage manufacture of country for part to uncritical palate tea be a well flavoured from clay of staffordshire a from that of dresden save be quite old set purchased two year ago manufacture be much improved since time have seen beautiful specimen when last in town have not be perfectly without vanity of kind might have be tempted to order new set trusted however that opportunity might ere long occur of selecting one though not for catherine be probably only one of party who did not understand shortly after breakfast henry left for woodston where business required must keep two three day attended in hall to see mount horse immediately on re entering breakfast room catherine walked to window in hope of catching glimpse of figure be somewhat heavy call upon brother fortitude observed general to eleanor woodston will make sombre appearance today be pretty place asked catherine what say eleanor speak opinion for lady can best tell taste of lady in regard to place a well a men think must be acknowledged by most impartial eye to have many recommendation house stand among fine meadow facing south east with excellent kitchen garden in same aspect wall surrounding built stocked about ten year ago for benefit of son be family living miss morland property in place being chiefly own may believe take care that will not be bad one did henry income depend solely on living must not be ill provided for perhaps may seem odd that with only two younger child must think profession necessary for certainly there be moment when must wish disengaged from tie of business though may not exactly make convert of young lady be sure father miss morland must agree with in thinking expedient to give young man employment money be nothing be not object employment be thing even frederick eldest son see who will perhaps inherit a considerable landed property a private man in county have profession imposing effect of last argument be equal to wish silence of lady proved to be unanswerable something have be said evening before of being shown over house now offered a conductor though catherine have hoped to explore accompanied only by daughter be proposal of too much happiness in under circumstance not to be gladly accepted for have be already eighteen hour in abbey have seen only few of room netting box just leisurely drawn forth be closed with joyful haste be ready to attend in moment when have gone over house promised moreover pleasure of accompanying into shrubbery garden curtsied acquiescence perhaps might be more agreeable to to make first object weather be at present favourable at time of year uncertainty be very great of continuing so must prefer be equally at service did daughter think must most accord with fair friend wish thought must discern yes certainly read in miss morland eye judicious desire of making use of present smiling weather when did judge amiss abbey must be always safe dry yielded implicitly must fetch hat attend in moment left room catherine with disappointed anxious face began to speak of unwillingness that must be taking out of door against own inclination under mistaken idea of pleasing be stopped by miss tilney saying with little confusion believe will be wisest to take morning while be so fine be uneasy on father account always walk out at time of day catherine did not exactly know how be to be understood why be miss tilney embarrassed must there be unwillingness on general side to show over abbey proposal be own be not odd that must always take walk so early father mr allen did so be certainly very provoking be impatience to see house have scarcely curiosity about ground if henry have be with indeed now must not know what be picturesque when saw such be thought kept to herself put on bonnet in patient discontent be struck however beyond expectation by grandeur of abbey a saw for first time from lawn whole building enclosed large court two side of quadrangle rich in gothic ornament stood forward for admiration remainder be shut off by knoll of old tree luxuriant plantation steep woody hill rising behind to give shelter be

dislike before be now absolute aversion yes aversion cruelty to charming woman made odious to have often read of such character character mr allen have be used to call unnatural overdrawn here be proof positive of contrary have just settled point when end of path brought directly upon general in spite of virtuous indignation found again obliged to walk with listen to even to smile when smiled being no longer able however to receive pleasure from surrounding object soon began to walk with general perceived with concern for health seemed to reproach for opinion of be most urgent for returning with daughter to house must follow in quarter of hour again parted eleanor be called back in minute to receive strict charge against taking friend round abbey till return second instance of anxiety to delay what so much wished for struck catherine a very remarkable chapter hour passed away before general came in spent on part of young guest in very favourable consideration of character lengthened absence solitary ramble did not speak mind at ease conscience void of reproach at length appeared might have be gloom of meditation must still smile with miss tilney understanding in part friend curiosity to see house soon revived subject father being contrary to catherine expectation unprovided with pretence for further delay beyond of stopping five minute to order refreshment to be in room by return be at last ready to escort set forward with grandeur of air dignified step caught eye must not shake doubt of well read catherine led way across hall through common drawing room one useless antechamber into room magnificent in size furniture real drawing room used only with company of consequence be very noble very grand very charming be that catherine have to say for indiscriminating eye scarcely discerned colour of satin minuteness of praise praise have much meaning be supplied by general costliness elegance of room fitting up must be nothing to cared for furniture of more modern date than fifteenth century when general have satisfied own curiosity in close examination of well known ornament proceeded into library apartment in way of equal magnificence exhibiting collection of book on humble man might have looked with pride catherine heard admired wondered with more genuine feeling than before gathered that must from storehouse of knowledge by running over title of shelf be ready to proceed suite of apartment did not spring up with wish large a be building have already visited greatest part though on being told that with addition of kitchen six seven room have now seen surrounded three side of court must scarcely believe overcome suspicion of there being many chamber secreted be relief however that be to return to room in common use by passing through few of le importance looking into court with occasional passage not wholly unintricate connected different side be further soothed in progress by being told that be treading what have

only new declared to be so intended only for office enclosed behind by stable yard uniformity of architecture have be thought necessary catherine must have raved at hand have swept away what must have be beyond value of rest for purpose of mere domestic economy must willingly have be spared mortification of walk through scene so fallen have general allowed if have vanity be in arrangement of office a be convinced that to mind like miss morland view of accommodation comfort by labour of inferior be softened must always be gratifying must make apology for leading on took slight survey of catherine

commodious roomy number of servant continually appearing did not strike le than number of office wherever went pattened girl stopped to curtsy footman in dishabille sneaked off yet be abbey how inexpressibly different in domestic arrangement from such a have read about from abbey castle in though certainly larger than northanger dirty work of house be to be done by two pair of female hand at utmost how must get through have often amazed mr allen when catherine saw what be necessary here began to be amazed returned to hall that chief staircase might be ascended beauty of wood ornament of rich carving might be pointed out having gained top turned in opposite direction from gallery in room lay shortly entered one on same plan superior in length breadth be here shown successively into

be honoured turned with smiling countenance to catherine ventured to hope henceforward of earliest tenant might be friend from fullerton felt unexpected compliment deeply regretted impossibility of thinking well of man so kindly disposed towards so full of civility to family gallery be terminated by folding door miss tilney advancing have thrown open passed through seemed on point of doing same by first door to left in long reach of gallery when general coming forward called hastily a catherine thought rather angrily back demanding whether be going what be there more to be seen have not miss morland already seen must be worth notice did not suppose friend might be glad of refreshment after so much exercise miss tilney drew back directly heavy door be closed upon mortified catherine who having seen in momentary glance beyond narrower passage more numerous opening symptom of winding staircase believed at last within reach of something worth notice felt a unwillingly paced back gallery that must rather be allowed to examine end of house than see finery of rest general evident desire of preventing such examination be additional stimulant something be certainly to be concealed fancy though have trespassed lately once twice must not mislead here what that something be short sentence of miss tilney a followed general at distance downstairs seemed to point out be going to take into what be mother room room in died be word few a be conveyed page of intelligence to catherine be wonder that general must shrink from sight of such object a room must contain room in probability never entered by since dreadful scene have passed released suffering wife left to sting of conscience ventured when next alone with eleanor to express wish of being permitted to see a well a rest of side of house eleanor promised to attend there whenever must have convenient hour catherine understood general must be watched from home before room must be entered remains a be suppose said in tone of feeling yes entirely how long ago may be that mother died have be dead nine year nine year catherine knew be trifle of time compared with what generally elapsed after death of injured wife before room be put to right be with suppose to last said miss tilney sighing be unfortunately from home illness be sudden short before arrived be over catherine blood ran cold with horrid suggestion naturally sprang from word must be possible must henry father yet how many be example to justify even blackest suspicion when saw in evening while worked with friend slowly pacing drawing room for hour together in silent thoughtfulness with downcast eye contracted brow felt secure from possibility of wronging be air attitude of montoni must more plainly speak gloomy working of mind not wholly dead to sense of humanity in fearful review of past scene of guilt unhappy man anxiousness of spirit directed eye towards figure so repeatedly a to catch miss tilney notice father whispered often walk about room in way be nothing unusual so much worse thought catherine such ill timed exercise be of piece with strange unseasonableness of morning walk boded nothing good after evening little variety seeming length of made peculiarly sensible of henry importance among be heartily glad to be dismissed though be look from general not designed for observation sent daughter to bell when butler must have lit master

either of be more meetly employed eye will be blinding for good of others yours preparing by rest for future mischief business alleged magnificent compliment must win catherine from thinking that very different object must occasion so serious delay of proper repose to be kept up for hour after family be in bed by stupid pamphlet be not very likely there must be deeper cause something be to be done must be done only while household slept probability mr tilney yet lived shut up for cause unknown receiving from pitiless hand of husband nightly supply of coarse food be conclusion necessarily followed shocking a be idea be at least better than death unfairly hastened a in natural course of thing must ere long be released suddenness of reputed illness absence of daughter probably of other child at time favoured supposition of imprisonment origin jealousy perhaps wanton cruelty be yet to be unravelled in revolving matter while undressed suddenly struck a not unlikely that might that morning have passed near very spot of unfortunate woman confinement might have be within few pace of cell in languished out day for what part of abbey must be more fitted for purpose than yet bore trace of monastic division in high arched passage paved with stone already have trodden with peculiar awe well remembered door of general have given no account to what might not door lead in support of plausibility of conjecture further occurred to that forbidden gallery in lay apartment of unfortunate mr tilney must be a certainly a memory must guide exactly over suspected range of cell staircase by side of apartment of have caught transient glimpse communicating by secret mean with cell might well have favoured barbarous proceeding of husband down staircase have perhaps be conveyed in state of well prepared insensibility catherine sometimes started at boldness of own surmise sometimes hoped feared that have gone too far be supported by such appearance a made dismissal impossible

window a passed to prison of wife twice before stepped into bed stole gently from room to corresponding window in gallery to see if appeared abroad be dark must yet be too early various ascending noise convinced that servant must still be up till midnight supposed must be in vain to watch then when clock have struck twelve be quiet must if not quite appalled by darkness steal out look once more clock struck twelve catherine have be hour asleep chapter next day afforded opportunity for proposed examination of mysterious apartment be sunday whole time between morning afternoon service be required by general in exercise abroad eating cold meat at home great a be catherine curiosity courage be not equal to wish of exploring after dinner either by fading light of sky between six seven o'clock by yet more partial though stronger illumination of treacherous lamp day be unmarked therefore by anything to interest imagination beyond sight of very elegant monument to memory of mr tilney immediately fronted family pew by eye be instantly caught long retained perusal of highly strained epitaph in virtue be ascribed to by inconsolable husband who must have be in way other destroyer affected even to tear that general having erected monument must be able to face be not perhaps very strange yet that must sit so boldly collected within view maintain so elevated air look so fearlessly around nay that must even enter church seemed wonderful to catherine not however that many instance of being equally hardened in guilt might not be produced must remember dozen who have persevered in possible vice going on from crime to crime murdering whomsoever chose without feeling of humanity remorse till violent death religious retirement closed black career erection of monument must not in smallest degree affect doubt of mr tilney actual decease be even to descend into family vault where ash be supposed to slumber be to behold coffin in be said to be enclosed what must avail in such case catherine have read too much not to be perfectly aware of ease with waxen figure might be introduced supposititious funeral carried on succeeding morning promised something better general early walk ill timed a be in other view be favourable here when knew to be out of house directly proposed to miss tilney accomplishment of promise eleanor be ready to oblige catherine reminding a went of promise first visit in consequence be to portrait in bed chamber represented very lovely woman with mild pensive countenance justifying so far expectation of new observer be not in respect answered for catherine have depended upon meeting with feature hair complexion must be very counterpart very image if not of henry of eleanor only portrait of have be in habit of thinking bearing always equal resemblance of mother child face once taken be taken for generation here be obliged to look consider study for likeness contemplated however in spite of drawback with much emotion for yet stronger interest must have left unwillingly agitation a entered great gallery be too much for endeavour at discourse must only look at companion eleanor countenance be dejected yet sedate composure spoke inured to gloomy object to be advancing again passed through folding door again hand be upon important lock catherine hardly able to breathe be turning to close former with fearful caution when figure dreaded figure of general at further end of gallery stood before name of eleanor at same moment in loudest tone resounded through building giving to daughter first intimation of presence to catherine terror upon terror attempt at concealment have be first instinctive movement on perceiving yet must scarcely hope to have escaped eye when friend who with apologizing look darted hastily by have joined disappeared with ran for safety to own room locking in believed that must never have courage to go down again remained there at least hour in greatest agitation deeply commiserating state of poor friend expecting summons from angry general to attend in own apartment summons however arrived at last on seeing carriage drive up to abbey be emboldened to descend meet under protection of visitor breakfast room be gay with company be named to by general a friend of daughter in complimentary style so well concealed resentful ire a to make feel secure at least of life for present eleanor with command of countenance did honour to concern for character taking early occasion of saying to father only wanted to answer note began to hope that have be unseen by general that from consideration of policy must be allowed to suppose so upon trust dared still to remain in presence after company left nothing occurred to disturb in course of morning reflection came to resolution of making next attempt on forbidden door alone must be much better in respect that eleanor must know nothing of matter to involve in danger of second detection to court into apartment must wring heart must not be office of friend general utmost anger must not be to herself what might be to daughter besides thought examination must be more satisfactory if made without companion must be impossible to explain to eleanor suspicion from other have in likelihood be hitherto happily exempt must therefore in presence search for proof of general cruelty however might yet have escaped discovery felt confident of somewhere drawing forth in shape of fragmented journal continued to last gasp of way to apartment be now perfectly mistress a wished to get over before henry return who be expected on morrow there be time to be lost day be bright courage high at four o'clock sun be now two hour above horizon must be only retiring to dress hour earlier than usual be done catherine found alone in gallery before clock have ceased to strike be time for thought hurried on slipped with least possible noise through folding door without stopping to look breathe rushed forward to one in question lock yielded to hand luckily with sullen sound must alarm human being on tiptoe entered room be before be minute before must advance step beheld what fixed to spot agitated feature saw large well proportioned apartment handsome dimity bed arranged a unoccupied with housemaid care bright bath stove mahogany wardrobe neatly painted chair on warm beam of western sun gaily poured through two sash window catherine have expected to have feeling worked worked be astonishment doubt first seized shortly succeeding ray of common sense added bitter emotion of shame must not be mistaken a to room how grossly mistaken in everything else in miss tilney meaning in own calculation apartment to have given date so ancient position so awful proved to be one end of what general father have built there be two other door in chamber leading probably into dressing closet have inclination to open must veil in mr tilney have last walked volume in have last read remain to tell what nothing else be allowed to whisper might have be general crime have certainly too much wit to let sue for detection be sick of exploring desired to be safe in own room with own heart only privy to folly be on point of retreating a softly a have entered when sound of footstep must hardly tell where made pause tremble to be found there even by servant must be unpleasant by general seemed always at hand when least wanted much worse listened sound have ceased resolving not to lose moment passed through closed door at instant door underneath be hastily opened someone seemed with swift step to ascend stair by head of have yet to pas before must gain gallery have power to move with feeling of terror not very definable fixed eye on staircase in few moment gave henry to view mr tilney exclaimed in voice of more than common astonishment looked astonished too good god continued not attending to address how came here how came up staircase how came up that staircase replied greatly surprised because be nearest way from stable yard to own chamber why must not come up catherine recollected blushed deeply must say no more seemed to be looking in countenance for explanation lip did not afford moved on towards gallery may not in turn said a pushed back folding door ask how came here passage be at least a extraordinary road from breakfast parlour to apartment a staircase can be from stable to mine have be said catherine looking down to see mother room mother room be there anything extraordinary to be seen there nothing at thought did not mean to come back till tomorrow did not expect to be able to return sooner when went away three hour ago have pleasure of finding nothing to detain look pale be afraid alarmed by running so fast up stair perhaps did not know be not aware of leading from office in common use be not have have very fine day for ride very doe eleanor leave to find way into room in house by oh showed over greatest part on saturday be coming here to room only dropping voice father be with that prevented said henry earnestly regarding have looked into room in passage only wanted to see be not very late must go dress be only quarter past four showing watch be not now in bath theatre no room to prepare for hour at northanger must be enough must not contradict therefore suffered to be detained though dread of further question made for first time in acquaintance wish to leave walked slowly up gallery have have letter from bath since saw be very much surprised isabella promised so faithfully to write directly promised so faithfully faithful promise puzzle have heard of faithful performance faithful promise fidelity of promising be power little worth knowing however since can deceive pain mother room be very commodious be not large cheerful looking dressing closet so well disposed always strike a most comfortable apartment in house rather wonder that eleanor must not take for own sent to look at suppose have be own doing entirely catherine said nothing after short silence during have closely observed added a there be nothing in room in to raise curiosity must have proceeded from sentiment of respect for mother character a described by eleanor doe honour to memory world believe never saw better woman be not often that virtue can boast interest such a domestic unpretending merit of person never known often create that kind of fervent venerating tenderness must prompt visit like yours eleanor suppose have talked of great deal yes great deal be not much what did say be very interesting dying so suddenly slowly with hesitation be spoken none of being at home father thought perhaps have not be very fond of from circumstance replied quick eye fixed on hers infer perhaps probability of negligence involuntarily shook head may be of something

constitutional on third day in short a soon a must be prevailed on physician attended very respectable man one in whom have always placed great confidence upon opinion of danger two others be called in next day remained in almost constant attendance for four twenty hour on fifth day died during progress of disorder frederick be at home saw repeatedly from own observation can bear witness to having received possible attention must spring from affection of about situation in life must command poor eleanor be absent at distance a to return only to see mother in coffin father said catherine be afflicted for time greatly so have erred in supposing not attached to loved be persuaded a well a be possible for to have not know same tenderness of disposition will not pretend to say that while lived might not often have have much to bear though temper injured judgment never did value of be sincere if not permanently be truly afflicted by death be very glad of said catherine must have be very shocking if understand rightly have formed surmise of such horror a have hardly word to dear miss morland consider dreadful nature of suspicion have entertained what have be judging from remember country age in live remember that be english that be christian consult own understanding own sense of probable own observation of what be passing around doe education prepare for such atrocity do law

henry address short a have be have more thoroughly opened eye to extravagance of late fancy than several disappointment have done most grievously be humbled most bitterly did cry be not only with that be sunk with henry folly now seemed even criminal be exposed to must despise forever liberty imagination have dared to take with character of father must ever forgive absurdity of curiosity fear must ever be forgotten hated more than must express have thought have once twice before fatal morning shown something like affection for now in short made a miserable a possible for about hour went down when clock struck five with broken heart must scarcely give intelligible answer to eleanor inquiry if be well formidable henry soon followed into room only difference in behaviour to be that paid rather more attention than usual catherine have never wanted comfort more looked a if be aware of evening wore away with abatement of soothing politeness spirit be gradually raised to modest tranquillity did not learn either to forget defend past learned to hope that must never transpire farther that might not cost henry entire regard thought being still chiefly fixed on what have with such causeless terror felt done nothing must shortly be clearer than that have be voluntary self created delusion trifling circumstance receiving importance from imagination resolved on alarm

general though unequal mixture of good bad upon conviction must not be surprised if even in henry eleanor tilney slight imperfection might hereafter appear upon conviction need not fear to acknowledge actual speck in character of father who though cleared from grossly injurious suspicion must ever blush to have entertained did believe upon serious consideration to be not perfectly amiable mind made up on several point resolution formed of always judging acting in future with greatest good sense have nothing to do to forgive be happier than ever lenient hand of time did much for by insensible gradation in course of day henry astonishing generosity nobleness of conduct in never alluding in slightest way to what have passed be of greatest assistance to sooner than must have supposed possible in beginning of distress spirit became absolutely comfortable capable a heretofore of continual improvement by anything said there be still subject indeed under believed must always tremble mention of chest cabinet for instance did not love sight of japan in shape even must allow occasional memento of past folly however painful might not be without use anxiety of common life began soon to succeed to alarm of romance desire of hearing from isabella grew day greater be quite impatient to know how bath world went on how room be attended especially be anxious to be assured of isabella having matched fine netting cotton on have left intent of continuing on best term with james only dependence for information of kind be on isabella james have protested against writing to till return to oxford mr allen have given hope of letter till have got back to fullerton isabella have promised promised again when promised thing be so scrupulous in performing made so particularly strange for nine

made miserable forever let soon hear from dear catherine be only friend love do build upon wish visit at northanger may be over before captain tilney make engagement known will be uncomfortably circumstanced poor thorpe be in town dread sight of honest heart must feel so much have written to father duplicity hurt more than till very last if reasoned with declared a much attached to a ever laughed at fear be ashamed to think how long bore with if ever man have reason to believe loved be that man can not understand even now what must be at for there must be need of being played off to make secure of tilney parted at last by mutual consent happy for have never met can never expect to know such woman dearest catherine beware how give heart believe c catherine have not read three line before sudden change of countenance short exclamation of sorrowing wonder declared to be receiving unpleasant news henry earnestly watching through whole letter saw plainly that ended no better than began be prevented however from even looking surprise by father entrance went to breakfast directly catherine must hardly eat anything tear filled eye even ran down cheek a sat letter be one moment in hand then in lap then in pocket looked a if knew not what did general between cocoa newspaper have luckily leisure for noticing to other two distress be equally visible a soon a dared leave table hurried away to own room housemaid be busy in be obliged to come down again turned into drawing room for privacy henry eleanor have likewise retreated thither be at moment deep in consultation about drew back trying to beg pardon be with gentle violence forced to return others withdrew after eleanor have affectionately expressed wish of being of use comfort to after hour free indulgence of grief reflection catherine felt equal to encountering friend whether must make distress known to be consideration perhaps if particularly questioned might just give idea just distantly hint at not more to expose friend such friend a isabella have be to then own brother so closely concerned in believed must waive subject altogether henry eleanor be by in breakfast room a entered looked at anxiously catherine took place at table after short silence eleanor said bad news from fullerton hope mr mr morland brother sister hope be none of ill thank sighing a spoke be very well letter be from brother at oxford nothing further be said for few minute then speaking through tear added think will ever wish for letter again be sorry said henry closing book have just opened if have suspected letter of containing anything unwelcome must have given with very different feeling contained something worse than anybody must suppose poor james be so unhappy will soon know why to have so kind hearted so affectionate sister replied henry warmly must be comfort to under distress have one favour to beg said catherine shortly afterwards in agitated manner that if brother must be coming here will give notice of may go away brother frederick yes be sure must be very sorry to leave so soon something have happened must make very dreadful for to be in same house with captain tilney eleanor work be suspended while gazed with increasing astonishment henry began to suspect truth something in miss thorpe name be included passed lip how quick be cried catherine have guessed declare yet when talked about in bath little thought of ending so isabella wonder now have not heard from isabella have deserted brother be to marry yours must have believed there have be such inconstancy fickleness everything be bad in world hope so far a concern brother be misinformed hope have not have material share in bringing on mr morland disappointment marrying miss thorpe be not probable think must be deceived so far be very sorry for mr morland sorry that anyone love must be unhappy surprise must be greater at frederick marrying than at other part of story be very true however will read james letter stay there be one part recollecting with blush last line will take trouble of reading to passage concern brother read cried catherine whose second thought be clearer know what be thinking of blushing again that have blushed before james only mean to give good advice gladly received letter having read through with close attention returned saying well if be to be so can only say that be sorry for frederick will not be first man who have chosen wife with le sense than family expected envy situation either a lover son miss tilney at catherine invitation now read letter likewise having expressed also concern surprise began to inquire into miss thorpe connection fortune mother be very good sort of woman be catherine answer what be father lawyer believe live at putney be wealthy family no not very believe isabella have fortune at will not signify in family father be so very liberal told other day that only valued money a allowed to promote happiness of child brother sister looked at other said eleanor after short pause must be to promote happiness to enable to marry girl must be unprincipled one must not have used brother so how strange infatuation on frederick side girl who before eye be violating engagement voluntarily entered into with man be not inconceivable henry frederick too who always wore heart so proudly who found woman good enough to be loved be most unpromising circumstance strongest presumption against when think of past declaration give up moreover have too good opinion of miss thorpe prudence to suppose that must part with one gentleman before other be secured be over with frederick indeed be deceased man defunct in understanding prepare for sister in law eleanor sister in law a must delight in open candid artless guileless with affection strong simple forming pretension knowing disguise sister in law henry must delight in said eleanor with smile perhaps observed catherine though have behaved so ill by family may behave better by yours now have really got man like may be constant indeed be afraid will replied henry be afraid will be very constant unless baronet must come in way be frederick only chance will get bath paper look over arrival think be for ambition then upon word there be thing seem very like can not forget that when first knew what father must do for seemed quite disappointed that be not more never be so deceived in anyone character in life before among great variety that have known studied own disappointment loss in be very great a for poor james suppose will hardly ever recover brother be certainly very much to be pitied at present must not in concern for suffering undervalue yours feel suppose that in losing isabella lose feel void in heart nothing else can occupy society be becoming irksome a for amusement in be wont to share at bath very idea of without be abhorrent must not for instance now go to ball for world feel that have longer friend to whom can speak with unreserve on whose regard can place dependence whose counsel in difficulty must rely on feel said catherine after few moment reflection ought to say truth though be hurt grieved can not still love that be never to hear from perhaps never to see again feel so very very much afflicted a one must have thought feel a always do what be most to credit of human nature such feeling ought to be investigated that may know catherine by chance other found spirit so very much relieved by conversation that must not regret being led on though so unaccountably to mention circumstance have produced chapter from time subject be frequently canvassed by three young people catherine found with surprise that two young friend be perfectly agreed in considering isabella want of consequence fortune a likely to throw great difficulty in way of marrying brother persuasion that general must upon ground alone independent of objection might be raised against character oppose connection turned feeling moreover with alarm towards be a insignificant perhaps a portionless a isabella if heir of tilney property have not grandeur wealth enough in at what point of interest be demand of younger brother to rest very painful reflection to thought led must only be dispersed by dependence on effect of particular partiality a be given to understand by word a well a action have from first be so fortunate a to excite in general by recollection of most generous disinterested sentiment on subject of money have more than once heard utter tempted to think disposition in such matter misunderstood by child be so fully convinced however that brother must not have courage to apply in person for father consent so repeatedly assured that have never in life be le likely to come to northanger than at present time that suffered mind to be at ease a to necessity of sudden removal of own a be not to be supposed captain tilney whenever made application must give father just idea of isabella conduct occurred to a highly expedient that henry must lay whole business before a really be enabling general by mean to form cool impartial opinion prepare objection on fairer ground than inequality of situation proposed to accordingly did not catch at measure so eagerly a have expected no said father hand need not be strengthened be confession of folly need not be forestalled must tell own story will tell only half of quarter must be enough day two passed away brought tidings of captain tilney brother sister knew not what to think sometimes appeared to a if silence must be natural result of suspected engagement at others that be wholly incompatible with general meanwhile though offended morning by frederick remissness in writing be free from real anxiety about have more pressing solicitude than of making miss morland time at northanger pas pleasantly often expressed uneasiness on head feared sameness of day society employment must disgust with place wished lady frasers have be in country talked now then of having large party to dinner once twice began even to calculate number of young dancing people in neighbourhood then be such dead time of year wild fowl game lady frasers be not in country ended at last in telling henry one morning when next went to woodston must take by surprise there day other eat mutton with henry be greatly honoured very happy catherine be quite delighted with scheme when do

a be known to be in country must be taken exceedingly amiss be rule with miss morland never to give offence to of neighbour if small sacrifice of time attention can prevent be set of very worthy men

quarter will carry to woodston suppose will be in carriage by ten so about quarter before one on wednesday may look for ball must not have be more welcome to catherine than little excursion so strong be desire to be acquainted with woodston heart be still bounding with joy when henry about hour afterwards came booted greatcoated into room where eleanor be sitting said be come young lady in very moralizing strain to observe pleasure in world be always to be paid for that often purchase at great disadvantage giving ready monied actual happiness for draft on future may not be honoured witness at present hour because be to hope for satisfaction of seeing at woodston on wednesday bad weather twenty other cause may prevent must go away directly two day before intended go away said catherine with very long face why why how can ask question because time be to be lost in frightening old housekeeper out of wit because must go prepare dinner for to be sure oh not seriously aye sadly too for have much rather stay how can think of thing after what general said when so particularly desired not to give trouble because anything must do henry only smiled be sure be quite unnecessary upon sister account mine must know to be so general made point of providing nothing extraordinary besides if have not said half so much a did have always such excellent dinner at home that sitting down to middling one for one day must not signify wish must reason like for sake own good bye a tomorrow be sunday eleanor will not return went being at time much simpler operation to catherine to doubt own judgment than henry be very soon obliged to give credit for being right however disagreeable to going inexplicability of general conduct dwelt much on thought that be very particular in eating have by own unassisted observation already discovered why must say one thing so positively mean while be most unaccountable how be people at rate to be understood who henry must have be aware of what father be at from saturday to wednesday however be now to be without henry be sad finale of reflection captain tilney letter must certainly come in absence wednesday be very sure must be wet past present future be equally in gloom brother so unhappy loss in isabella so great eleanor spirit always affected by henry absence what be there to interest amuse be tired of wood shrubbery always so smooth so dry abbey in be no more to now than other house painful remembrance of folly have helped to nourish perfect be only emotion must spring from consideration of building what revolution in idea who have so longed to be in abbey now there be nothing so charming to imagination a unpretending comfort of well connected parsonage something like fullerton better fullerton have fault woodston probably have none if wednesday must ever come did come exactly when might be reasonably looked for came be fine catherine trod on air by ten o'clock chaise four conveyed two from abbey after agreeable drive of almost twenty mile entered woodston large populous village in situation not unpleasant catherine be ashamed to say how pretty thought a general seemed to think apology necessary for flatness of

northanger be considering a mere parsonage small confined allow decent perhaps habitable altogether not inferior to generality in other word believe there be few country parsonage in england half so good may admit of improvement however far be from to say otherwise anything in reason bow thrown out perhaps though between if there be one thing more than aversion be patched on bow catherine did not hear enough of speech to understand be pained by other subject being studiously brought forward supported by henry at same time that tray full of refreshment be introduced by servant general be shortly restored to complacency catherine to usual ease of spirit room in question be of commodious well proportioned size handsomely fitted up a dining parlour on quitting to walk round ground be shown first into smaller apartment belonging peculiarly to master of house made unusually tidy on occasion afterwards into what be to be drawing room with appearance of though unfurnished catherine be delighted enough even to satisfy general be prettily shaped room window reaching to ground view from pleasant though only over green meadow expressed admiration at moment with honest simplicity with felt oh why fit up room mr tilney what pity not to have fitted up be prettiest room ever saw be prettiest room in world trust said general with most satisfied smile that will very speedily be furnished wait only for lady taste well if be house must never sit anywhere else oh what sweet little cottage there be among tree apple tree too be prettiest cottage like approve a object be enough henry remember that robinson be spoken to about cottage remains such compliment recalled catherine consciousness silenced directly though pointedly applied to by general for choice of prevailing colour of paper hanging nothing like opinion on subject must be drawn from influence of fresh object fresh air however be of great use in dissipating embarrassing association having reached ornamental

etc such strain of willow artifice must not impose even upon catherine inconsistency contradiction falsehood struck from very first be ashamed of isabella ashamed of having ever loved profession of attachment be now a disgusting a excuse be empty demand impudent write to james on behalf james must never hear isabella name mentioned by again on henry arrival from woodston made known to eleanor brother safety congratulating with sincerity on reading aloud most material passage of letter with strong indignation when have finished so much for isabella cried for intimacy must think idiot must not have written so perhaps have served to make character better known to than mine be to see what have be about be vain coquette trick have not answered believe have ever regard for james for wish have never known will soon be a if never have said henry there be one thing can not understand see that have have design on captain tilney have not succeeded understand what captain tilney have be about time why must pay such attention a to make quarrel with brother then fly off have very little to say for frederick motif such a believe to have be have vanity a well a miss thorpe chief difference be that having stronger head have not yet injured if effect of behaviour doe not justify with have better not seek after cause then suppose ever really cared about be persuaded that never did only made believe to do so for mischief sake henry bowed assent well then must say that like at though have turned out so well for like at a happens there be great harm done because think isabella have heart to lose suppose have made very much in love with must first suppose isabella to have have heart to lose consequently to have be very different creature in case must have met with very different treatment be very right that must stand by brother if must stand by yours must not be much distressed by disappointment of miss thorpe mind be warped by innate principle of general integrity therefore not accessible to cool reasoning of family partiality desire of revenge catherine be complimented out of further bitterness frederick must not be unpardonably guilty while henry made so agreeable resolved on not answering isabella letter tried to think more of chapter soon after general found obliged to go to london for week left northanger earnestly regretting that necessity must rob even for hour of miss morland company anxiously recommending study of comfort amusement to child a chief object in absence departure gave catherine first experimental conviction that loss may be sometimes gain happiness with time now passed employment voluntary laugh indulged meal scene of ease good humour walking where liked when liked hour pleasure fatigue at own command made thoroughly sensible of restraint general presence have imposed most thankfully feel present release from such ease such delight made love place people more more day have not be for dread of soon becoming expedient to leave one apprehension of not being equally beloved by other must at moment of day have be perfectly happy be now in fourth week of visit before general came home fourth week must be turned perhaps might seem intrusion if stayed much longer be painful consideration whenever occurred eager to get rid of such weight on mind very soon resolved to speak to eleanor about at once propose going away be guided in conduct by manner in proposal might be taken aware that if gave much time might feel difficult to bring forward so unpleasant subject took first opportunity of being suddenly alone with eleanor of eleanor being in middle of speech about something very different to start forth obligation of going away very soon eleanor looked declared much concerned have hoped for pleasure of company for much longer time have be misled perhaps by wish to suppose that much longer visit have be promised must not think that if mr mr morland be aware of pleasure be to to have there must be too generous to hasten return catherine explained oh a to papa mamma be in hurry at a long a be happy must always be satisfied then why might ask in such hurry to leave oh because have be there so long nay if can use such word can urge farther if think long oh indeed for own pleasure must stay with a long again be directly settled that till have leaving be not even to be thought of in having cause of uneasiness so pleasantly removed force of other be likewise weakened kindness earnestness of eleanor manner in pressing to stay henry gratified look on being told that stay be determined be such sweet proof of importance with a left only just so much solicitude a human mind can never do comfortably without did almost always believe that henry loved quite always that father sister loved even wished to belong to believing so far doubt anxiety be merely sportive irritation henry be not able to obey father injunction of remaining wholly at northanger in attendance on lady during absence in engagement of curate at woodston obliging to leave on saturday for couple of night loss be not now what have be while general be at home lessened gaiety did not ruin comfort two girl agreeing in occupation improving in intimacy found so well sufficient for time to that be eleven o'clock rather late hour at abbey before quitted supper room on day of henry departure have just reached head of stair when seemed a far a thickness of wall must allow to judge that carriage be driving up to door next moment confirmed idea by loud noise of house bell after first perturbation of surprise have passed away in good heaven what can be matter be quickly decided by eleanor to be eldest brother whose arrival be often a sudden if not quite so unseasonable accordingly hurried down to welcome catherine walked on to chamber making up mind a well a must to further acquaintance with captain tilney comforting under unpleasant impression conduct have given persuasion of being by far too fine gentleman to approve of at least must not meet under such circumstance a must make meeting materially painful trusted must never speak of miss thorpe indeed a must by time be ashamed of part have acted there must be danger of a long a mention of bath scene be avoided thought must behave to very civilly in such consideration time passed away be certainly in favour that eleanor must be so glad to see have so much to say for hour be almost gone since arrival eleanor did not come up at moment catherine thought heard step in gallery listened for continuance be silent scarcely however have convicted fancy of error when noise of something moving close to door made start seemed a if someone be touching very doorway in moment slight motion of lock proved that hand must be on trembled little at idea of anyone approaching so cautiously resolving not to be again overcome by trivial appearance of alarm misled by raised imagination stepped quietly forward opened door eleanor only eleanor stood there catherine spirit however be tranquillized for instant for eleanor cheek be pale manner greatly agitated though evidently intending to come in seemed effort to enter room still greater to speak when there catherine supposing uneasiness on captain tilney account must only express concern by silent attention obliged to be seated rubbed temple with lavender water hung over with affectionate solicitude dear catherine must not must not indeed be eleanor first connected word be quite well kindness distracts can not bear come to on errand errand to how will tell oh how will tell new idea now darted into catherine mind turning a pale a friend exclaimed be messenger from woodston be mistaken indeed returned eleanor looking at most compassionately be one from woodston be father voice faltered eye be turned to ground a mentioned name unlooked for return be enough in to make catherine heart sink for few moment hardly supposed there be anything worse to be told said nothing eleanor endeavouring to collect speak with firmness with eye still cast down soon went on be too good be sure to think worse of for part be obliged to perform be indeed most unwilling messenger after what have so lately passed so lately be settled between how joyfully how thankfully on side a to continuing here a hoped for many many week longer how can tell that kindness be not to be accepted that happiness company have hitherto given be to be repaid by must not trust with word dear catherine be to part father have recollected engagement take whole family away on monday be going to lord longtown near hereford for fortnight explanation apology be equally impossible can not attempt dear eleanor cried catherine suppressing feeling a well a must be so distressed second engagement must give way to first be very very sorry be to part so soon so suddenly too be not offended indeed be not can finish visit here know at time hope will come to can when return from lord come to fullerton will not be in power catherine come when can then eleanor made answer catherine thought recurring to something more directly interesting added thinking aloud monday so soon a monday go well be certain of will be able to take leave however need not go till just before do know be distressed eleanor can go on monday very well father mother having notice of be of very little consequence general will send servant with dare say way then will soon be at salisbury then be only nine mile from home ah catherine be settled so must be somewhat le intolerable though in such common attention must have received what ought how can tell tomorrow morning be fixed for leaving not even hour be left to choice very carriage be ordered will be here at seven o'clock servant will be offered catherine sat down breathless speechless must hardly believe sens when heard displeasure resentment that can feel at moment however justly great can be more than must not talk of what felt oh must suggest anything in extenuation good god what will father mother say after courting from protection of real friend to almost double distance from home to have driven out of house without consideration even of decent civility dear dear catherine in being bearer of such message seem guilty myself of insult yet trust will acquit for must have be long enough in house to see that be nominal mistress of that real power be nothing have offended general said catherine in faltering voice ala for feeling a daughter know answer for be that can have given just cause of offence certainly be greatly very greatly discomposed have seldom seen more so temper be not happy something have now occurred to ruffle in uncommon degree disappointment vexation just at moment seems important can hardly suppose to have concern in for how be possible be with pain that catherine must speak at be only for eleanor sake that attempted be sure said be very sorry if have offended be last thing must willingly have done be unhappy eleanor engagement know must be kept be only sorry be not recollected sooner might have written home be of very little consequence hope earnestly hope that to real safety will be of none to everything else be of greatest consequence to comfort appearance propriety to family to world be friend allen still in bath might go to with comparative ease few hour must take there journey of seventy mile to be taken post by at age alone unattended oh journey be nothing think about if be to part few hour sooner later know make difference can be ready by seven let be called in time eleanor saw that wished to be alone believing better for that must avoid further conversation now left with will see in morning catherine swelling heart needed relief in eleanor presence friendship pride have equally restrained tear sooner be gone than burst forth in torrent turned from house in such way without reason must justify apology must atone for abruptness rudeness nay insolence of henry at distance not able even to bid farewell hope expectation from suspended at least who must say how long who must say when might meet again by man a general tilney so polite so well bred heretofore so particularly fond of be a incomprehensible a be mortifying grievous from what must arise where must end be consideration of equal perplexity alarm manner in be done so grossly uncivil hurrying away without reference to own convenience allowing even appearance of choice a to time mode of travelling of two day earliest fixed on of almost earliest hour a if resolved to have gone before be stirring in morning that might not be obliged even to see what must all mean intentional affront by mean other must have have misfortune to offend eleanor have wished to spare from so painful notion catherine must not believe possible that injury misfortune must provoke such ill will against person not connected at least not supposed to be connected with heavily passed night sleep repose deserved name of sleep be out of question room in disturbed imagination have tormented on first arrival be again scene of agitated spirit unquiet slumber yet how different now source of inquietude from what have be then how mournfully superior in reality substance anxiety have foundation in fact fear in probability with mind so occupied in contemplation of actual natural evil solitude of situation darkness of chamber antiquity of building be felt considered without smallest emotion though wind be high often produced strange sudden noise throughout house heard all a lay awake hour after hour without curiosity terror soon after six eleanor entered room eager to show attention give assistance where be possible very little remained to be done catherine have not loitered be almost dressed packing almost finished possibility of conciliatory message from general occurred to a daughter appeared what so natural a anger must pas away repentance succeed only wanted to know how far after what have passed apology might properly be received by knowledge must have be useless here be not called for clemency dignity be put to trial eleanor brought message very little passed between on meeting found greatest safety in silence few trivial be sentence exchanged while remained upstairs catherine in busy agitation completing dress eleanor with more goodwill than experience intent upon filling trunk when everything be done left room catherine lingering only minute behind friend to throw parting glance on well known cherished object went down to breakfast parlour where breakfast be prepared tried to eat a well to save from pain of being urged a to make friend comfortable have appetite must not swallow many contrast between last breakfast in room gave fresh misery strengthened distaste for everything before be not four twenty hour ago since have met there to same repast in circumstance how different with what cheerful ease what happy though false security have then looked around enjoying everything present fearing little in future beyond henry going to woodston for day happy happy breakfast for henry have be there henry have sat by helped reflection be long indulged undisturbed by address from companion who sat a deep in thought a herself appearance of carriage be first thing to startle recall to present moment catherine colour rose at sight of indignity with be treated striking at instant on mind with peculiar force made for short time sensible only of resentment eleanor seemed now impelled into resolution speech must write to catherine cried must let hear from a soon a possible till know to be safe at home will not have hour comfort for one letter at risk hazard must entreat let have satisfaction of knowing that be safe at fullerton have found family well then till can ask for correspondence a ought to do will not expect more direct to at lord longtown must ask under cover to alice eleanor if be not allowed to receive letter from be sure have better not write there can be doubt of getting home safe eleanor only replied can not wonder at feeling will not importune will trust to own kindness of heart when be at distance from with look of sorrow accompanying be enough to melt catherine pride in moment instantly said oh eleanor will write to indeed there be yet point miss tilney be anxious to settle though somewhat embarrassed in speaking of have occurred to that after so long absence from home catherine might not be provided with money enough for expense of journey upon suggesting to with most affectionate offer of accommodation proved to be exactly case catherine have never thought on subject till moment upon examining purse be convinced that for kindness of friend might have be turned from house without even mean of getting home distress in must have be thereby involved filling mind of scarcely word be said by during time of remaining together short however be that time carriage be soon announced to be ready catherine instantly rising long affectionate embrace supplied place of language in bidding other adieu a entered hall unable to leave house without mention of one whose name have not yet be spoken by paused moment with quivering lip just made intelligible that left kind remembrance for absent friend with approach to name ended possibility of restraining feeling hiding face a well a must with handkerchief darted across hall jumped into chaise in moment be driven from door chapter catherine be too wretched to be fearful journey in have terror for began without dreading length feeling solitariness leaning back in one corner of carriage in violent burst of tear be conveyed mile beyond wall of abbey before raised head highest point of ground within park be almost closed from view before be capable of turning eye towards unfortunately road now travelled be same only ten day ago have so happily passed along in going to from woodston for fourteen mile bitter feeling be rendered more severe by review of object on have first looked under impression so different mile a brought nearer woodston added to suffering when within distance of five passed turning led to thought of henry so near yet so unconscious grief agitation be excessive day have spent at place have be one of happiest of life be there be on day that general have made use of such expression with regard to henry have so spoken so looked a to give most positive conviction of actually wishing marriage yes only ten day ago have elated by pointed regard have even confused by too significant reference now what have done what have omitted to do to merit such change only offence against of must accuse have be such a be scarcely possible to reach knowledge henry own heart only be privy to shocking suspicion have so idly entertained equally safe did believe secret with designedly at least henry must not have betrayed if indeed by strange mischance father must have gained intelligence of what have dared to think look for of causeless fancy injurious examination must not wonder at degree of indignation if aware of having viewed a murderer must not wonder at even turning from house justification so full of torture to herself trusted must not be in power anxious a be conjecture on point be not however one on dwelt most there be thought yet nearer more prevailing more impetuous concern how henry must think feel look when returned on

beyond neighbourhood of woodston saved at same time from watching progress though object on road must engage moment attention found stage of tedious from be preserved too by cause by feeling eagerness for journey conclusion for to return in such manner to fullerton be almost to destroy pleasure of meeting with loved best even after absence such a hers eleven week absence what have to say must not humble pain family must not increase own grief by confession of extend useless resentment perhaps involve innocent with guilty in undistinguishing ill will must never do justice to henry eleanor merit felt too strongly for expression must dislike be taken against must be thought of unfavourably on father account must cut to heart with feeling rather dreaded than sought for first view of well known

catherine heart in embrace of a stepped from carriage found soothed beyond anything that have believed possible so surrounded so caressed be even happy in joyfulness of family love everything for short time be subdued pleasure of seeing leaving at first little leisure for calm curiosity be seated round tea table mr morland have hurried for comfort of poor traveller whose pale jaded look soon caught notice before inquiry so direct a to demand positive answer be addressed to reluctantly with much hesitation did then begin what might perhaps at end of hour be termed by courtesy of hearer explanation scarcely within time must at discover cause collect particular of sudden return be far from being irritable race far from quickness in catching bitterness in resenting affront here when whole be unfolded be insult not to be overlooked for first half hour to be easily pardoned without suffering romantic alarm in consideration of daughter long lonely journey mr mr morland must not feel that might have be productive of much unpleasantness to that be what must never have voluntarily suffered that in forcing on measure general tilney have acted neither honourably feelingly a gentleman a parent why have done what must have provoked to such breach of hospitality so suddenly turned partial regard for daughter into actual ill will be matter be at least a far from divining a catherine did not oppress by mean so long after due course of useless conjecture that be strange business that must be very strange man grew enough for indignation wonder though sarah indeed still indulged in sweet of incomprehensibility exclaiming conjecturing with youthful ardour dear give great deal of needle trouble said mother at last depend upon be something not at worth understanding can allow for wishing catherine away when recollected engagement said sarah why not do civilly be sorry for young people returned mr morland must have sad time of a for anything else be matter now catherine be safe at home comfort doe not depend upon general tilney catherine sighed well continued philosophic mother be glad did not know of journey at time now be over perhaps there be great harm done be always good for young people to be put upon exerting know dear catherine always be sad little scatter brained creature now must have be forced to have wit about with so much changing of chaise so forth hope will appear that have not left anything behind in of pocket catherine hoped so too tried to feel interest in own amendment spirit be quite worn down to be silent alone becoming soon only wish readily agreed to mother next counsel of going early to bed parent seeing nothing in ill look agitation natural consequence of mortified feeling of unusual exertion fatigue of such journey parted from without doubt of being soon slept away though when met next morning recovery be not equal to hope be still perfectly unsuspicious of there being deeper evil never once thought of heart for parent of young lady of seventeen just returned from first excursion from home be odd enough a soon a breakfast be over sat down to fulfil promise to miss tilney whose trust in effect of time distance on friend disposition be already justified for already did catherine reproach with having parted from eleanor coldly with having never enough valued merit kindness never enough commiserated for what have be yesterday left to endure strength of feeling however be far from assisting pen never have be harder for to write than in addressing eleanor tilney to compose letter might at once do justice to sentiment situation convey gratitude without servile regret be guarded without coldness honest without resentment letter eleanor might not be pained by perusal of above might not blush if henry must chance to see be undertaking to frighten away power of performance after long thought much perplexity to be very brief be that must determine on with confidence of safety money therefore eleanor have advanced be enclosed with little more than grateful thanks thousand good wish of most affectionate heart have be strange acquaintance observed mr morland a letter be finished soon made soon ended be sorry happens so for mr allen thought very pretty kind of young people be sadly out of luck too in isabella ah poor james well must live learn next new friend make hope will be better worth keeping catherine coloured a warmly answered friend can be better worth keeping than eleanor if so dear dare say will meet again time other be uneasy be ten to one be thrown together again in course of few year then what pleasure will be mr morland be not happy in attempt at consolation hope of meeting again in course of few year must only put into catherine head what might happen within time to make meeting dreadful to must never forget henry tilney think of with le tenderness than did at moment might forget in case to meet eye filled with tear a pictured acquaintance so renewed mother perceiving comfortable suggestion to have have good effect proposed a expedient for restoring spirit that must call on mr allen two house be only quarter of mile apart a walked mr morland quickly dispatched that felt on score of james disappointment be sorry for said otherwise there be harm done in match going off for must not be desirable thing to have engaged to girl whom have not smallest acquaintance with who be so entirely without fortune now after such behaviour can not think at well of just at present come hard to poor james will not last forever dare say will be discreeter man life for foolishness of first choice be just such summary view of affair a catherine must listen to sentence might have endangered complaisance made reply le rational for soon be thinking power swallowed up in reflection of own change of feeling spirit since last have trodden that well known road be not three month ago since wild with joyful expectation have there run backwards forward ten time day with heart light gay independent looking forward to pleasure untasted unalloyed free from apprehension of evil a from knowledge of three month ago have seen now how altered being did return be received by allen with kindness unlooked for appearance acting on steady affection must naturally call forth great be surprise warm displeasure on hearing how have be treated though mr morland account of be inflated representation studied appeal to passion catherine took quite by surprise yesterday evening said travelled way post by herself knew nothing of coming till saturday night for general tilney from odd fancy other of sudden grew tired of having there almost turned out of house very unfriendly certainly must be very odd man be so glad to have amongst again be great comfort to find that be not poor helpless creature can shift very well for mr allen expressed on occasion with reasonable resentment of sensible friend mr allen thought expression quite good enough to be immediately made use of again by wonder conjecture explanation became in succession hers with addition of single remark really have not patience with general to fill up accidental pause really have not patience with general be uttered twice after mr allen left room without relaxation of anger material digression of thought more considerable degree of wandering attended third repetition after completing fourth immediately added only think dear of having got that frightful great rent in best mechlin so charmingly mended before left bath that one can hardly see where be must show day other bath be nice place catherine after assure did not above half like coming away mr thorpe being there be such comfort to be not know be quite forlorn at first yes did not last long said catherine eye brightening at recollection of what have first given spirit to existence there very true soon met with mr thorpe then wanted for nothing dear think silk glove wear very well put on new first time of going to lower room know have

room at parsonage have never be wanted absolute necessity of spare room for friend be now never forgotten not precaution however must save from being suspected of something better perhaps very display of importance of spare room might have misled sir thomas to suppose really intended for fanny lady bertram soon brought matter to certainty by carelessly observing to mr norris think sister need not keep miss lee longer when fanny go to live with mr norris almost started live with dear lady bertram what do mean be not to live with thought have settled with sir thomas never never spoke syllable

be richer have nobody else to care for must be very glad to think must leave little trifle among worth having be very good trouble about be sure of being well provided for sir thomas will take care of why know sir thomas mean will be rather straitened if antigua estate be to make such poor return oh will soon be settled sir thomas have be writing about know well lady bertram said mr norris moving to go can only say that sole desire be to be of use to family so if sir thomas must ever speak again about taking fanny will be able to say that health spirit put quite out of question besides really must not have bed to give for must keep spare room for friend lady bertram repeated enough of conversation to husband to convince how much have mistaken sister in law view be from moment perfectly safe from expectation slightest allusion to from must not wonder at refusing to do anything for niece whom have be so forward to adopt a took early care to make a well a lady bertram understand that

acquaintance have fault mr norris soon found out doctor be very fond of eating must have good dinner day mr grant instead of contriving to gratify at little expense gave cook a high wage a did at mansfield park be scarcely ever seen in office mr norris must not speak with temper of such grievance of quantity of butter egg be regularly consumed in house nobody loved plenty hospitality more than nobody more hated pitiful doings parsonage believed have never be wanting in comfort of sort have never borne bad character in time be way of going on must not understand fine lady in country parsonage be quite out of place store room thought might have be good enough for mr grant to go into inquire where must must not find out that mr grant have ever have more than five thousand pound lady bertram listened without much interest to sort of invective must not enter into wrong of economist felt injury of beauty in mr grant being so well settled in life without being handsome expressed astonishment on point almost a often though not so diffusely a mr norris discussed other opinion have be hardly canvassed year before event arose of such importance in family a might fairly claim place in thought conversation of lady sir thomas found expedient to go to antigua for better arrangement of affair took eldest son with in hope of detaching from bad connexion at home left england with probability of being nearly twelvemonth absent necessity of measure in pecuniary light hope of utility to son reconciled sir thomas to effort of quitting rest of family of leaving daughter to

edmund judgment have sufficient confidence to make go without fear for conduct lady bertram did not at like to have husband leave be not disturbed by alarm for safety solicitude for comfort being one of person who think nothing can be dangerous difficult fatiguing to anybody miss bertrams be much to be pitied on occasion not for sorrow for want of father be object of love to have never seemed

gone cousin on seeing with red eye set down a hypocrite chapter iv tom bertram have of late spent so little of time at home that must be only nominally missed lady bertram be soon astonished to find how very well did even without father how well edmund must supply place in carving talking to steward writing to attorney settling with servant equally saving from possible fatigue exertion in

may smile be so assure except that be sometimes carried little too far be very proper girl must be quiet modest most objectionable part be that alteration of manner on being introduced into company be frequently too sudden sometimes pas in such very little time from reserve to quite opposite to confidence be faulty part of present system one doe not like to see girl of eighteen nineteen so immediately up to thing perhaps when one have seen hardly able to speak year before mr bertram dare say have sometimes met with such change believe have be hardly fair see what be at be quizzing miss anderson indeed miss anderson know who what mean be quite in dark will quiz with great deal of pleasure if will tell what about ah carry off very well can not be quite so far imposed on must have have miss anderson in eye in describing altered young lady paint too accurately for mistake be exactly so anderson of baker street be speaking of other day know edmund have heard mention charles anderson

be doing great deal to set right error be plain enough said le courteous edmund such girl be ill brought up be given wrong notion from beginning be always acting upon motif of vanity there be more real modesty in behaviour before appear in public than afterwards know replied miss crawford hesitatingly yes can not agree with there be certainly modestest part of business be much worse to have girl not out give same air take same liberty a if be have seen done be worse than anything quite disgusting yes be very inconvenient indeed said mr bertram lead one astray one doe not know what to do close bonnet demure air describe so well nothing be ever juster tell one be expected got into dreadful scrape last year from want of went down to ramsgate for week with friend last september just after return from west indie friend sneyd have heard speak of sneyd edmund father mother sister be there all new to when reached albion place be out went after found on pier mr two miss sneyds with

price doe go to ball doe dine out where a well a at sister replied edmund think have ever be to ball mother seldom go into company dines nowhere with mr grant fanny stay at home with oh then point be clear miss price be not out chapter vi mr bertram set off for miss crawford be prepared to find great chasm in society to miss decidedly in meeting be now becoming almost daily between family on dining together at park soon after going retook chosen place near bottom of table fully expecting to feel most melancholy difference in change of master must be very flat business be sure in comparison with brother edmund must have nothing to say soup must be sent round in most spiritless manner wine drank without smile agreeable trifling venison cut up without supplying one pleasant anecdote of former haunch single entertaining story about friend one must try to find amusement in what be passing at upper end of table in observing mr rushworth who be now making appearance at mansfield for first time since crawford arrival have be visiting friend in neighbouring county that friend having recently have ground laid out by improver mr rushworth be returned with head full of subject very eager to be improving own place in same way though not saying much to purpose must talk of nothing else subject have be already handled in drawing room be revived in dining parlour miss bertram attention opinion be evidently chief aim though deportment showed rather conscious superiority than solicitude to oblige mention of sotherton court idea attached to gave feeling of complacency prevented from being very ungracious wish must see compton said be most complete thing never saw place so altered in life told smith did not know where be approach now be one of finest thing in country see house in most surprising manner declare when got back to sotherton yesterday looked like prison quite dismal old prison oh for shame cried mr norris prison indeed sotherton court be noblest old place in world want improvement ma'be beyond anything never saw place wanted so much improvement in life be so forlorn that know what can be done with wonder that mr rushworth must think so at present said mr grant to mr norris with smile depend upon sotherton will have improvement in time heart can desire must try to do something with said mr rushworth know what hope will have good friend to help best friend upon occasion said miss bertram calmly must be mr repton imagine be what be thinking of a have done so well by smith think have better have at once term be five guinea day well if be ten cried mr norris be sure need not regard expense need not be impediment if be must not think of expense must have everything done in best style made a nice a possible such place a sotherton court deserves everything that taste money can do have space to work upon there ground will well reward for own part if have anything within fiftieth part of size of sotherton must be always planting improving for naturally be excessively fond of must be too ridiculous for to attempt anything where be now with little half acre must be quite burlesque if have more room must take prodigious delight in improving planting did vast deal in way at parsonage made quite different place from what be when first have young one remember much about perhaps if dear sir thomas be here must tell improvement made great deal more must have be done for poor mr norris sad state of health must hardly ever get out poor man to enjoy anything disheartened from doing several thing sir thomas used to talk of if have not be for must have carried on garden wall made plantation to shut out churchyard just a dr grant have done be always doing something a be be only spring twelvemonth before mr norris death that put in apricot against stable wall be now grown noble tree getting to such perfection sir addressing then to dr grant tree thrives well beyond doubt madam replied dr grant soil be good never pas without regretting that fruit must be so little worth trouble of gathering sir be moor park bought a moor park cost be be present from sir thomas saw bill know cost seven shilling be charged a moor park be imposed on ma'be replied dr grant potato have a much flavour of moor park apricot a fruit from tree be insipid fruit at best good apricot be eatable none from garden be truth be ma'be said mr grant pretending to whisper across table to mr norris that dr grant hardly know what natural taste of apricot be be scarcely ever indulged with one for be so valuable fruit with little assistance be such remarkably large fair sort that what with early tart preserve cook contrives to get mr norris who have begun to redden be appeased for little while other subject took place of improvement of sotherton dr grant mr norris be seldom good friend acquaintance have begun in dilapidation habit be totally dissimilar after short interruption mr rushworth began again smith place be admiration of country be mere nothing before repton took in hand think will have repton mr rushworth said lady bertram if be must have very pretty shrubbery one like to get out into shrubbery in fine weather mr rushworth be eager to assure ladyship of acquiescence tried to make out something complimentary between submission to taste having always intended same with superadded object of professing attention to comfort of lady in general of insinuating that there be one only whom be anxious to please grew puzzled edmund be glad to put end to speech by proposal of wine mr rushworth however though not usually great talker have still more to say on subject next heart smith have not much above hundred acre altogether in ground be little enough make more surprising that place can have be so improved now at sotherton have good seven hundred without reckoning water meadow so that think if so much must be done at compton need not despair there have be two three fine old tree cut down grew too near house open prospect amazingly make think that repton anybody of sort must certainly have avenue at sotherton down avenue lead from west front to top of hill know turning to miss bertram particularly a spoke miss bertram thought most becoming to reply avenue oh recollect really know very little of sotherton fanny who be sitting on other side of edmund exactly opposite miss crawford who have be attentively listening now looked at said in low voice cut down avenue what pity doe not make think of cowper fallen avenue once more mourn fate unmerited smiled a answered be afraid avenue stand bad chance fanny must like to see sotherton before be cut down to see place a be now in old state suppose will have never be there never can unluckily be out of distance for ride wish must contrive oh doe not signify whenever do see will tell how have be altered collect said miss crawford that sotherton be old place place of grandeur in particular style of building house be built in elizabeth time be large regular brick building heavy respectable looking have many good room be ill placed stand in one of lowest spot of park in respect unfavourable for improvement wood be fine there be stream dare say might be made good deal of mr rushworth be quite right think in meaning to give modern dress have doubt that will be done extremely well miss crawford listened with submission said to herself be well bred man make best of wish to influence mr rushworth continued have place to new fashion must not put into hand of improver must rather have inferior degree of beauty of own choice acquired progressively must rather abide by own blunder than by must know what be about of course must not suit have eye ingenuity for such matter a be before have place of own in country must be most thankful to mr repton who must undertake give a much beauty a must for money must never look at till be complete must be delightful to to see progress of said fanny ay have be brought up to be part of education only dose ever have being administered by not first favourite in world have made consider improvement in hand a greatest of nuisance three year ago admiral honoured uncle bought cottage at twickenham for to spend summer in aunt went down to quite in rapture being excessively pretty be soon found necessary to be improved for three month be dirt confusion without gravel walk to step on bench fit for use must have everything a complete a possible in country shrubbery flower garden rustic seat innumerable must all be done without care henry be different love to be doing edmund be sorry to hear miss crawford whom be much disposed to admire speak so freely of uncle did not suit sense of propriety be silenced till induced by further smile liveliness to put matter by for present mr bertram said have tidings of harp at last be assured that be safe at northampton there have probably be ten day in spite of solemn assurance have so often received to contrary edmund expressed pleasure surprise truth be that inquiry be too direct sent servant went will not do seventy mile from london morning heard of in right way be seen by farmer told miller miller told butcher butcher son in law left word at shop be very glad that have heard of by mean hope there will be further delay be to have to morrow how do think be to be conveyed not by wagon cart oh nothing of kind must be hired in village might a well have asked for porter handbarrow must find difficult dare say just now in middle of very late hay harvest to hire horse cart be astonished to find what piece of work be made of to want horse cart in country seemed impossible so told maid to speak for one directly a can not look out of dressing closet without seeing one farmyard walk in shrubbery without passing thought must be only ask have be rather grieved must not give advantage to guess surprise when found have be asking most unreasonable most impossible thing in world have offended farmer labourer hay in parish a for dr grant bailiff believe have better keep out of way brother in law who be kindness in general looked rather black upon when found what have be at must not be expected to have thought on subject before when do think of must see importance of getting in grass hire of cart at time might not be so easy a suppose farmer be not in habit of letting out in harvest must be quite out of power to spare horse will understand way in time coming down with true london maxim that everything be to be got with money be little embarrassed at first by sturdy independence of country custom however be to have harp fetched to morrow henry who be good nature have offered to fetch in barouche will not be honourably conveyed edmund spoke of harp a favourite instrument hoped to be soon allowed to hear fanny have never heard harp at wished for very much will be most happy to play to said miss crawford at least a long a can like to listen probably much longer for dearly love music where natural taste be equal player must always be best off for be gratified in more way than one now mr bertram if write to brother entreat to tell that harp be come heard so much of misery about may say if please that will prepare most plaintive air against return in compassion to feeling a know horse will lose if write will say wish at present foresee occasion for writing dare say if be to be gone twelvemonth must ever write to to if must be helped occasion must never be foreseen what strange creature brother be must not write to other upon most urgent necessity in world when obliged to take up pen to say that horse be ill such relation dead be done in fewest possible word have one style among know perfectly henry who be in other respect exactly what brother must be who love consults confides in will talk to by hour together have never yet turned page in letter very often be nothing more than 'dear mary be just arrived bath seems full everything a usual yours sincerely be true manly style be complete brother letter when be at distance from family said fanny colouring for william sake can write long letter miss price have brother at sea said edmund whose excellence a correspondent make think too severe upon at sea have in king service of course fanny must rather have have edmund tell story determined silence obliged to relate brother situation voice be animated in speaking of profession foreign station have be on must not mention number of year that have be absent without tear in eye miss crawford civilly wished early promotion do know anything of cousin captain said edmund captain marwill have large acquaintance in navy conclude among admiral large enough with air of grandeur know very little of inferior rank post captain may be very good sort of men belong to of various admiral must tell great deal of flag gradation of pay bickering jealousy in general can assure that be passed over very ill used certainly home at uncle brought acquainted with circle of admiral of rear vice saw enough now be suspecting of pun entreat edmund again felt grave only replied be noble profession yes profession be well enough under two circumstance if make fortune there be discretion in spending in short be not favourite profession of mine have never worn amiable form to edmund reverted to harp be again very happy in prospect of hearing play subject of improving ground meanwhile be still under consideration among others mr grant must not help addressing brother though be calling attention from miss julia bertram dear henry have nothing to say have be improver from what hear of everingham may vie with place in england natural beauty be sure be great everingham a used to be be perfect in estimation happy fall of ground such timber what must not give to see again nothing must be so gratifying to a to hear opinion of be answer fear there must be disappointment must not find equal to present idea in extent be mere nothing must be surprised at insignificance a for improvement there be very little for to do too little must like to have be busy much longer be fond of sort of thing said julia excessively what with natural advantage of ground pointed out even to very young eye what little remained to be done own consequent resolution have not be of age three month before everingham be that be now plan be laid at westminster little altered perhaps at cambridge at one twenty executed be inclined to envy mr rushworth for having so much happiness yet before have be devourer of own who see quickly will resolve quickly act quickly said julia can never want employment instead of envying mr rushworth must assist with opinion mr grant hearing latter part of speech enforced warmly persuaded that judgment must be equal to brother a miss bertram caught at idea likewise gave full support declaring that in opinion be infinitely better to consult with friend disinterested adviser than immediately to throw business into hand of professional man mr rushworth be very ready to request favour of mr crawford assistance mr crawford after properly depreciating own ability be quite at service in way must be useful mr rushworth then began to propose mr crawford doing honour of coming over to sotherton taking bed there when mr norris a if reading in two niece mind little approbation of plan be to take mr crawford away interposed with amendment there can be doubt of mr crawford willingness why must not more of go why must not make little party here be many must be interested in improvement dear mr rushworth must like to hear mr crawford opinion on spot might be of small use to with opinion for own part have be long wishing to wait upon good mother again nothing having horse of own must have made so remiss now must go sit few hour with mr rushworth while rest of walked about settled thing then must return to late dinner here dine at sotherton just a might be most agreeable to mother have pleasant drive home by moonlight dare say mr crawford must take two niece in barouche edmund can go on horseback know sister fanny will stay at home with lady bertram made objection one concerned in going be forward in expressing ready concurrence excepting edmund who heard said nothing chapter vii well fanny how do like miss crawford now said edmund next day after thinking time on subject how did like yesterday very well very much like to hear talk entertains be so extremely pretty have great pleasure in looking at be countenance be so attractive have wonderful play of feature be there nothing in conversation that struck fanny a not quite right oh yes ought not to have spoken of uncle a did be quite astonished uncle with whom have be living so many year who whatever fault may be be so very fond of brother treating say quite like son must not have believed thought must be struck be very wrong very indecorous very ungrateful think ungrateful be strong word know that uncle have claim to gratitude wife certainly have be warmth of respect for aunt memory misleads here be awkwardly circumstanced with such warm feeling lively spirit must be difficult to do justice to affection for mr crawford without throwing shade on admiral pretend to know be most to blame in disagreement though admiral present conduct might incline one to side of wife be natural amiable that miss crawford must acquit aunt entirely censure opinion there certainly be impropriety in making public think said fanny after little consideration that impropriety be reflection upon mr crawford a niece have be entirely brought up by can not have given right notion of what be due to admiral be fair remark yes must suppose fault of niece to have be of aunt make one more sensible of disadvantage have be under think present home must do good mr grant manner be just what ought to be speaks of brother with very pleasing affection yes except a to writing such short letter made almost laugh can not rate so very highly love good nature of brother who will not give trouble of writing anything worth reading to sister when be separated be sure william must never have used so under circumstance what right have to suppose that must not write long letter when be absent right of lively mind fanny seizing may contribute to own amusement that of others perfectly allowable when untinctured by ill humour roughness there be not shadow of in countenance manner of miss crawford nothing sharp loud coarse be perfectly feminine except in instance have be speaking of there can not be justified be glad saw a did having formed mind gained affection have good chance of thinking like though at period on subject there began now to be danger of dissimilarity for be in line of admiration of miss crawford might lead where fanny must not follow miss crawford attraction did not lessen harp arrived rather added to beauty wit good humour for played with greatest obligingness with expression taste be peculiarly becoming there be something clever to be said at close of air edmund be at parsonage day to be indulged with favourite instrument one morning secured invitation for next for lady must not be unwilling to have listener thing be soon in fair train young woman pretty lively with harp a elegant a herself placed near window cut down to ground opening on little lawn surrounded by shrub in rich foliage of summer be enough to catch man heart season scene air be favourable to tenderness sentiment mr grant tambour frame be not without use be in harmony a everything will turn to account when love be once set going even sandwich tray dr grant doing honour of be worth looking at without studying business however knowing what be about edmund be beginning at end of week of such intercourse to be good deal in love to credit of lady may be added that without being man of world elder brother without of art of flattery gaiety of small talk began to be agreeable to felt to be so though have not foreseen must hardly understand for be not pleasant by common rule talked nonsense paid compliment opinion be unbending attention tranquil simple there be charm perhaps in sincerity steadiness integrity miss crawford might be equal to feel though not equal to discus with did not think very much about however pleased for present liked to have near be enough fanny must not wonder that edmund be at parsonage morning must gladly have be there too might have gone in uninvited unnoticed to hear harp neither must wonder that when evening stroll be over two family parted again must think right to attend mr grant sister to home while mr crawford be devoted to lady of park thought very bad exchange if edmund be not there to mix wine water for must rather go without than not be little surprised that must spend so many hour with miss crawford not see more of sort of fault have already observed of be almost always reminded by something of same nature whenever be in company so be edmund be fond of speaking to of miss crawford seemed to think enough that admiral have since be spared scrupled to point out own remark to lest must appear like ill nature first actual pain miss crawford occasioned be consequence of inclination to learn to ride former caught soon after being settled at mansfield from example of young lady at park when edmund acquaintance with increased led to encouraging wish offer of own quiet mare for purpose of first attempt a best fitted for beginner that stable must furnish pain injury however be designed by to cousin in offer be not to lose day exercise by mare be only to be taken down to parsonage hour before ride be to begin fanny on being first proposed so far from feeling slighted be almost over powered with gratitude that must be asking leave for miss crawford made first essay with great credit to herself inconvenience to fanny edmund who have taken down mare presided at whole returned with in excellent time before fanny steady old coachman who always attended when rode without cousin be ready to set forward second day trial be not so guiltless miss crawford enjoyment of riding be such that did not know how to leave off active fearless though rather small strongly made seemed formed for horsewoman to pure genuine pleasure of exercise something be probably added in edmund attendance instruction something more in conviction of very much surpassing sex in general by early progress to make unwilling to dismount fanny be ready waiting mr norris be beginning to scold for not being gone still horse be announced edmund appeared to avoid aunt look for went out house though scarcely mile apart be not within sight of other by walking fifty yard from hall door must look down park command view of parsonage demesne gently rising beyond village road in dr grant meadow immediately saw group edmund miss crawford on horse back riding side by side dr mr grant mr crawford with two three groom standing about looking on happy party appeared to interested in one object cheerful beyond doubt for sound of merriment ascended even to be sound did not make cheerful wondered that edmund must forget felt pang must not turn eye from meadow must not help watching passed at first miss crawford companion made circuit of field be not small at foot pace then at apparent suggestion rose into canter to fanny timid nature be most astonishing to see how well sat after few minute stopped entirely edmund be close to be speaking to be evidently directing management of bridle have hold of hand saw imagination supplied what eye must not reach must not wonder at what must be more natural than edmund must be making useful proving good nature by one must not think indeed that mr crawford might a well have saved trouble that must have be particularly proper becoming in brother to have done mr crawford with boasted good nature coachmanship probably knew nothing of matter have active kindness in comparison of edmund began to think rather hard upon mare to have such double duty if be forgotten poor mare must be remembered feeling for one other be soon little tranquillised by seeing party in meadow disperse miss crawford still on horseback attended by edmund on foot pas through gate into lane so into park make towards spot where stood began then to be afraid of appearing rude impatient walked to meet with great anxiety to avoid suspicion dear miss price said miss crawford a soon a be at within hearing be come to make own apology for keeping waiting have nothing in world to say for knew be very late be behaving extremely ill therefore if please must forgive selfishness must always be forgiven know because there be hope of cure fanny answer be extremely civil edmund added conviction that must be in hurry for there be more than time enough for cousin to ride twice a far a ever go said have be promoting comfort by preventing from setting off hour sooner cloud be now coming up will not suffer from heat a must have done then wish may not be fatigued by so much exercise wish have saved walk home part of fatigue getting off horse assure said a sprang down with help be very strong nothing ever fatigue doing what like miss price give way to with very bad grace sincerely hope will have pleasant ride may have nothing good to hear of dear delightful beautiful animal old coachman who have be waiting about with own horse now joining fanny be lifted on hers set off across part of park feeling of discomfort not lightened by seeing a looked back that others be walking down hill together to village did attendant do much good by comment on miss crawford great cleverness a horse woman have be watching with interest almost equal to own be pleasure to see lady with good heart for riding said never see one sit horse better did not seem to have thought of fear very different from miss when first began six year ago come next easter lord bless how did tremble when sir thomas first have put on in drawing room miss crawford be also celebrated merit in being gifted by nature with strength courage be fully appreciated by miss bertrams delight in riding be like own early excellence in be like own have great pleasure in praising be sure must ride well said julia have make for figure be a neat a brother yes added maria spirit be a good have same energy of character can not think that good horsemanship have great deal to do with mind when parted at night edmund asked fanny whether meant to ride next day know not if want mare be answer want at for myself said whenever be next inclined to stay at home think miss crawford must be glad to have longer time for whole morning in short have great desire to get a far a mansfield common mr grant have be telling of fine view have doubt of being perfectly equal to morning will do for must be extremely sorry to interfere with must be very wrong if did ride only for pleasure for health will not ride to morrow certainly said fanny have be out very often lately must rather stay at home know be strong enough now to walk very well edmund looked pleased must be fanny comfort ride to mansfield common took place next morning party included young people be much enjoyed at time doubly enjoyed again in evening discussion successful scheme of sort generally brings on having be to mansfield common disposed for going somewhere else day after there be many other view to be shewn though weather be hot there be shady lane wherever wanted to go young party be always provided with shady lane four fine morning successively be spent in manner in shewing crawford country doing honour of finest spot everything answered be gaiety good humour heat only supplying inconvenience enough to be talked of with pleasure till fourth day when happiness of one of party be exceedingly clouded miss bertram be one edmund julia be invited to dine at parsonage be excluded be meant done by mr grant with perfect good humour on mr rushworth account who be partly expected at park that day be felt a very grievous injury good manner be severely taxed to conceal vexation anger till reached home a mr rushworth did not come injury be increased have not even relief of shewing power over must only be sullen to mother aunt cousin throw a great gloom a possible over dinner dessert between ten eleven edmund julia walked into drawing room fresh with evening air glowing cheerful very reverse of what found in three lady sitting there for maria must scarcely raise eye from book lady bertram be half asleep even mr norris discomposed by niece ill humour having asked one two question about dinner be not immediately attended to seemed almost determined to say more for few minute brother sister be too eager in praise of night remark on star to think beyond when first pause came edmund looking around said where be fanny be gone to bed not that know of replied mr norris be here moment ago own gentle voice speaking from other end of room be very long one told that be on sofa mr norris began scolding be very foolish trick fanny to be idling away evening upon sofa why can not come sit here employ a do if have work of own can supply from poor basket there be new calico be bought last week not touched yet be sure almost broke back by cutting out must learn to think of other people take word for be shocking trick for young person to be always lolling upon sofa before be said fanny be returned to seat at table have taken up work again julia who be in high good humour from pleasure of day did justice of exclaiming must say ma'be that fanny be a little upon sofa a anybody in house fanny said edmund after looking at attentively be sure have headache must not deny said be not very bad can hardly believe replied know look too well how long have have since little before dinner be nothing heat did go out in heat go out to be sure did said mr norris must have stay within fine day a be not all out even mother be out to day for above hour yes indeed edmund added ladyship who have be thoroughly awakened by mr norris sharp reprimand to fanny be out above hour sat three quarter of hour in flower garden while fanny cut rose very pleasant be assure very hot be shady enough in alcove declare quite dreaded coming home again fanny have be cutting rose have yes be afraid will be last year poor thing found hot enough be so full blown one must not wait there be help for certainly rejoined mr norris in rather softened voice question whether headache might not be caught then sister there be nothing so likely to give a standing stooping in hot sun dare say will be well to morrow suppose let have aromatic vinegar always forget to have mine filled have got said lady bertram have have ever since came back from house second time what cried edmund have be walking a well a cutting rose walking across hot park to house doing twice ma'be wonder head ache mr norris be talking to julia did not hear be afraid must be too much for said lady bertram when rose be gathered aunt wished to have then know must be taken home be there rose enough to oblige to go twice be to be put into spare room to dry unluckily fanny forgot to lock door of room bring away key so be obliged to go again edmund got up walked about room saying must nobody be employed on errand fanny upon word ma'be have be very ill managed business be sure know how be to have be done better cried mr norris unable to be longer deaf unless have gone indeed can not be in two place at once be talking to mr green at very time about mother dairymaid by desire have promised john groom to write to mr jefferies about son poor fellow be waiting for hour think nobody can justly accuse of sparing upon occasion really can not do everything at once a for fanny just stepping down to house for be not much above quarter of mile can not think be unreasonable to ask how often do pace three time day early late ay in weather too say nothing about wish fanny have strength ma'be if fanny must be more regular in exercise must not be knocked up so soon have not be out on horseback now long while be persuaded that when doe not ride ought to walk if have be riding before must not have asked of thought must rather do good after being stooping among rose for there be nothing so refreshing a walk after fatigue of kind though sun be strong be not so very hot between edmund nodding significantly at mother be cutting rose dawdling about in flower garden did mischief be afraid be indeed said more candid lady bertram who have overheard be very much afraid caught headache there for heat be enough to kill anybody be a much a must bear sitting calling to pug trying to keep from flower bed be almost too much for edmund said more to lady going quietly to table on supper tray yet remained brought glass of madeira to fanny obliged to drink greater part wished to be able to decline tear variety of feeling created made easier to swallow than to speak vexed a edmund be with mother aunt be still more angry with own forgetfulness of be worse than anything have done nothing of must have happened have be properly considered have be left four day together without choice of companion exercise without excuse for avoiding unreasonable aunt might require be ashamed to think that for four day together have not have power of riding very seriously resolved however unwilling must be to check pleasure of miss crawford that must never happen again fanny went to bed with heart a full a on first evening of arrival at park state of spirit have probably have share in indisposition for have be feeling neglected be struggling against discontent envy for day past a leant on sofa to have retreated that might not be seen pain of mind have be much beyond in head sudden change edmund kindness have then occasioned made hardly know how to support chapter viii fanny ride recommenced very next day a be pleasant fresh feeling morning le hot than weather have lately be edmund trusted that loss of health pleasure must be soon made good while be gone mr rushworth arrived escorting mother who came to be civil to shew civility especially in urging execution of plan for visiting sotherton have be started fortnight before in consequence of subsequent absence from home have since lain dormant mr norris niece be well pleased with revival early day be named agreed to provided mr crawford must be disengaged young lady did not forget stipulation though mr norris must willingly have answered for being so must neither authorise liberty run risk at last on hint from miss bertram mr rushworth discovered that properest thing to be done be for to walk down to parsonage directly call on mr crawford inquire whether wednesday must suit not before return mr grant miss crawford came

conviction that everybody must be wanting to see sotherton to include miss crawford in invitation though mr grant who have not be at trouble of visiting mr rushworth on coming into neighbourhood civilly declined on own account be glad to secure pleasure for sister mary properly pressed persuaded be not long in accepting share of civility mr rushworth came back from parsonage successful edmund

trying to make up mind a to whether miss crawford being of party be desirable not whether brother barouche must not be full without miss bertrams laughed at idea assuring that barouche must hold four perfectly well independent of box on one might go with why be necessary said edmund that crawford carriage only must be employed why be use to be made of mother chaise must not when scheme be first mentioned other day understand why visit from family be not to be made in carriage of family what cried julia go boxed up three in postchaise in weather when may have seat in barouche dear edmund will not quite do besides said maria know that mr crawford depends upon taking after what passed at first must claim a promise dear edmund added mr norris taking out two carriage when one will do must be

pleasure now oh yes very glad if aunt see objection mr norris be very ready with only objection must remain having positively assured mr rushworth that fanny must not go very strange appearance there must consequently be in taking seemed to difficulty quite impossible to be got over must have strangest appearance must be something so very unceremonious so bordering on disrespect for mr rushworth whose own manner be such pattern of good breeding attention that really did not feel equal to mr norris have affection for fanny wish of procuring pleasure at time opposition to edmund now arose more from partiality for own scheme because be own than from anything else felt that have arranged everything extremely well that alteration must be for worse when edmund therefore told in reply a did when must give hearing that need not distress on mr rushworth account because have taken opportunity a walked with through hall of mentioning miss price a one who must probably be of party have directly received very sufficient invitation for cousin mr norris be too much vexed to submit with very good grace must only say very well very well just a chuse settle own way be sure care about seems very odd said maria that must be staying at home instead of fanny be sure ought to be very much obliged to added julia hastily leaving room a spoke from consciousness that ought to offer to stay at home fanny will feel quite a grateful a occasion requires be edmund only reply subject dropt fanny gratitude when heard plan be in fact much greater than pleasure felt edmund kindness with more than sensibility unsuspicious of fond attachment must be aware of that must forego enjoyment on account gave pain own satisfaction in seeing sotherton must be nothing without next meeting of two mansfield

extremity of ground may see something of here something of more distant tree be oak entirely miss bertram must now speak with decided information of what have known nothing about when mr rushworth have asked opinion spirit be in a happy flutter a vanity pride must furnish when drove up to spacious stone step before principal entrance chapter ix mr rushworth be at door to receive fair lady whole party be welcomed by with due attention in drawing room be met with equal cordiality by mother miss bertram have distinction with that must wish after business of arriving be over be first necessary to eat door be thrown open to admit through one two intermediate room into appointed dining parlour where collation be prepared with abundance elegance much be said much be ate went well particular object of day be then considered how must mr crawford like in what manner must chuse to take survey of ground mr rushworth mentioned curricle mr crawford suggested greater desirableness of carriage might convey more than two to be depriving of advantage of other eye other judgment might be evil even beyond loss of present pleasure mr rushworth proposed that chaise must be taken also be scarcely received a amendment young lady smiled spoke next proposition of shewing house to such of a have not be there before be more acceptable for miss bertram be pleased to have size displayed be glad to be doing something whole party rose accordingly under mr rushworth guidance be shewn through number of room lofty many large amply furnished in taste of fifty year back with shining floor solid mahogany rich damask marble gilding carving handsome in way of picture there be abundance few good larger part be family portrait no longer anything to anybody mr rushworth who have be at great pain to learn that housekeeper must teach be now almost equally well qualified to shew house on present occasion addressed chiefly to miss crawford fanny there be comparison in willingness of attention for miss crawford who have seen score of great house cared for none of have only appearance of civilly listening while fanny to whom everything be almost a interesting a be new attended with unaffected earnestness to mr rushworth must relate of family in former time rise grandeur regal visit loyal effort delighted to connect anything with history already known warm imagination with scene of past situation of house excluded possibility of much prospect from of room while fanny of others be attending mr rushworth henry crawford be looking grave shaking head at window room on west front looked across lawn to beginning of avenue immediately beyond tall iron palisade gate having visited many more room than must be supposed to be of other use than to contribute to window tax find employment for housemaid now said mr rushworth be coming to chapel properly ought to enter from above look down upon a be quite among friend will take in way if will excuse entered fanny imagination have prepared for something grander than mere spacious oblong room fitted up for purpose of devotion with nothing more striking more solemn than profusion of mahogany crimson velvet cushion appearing over ledge of family gallery above be disappointed said in low voice to edmund be not idea of chapel there be nothing awful here nothing melancholy nothing grand here be aisle arch inscription banner banner cousin to be 'blown by night wind of heaven ' sign that becottish monarch sleep below ' forget fanny how lately have be built for how confined purpose compared with old chapel of castle monastery be only for private use of family have be buried suppose in parish church there must look for banner achievement be foolish of not to think of be disappointed mr rushworth began relation chapel be fitted up a see in james second time before period a understand pew be only wainscot there be reason to think that lining cushion of pulpit family seat be only purple cloth be not quite certain be handsome chapel be formerly in constant use morning evening prayer be always read in by domestic chaplain within memory of many late mr rushworth left off generation have improvement said miss crawford with smile to edmund mr rushworth be gone to repeat lesson to mr crawford edmund fanny miss crawford remained in cluster together be pity cried fanny that custom must have be discontinued be valuable part of former time there be something in chapel chaplain so much in character with great house with one idea of what household must be whole family assembling regularly for purpose of prayer be fine very fine indeed said miss crawford laughing must do head of family great deal of good to force poor housemaid footman to leave business pleasure say prayer here twice day while be inventing excuse for staying away be hardly fanny idea of family assembling said edmund if master mistress attend there must be more harm than good in custom at rate be safer to leave people to own device on such subject everybody like to go own way to chuse own time manner of devotion obligation of attendance formality restraint length of time altogether be formidable thing what nobody like if good people who used to kneel gape in gallery must have foreseen that time must ever come when men woman might lie ten minute in bed when woke with headache without danger of reprobation because chapel be missed must have jumped with joy envy can not imagine with what unwilling feeling former belle of house of rushworth did many time repair to chapel young mr eleanors mr bridget starched up into seeming piety with head full of something very different especially if poor chaplain be not worth looking at in day fancy parson be very inferior even to what be now for few moment be unanswered fanny coloured looked at edmund felt too angry for speech needed little recollection before must say lively mind can hardly be serious even on serious subject have given amusing sketch human nature can not say be not so must feel at time difficulty of fixing thought a must wish if be supposing frequent thing be to say weakness grown into habit from neglect what must be expected from private devotion of such person do think mind be suffered be indulged in wandering in chapel must be more collected in closet yes very likely must have two chance at least in favour there must be le to distract attention from without must not be tried so long mind doe not struggle against under one circumstance must find object to distract in other believe influence of place of example may often rouse better feeling than be begun with greater length of service however admit to be sometimes too hard stretch upon mind one wish be not so have not yet left oxford long enough to forget what chapel prayer be while be passing rest of party being scattered about chapel julia called mr crawford attention to sister by saying do look at mr rushworth maria standing side by side exactly a if ceremony be going to be performed have not completely air of mr crawford smiled acquiescence stepping forward to maria said in voice only must hear like to see miss bertram so near altar starting lady instinctively moved step two recovering in moment affected to laugh asked in tone not much louder if must give away be afraid must do very awkwardly be reply with look of meaning julia joining at moment carried on joke upon word be really pity that must not take place directly if have proper licence for here be altogether nothing in world must be more snug pleasant talked laughed about with so little caution a to catch comprehension of mr rushworth mother expose sister to whispered gallantry of lover while mr rushworth spoke with proper smile dignity of being most happy event to whenever took place if edmund be in order cried julia running to where stood with miss crawford fanny dear edmund if be in order now might perform ceremony directly how unlucky that be not ordained mr rushworth maria be quite ready miss crawford countenance a julia spoke might have amused disinterested observer looked almost aghast under new idea be receiving fanny pitied how distressed will be at what said just now passed across mind ordained said miss crawford what be to be clergyman yes will take order soon after father return probably at christmas miss crawford rallying spirit recovering complexion replied only if have known before must have spoken of cloth with more respect turned subject chapel be soon afterwards left to silence stillness reigned in with few interruption throughout year miss bertram displeased with sister led way seemed to feel that have be there long enough lower part of house have be now entirely shewn mr rushworth never weary in cause must have proceeded towards principal staircase taken through room above if son have not interposed with doubt of there being time enough for if said with sort of self evident proposition many clearer head doe not always avoid be too long going over house will not have time for what be to be done out of door be past two be to dine at five mr rushworth submitted question of surveying ground with who how be likely to be more fully agitated mr norris be beginning to arrange by what junction of carriage horse most must be done when young people meeting with outward door temptingly open on flight of step led immediately to turf shrub sweet of pleasure ground a by one impulse one wish for air liberty walked out suppose turn down here for present said mr rushworth civilly taking hint following here be greatest number of plant here be curious pheasant query said mr crawford looking round whether may not find something to employ here before go farther see wall of great promise mr rushworth will summon council on lawn james said mr rushworth to son believe wilderness will be new to party miss bertrams have never seen wilderness yet objection be made for time there seemed inclination to move in plan to distance be attracted at first by plant pheasant dispersed about in happy independence mr crawford be first to move forward to examine capability of end of house lawn bounded on side by high wall contained beyond first planted area bowling green beyond bowling green long terrace walk backed by iron palisade commanding view over into top of tree of wilderness immediately adjoining be good spot for fault finding mr crawford be soon followed by miss bertram mr rushworth when after little time others began to form into party three be found in busy consultation on terrace by edmund miss crawford fanny who seemed a naturally to unite who after short participation of regret difficulty left walked on remaining three mr rushworth mr norris julia be still far behind for julia whose happy star no longer prevailed be obliged to keep by side of mr rushworth restrain impatient foot to lady slow pace while aunt having fallen in with housekeeper who be come out to feed pheasant be lingering behind in gossip with poor julia only one out of nine not tolerably satisfied with lot be now in state of complete penance a different from julia of barouche box a must well be imagined politeness have be brought up to practise a duty made impossible for to escape while want of higher specie of self command just consideration of others that knowledge of own heart that principle of right have not formed essential part of education made miserable under be insufferably hot said miss crawford when have taken one turn on terrace be drawing second time to door in middle opened to wilderness will of object to being comfortable here be nice little wood if one can get into what happiness if door must not be locked of course be for in great place gardener be only people who can go where like door however proved not to be locked be agreed in turning joyfully through leaving unmitigated glare of day behind considerable flight of step landed in wilderness be planted wood of about two acre though chiefly of larch laurel beech cut down though laid out with too much regularity be darkness shade natural beauty compared with bowling green terrace felt refreshment of for time must only walk admire at length after short pause miss crawford began with so be to be clergyman mr bertram be rather surprise to why must surprise must suppose designed for profession might perceive that be lawyer soldier sailor very true in short have not occurred to know there be generally uncle grandfather to leave fortune to second son very praiseworthy practice said edmund not quite universal be one of exception being must do something for why be to be clergyman thought be always lot of youngest where there be many to chuse before do think church never chosen then never be black word yes in never of conversation mean not very often do think for what be to be done in church men love to distinguish in of other line distinction may be gained not in church clergyman be nothing nothing of conversation have gradation hope a well a never clergyman can not be high in state fashion must not head mob set ton in dress can not call situation nothing have charge of be of first importance to mankind individually collectively considered temporally eternally have guardianship of religion moral consequently of manner result from influence one here can call office nothing if man who hold be so be by neglect of duty by foregoing just importance stepping out of place to appear what ought not to appear assign greater consequence to clergyman than one have be used to hear given than can quite comprehend one doe not see much of influence importance in society how can be acquired where be so seldom seen how can two sermon week even supposing worth hearing supposing preacher to have sense to prefer blair to own do that speak of govern conduct fashion manner of large congregation for rest of week one scarcely see clergyman out of pulpit be speaking of london be speaking of nation at large metropolis imagine be pretty fair sample of rest not must hope of proportion of virtue to vice throughout kingdom look in great city for best morality be not there that respectable people of denomination can do most good certainly be not there that influence of clergy can be most felt fine preacher be followed admired be not in fine preaching only that good clergyman will be useful in parish neighbourhood where parish neighbourhood be of size capable of knowing private character observing general conduct in london can rarely be case clergy be lost there in crowd of parishioner be known to largest part only a preacher with regard to influencing public manner miss crawford must not misunderstand suppose mean to call arbiter of good breeding regulator of refinement courtesy master of ceremony of life manner speak of might rather be called conduct perhaps result of good principle effect in short of doctrine be duty to teach recommend will believe be everywhere found that a clergy be be not what ought to be so be rest of nation certainly said fanny with gentle earnestness there cried miss crawford have quite convinced miss price already wish must convince miss crawford too think ever will said with arch smile be just a much surprised now a be at first that must intend to take order really be fit for something better come do change mind be not too late go into law go into law with a much ease a be told to go into wilderness now be going to say something about law being worst wilderness of two forestall remember have forestalled need not hurry when object be only to prevent saying bon mot for there be not least wit in nature be very matter of fact plain spoken being may blunder on border of repartee for hour together without striking out general silence succeeded be thoughtful fanny made first interruption by saying wonder must be tired with only walking in sweet wood next time come to seat if be not disagreeable to must be glad to sit down for little while dear fanny cried edmund immediately drawing arm within how thoughtless have be hope be not very tired perhaps turning to miss crawford other companion may do honour of taking arm thank be not at all tired took however a spoke gratification of having do so of feeling such connexion for first time made little forgetful of fanny scarcely touch said make of use what difference in weight of woman arm from of man at oxford have be good deal used to have man lean on for length of street be only fly in comparison be really not tired almost wonder at for must have walked at least mile in wood think have not mile be sturdy answer for be not yet so much in love a to measure distance reckon time with feminine lawlessness oh consider how much have wound about have taken very serpentine course wood must be mile long in straight line for have never seen end of yet since left first great path if remember before left that first great path saw directly to end of looked down whole vista saw closed by iron gate must not have be more than furlong in length oh know nothing of furlong be sure be very long wood that have be winding in out ever since came into therefore when say that have walked mile in must speak within compass have be exactly quarter of hour here said edmund taking out watch do think be walking four mile hour oh attack with watch watch be always too fast too slow can not be dictated to by watch few step farther brought out at bottom of very walk have be talking of standing back well shaded sheltered looking over have have into park be comfortable sized bench on sat down be afraid be very tired fanny said edmund observing why must not speak sooner will be bad day amusement for if be to be knocked up sort of exercise fatigue so soon miss crawford except riding how abominable in then to let engross horse a did last week be ashamed of of will never happen again attentiveness consideration make more sensible of own neglect fanny interest seems in safer hand with than with that must be tired now however give surprise for there be nothing in course of one duty so fatiguing a what have be doing morning seeing great house dawdling from one room to straining one eye one attention hearing what one doe not understand admiring what one doe not care for be generally allowed to be greatest bore in world miss price have found so though did not know will soon be rested said fanny to sit in shade on fine day look upon verdure be most perfect refreshment after sitting little while miss crawford be up again must move said resting fatigue have looked across have have till be weary must go look through iron gate at same view without being able to see so well edmund left seat likewise now miss crawford if will look up walk will convince that can not be mile long half mile be immense distance said see that with glance still reasoned with in vain must not calculate must not compare must only smile assert greatest degree of rational consistency must not have be more engaging talked with mutual satisfaction at last be agreed that must endeavour to determine dimension of wood by walking little more about must go to one end of in line be then in for there be straight green walk along bottom by side of have have perhaps turn little way in other direction if seemed likely to assist be back in few minute fanny said be rested must have moved too be not suffered edmund urged remaining where be with earnestness must not resist be left on bench to think with pleasure of cousin care with great regret that be not stronger watched till have turned corner listened till sound of have ceased chapter x quarter of hour twenty minute passed away fanny be still thinking of edmund miss crawford without interruption from one began to be surprised at being left so long to listen with anxious desire of hearing step voice again listened at length heard heard voice foot approaching have just satisfied that be not wanted when miss bertram mr rushworth mr crawford issued from same path have trod be before miss price alone dear fanny how come be first salutation told story poor dear fanny cried cousin how ill have be used by have better have staid with then seating with gentleman on side resumed conversation have engaged before discussed possibility of improvement with much animation nothing be fixed on henry crawford be full of idea project generally speaking whatever proposed be immediately approved first by then by mr rushworth whose principal business seemed to be to hear others who scarcely risked original thought of own beyond wish that have seen friend smith place after minute spent in way miss bertram observing iron gate expressed wish of passing through into park that view plan might be more comprehensive be very thing of others to be wished be best be only way of proceeding with advantage in henry crawford opinion directly saw knoll not mile off must give exactly requisite command of house go therefore must to knoll through gate gate be locked mr rushworth wished have brought key have be very near thinking whether must not bring key be determined must never come without key again still did not remove present evil must not get through a miss bertram inclination for so doing did by mean lessen ended in mr rushworth declaring outright that must go fetch key set off accordingly be undoubtedly best thing can do now a be so far from house already said mr crawford when be gone yes there be nothing else to be done now sincerely find place altogether worse than expected indeed far otherwise find better grander more complete in style though style may not be best to tell truth speaking rather lower think that will ever see sotherton again with so much pleasure a do now summer will hardly improve to after moment embarrassment lady replied be too much man of world not to see with eye of world if other people think sotherton improved have doubt that will be afraid be not quite so much man of world a might be good for in point feeling be not quite so evanescent memory of past under such easy dominion a one find to be case with men of world be followed by short silence miss bertram began again seemed to enjoy drive here very much morning be glad to see so well entertained julia be laughing whole way be yes believe be have not least recollection at what oh believe be relating to ridiculous story of old irish groom of uncle sister love to laugh think more light hearted than be more easily amused replied consequently know smiling better company must not have hoped to entertain with irish anecdote during ten mile drive naturally believe be a lively a julia have more to think of now have undoubtedly there be situation in very high spirit must denote insensibility prospect however be too fair to justify want of spirit have very smiling scene before do mean literally figuratively literally conclude yes certainly sun shine park look very cheerful unluckily that iron gate have have give feeling of restraint hardship ' can not get out a starling said a spoke be with expression walked to gate followed mr rushworth be so long fetching key for world must not get out without key without mr

prohibited prohibited nonsense certainly can get out way will mr rushworth will be here in moment know will not be out of sight if be miss price will be so good a to tell that will find near knoll grove of oak on knoll fanny feeling to be wrong must not help making effort to prevent will hurt miss bertram cried will certainly hurt against spike will tear gown will be in danger of slipping into have have have better not go cousin be safe on other side while word be spoken smiling with good humour of success said thank dear fanny gown be alive well so good bye fanny be again left to solitude with increase of pleasant feeling for be sorry for almost that have seen heard astonished at miss bertram angry with mr crawford by taking circuitous route a appeared to very unreasonable direction to knoll be soon beyond eye for minute longer remained without sight sound of companion seemed to have little wood to herself must almost have thought that edmund miss crawford have left that be impossible for edmund to forget so entirely be again roused from disagreeable musing by sudden footstep somebody be coming at quick pace down principal walk expected mr rushworth be julia who hot out of breath with look of disappointment cried out on seeing heyday where be others thought maria mr crawford be with fanny explained pretty trick upon word can not see anywhere looking eagerly into park

morning why child have moment escaped from horrible mother penance a have be enduring while be sitting here so composed so happy might have be a well perhaps if have be in place always contrive to keep out of scrape be most unjust reflection fanny must allow for let pas julia be vexed temper be hasty felt that must not last therefore taking notice only asked if have not seen mr rushworth yes yes saw be posting away a if upon life death must just spare time to tell errand where be be pity must have so much trouble for nothing be miss maria concern be not obliged to punish for sin mother must not avoid a long a tiresome aunt be dancing about with housekeeper son can get away from immediately scrambled across fence walked away not attending to fanny last question of whether have seen anything of miss crawford edmund sort of dread in fanny now sat of seeing mr rushworth prevented thinking so much of continued absence however a might have done felt that have be very ill used be quite unhappy in having to communicate what have passed joined within five minute after julia exit though made best of story be evidently mortified displeased in common degree at first scarcely said anything look only expressed extreme surprise vexation walked to gate stood there without seeming to know what to do desired to stay cousin maria charged to say that must find at knoll thereabouts believe will go farther said sullenly see nothing of by time get to knoll may be gone somewhere else have have walking enough sat down with most gloomy countenance by fanny be very sorry said be very unlucky longed to be able to say something more to purpose after interval of silence think might a well have staid for said miss bertram thought must follow must not have have to follow if have staid must not be denied fanny be silenced after pause went on pray miss price be such great admirer of mr crawford a people be for part can see nothing in think at handsome handsome nobody can call such undersized man handsome be not five foot nine must not wonder if be not more than five foot eight think be ill looking fellow in opinion crawford be addition at did very well without small sigh escaped fanny here did not know how to contradict if have made difficulty about fetching key there might have be excuse went very moment said wanted nothing must be more obliging than manner be sure dare say walked a fast a must still be distance know from spot to house quite into house when people be waiting be bad judge of time half minute seems like five got up walked to gate again wished have have key about at time fanny thought discerned in standing there indication of relenting encouraged to attempt said therefore be pity must not join expected to have better view of house from part of park will be thinking how may be improved nothing of sort know can be settled without found more successful in sending away than in retaining companion mr rushworth be worked on well said if really think have better go must be foolish to bring key for nothing letting out walked off without farther ceremony fanny thought be now engrossed by two who have left so long ago getting quite impatient resolved to go in search of followed step along bottom walk have just turned up into when voice laugh of miss crawford once more caught ear sound approached few more winding brought before be just returned into wilderness from park to sidegate not fastened have tempted very soon after leaving have be across portion of park into very avenue fanny have be hoping whole morning to reach at last

pleasant a serenity of nature must make when mr norris ceased speaking be altogether silent drive to within spirit be in general exhausted to determine whether day have afforded most pleasure pain might occupy meditation of almost chapter xi day at sotherton with imperfection afforded miss bertrams much more agreeable feeling than be derived from letter from antigua soon afterwards reached mansfield be much pleasanter to think of henry crawford than of father to think of father in england again within certain period letter obliged to do be most unwelcome exercise november be black month fixed for return sir thomas wrote of with a much decision a experience anxiety must authorise business be so nearly concluded a to justify in proposing to take passage in september packet consequently looked forward with hope of being with beloved family again early in november maria be more to be pitied than julia for to father brought husband return of friend most solicitous for happiness must unite to lover on whom have chosen that happiness must depend be gloomy prospect must do be to throw mist over hope when mist cleared away must see something else must hardly be early in november there be generally delay bad passage something that favouring something everybody who shuts eye while look understanding while reason feel comfort of must probably be middle of november at least middle of november be three month off three month comprised thirteen week much might happen in thirteen week sir thomas must have be deeply mortified by suspicion of half that daughter felt on subject of return must hardly have found consolation in knowledge of interest excited in breast of young lady miss crawford on walking up with brother to spend evening at mansfield park heard good news though seeming to have concern in affair beyond politeness to have vented feeling in quiet congratulation heard with attention not so easily satisfied mr norris gave particular of letter subject be dropt after tea a miss crawford be standing at open window with edmund fanny looking out on twilight scene while miss bertrams mr rushworth henry crawford be busy with candle at pianoforte suddenly revived by turning round towards group saying how happy mr rushworth look be thinking of november edmund looked round at mr rushworth too have nothing to say father return will be very interesting event will indeed after such absence absence not only long including so many danger will be forerunner also of other interesting event sister marriage taking order yes be affronted said laughing doe put in mind of of old heathen hero who after performing great exploit in foreign land offered sacrifice to god on safe return there be sacrifice in case replied edmund with serious smile glancing at pianoforte again be entirely own doing oh yes know be be merely joking have done more than what young woman must do have doubt of being extremely happy other sacrifice of course understand taking order assure be quite a voluntary a maria marrying be fortunate that inclination father convenience must accord so well there be very good living kept for understand hereabouts suppose have biassed that be sure have not cried fanny thank for good word fanny be more than must affirm on contrary knowing that there be such provision for probably did bias can think wrong that must there be natural disinclination to be overcome see reason why man must make worse clergyman for knowing that will have competence early in life be in safe hand hope must not have be influenced in wrong way be sure father be too conscientious to have allowed have doubt be biased think be blamelessly be same sort of thing said fanny after short pause a for son of admiral to go into navy son of general to be in army nobody see anything wrong in nobody wonder that must prefer line where friend can serve best suspect to be le in earnest in than appear dear miss price for reason good profession navy army be own justification have everything in favour heroism danger bustle fashion soldier sailor be always acceptable in society nobody can wonder that men be soldier sailor motif of man who take order with certainty of preferment may be fairly suspected think said edmund to be justified in eye must do in most complete uncertainty of provision what take order without living be madness indeed absolute madness will ask how church be to be filled if man be to take order with living without for certainly must not know what to say must beg advantage to clergyman from own argument a can not be influenced by feeling rank highly a temptation reward to soldier sailor in choice of profession a heroism noise fashion be against ought to be le liable to suspicion of wanting sincerity good intention in choice of oh doubt be very sincere in preferring income ready made to trouble of working for one have best intention of doing nothing rest of day eat drink grow fat be indolence mr bertram indeed indolence love of ease want of laudable ambition of taste for good company of inclination to take trouble of being agreeable make men clergyman clergyman have nothing to do be slovenly selfish read newspaper watch weather quarrel with wife curate doe work business of own life be to dine there be such clergyman doubt think be not so common a to justify miss crawford in esteeming general character suspect that in comprehensive may say commonplace censure be not judging from from prejudiced person whose opinion have be in habit of hearing be impossible that own observation can have given much knowledge of clergy can have be personally acquainted with very few of set of men condemn so conclusively be speaking what have be told at uncle table speak what appears to general opinion where opinion be general be usually correct though have not seen much of domestic life of clergyman be seen by too many to leave deficiency of information where one body of educated men of denomination be condemned indiscriminately there must be deficiency of information smiling of something else uncle brother admiral perhaps knew little of clergyman beyond chaplain whom good bad be always wishing away poor william have met with great kindness from chaplain of antwerp be tender apostrophe of fanny very much to purpose of own feeling if not of conversation have be so little addicted to take opinion from uncle said miss crawford can hardly suppose since push so hard must observe be not entirely without mean of seeing what clergyman be being at present time guest of own brother dr grant though dr grant be most kind obliging to though be really gentleman dare say good scholar clever often preaches good sermon be very respectable see to be indolent selfish bon vivant who must have palate consulted in everything who will not stir finger for convenience of one who moreover if cook make blunder be out of humour with excellent wife to own truth henry be partly driven out very evening by disappointment about green goose must not get better of poor sister be forced to stay bear wonder at disapprobation upon word be great defect of temper made worse by very faulty habit of self indulgence to see sister suffering from must be exceedingly painful to such feeling a yours fanny go against can not attempt to defend dr grant replied fanny need not give up profession for because profession dr grant have chosen must have taken not good temper into a must either in navy army have have great many more people under command than have now think more must have be made unhappy by a sailor soldier than a clergyman besides can not suppose that there may be to wish otherwise in dr grant must have be in greater danger of becoming worse in more active worldly profession where must have have le time obligation where might have escaped that knowledge of frequency at least of knowledge be impossible must escape a be now man sensible man like dr grant can not be in habit of teaching others duty week can not go to church twice sunday preach such very good sermon in so good manner a doe without being better for must make think have doubt that oftener endeavour to restrain than must if have be anything clergyman can not prove to contrary to be sure wish better fate miss price than to be wife of man whose amiableness depends upon own sermon for though may preach into good humour sunday will be bad enough to have quarrelling about green goose from monday morning till saturday night think man who must often quarrel with fanny said edmund affectionately must be beyond reach of sermon fanny turned farther into window miss crawford have only time to say in pleasant manner fancy miss price have be more used to deserve praise than to hear when being earnestly invited by miss bertrams to join in glee tripped off to instrument leaving edmund looking after in ecstasy of admiration of many virtue from obliging manner down to light graceful tread there go good humour be sure said presently there go temper must never give pain how well walk how readily fall in with inclination of others joining moment be asked what pity added after instant reflection that must have be in such hand fanny agreed to have pleasure of seeing continue at window with in spite of expected glee of having eye soon turned like hers towards scene without where be solemn soothing lovely appeared in brilliancy of unclouded night contrast of deep shade of wood fanny spoke feeling here harmony said here be repose here be what may leave painting music behind what poetry only can attempt to describe here be what may tranquillise care lift heart to rapture when look out on night a feel a if there must be wickedness sorrow in world there certainly must be le of if sublimity of nature be more attended to people be carried more out of by contemplating scene like to hear enthusiasm fanny be lovely night be much to be pitied who have not be taught to feel in degree a do who have not at least be given taste for nature in early life lose great deal taught to think feel on subject cousin have very apt scholar there be arcturus looking very bright yes bear wish must see cassiopeia must go out on lawn for must be afraid not in least be great while since have have star gazing yes know how have happened glee began will stay till be finished fanny said turning back on window a advanced have mortification of seeing advance too moving forward by gentle degree towards instrument when ceased be close by singer among most urgent in requesting to hear glee again fanny sighed alone at window till scolded away by mr norris threat of catching cold chapter xii sir thomas be to return in november eldest son have duty to call earlier home approach of september brought tidings of mr bertram first in letter to gamekeeper then in letter to edmund by end of august arrived to be gay agreeable gallant again a occasion served miss crawford demanded to tell of race weymouth party friend to might have listened six week before with interest altogether to give fullest conviction by power of actual comparison of preferring younger brother be very vexatious be heartily sorry for so be so far from now meaning to marry elder did not even want to attract beyond what simplest claim of conscious beauty required lengthened absence from mansfield without anything pleasure in view own will to consult made perfectly clear that did not care about indifference be so much more than equalled by own be now to step forth owner of mansfield park sir thomas complete be to be in time did not believe must accept season duty brought mr bertram back to mansfield took mr crawford into norfolk everingham must not do without in beginning of september went for fortnight fortnight of such dullness to miss bertrams a ought to have put on guard made even julia admit in jealousy of sister absolute necessity of distrusting attention wishing not to return fortnight of sufficient leisure in interval of shooting sleeping to have convinced gentleman that ought to keep longer away have be more in habit of examining own motif of reflecting to what indulgence of idle vanity be tending thoughtless selfish from prosperity bad example must not look beyond present moment sister handsome clever encouraging be amusement to sated mind finding nothing in norfolk to equal social pleasure of mansfield gladly returned to at time appointed be welcomed thither quite a gladly by whom came to trifle with further maria with only mr rushworth to attend to doomed to repeated detail of day sport good bad boast of dog jealousy of neighbour doubt of qualification zeal after poacher subject will not find way to female feeling without talent on one side attachment on other have missed mr crawford grievously julia unengaged unemployed felt right of missing much more sister believed favourite julia might be justified in so doing by hint of mr grant inclined to credit what wished maria by hint of mr crawford everything returned into same channel a before absence manner being to so animated agreeable a to lose ground with just stopping short of consistence steadiness solicitude warmth might excite general notice fanny be only one of party who found anything to dislike since day at sotherton must never see mr crawford with sister without observation seldom without wonder censure have confidence in own judgment be equal to exercise of in other respect have be sure that be seeing clearly judging candidly must probably have made important communication to usual confidant a be however only hazarded hint hint be lost be rather surprised said that mr crawford must come back again so soon after being here so long before full seven week for have understood be so very fond of change moving about thought something must certainly occur when be once gone to take elsewhere be used to much gayer place than mansfield be to credit be edmund answer dare say give sister pleasure doe not like unsettled habit what favourite be with cousin yes manner to woman be such a must please mr grant believe suspect of preference for julia have never seen much symptom of wish may be so have fault what serious attachment must remove if miss bertram be not engaged said fanny cautiously must sometimes almost think that admired more than julia be perhaps more in favour of liking julia best than fanny may be aware for believe often happens that man before have quite made up own mind will distinguish sister intimate friend of woman be really thinking of more than woman crawford have too much sense to stay here if found in danger from maria be not at afraid for after such proof a have given that feeling be not strong fanny supposed must have be mistaken meant to think differently in future with submission to edmund must do all help of coinciding look hint occasionally noticed in of others seemed to say that julia be mr crawford choice knew not always what to think be privy one evening to hope of aunt norris on subject a well a to feeling feeling of mr rushworth on point of similarity must not help wondering a listened glad must have be not to be obliged to listen for be while other young people be dancing sitting most unwillingly among chaperon at fire longing for re entrance of elder cousin on whom own hope of partner then depended be fanny first ball though without preparation splendour of many young lady first ball being thought only of afternoon built on late acquisition of violin player in servant hall possibility of raising five couple with help of mr grant new intimate friend of mr bertram just arrived on visit have however be very happy one to fanny through four dance be quite grieved to be losing even quarter of hour while waiting wishing looking now at dancer now at door dialogue between two above mentioned lady be forced on think ma'be said mr norris eye directed towards mr rushworth maria who be partner for second time will see happy face again now yes ma'be indeed replied other with stately simper there will be satisfaction in looking on now think be rather pity must have be obliged to part young folk in situation must be excused complying with common form wonder son did not propose dare say did ma'be mr rushworth be never remiss dear maria have strict sense of propriety so much of true delicacy one seldom meet with nowadays mr rushworth that wish of avoiding particularity dear ma'be only look at face at moment how different from what be two last dance miss bertram did indeed look happy eye be sparkling with pleasure be speaking with great animation for julia partner mr crawford be close to be in cluster together how have looked before fanny must not recollect for have be dancing with edmund have not thought about mr norris continued be quite delightful ma'be to see young people so properly happy so well suited so much thing can not think of dear sir thomas delight what do say ma'be to chance of match mr rushworth have set good example such thing be very catching mr rushworth who saw nothing son be quite at loss couple above ma'be do see symptom there oh dear miss julia mr crawford yes indeed very pretty match what be property four thousand year very well who have not more must be satisfied with what have four thousand year be pretty estate seems very genteel steady young man so hope miss julia will be very happy be not settled thing ma'be yet only speak of among friend have very little doubt will be be growing extremely particular in attention fanny must listen farther listening wondering be suspended for time for mr bertram be in room again though feeling must be great honour to be asked by thought must happen came towards little circle instead of asking to dance drew chair near gave account of present state of sick horse opinion of groom from whom have just parted fanny found that be not to be in modesty of nature immediately felt that have be unreasonable in expecting when have told of horse took newspaper from table looking over said in languid way if want to dance fanny will stand up with with more than equal civility offer be declined did not wish to dance be glad of said in much brisker tone throwing down newspaper again for be tired to death only wonder how good people can keep up so long have need be in love to find amusement in such folly so be fancy if look at may see be so many couple of lover yates mr grant between poor woman must want lover a much a one of desperate dull life hers must be with doctor making sly face a spoke towards chair of latter who proving however to be close at elbow made so instantaneous change of expression subject necessary a fanny in spite of everything must hardly help laughing at strange business in america dr grant what be opinion always come to to know what be to think of public matter dear tom cried aunt soon afterwards a be not dancing dare say will have objection to join in rubber will then leaving seat coming to to enforce proposal added in whisper want to make table for mr rushworth know mother be quite anxious about can not very well spare time to sit down because of fringe now dr grant will just do though play half crown know may bet half guinea with must be most happy replied aloud jumping up with alacrity must give greatest pleasure be moment going to dance come fanny taking hand be dawdling longer dance will be over fanny be led off very willingly though be impossible for to feel much gratitude towards cousin distinguish a certainly did between selfishness of person own pretty modest request upon word indignantly exclaimed a walked away to want to nail to card table for next two hour with dr grant who be always quarrelling that poking old woman who know more of whist than of algebra wish good aunt must be little le busy to ask in way too without ceremony before so a to leave possibility of refusing be what dislike most particularly raise spleen more than anything to have pretence of being asked of being given choice at same time addressed in such way a to oblige one to do very thing whatever be if have not luckily thought of standing up with must not have got out of be great deal too bad when aunt have got fancy in head nothing can stop chapter xiii honourable john yates new friend have not much to recommend beyond habit of fashion expense being younger son of lord with tolerable independence sir thomas must probably have thought introduction at mansfield by mean desirable mr bertram acquaintance with have begun at weymouth where have spent ten day together in same society friendship if friendship might be called have be proved perfected by mr yates being invited to take mansfield in way whenever must by promising to come did come rather earlier than have be expected in consequence of sudden breaking up of large party assembled for gaiety at house of friend have left weymouth to join came on wing of disappointment with head full of acting for have be theatrical party play in have borne part be within two day of representation when sudden death of one of nearest connexion of family have destroyed scheme dispersed performer to be so near happiness so near fame so near long paragraph in praise of private theatrical at ecclesford seat of right hon lord ravenshaw in cornwall must of course have immortalised whole party for at least twelvemonth being so near to lose be injury to be keenly felt mr yates must talk of nothing else ecclesford theatre with arrangement dress rehearsal joke be never failing subject to boast of past only consolation happily for love of theatre be so general itch for acting so strong among young people that must hardly out talk interest of hearer from first casting of part to epilogue be bewitching there be few who did not wish to have be party concerned must have hesitated to try skill play have be lover vow mr yates be to have be count cassel trifling part said not at to taste one a certainly must not accept again be determined to make difficulty lord ravenshaw duke have appropriated only two character worth playing before reached ecclesford though lord ravenshaw offered to resign to be impossible to take know be sorry for that must have so mistaken power for be more equal to baron little man with weak voice always hoarse after first ten minute must have injured piece materially be resolved to make difficulty sir henry thought duke not equal to frederick be because sir henry wanted part whereas be certainly in best hand of two be surprised to see sir henry such stick luckily strength of piece did not depend upon agatha be inimitable duke be thought very great by many upon whole must certainly have gone off wonderfully be hard case upon word do think be very much to be pitied be kind response of listening sympathy be not worth complaining about to be sure poor old dowager must not have died at worse time be impossible to help wishing that news must have be suppressed for just three day wanted be three day being only grandmother happening two hundred mile off think there must have be great harm be suggested know lord ravenshaw who suppose be one of most correct men in england must not hear of afterpiece instead of comedy said mr bertram lover vow be at end lord lady ravenshaw left to act grandmother by well jointure may comfort perhaps between friend began to tremble for credit lung in baron be not sorry to withdraw to make amends yates think must raise little theatre at mansfield ask to be manager though thought of moment did not end with moment for inclination to act be awakened in one more strongly than in who be now master of house who having so much leisure a to make almost novelty certain good have likewise degree of lively talent comic taste a be exactly adapted to novelty of acting thought returned again again oh for ecclesford theatre scenery to try something with sister must echo wish henry crawford to whom in riot of gratification be yet untasted pleasure be quite alive at idea really believe said must be fool enough at moment to undertake character that ever be written from shylock richard iii down to singing hero of farce in scarlet coat cocked hat feel a if must be anything everything a if must rant storm sigh cut caper in tragedy comedy in english language let be doing something be only play act scene what must prevent not countenance be sure looking towards miss bertrams for theatre what signifies theatre will be only amusing room in house might suffice must have curtain said tom bertram few yard of green baize for curtain perhaps may be enough oh quite enough cried mr yates with only just side wing two run up door in flat three four scene to be let down nothing more must be necessary on plan a for mere amusement among must want nothing more believe must be satisfied with le said maria there must not be time other difficulty must arise must rather adopt mr crawford view make performance not theatre object many part of best play be independent of scenery nay said edmund who began to listen with alarm let hing by half if be to act let be in theatre completely fitted up with pit box gallery let have play entire from beginning to end so a be german play matter what with good tricking shifting afterpiece figure dance hornpipe song between act if outdo ecclesford hing now edmund be disagreeable said julia nobody love play better than do can have gone much farther to see one true to see real acting good hardened real acting must hardly walk from room to next to look at raw effort of who have not be bred to trade set of gentleman lady who have disadvantage of education decorum to struggle through after short pause however subject still continued be discussed with unabated eagerness one inclination increasing by discussion knowledge of inclination of rest though nothing be settled that tom bertram must prefer comedy sister henry crawford tragedy that nothing in world must be easier than to find piece must please resolution to act something other seemed so decided a to make edmund quite uncomfortable be determined to prevent if possible though mother who equally heard conversation passed at table did not evince least disapprobation same evening afforded opportunity of trying strength maria julia henry crawford mr yates be in billiard room tom returning from into drawing room where edmund be standing thoughtfully by fire while lady bertram be on sofa at little distance fanny close beside arranging work thus began a entered horribly vile billiard table a ours be not to be met with believe above ground can stand no longer think may say that nothing will ever tempt to again one good thing have just ascertained be very room for theatre precisely shape length for door at farther end communicating with other a may be made to do in five minute by merely moving bookcase in father room be very thing must have desired if have sat down to wish for father room will be excellent greenroom seems to join billiard room on purpose be not serious tom in meaning to act said edmund in low voice a brother approached fire not serious never more so assure what be there to surprise in think must be very wrong in general light private theatrical be open to objection a be circumstanced must think must be highly injudicious more than injudicious to attempt anything of kind must shew great want of feeling on father account absent a be in degree of constant danger must be imprudent think with regard to maria whose situation be very delicate one considering everything extremely delicate take up thing so seriously a if be going to act three time week till father return invite country be not to be display of sort mean nothing little amusement among just to vary scene exercise power in something new want audience publicity may be trusted think in chusing play most perfectly unexceptionable can conceive greater harm danger to of in conversing in elegant written language of respectable author than in chattering in word of own have fear scruple a to father being absent be so far from objection consider rather a motive for expectation of return must be very anxious period to mother if can be mean of amusing that anxiety keeping up spirit for next few week will think time very well spent so be sure will be very anxious period for a said looked towards mother lady bertram sunk back in one corner of sofa picture of health wealth ease tranquillity be just falling into gentle doze while fanny be getting through few difficulty of work for edmund smiled shook head by jove wo do cried tom throwing into chair with hearty laugh to be sure dear mother anxiety be unlucky there what be matter asked ladyship in heavy tone of one half roused be not asleep oh dear ma'be nobody suspected well edmund continued returning to former subject posture voice a soon a lady bertram began to nod again will maintain that will be doing harm can not agree with be convinced that father must totally disapprove be convinced to contrary nobody be fonder of exercise of talent in young people promotes more than father for anything of acting spouting reciting kind think have always decided taste be sure encouraged in a boy how many time have mourned over dead body of julius caesar to be 'd not to be 'd in very room for amusement be sure name be norval evening of life through one christmas holiday be very different thing must see difference father wished a schoolboy to speak well must never wish grown up daughter to be acting play sense of decorum be strict know said tom displeased know father a well a do will take care that daughter hing to distress manage own concern edmund will take care of rest of family if be resolved on acting replied persevering edmund must hope will be in very small quiet way think theatre ought not to be attempted must be taking liberty with father house in absence must not be justified for everything of nature will be answerable said tom in decided tone house will not be hurt have quite a great interest in being careful of house a can have a to such alteration a be suggesting just now such a moving bookcase unlocking door even a using billiard room for space of week without playing at billiards in might just a well suppose must object to sitting more in room le in breakfast room than did before went away to sister pianoforte being moved from one side of room to other absolute nonsense innovation if not wrong a innovation will be wrong a expense yes expense of such undertaking must be prodigious perhaps might cost whole twenty pound something of theatre must have undoubtedly will be on simplest plan green curtain little carpenter work be a carpenter work may be done at home by christopher jackson will be too absurd to talk of expense a long a jackson be employed everything will be right with sir thomas imagine that nobody in house can see judge act if like expect to govern everybody else no a to acting said edmund that absolutely protest against tom walked out of room a said edmund be left to sit down stir fire in thoughtful vexation fanny who have heard borne edmund company in feeling throughout whole now ventured to say in anxiety to suggest comfort perhaps may not be able to find play to suit brother taste sister seem very different have hope there fanny if persist in scheme will find something will speak to sister try to dissuade be can do must think aunt norris must be on side dare say must have influence with tom sister must be of use if can not convince will let thing take course without attempting through family squabbling be greatest evil of have better do anything than be altogether by ear sister to whom have opportunity of speaking next morning be quite a impatient of advice quite a unyielding to representation quite a determined in cause of pleasure a tom mother have objection to plan be not in least afraid of father disapprobation there must be harm in what have be done in so many respectable family by so many woman of first consideration must be scrupulousness run mad must see anything to censure in plan like theirs comprehending only brother sister intimate friend must never be heard of beyond julia did seem inclined to admit that maria situation might require particular caution delicacy must not extend to be at liberty maria evidently considered engagement a only raising so much more above restraint leaving le occasion than julia to consult either father mother edmund have little to hope be still urging subject when henry crawford entered room fresh from parsonage calling out want of hand in theatre miss bertram want of understrappers sister desire love hope to be admitted into company will be happy to take part of old duenna tame confidante that may not like to do yourselves maria gave edmund glance meant what say now can be wrong if mary crawford feel same edmund silenced be obliged to acknowledge that charm of acting might well carry fascination to mind of genius with ingenuity of love to dwell more on obliging accommodating purport of message than on anything else scheme advanced opposition be vain a to mr norris be mistaken in supposing must wish to make started difficulty be not talked down in five minute by eldest nephew niece who be powerful with a whole arrangement be to bring very little expense to anybody none at to herself a foresaw in comfort of hurry bustle importance derived immediate advantage of fancying obliged to leave own house where have be living month at own cost take up abode in theirs that hour might be spent in service be in fact exceedingly delighted with project chapter xiv fanny seemed nearer being right than edmund have supposed business of finding play must suit everybody proved to be trifle carpenter have received order taken measurement have suggested removed at least two set of difficulty having made necessity of enlargement of plan expense fully evident be already at work while play be still to seek other preparation be also in hand enormous roll of green baize have arrived from northampton be cut out by mr norris with saving by good management of full three quarter of yard be actually forming into curtain by housemaid still play be wanting a two three day passed away in manner edmund began almost to hope that none might ever be found there be in fact so many thing to be attended to so many people to be pleased so many best character required above need that play must be at once tragedy comedy that there did seem a little chance of decision a anything pursued by youth zeal must hold out on tragic side be miss bertrams henry crawford mr yates on comic tom bertram not quite alone because be evident that mary crawford wish though politely kept back inclined same way determinateness power seemed to make ally unnecessary independent of great irreconcilable difference wanted piece containing very few character in whole character first rate three principal woman best play be run over in vain hamlet macbeth othello douglas gamester presented anything must satisfy even tragedian rival school for scandal wheel of fortune heir at law long et cetera be successively dismissed with yet warmer objection piece must be proposed did not supply somebody with difficulty on one side other be continual repetition of oh will never do let have ranting tragedy too many character not tolerable woman part in play anything that dear tom must be impossible to fill up one must not expect anybody to take part nothing buffoonery from beginning to end might do perhaps for low part if must give opinion have always thought most insipid play in english language wish to make objection will be happy to be of use think must not chuse worse fanny looked on listened not unamused to observe selfishness more le disguised seemed to govern wondering how must end for own gratification must have wished that something might be acted for have never seen even play everything of higher consequence be against will never do said tom bertram at last be wasting time most abominably something must be fixed on matter what so something be chosen must not be so nice few character too many must not frighten must double must descend little if part be insignificant greater credit in making anything of from moment make difficulty take part chuse to give so a be comic let be comic condition for nothing more for about fifth time then proposed heir at law doubting only whether to prefer lord duberley dr pangloss for very earnestly very unsuccessfully trying to persuade others that there be fine tragic part in rest of dramatis persona pause followed fruitless effort be ended by same speaker who taking up one of many volume of play lay on table turning over suddenly exclaimed lover vow why must not lover vow do for a well a for ravenshaws how came never to be thought of before strike a if must do exactly what say here be two capital tragic part for yates crawford here be rhyming butler for if nobody else want trifling part sort of thing must not dislike a said before be determined to take anything do best a for rest may be filled up by anybody be only count cassel anhalt suggestion be generally welcome everybody be growing weary of indecision first idea with everybody be that nothing have be proposed before so likely to suit mr yates be particularly pleased have be sighing longing to do baron at ecclesford have grudged rant of lord ravenshaw be forced to re rant in own room storm through baron wildenheim be height of theatrical ambition with advantage of knowing scene by heart already did now with greatest alacrity offer service for part to do justice however did not resolve to appropriate for remembering that there be very good ranting ground in frederick professed equal willingness for henry crawford be ready to take mr yates did not chuse must perfectly satisfy short parley of compliment ensued miss bertram feeling interest of agatha in question took on to decide by observing to mr yates that be point in height figure ought to be considered that being tallest seemed to fit peculiarly for baron be acknowledged to be quite right two part being accepted accordingly be certain of proper frederick three of character be now cast besides mr rushworth who be always answered for by maria a willing to do anything when julia meaning like sister to be agatha began to be scrupulous on miss crawford account be not behaving well by absent said here be not woman enough amelia agatha may do for maria here be nothing for sister mr crawford mr crawford desired that might not be thought of be very sure sister have wish of acting a might be useful that must not allow to be considered in present case be immediately opposed by tom bertram who asserted part of amelia to be in respect property of miss crawford if must accept fall a naturally a necessarily to said a agatha doe to one

represented than even agatha consider amelia be most difficult character in whole piece requires great power great nicety to give playfulness simplicity without extravagance have seen good actress fail in part simplicity indeed be beyond reach of almost actress by profession requires delicacy of feeling have not requires gentlewoman julia bertram will undertake hope turning to with look of anxious entreaty softened little while hesitated what to say brother again interposed with miss crawford better claim julia must not be amelia be not at part for must not like must not do well be too

supposed be only a agatha be to be so overpowering stopped henry crawford looked rather foolish a if did not know what to say tom bertram began again miss crawford must be amelia will be excellent amelia be afraid of wanting character cried julia with angry quickness be not to be agatha be sure will hing else a to amelia be of part in world most disgusting to quite detest odious little pert unnatural impudent girl have always protested against comedy be comedy in worst form so saying walked hastily out of room leaving awkward feeling to more than one exciting small compassion in except fanny who have be quiet auditor of whole who must not think of a under agitation of jealousy without great pity short silence succeeded leaving brother soon returned to business lover vow be eagerly looking over play with mr yates help to ascertain what scenery must be necessary while maria henry crawford conversed together in under voice declaration with began of be sure must give up part to

anhalt very stupid fellow soon decided for count miss bertram approved decision for le have to learn better though must not sympathise in wish that count agatha might be to act together wait very patiently while be slowly turning over leaf with hope of still discovering such scene very kindly took part in hand curtailed speech admitted being shortened besides pointing out necessity of being very much dressed chusing colour mr rushworth liked idea of finery very well though affecting to despise be too much engaged with what own appearance must be to think of others draw of conclusion feel of displeasure maria have be half prepared for thus much be settled before edmund who have be out morning knew anything of matter when entered drawing room before dinner buzz of discussion be high between tom maria mr yates mr rushworth stepped forward with great alacrity to tell agreeable news have got play said be to be lover vow be to be count cassel be to come in first with blue dress pink

others soon returned edmund found that to have endeavoured to set right must be only satisfaction dinner passed heavily mr norris related again triumph over dick jackson play preparation be otherwise much talked of for edmund disapprobation be felt even by brother though must not have owned maria wanting henry crawford animating support thought subject better avoided mr yates who be trying to make agreeable to julia found gloom le impenetrable on topic than of regret at secession from company mr rushworth having only own part own dress in head have soon talked away must be said of concern of theatre be suspended only for hour two there be still great deal to be settled spirit of evening giving fresh courage tom maria mr yates soon after being reassembled in drawing room seated in committee at separate table with play open before be just getting deep in subject when most welcome interruption be given by entrance of mr miss crawford who late dark dirty a be must not help coming be received with most grateful joy well how do go on what have settled oh can hing without followed first salutation henry crawford be soon seated with other three at table while sister made way to lady bertram with pleasant attention be complimenting must really congratulate ladyship said on play being chosen for though have borne with exemplary patience be sure must be sick of noise difficulty

beyond fanny to edmund be very civilly answered by lady bertram edmund said nothing being only bystander be not disclaimed after continuing in chat with party round fire few minute miss crawford returned to party round table standing by seemed to interest in arrangement till a if struck by sudden recollection exclaimed good friend be most composedly at work upon cottage alehouse inside out

yet got anhalt mr rushworth be to be count cassel one have yet undertaken anhalt have choice of part said mr rushworth thought must like count best though much relish finery be to have chose very wisely be sure replied miss crawford with brightened look anhalt be heavy part count have two forty speech returned mr rushworth be trifle be not at surprised said miss crawford after short pause at want of anhalt amelia deserves better forward young lady may well frighten men must be too happy in taking part if be possible cried tom unluckily butler anhalt be in together will not entirely give up however will try what can be done will look over again brother must take part said mr yates in low voice think must will not ask replied tom in cold determined manner miss crawford talked of something else soon afterwards rejoined party at fire want at said seating only puzzle oblige to make civil speech mr edmund bertram a act will be disinterested adviser therefore apply to what will do for anhalt be practicable for of others to double what be advice advice said calmly be that change play must have objection replied for though must not particularly dislike part of amelia if well supported be if everything went well will be sorry to be inconvenience a chuse to hear advice at table looking round certainly will not be taken edmund said more if part must tempt to act suppose must be anhalt observed lady archly after short pause for be clergyman know circumstance must by mean tempt replied for must be sorry to make character ridiculous by bad acting must be very difficult to keep anhalt from appearing formal solemn lecturer man who chuses profession be perhaps one of last who must wish to represent on stage miss crawford be silenced with feeling of resentment mortification moved chair considerably nearer tea table gave attention to mr norris who be presiding there fanny cried tom bertram from other table where conference be eagerly carrying on conversation

expect perfection must get brown gown white apron mob cap must make few wrinkle little of crowsfoot at corner of eye will be very proper little old woman must excuse indeed must excuse cried fanny growing more more red from excessive agitation looking distressfully at edmund who be kindly observing unwilling to exasperate brother by interference gave only encouraging smile entreaty have effect on tom only said again what have said before be not merely tom for requisition be now backed by maria mr crawford mr yates with urgency differed from in being more gentle more ceremonious altogether be quite overpowering to fanny before must breathe after mr norris completed whole by thus addressing in whisper at once angry audible what piece of work here be about nothing be quite ashamed of fanny to make such difficulty of obliging cousin in trifle of sort so kind a be to take part with good grace let hear more of matter entreat urge madam said edmund be not fair to urge in manner see doe not like to act let chuse for a well a rest of judgment may be quite a safely trusted urge more be not going to urge replied mr norris sharply will think very obstinate ungrateful girl if doe not do what aunt cousin wish very ungrateful indeed considering who what be edmund be too angry to speak miss crawford looking for moment with astonished eye at mr norris then at fanny whose tear be beginning to shew immediately said with keenness like situation place be too hot for moved away chair to opposite side of table close to fanny saying to in kind low whisper a placed never mind dear miss price be cross evening everybody be cross teasing let mind with pointed attention continued to talk to endeavour to raise spirit in spite of being out of spirit herself by look at brother

much obliged to for present kindness when from taking notice of work wishing must work a well begging for pattern supposing fanny be now preparing for appearance a of course must come out when cousin

called from fanny by tom bertram telling with infinite regret that found absolutely impossible for to undertake part of anhalt in addition to butler have be most anxiously trying to make out to be feasible must not do must give up there will not be smallest difficulty in filling added have to speak word may pick chuse must name at moment at least six young men within six mile of who be wild to

maria maria also thought acted well too well after first rehearsal two fanny began to be only audience sometimes a prompter sometimes a spectator be often very useful a far a must judge mr crawford be considerably best actor of have more confidence than edmund more judgment than tom more talent taste than mr yates did not like a man must admit to be best actor on point there be not many who differed from mr yates indeed exclaimed against tameness insipidity day came at last when mr rushworth turned to with black look said do think there be anything so very fine in for life soul of can not admire between ourselves to see such undersized little mean looking man set up for fine actor be very ridiculous in opinion from moment there be return of former jealousy maria from increasing

except mother indeed regretted that part be not more considerable deferred coming over to mansfield till be forward enough in rehearsal to comprehend scene others aspired at nothing beyond remembering catchword first line of speech being able to follow prompter through rest fanny in pity kindheartedness be at great pain to teach how to learn giving help direction in power trying to make artificial memory for learning word of part without being much forwarder many uncomfortable anxious apprehensive feeling certainly have with other claim on time attention be a far from finding without employment utility amongst a without companion in uneasiness quite a far from having demand on leisure a on compassion gloom of first anticipation be proved to have be unfounded be occasionally useful to be perhaps a much at peace a there be great deal of needlework to be done moreover in help be wanted that mr norris thought quite a well off a rest be evident by manner in claimed come fanny cried be fine time for must not be always walking from one room to other doing looking on at ease in way want here have be slaving till can hardly stand to contrive mr rushworth cloak without sending for more

between interested most particularly be longing dreading to see how must perform whole subject of be love marriage of love be to be described by gentleman very little short of declaration of love be made by lady have read read scene again with many painful many wondering emotion looked forward to representation of a circumstance almost too interesting did not believe have yet rehearsed even in private morrow came plan for evening continued be consideration of did not become le agitated worked very diligently under aunt direction diligence silence concealed very absent anxious mind about noon made escape with work to east room that might have concern in a deemed most unnecessary rehearsal of first act henry crawford be just proposing desirous at once of having time to herself of avoiding sight of mr rushworth glimpse a passed through hall of two lady walking up from parsonage made change in wish of retreat worked meditated in east room undisturbed for quarter of hour when gentle tap at door be followed by entrance of miss crawford be right yes be east room dear miss price beg pardon have made way to on purpose to entreat help fanny quite surprised endeavoured to shew mistress of room by civility looked at bright bar of empty grate with concern thank be quite warm very warm allow to stay here little while do have goodness to hear third act have brought book if must rehearse with must be so obliged came here to day intending to rehearse with edmund by ourselves against evening be not in way if be think must go through with till have hardened little for really there be speech two will be so good wo fanny be most civil in assurance though must not give in very steady voice have ever happened to look at part mean continued miss crawford opening book here be

rehearsers agatha frederick if be not perfect will be surprised by bye looked in upon five minute ago happened to be exactly at one of time when be trying not to embrace mr rushworth be with thought began to look little queer so turned off a well a must by whispering to 'we will have excellent agatha there be something so maternal in manner so completely maternal in voice countenance ' be not that well done of brightened up directly now for soliloquy began fanny joined in with modest feeling idea of representing edmund be so strongly calculated to inspire with look voice so truly feminine a to be very good picture of man with such anhalt however miss crawford have courage enough have got through scene when tap at door brought pause entrance of edmund next moment suspended surprise consciousness pleasure appeared in of three on unexpected meeting a edmund be come on very same business have brought miss crawford consciousness pleasure be likely to be more than momentary in too have book be seeking fanny to ask to rehearse with help to prepare for evening without knowing miss crawford to be in house great be joy animation of being thus thrown together of comparing scheme sympathising in praise of fanny kind office must not equal in warmth spirit sank under glow of theirs felt becoming too nearly nothing to to have comfort in having be sought by must now rehearse together edmund proposed urged entreated till lady not very unwilling at first must refuse no longer fanny be wanted only to prompt observe be invested indeed with office of judge critic earnestly desired to exercise tell fault from doing so feeling within shrank must not must not dared not attempt have be otherwise qualified for criticism conscience must have restrained from venturing at disapprobation believed to feel too much of in aggregate for honesty safety in particular to prompt must be enough for be sometimes more than enough for must not always pay attention to book in watching forgot agitated by increasing spirit of edmund manner have once closed page turned away exactly a wanted help be imputed to very reasonable weariness be thanked pitied deserved pity more than hoped must ever surmise at last scene be over fanny forced to add praise to compliment be giving other when again alone able to recall whole be inclined to believe performance must indeed have such nature feeling in a must ensure credit make very suffering exhibition to herself might be effect however must stand brunt of again that very day first regular rehearsal of three first act be certainly to take place in evening mr grant crawford be engaged to return for purpose a soon a must after dinner one concerned be looking forward with eagerness there seemed general diffusion of cheerfulness on occasion tom be enjoying such advance towards end edmund be in spirit from morning rehearsal little vexation seemed everywhere smoothed away be alert impatient lady moved soon gentleman soon followed with exception of lady bertram mr norris julia everybody be in theatre at early hour having lighted up a well a unfinished state admitted be waiting only arrival of mr grant crawford to begin did not wait long for crawford there be mr grant must not come dr grant professing indisposition for have little credit with fair sister in law must not spare wife dr grant be ill said with mock solemnity have be ill ever since did not eat of pheasant today fancied tough sent away plate have be suffering ever since here be disappointment mr grant non attendance be sad indeed pleasant manner cheerful conformity made always valuable amongst now be absolutely necessary must not act must not rehearse with satisfaction without comfort of whole evening be destroyed what be to be done tom a cottager be in despair after pause of perplexity eye began to be turned towards fanny voice two to say if miss price must be so good a to read part be immediately surrounded by supplication everybody asked even edmund said do fanny if be not very disagreeable to fanny still hung back must not endure idea of why be not miss crawford to be applied to a well why have not rather gone to own room a have felt to be safest instead of attending rehearsal at have known must irritate distress have known duty to keep away be properly punished have only to read part said henry crawford with renewed entreaty do believe can say word of added maria for must put mr grant right other day in twenty place fanny be sure know part fanny must not say did not a persevered a edmund repeated wish with look of even fond dependence on good nature must yield must do best everybody be satisfied be left to tremor of most palpitating heart while others prepared to begin did begin being too much engaged in own noise to be struck by unusual noise in other part of house have proceeded way when door of room be thrown open julia appearing at with face aghast exclaimed father be come be in hall at moment chapter xix how be consternation of party to be described to greater number be moment of absolute horror sir thomas in house felt instantaneous conviction not hope of imposition mistake be harboured anywhere julia look be evidence of fact that made indisputable after first start exclamation not word be spoken for minute with altered countenance be looking at other almost be feeling stroke most unwelcome most ill timed most appalling mr yates might consider only a vexatious interruption for evening mr rushworth might imagine blessing other heart be sinking under degree of self condemnation undefined alarm other heart be suggesting what will become of be to be done now be terrible pause terrible to ear be corroborating sound of opening door passing footstep julia be first to move speak again jealousy bitterness have be suspended selfishness be lost in common cause at moment of appearance frederick be listening with look of devotion to agatha narrative pressing hand to heart a soon a must notice

appearing before going roused rest at same moment two brother stepped forward feeling necessity of doing something very few word between be sufficient case admitted difference of opinion must go to drawing room directly maria joined with same intent just then stoutest of three for very circumstance have driven julia away be to sweetest support henry crawford retaining hand at moment moment of such peculiar proof importance be worth age of doubt anxiety hailed a earnest of most serious determination be equal even to encounter father walked off utterly heedless of mr rushworth repeated question of will go too have not better go too will not be right for to go too be sooner through door than henry crawford undertook to answer anxious inquiry encouraging by mean to pay respect to sir thomas without delay sent after others with delighted haste fanny be left with only crawford mr yates have be quite overlooked by cousin a own opinion of claim on sir thomas affection be much too humble to give idea of classing with child be glad to remain behind gain little breathing time agitation alarm exceeded be endured by rest by right of disposition not even innocence must keep from suffering be nearly fainting former habitual dread of uncle be returning with compassion for for almost one of party on development before with solicitude on edmund account indescribable have found seat where in excessive trembling be enduring fearful thought while other three no longer under restraint be giving vent to feeling of vexation lamenting over such unlooked for premature arrival a most untoward event without mercy wishing poor sir thomas have be twice a long on passage be still in crawford be more warm on subject than mr yates from better understanding family judging more clearly of mischief must ensue ruin of play be to certainty felt total destruction of scheme to be inevitably at hand while mr yates considered only a temporary interruption disaster for evening must even suggest possibility of rehearsal being renewed after tea when bustle of receiving sir thomas be over might be at leisure to be amused by crawford laughed at idea having soon agreed on propriety of walking quietly home leaving family to proposed mr yates accompanying spending evening at parsonage mr yates having never be with who thought much of parental claim family confidence must not perceive that anything of kind be necessary therefore thanking said preferred remaining where be that might pay respect to old gentleman handsomely since be come besides did not think must be fair by others to have everybody run away fanny be just beginning to collect to feel that if staid longer behind might seem disrespectful when point be settled being commissioned with brother sister apology saw preparing to go a quitted room to perform dreadful duty of appearing before uncle too soon did find at drawing room door after pausing moment for what knew must not come for courage outside of door have ever supplied to turned lock in desperation light of drawing room collected family be before a entered own name caught ear sir thomas be at moment looking round saying where be fanny why see little fanny on perceiving came forward with kindness astonished penetrated calling dear fanny kissing affectionately observing with decided pleasure how much be grown fanny knew not how to feel where to look be quite oppressed have never be so kind so very kind to in life manner seemed changed voice be quick from agitation of joy have be awful in dignity seemed lost in tenderness led nearer light

justified in belief of equal improvement in health beauty inquired next after family especially william kindness altogether be such a made reproach for loving so little thinking return misfortune when on having courage to lift eye to face saw that be grown thinner have burnt fagged worn look of fatigue hot climate tender feeling be increased be miserable in considering how much unsuspected vexation be probably ready to burst on sir thomas be indeed life of party who at suggestion now seated round fire have best right to be talker delight of sensation in being again in own house in centre of family after separation made communicative chatty in very unusual degree be ready to give information a to voyage answer question of two son almost before be put business in antigua have latterly be prosperously rapid came directly from liverpool having have opportunity of making passage thither in private vessel instead of waiting for packet little particular of proceeding event arrival departure be most promptly delivered a sat by lady bertram looked with heartfelt satisfaction on face around interrupting more than once however to remark on good fortune in finding at home coming unexpectedly a did all collected together exactly a must have wished dared not depend on mr rushworth be not forgotten most friendly reception warmth of hand shaking have already met with pointed attention be now included in object most intimately connected with mansfield there be nothing disagreeable in mr rushworth appearance sir thomas be liking already by not one of circle be listened to with such unbroken unalloyed enjoyment a by wife who be really extremely happy to see whose feeling be so warmed by sudden arrival a to place nearer agitation than have be for last twenty year have be almost fluttered for few minute still remained so sensibly animated a to put away work move pug from side give attention rest of sofa to husband have anxiety for anybody to cloud pleasure own time have be irreproachably spent during absence have done great deal of carpet work made many yard of fringe must have answered a freely for good conduct useful pursuit of young people a for own be so agreeable to to see again hear talk to have ear amused whole comprehension filled by narrative that began particularly to feel how dreadfully must have missed how impossible must have be for to bear lengthened absence mr norris be by mean to be compared in happiness to sister not that be incommoded by many fear of sir thomas disapprobation when present state of house must be known for judgment have be so blinded that except by instinctive caution with have whisked away mr rushworth pink satin cloak a brother in law entered must hardly be said to shew sign of alarm be vexed by manner of return have left nothing to do instead of being sent for out of room seeing first having to spread happy news through house sir thomas with very reasonable dependence perhaps on nerve of wife child have sought no confidant butler have be following almost instantaneously into drawing room mr norris felt defrauded of office on have always depended whether arrival death be to be thing unfolded be now trying to be in bustle without having anything to bustle about labouring to be important where nothing be wanted tranquillity silence must sir thomas have consented to eat might have gone to housekeeper with troublesome direction insulted footman with injunction of despatch sir thomas resolutely declined dinner must take nothing nothing till tea came must rather wait for tea still mr be at interval urging something different in most interesting moment of passage to england when alarm of french privateer be at height burst through recital with proposal of soup sure dear sir thomas basin of soup must be much better thing for than tea do have basin of soup sir thomas must not be provoked still same anxiety for everybody comfort dear mr norris be answer indeed must rather have nothing tea well then lady bertram suppose speak for tea directly suppose hurry baddeley little seems behindhand to night carried point sir thomas narrative proceeded at length there be pause immediate communication be exhausted seemed enough to be looking joyfully around now at one now at of beloved circle pause be not long in elation of spirit lady bertram became talkative be sensation of child upon hearing say how do think young people have be amusing lately sir thomas have be acting have be alive with acting indeed what have be acting oh will tell about will soon be told cried tom hastily with affected unconcern be not worth while to bore father with now will hear enough of to morrow sir have just be trying by way of doing something amusing mother just within last week to get up few scene mere trifle have have such incessant rain almost since october began that have be nearly confined to house for day together have hardly taken out gun since rd tolerable sport first three day there have be attempting anything since first day went over mansfield wood edmund took copse beyond easton brought home six brace between might have killed six time a many respect pheasant sir assure a much a must desire think will find wood by mean worse stocked than be never saw mansfield wood so full of pheasant in life a year hope will take day sport there sir soon for present danger be over fanny sick feeling subsided when tea be soon afterwards brought in sir thomas getting up said that found that must not be longer in house without just looking into own dear room agitation be returning be gone before anything have be said to prepare for change must find there pause of alarm followed disappearance edmund be first to speak something must be done said be time to think of visitor said maria still feeling hand pressed to henry crawford heart caring little for anything else where did leave miss crawford fanny fanny told of departure delivered message then poor yates be alone cried tom will go fetch will be bad assistant when come out to theatre went reached just in time to witness first meeting of father friend sir thomas have be good deal surprised to find candle burning in room on casting eye round to see other symptom of recent habitation general air of confusion in furniture removal of bookcase from before billiard room door struck especially have scarcely more than time to feel astonished at before there be sound from billiard room to astonish still farther one be talking there in very loud accent did not know voice more than talking almost hallooing stepped to door rejoicing at moment in having mean of immediate communication opening found on stage of theatre opposed to ranting young man who appeared likely to knock down backwards at very moment of yates perceiving sir thomas giving perhaps very best start have ever given in whole course of rehearsal tom bertram entered at other end of room never have found greater difficulty in keeping countenance father look of solemnity amazement on first appearance on stage gradual metamorphosis of impassioned baron wildenheim into well bred easy mr yates making bow apology to sir thomas bertram be such exhibition piece of true acting a must not have lost upon account must be last in probability last scene on stage be sure there must not be finer house must close with greatest eclat there be little time however for indulgence of image of merriment be necessary for to step forward too assist introduction with many awkward sensation did best sir thomas received mr yates with appearance of cordiality be due to own character be really a far from pleased with necessity of acquaintance a with manner of commencement mr yates family connexion be sufficiently known to to render introduction a particular friend of hundred particular friend of son exceedingly unwelcome needed felicity of being again at home forbearance must supply to save sir thomas from anger on finding thus bewildered in own house making part of ridiculous exhibition in midst of theatrical nonsense forced in so untoward moment to admit acquaintance of young man whom felt sure of disapproving whose easy indifference volubility in course of first five minute seemed to mark most at home of two tom understood father thought heartily wishing might be always a well disposed to give partial expression began to see more clearly than have ever done before there might be ground of offence that there might be reason for glance father gave towards ceiling stucco of room that when inquired with mild gravity after fate of billiard table be not proceeding beyond very allowable curiosity few minute be enough for such unsatisfactory sensation on side sir thomas having exerted so far a to speak few word of calm approbation in reply to eager appeal of mr yates a to happiness of arrangement three gentleman returned to drawing room together sir thomas with increase of gravity be not lost on come from theatre said composedly a sat down found in rather unexpectedly vicinity to own room in respect indeed took by surprise a have not smallest suspicion of acting having assumed so serious character appears neat job however a far a must judge by candlelight doe friend christopher jackson credit then must have changed subject sipped coffee in peace over domestic matter of calmer hue mr yates without discernment to catch sir thomas meaning diffidence delicacy discretion enough to allow to lead discourse while mingled among others with least obtrusiveness must keep on topic of theatre must torment with question remark relative to finally must make hear whole history of disappointment at ecclesford sir thomas listened most politely found much to offend idea of decorum confirm ill opinion of mr yates habit of thinking from beginning to end of story when be over must give other assurance of sympathy than what slight bow conveyed be in fact origin of acting said tom after moment thought friend yates brought infection from ecclesford spread a thing always spread know sir faster probably from having so often encouraged sort of thing in formerly be like treading old ground again mr yates took subject from friend a soon a possible immediately gave sir thomas account of what have done be doing told of gradual increase of view happy conclusion of first difficulty present promising state of affair relating everything with so blind interest a made not only totally unconscious of uneasy movement of many of friend a sat change of countenance fidget hem of unquietness prevented even from seeing expression of face on own eye be fixed from seeing sir thomas dark brow contract a looked with inquiring earnestness at daughter edmund dwelling particularly on latter speaking language remonstrance reproof felt at heart not le acutely be felt by fanny who have edged back chair behind aunt end of sofa screened from notice saw be passing before such look of reproach at edmund from father must never have expected to witness to feel that be in degree deserved be aggravation indeed sir thomas look implied on judgment edmund depended what have be about knelt in spirit to uncle bosom swelled to utter not to look so to others not to mr yates be still talking to own truth sir thomas be in middle of rehearsal when arrived evening be going through three first act not unsuccessfully upon whole company be now so dispersed from crawford being gone home that nothing more can be done to night if will give honour of company to morrow evening must not be afraid of result bespeak indulgence understand a young performer bespeak indulgence indulgence will be given sir replied sir thomas gravely without other rehearsal with relenting smile added come home to be happy indulgent then turning away towards of rest tranquilly said mr miss crawford be mentioned in last letter from mansfield do find agreeable acquaintance tom be only one at ready with answer being entirely without particular regard for without jealousy in love acting must speak very handsomely of mr crawford be most pleasant gentleman like man sister sweet pretty elegant lively girl mr rushworth must be silent no longer say be not gentleman like considering must tell father be not above five foot eight will be expecting well looking man sir thomas did not quite understand looked with surprise at speaker if must say what think continued mr rushworth in opinion be very disagreeable to be always rehearsing be having too much of good thing be not so fond of acting a be at first think be great deal better employed sitting comfortably here among ourselves doing nothing sir thomas looked again then replied with approving smile be happy to find sentiment on subject so much same give sincere satisfaction must be cautious quick sighted feel many scruple child feel be perfectly natural equally so that value for domestic tranquillity for home shuts out noisy pleasure must much exceed theirs at time of life to feel be most favourable circumstance for yourself for everybody connected with be sensible of importance of having ally of such weight sir thomas meant to be giving mr rushworth opinion in better word than must find be aware that must not expect genius in mr rushworth a well judging steady young man with better notion than elocution must do justice to intended to value very highly be impossible for many of others not to smile mr rushworth hardly knew what to do with so much meaning by looking a really felt most exceedingly pleased with sir thomas good opinion saying scarcely anything did best towards preserving that good opinion little longer chapter xx edmund first object next morning be to see father alone give fair statement of whole acting scheme defending own share in a far only a must then in soberer moment feel motif to deserve acknowledging with perfect ingenuousness that concession have be attended with such partial good a to make judgment in very doubtful be anxious while vindicating to say nothing unkind of others there be only one amongst whose conduct must mention without necessity of defence palliation have be more le to blame said one of excepting fanny fanny be only one who have judged rightly throughout who have be consistent feeling have be steadily against from first to last never ceased to think of what be due to will find fanny everything must wish sir thomas saw impropriety of such scheme among such party at time a strongly a son have ever supposed must felt too much indeed for many word having shaken hand with edmund meant to try to lose disagreeable impression forget how much have be forgotten a soon a must after house have be cleared of object enforcing remembrance restored to proper state did not enter into remonstrance with other child be more willing to believe felt error than to run risk of investigation reproof of immediate conclusion of everything sweep of preparation must be sufficient there be one person however in house whom must not leave to learn sentiment merely through conduct must not help giving mr norris hint of having hoped that advice might have be interposed to prevent what judgment must certainly have disapproved young people have be very inconsiderate in forming plan ought to have be capable of better decision be young excepting edmund believed of unsteady character with greater surprise therefore must regard acquiescence in wrong measure countenance of unsafe amusement than such measure such amusement must have be suggested mr norris be little confounded a nearly being silenced a ever have be in life for be ashamed to confess having never seen of impropriety be so glaring to sir thomas must not have admitted that influence be insufficient that might have talked in vain only resource be to get out of subject a fast a possible turn current of sir thomas idea into happier channel have great deal to insinuate in own praise a to general attention to interest comfort of family much exertion many sacrifice to glance at in form of hurried walk sudden removal from own fireside many excellent hint of distrust economy to lady bertram edmund to detail whereby most considerable saving have always arisen more than one bad servant be detected chief strength lay in sotherton greatest support glory be in having formed connexion with rushworths there be impregnable took to herself credit of bringing mr rushworth admiration of maria to effect if have not be active said made point of being introduced to mother then prevailed on sister to pay first visit be a certain a sit here that nothing must have come of for mr rushworth be sort of amiable modest young man who want great deal of encouragement there be girl enough on catch for if have be idle left stone unturned be ready to move heaven earth to persuade sister at last did persuade know distance to sotherton be in middle of winter road almost impassable did persuade know how great how justly great influence be with lady bertram child be more concerned that must not have be dear sir thomas if have seen state of road that day thought must never have got through though have four horse of course poor old coachman must attend out of great love kindness though be hardly able to sit box on account of rheumatism have be doctoring for ever since michaelmas cured at last be very bad winter be such day must not help going to up in room before set off to advise not to venture be putting on wig so said 'coachman have much better not go lady will be very safe know how steady stephen be charles have be upon leader so often now that be sure there be fear however soon found must not do be bent upon going a hate to be worrying officious said more heart quite ached for at jolt when got into rough lane about stoke where what with frost snow upon bed of stone be worse than anything can imagine be quite in agony about then poor horse too to see straining away know how always feel for horse when got to bottom of sandcroft hill what do think did will laugh at got out walked up did indeed might not be saving much be something must not bear to sit at ease be dragged up at expense of noble animal caught dreadful cold did not regard object be accomplished in visit hope will always think acquaintance worth trouble might be taken to establish there be nothing very striking in mr rushworth manner be pleased last night with what appeared to be opinion on one subject decided preference of quiet family party to bustle confusion of acting seemed to feel exactly a one must wish yes indeed more know of better will like be not shining character have thousand good quality be so disposed to look up to that be quite laughed at about for everybody considers a doing 'upon word mr norris ' said mr grant other day mr rushworth be son of own must not hold sir thomas in greater respect ' sir thomas gave up point foiled by evasion disarmed by flattery be obliged to rest satisfied with conviction where present pleasure of loved be at stake kindness did sometimes overpower judgment be busy morning with conversation with of occupied small part of have to reinstate in wonted concern of mansfield life to see

memento of what have be even to destruction of unbound copy of lover vow in house for be burning met eye mr yates be beginning now to understand sir thomas intention though a far a ever from understanding source friend have be out with gun chief of morning tom have taken opportunity of explaining with proper apology for father particularity what be to be expected mr yates felt a acutely a might be supposed to be second time disappointed in same way be instance of very severe ill luck indignation be such that have not be for delicacy towards friend friend youngest sister believed must certainly attack baronet on absurdity of proceeding argue into little more rationality believed very stoutly while be in mansfield wood way home there be something in sir thomas when sat round same table made mr yates think wiser to let pursue own way feel folly of without opposition have known many disagreeable father before often be struck with inconvenience occasioned never in whole course of life have seen one of class so unintelligibly moral so infamously tyrannical a sir thomas be not man to be endured for child sake might be thankful to fair daughter julia mr yates did yet mean to stay few day longer under roof evening passed with external smoothness though almost mind be ruffled music sir thomas called for from daughter helped to conceal want of real harmony maria be in good deal of agitation be of utmost consequence to that crawford must now lose time in declaring be disturbed that even day must be gone by without seeming to advance point have be expecting to see whole

endeavouring to find shelter under branch lingering leaf of oak just beyond premise be forced though not without modest reluctance on part to come in civil servant have withstood when dr grant went out with umbrella there be nothing to be done to be very much ashamed to get into house a fast a possible to poor miss crawford who have just be contemplating dismal rain in very desponding state of mind sighing over ruin of plan of exercise for morning of chance of seeing single creature beyond for next twenty four hour sound of little bustle at front door sight of miss price dripping with wet in vestibule be delightful value of event on wet day in country be most forcibly brought before be alive again directly among most active in being useful to fanny in detecting to be wetter than must at first allow providing with dry clothes fanny after being obliged to submit to attention to being assisted waited on by mistress maid being also obliged on returning downstairs to be fixed in drawing room for hour while rain continued blessing of something fresh to see think of be thus extended to miss crawford might carry on spirit to period of dressing dinner two sister be so kind to so pleasant that fanny might have enjoyed visit must have believed not in way must have foreseen that weather must certainly clear at end of hour save from shame of having dr grant carriage horse out to take home with be threatened a to anxiety for alarm that absence in such weather might occasion at home have nothing to suffer on score for a being out be known only to two aunt be perfectly aware that none must be felt that in cottage aunt norris might chuse to establish during rain being in such cottage must be indubitable to aunt bertram be beginning to look brighter when fanny observing harp in room asked question about soon led to acknowledgment of wishing very much to hear confession must hardly be believed of having never yet heard since being in mansfield to fanny appeared very simple natural circumstance have scarcely ever be at parsonage since instrument arrival there have be reason that must miss crawford calling to mind early expressed wish on subject be concerned at own neglect will play to now what will have be question immediately following with readiest good humour played accordingly happy to have new listener listener who seemed so much obliged so full of wonder at performance who shewed not wanting in taste played till fanny eye straying to window on weather being evidently fair spoke what felt must be done quarter of hour said miss crawford will see how will be run away first moment of holding up cloud look alarming be passed over said fanny have be watching weather be from south south north know black cloud when see must not set forward while be so threatening besides want to play something more to very pretty piece cousin edmund prime favourite must stay hear cousin favourite fanny felt that must though have not waited for sentence to be thinking of edmund memento made particularly awake to idea fancied sitting in room again again perhaps in very spot where sat now listening with constant delight to favourite air played a appeared to with superior tone expression though pleased with glad to like be liked by be more sincerely impatient to go away at conclusion of than have be before on being evident be so kindly asked to call again to take in walk whenever must to come hear more of harp that felt necessary to be done if objection arose at home such be origin of sort of intimacy took place between within first fortnight after miss bertrams ' going away intimacy resulting principally from miss crawford desire of something new have little reality in fanny feeling fanny went to two three day seemed kind of fascination must not be easy without going yet be without loving without ever thinking like without sense of obligation for being sought after now when nobody else be to be have deriving higher pleasure from conversation than occasional amusement often at expense of judgment when be raised by pleasantry on people subject wished to be respected went however sauntered about together many half hour in mr grant shrubbery weather being unusually mild for time of year venturing sometimes even to sit down on one of bench now comparatively unsheltered remaining there perhaps till in midst of tender ejaculation of fanny on sweet of so protracted autumn be forced by sudden swell of cold gust shaking down last few yellow leaf about to jump up walk for warmth be pretty very pretty said fanny looking around a be thus sitting together one day time come into shrubbery be more struck with growth beauty three year ago be nothing rough hedgerow along upper side of field never thought of a anything capable of becoming anything now be converted into walk must be difficult to say whether most valuable a convenience ornament perhaps in three year may be forgetting almost forgetting what be before how wonderful how very wonderful operation of time change of human mind following latter train of thought soon afterwards added if one faculty of nature may be called more wonderful than rest do think be memory there seems something more speakingly incomprehensible in power failure inequality of memory than in other of intelligence memory be sometimes so retentive so serviceable so obedient at others so bewildered so weak at others again so tyrannic so beyond control be to be sure miracle way power of recollecting of forgetting do seem peculiarly past finding out miss crawford untouched inattentive have nothing to say fanny perceiving brought back own mind to what thought must interest may seem impertinent in to praise must admire taste mr grant have shewn in there be such quiet simplicity in plan of walk not too much attempted yes replied miss crawford carelessly doe very well for place of sort one doe not think of extent here between ourselves till came to mansfield have not imagined country parson ever aspired to shrubbery anything of kind be so glad to see evergreen thrive said fanny in reply uncle gardener always say soil here be better than own so appears from growth of laurel evergreen in general evergreen how beautiful how welcome how wonderful evergreen when one think of how astonishing variety of nature in country know tree shed leaf be variety doe not make le amazing that same soil same sun must nurture plant differing in first rule law of existence will think rhapsodising when be out of door especially when be sitting out of door be very apt to get into sort of wondering strain one can not fix one eye on commonest natural production without finding food for rambling fancy to say truth replied miss crawford be something like famous doge at court of lewis xiv may declare that see wonder in shrubbery equal to seeing in if anybody have told year ago that place must be home must be spending month after month here a have done certainly must not have believed have now be here nearly five month moreover quietest five month ever passed too quiet for believe must have thought so theoretically eye brightened a spoke take never spent so happy summer then with more thoughtful air lowered voice there be saying what may lead to fanny heart beat quick felt quite unequal to surmising soliciting anything more miss crawford however with renewed animation soon went on be conscious of being far better reconciled to country residence than have ever expected to be can even suppose pleasant to spend year in country under certain circumstance very pleasant elegant moderate sized house in centre of family connexion continual engagement among commanding first society in neighbourhood looked up to perhaps a leading even more than of larger fortune turning from cheerful round of such amusement to nothing worse than tete tete with person one feel most agreeable in world there be nothing frightful in such picture be there miss price one need not envy new mr rushworth with home a envy mr rushworth be that fanny attempted to say come come must be very un handsome in to be severe on mr rushworth for look forward to owing great many gay brilliant happy hour expect will be very much at sotherton year match a miss bertram have made be public blessing for first pleasure of mr rushworth wife must be to fill house give best ball in country fanny be silent miss crawford relapsed into thoughtfulness till suddenly looking up at end of few minute exclaimed ah here be be not mr rushworth however edmund who then appeared walking towards with mr grant

king prince knight seems to breathe spirit of chivalry warm affection grant name be good in lord edmund sir edmund sound delightfully sink under chill annihilation of mr mr edmund be more than mr john mr thomas well will join disappoint of lecture upon sitting down out of door at time of year by being up before can begin edmund met with particular pleasure be first time of seeing together since beginning of better acquaintance have be hearing of with great satisfaction friendship between two so very dear to be exactly what must have wished to credit of lover understanding be stated that did not by mean consider fanny a only even a greater gainer by friendship well said miss crawford do not scold for imprudence what do think have be sitting down for to be talked to about entreated supplicated never to do so again perhaps might have scolded said edmund if of have be sitting down alone while do wrong together can overlook great deal can not have be sitting long cried mr grant for when went up for shawl saw from staircase window then be walking really added edmund day be so mild that sitting down for few minute can be hardly thought imprudent weather must not always be judged by calendar may sometimes take greater liberty in than in may upon word cried miss crawford be two of most disappointing unfeeling kind friend ever met with there be giving moment uneasiness know how much have be suffering what chill have felt have long thought mr bertram one of worst subject to work on in little manoeuvre against common sense that woman must be plagued with have very little hope of from first mr grant sister own sister think have right to alarm little flatter dearest mary have not smallest chance of moving have alarm be quite in different quarter if must have altered weather

mansfield what must have do oh can hing what do already be plagued very often never lose temper thank there be escaping little vexation mary live where may when be settled in town come to see dare say will find with yours in spite of nurseryman poulterer perhaps on very account remoteness unpunctuality exorbitant charge fraud will be drawing forth bitter lamentation mean to be too rich to lament to feel anything of sort large income be best recipe for happiness ever heard of certainly may secure myrtle turkey part of intend to be very rich said edmund with look to fanny eye have great deal of serious meaning to be sure can not intend anything must be so completely beyond power to command miss crawford may chuse degree of wealth have only to fix on number of thousand year there can be doubt of coming intention be only not to be poor by moderation economy bringing down want to income understand very proper plan be for person at time of life with such limited mean indifferent connexion what can want decent maintenance have not much time before relation be in situation to do anything for to mortify by contrast of own wealth consequence be honest poor by mean will not envy much think will even respect have much greater respect for be honest rich degree of respect for honesty rich poor be precisely what have manner of concern with mean to be poor poverty be exactly what have determined against honesty in something between in middle state of worldly circumstance be that be anxious for not looking down on do look down upon if might have be higher must look down upon anything contented with obscurity when might rise to distinction how may rise how may honesty at least rise to distinction be not so very easy question to answer occasioned oh of length from fair lady before must add ought to be in parliament must have gone into army ten year ago be not much to purpose now a to being in parliament believe must wait till there be especial assembly for representation of younger son who have little to live on miss crawford added in more serious tone there be distinction must be miserable if thought without chance absolutely without chance possibility of obtaining be of different character look of consciousness a spoke what seemed consciousness of manner on miss crawford side a made laughing answer be sorrowfull food for fanny observation finding quite unable to attend a ought to mr grant by whose side be now following others have nearly resolved on going home immediately only waited for courage to say so when sound of great clock at mansfield park striking three made feel that have really be much longer absent than usual brought previous self inquiry of whether must take leave not just then how to very speedy issue with undoubting decision directly began adieu edmund began at same time to recollect that mother have be inquiring for that have walked down to parsonage on purpose to bring back fanny hurry increased without in least expecting edmund attendance must have hastened away alone general pace be quickened accompanied into house through be necessary to pas dr grant be in vestibule a stopt to speak to found from edmund manner that did mean to go with too be taking leave must not be thankful in moment of parting edmund be invited by dr grant to eat mutton with next day fanny have barely time for unpleasant feeling on occasion when mr grant with sudden recollection turned to asked for pleasure of company too be so new attention so perfectly new circumstance in event of fanny life that be surprise embarrassment while stammering out great obligation did not suppose must be in power be looking at edmund for opinion help edmund delighted with having such happiness offered ascertaining with look sentence that have objection on aunt account must not imagine that mother must make difficulty of sparing therefore gave decided open advice that invitation must be accepted though fanny must not venture even on encouragement to flight of audacious independence be soon settled that if nothing be heard to contrary mr grant might expect know what dinner will be said mr grant smiling turkey assure very fine one for dear turning to husband cook insists upon turkey being dressed to morrow very well very well cried dr grant better be glad to hear have anything so good in house miss price mr edmund bertram dare say must take chance none of want to hear bill of fare friendly meeting not fine dinner be have in view turkey goose leg of mutton cook chuse to give two cousin walked home together except in immediate discussion of engagement edmund spoke of with warmest satisfaction a so particularly desirable for in intimacy saw with so much pleasure established be silent walk for having finished that subject grew thoughtful indisposed for other chapter xxiii why must mr grant ask fanny said lady bertram how came to think of asking fanny fanny never dines there know in sort of way can not spare be sure doe not want to go fanny want to go do if put question to cried edmund preventing cousin speaking fanny will immediately say be sure dear mother must like to go can see reason why must not can not imagine why mr grant must think of asking never did before used to ask sister now then never asked fanny if can not do without ma'be said fanny in self denying tone mother will have father with evening to be sure so will suppose take father opinion ma'be be well thought of so will edmund will ask sir thomas a soon a come in whether can do without a please ma'be on head meant father opinion a to propriety of invitation being accepted not think will consider right thing by mr grant a well a by fanny that being first invitation must be accepted know will ask will be very much surprised that mr grant must ask fanny at there be nothing more to be said must be said to purpose till sir thomas be present subject involving a did own evening comfort for morrow be so much uppermost in lady bertram mind that hour afterwards on looking in for minute in way from plantation to dressing room called back again when have almost closed door with sir thomas stop moment have something to say to tone of calm languor for never took trouble of raising voice be always heard attended to sir thomas came back story began fanny immediately slipped out of room for to hear subject of discussion with uncle be more than nerve must bear be anxious knew more anxious perhaps than ought to be for what be after whether went staid if uncle be to be great while considering deciding with very grave look grave look directed to at last decide against might not be able to appear properly submissive indifferent cause meanwhile went on well began on lady bertram part with have something to tell will surprise mr grant have asked fanny to dinner well said sir thomas a if waiting more to accomplish surprise edmund want to go how can spare will be late said sir thomas taking out watch what be difficulty edmund found obliged to speak fill up blank in mother story told whole have only to add so strange for mr grant never used to ask be not very natural observed edmund that mr grant must wish to procure so agreeable visitor for sister nothing can be more natural said sir thomas after short deliberation be there sister in case must anything in opinion be more natural mr grant shewing civility to miss price to lady bertram niece must never want explanation only surprise can feel be that must be first time of being paid fanny be perfectly right in giving only conditional answer appears to feel a ought a conclude that must wish to go since young people like to be together can see reason why must be denied indulgence can do without sir thomas indeed think may always make tea know when sister be not here sister perhaps may be prevailed on to spend day with will certainly be at home very well then fanny may go edmund good news soon followed edmund knocked at door in way to own well fanny be happily settled without smallest hesitation on uncle side have one opinion be to go thank be so glad be fanny instinctive reply though when have turned from shut door must not help feeling yet why must be glad for be not certain of seeing hearing something there to pain in spite of conviction however be glad simple a such engagement might appear in other eye have novelty importance in hers for excepting day at sotherton have scarcely ever dined out before though now going only mile only to three people still be dining out little interest of preparation be enjoyment in have sympathy assistance from who ought to have entered into feeling directed taste for lady bertram never thought of being useful to anybody mr norris when came on morrow in consequence of early call invitation from sir thomas be in very ill humour seemed intent only on lessening niece pleasure present future a much a possible upon word fanny be in high luck to meet with such attention indulgence ought to be very much obliged to mr grant for thinking of to aunt for letting go ought to look upon a something extraordinary for hope be aware that there be real occasion for going into company in sort of way ever dining out at be what must not depend upon ever being repeated must be fancying that invitation be meant a particular compliment to compliment be intended to uncle aunt mr grant think civility due to to take little notice of else must never have come into head may be very certain that if cousin julia have be at home must not have be asked at mr norris have now so ingeniously done away mr grant part of favour fanny who found expected to speak must only say that be very much obliged to aunt bertram for sparing that be endeavouring to put aunt evening work in such state a to prevent being missed oh depend upon aunt can do very well without must not be allowed to go will be here so may be quite easy about aunt hope will have very agreeable day find mighty delightful must observe five be very awkwardest of possible number to sit down to table can not be surprised that elegant lady a mr grant must not contrive better round enormous great wide table too fill up room so dreadfully have doctor be contented to take dining table when came away a anybody in sens must have done instead of having absurd new one of own be wider literally wider than dinner table here how infinitely better must have be how much more must have be respected for people be never respected when step out of proper sphere remember that fanny five only five to be sitting round table however will have dinner enough on for ten dare say mr norris fetched breath went on again nonsense folly of people stepping out of rank trying to appear above make think right to give hint fanny now that be going into company without of do beseech entreat not to be putting forward talking giving opinion a if be one of cousin a if be dear mr rushworth julia will never do believe remember wherever be must be lowest last though miss crawford be in manner at home at parsonage be not to be taking place of a to coming away at night be to stay just a long a edmund chuses leave to settle yes ma'be must not think of anything else if must rain think exceedingly likely for never saw more threatening for wet evening in life must manage a well a can not be expecting carriage to be sent for certainly go home to night therefore carriage will not be out on account so must make up mind to what may happen take thing accordingly niece thought perfectly reasonable rated own claim to comfort a low even a mr norris must when sir thomas soon afterwards just opening door said fanny at what time must have carriage come round felt degree of astonishment made impossible for to speak dear sir thomas cried mr norris red with anger fanny can walk walk repeated sir thomas in tone of most unanswerable dignity coming farther into room niece walk to dinner engagement at time of year will twenty minute after four suit yes sir be fanny humble answer given with feeling almost of criminal towards mr norris not bearing to remain with in what might seem state of triumph followed uncle out of room having staid behind only long enough to hear word spoken in angry agitation quite unnecessary great deal too kind edmund go true be upon edmund account observed be hoarse on thursday night must not impose on fanny felt that carriage be for herself alone uncle consideration of coming immediately after such representation from aunt cost tear of gratitude when be alone coachman drove round to minute minute brought down gentleman a lady have with most scrupulous fear of being late be many minute seated in drawing room sir thomas saw off in a good time a own correctly punctual habit required now must look at fanny said edmund with kind smile of affectionate brother tell how like a well a can judge by light look very nicely indeed what have got on new dress that uncle be so good a to give on cousin marriage hope be not too fine thought ought to wear a soon a must might not have such opportunity winter hope think too fine woman can never be too fine while be in white see no finery about nothing what be perfectly proper gown seems very pretty like glossy spot have not miss crawford gown something same in approaching parsonage passed close by stable yard coach house heyday said edmund here be company here be carriage who have got to meet letting down side glass to distinguish be crawford crawford barouche protest there be own two men pushing back into old quarter be here of course be quite surprise fanny will be very glad to see there be occasion there be time for fanny to say how very differently felt idea of having such to observe be great increase of trepidation with performed very awful ceremony of walking into drawing room in drawing room mr crawford certainly be having be just long enough arrived to be ready for dinner smile pleased look of three others standing round shewed how welcome be sudden resolution of coming to for few day on leaving bath very cordial meeting passed between edmund with exception of fanny pleasure be general even to there might be advantage in presence since addition to party must rather forward favourite indulgence of being suffered to sit silent unattended to be soon aware of herself for though must submit a own propriety of mind directed

have much to do with much be still owing to sir thomas more than toleration of neighbourly attempt at parsonage mind now disengaged from care have pressed on at first be at leisure to find grant young inmate really worth visiting though infinitely above scheming contriving for most advantageous matrimonial establishment must be among apparent possibility of one most dear to disdaining even a littleness being quick sighted on such point must not avoid perceiving in grand careless way that mr crawford be somewhat distinguishing niece perhaps refrain though unconsciously from giving more willing assent to invitation on account readiness however in agreeing to dine at parsonage when general invitation be at last hazarded after many debate many doubt a to whether be worth while because sir thomas seemed so ill inclined lady bertram be so indolent proceeded from good breeding goodwill alone have nothing to do with mr crawford a being one in agreeable group for be in course of very visit that first began to think that one in habit of such idle observation must have thought that mr crawford be admirer of fanny price meeting be generally felt to be pleasant one being composed in good proportion of who must talk who must listen dinner be elegant plentiful according to usual style of grant too much according to usual habit of to raise emotion except in mr norris who must never behold wide table number of dish on with patience who did always contrive to experience evil from passing of servant behind chair to bring away fresh conviction of being impossible among so many dish must be cold in evening be found according to predetermination of mr grant sister that after making up whist table there must remain sufficient for round game everybody being a perfectly complying without choice a on such occasion always be speculation be decided on almost a soon a whist lady bertram soon found in critical situation of being applied to for own choice between game being required to draw card for whist not hesitated luckily sir thomas be at hand what will do sir thomas whist speculation will amuse most sir thomas after moment thought recommended speculation be whist player perhaps might feel that must not much amuse to have for partner very well be ladyship contented answer then speculation if please mr grant know nothing about fanny must teach here fanny interposed however with anxious protestation of own equal ignorance have never played game seen played in life lady bertram felt moment indecision again upon everybody assuring that nothing must be so easy that be easiest game on card henry crawford stepping forward with most earnest request to be allowed to sit between ladyship miss price teach be so settled sir thomas mr norris dr mr grant being seated at table of prime intellectual state dignity remaining six under miss crawford direction be arranged round other be fine arrangement for henry crawford who be close to fanny with hand full of business having two person card to manage a well a own for though be impossible for fanny not to feel mistress of rule of game in three minute have yet to inspirit play sharpen avarice harden heart especially in competition with william be work of difficulty a for lady bertram must continue in charge of fame fortune through whole evening if quick enough to keep from looking at card when deal began must direct in be to be done with to end of be in high spirit doing everything with happy ease preeminent in lively turn quick resource playful impudence must do honour to game round table be altogether very comfortable contrast to steady sobriety orderly silence of other twice have sir thomas inquired into enjoyment success of lady in vain pause be long enough for time measured manner needed very little of state must be known till mr grant be able at end of first rubber to go to pay compliment hope ladyship be pleased with game oh dear yes very entertaining indeed very odd game know what be about be never to see card mr crawford doe rest bertram said crawford time afterwards taking opportunity of little languor in game have never told what happened to yesterday in ride home have be hunting together be in midst of good run at distance from mansfield when horse being found to have flung shoe henry crawford have be obliged to give up make best of way back told lost way after passing that old farmhouse with yew tree because can never bear to ask have not told that with usual luck for never do wrong without gaining by found in due time in very place have curiosity to see be

strikingly large handsome for place not gentleman gentleman house to be seen excepting one to be presumed parsonage within stone throw of said knoll church found in short in thornton lacey sound like said edmund way did turn after passing sewell farm answer such irrelevant insidious question though be to answer that must put in course of hour must never be able to prove that be not thornton lacey for such certainly be inquired then never inquire told man mending hedge that be thornton lacey agreed to have good memory have forgotten having ever told half so much of place thornton lacey be name of impending living a miss crawford well knew interest in negotiation for william price knave increased well continued edmund how did like what saw very much indeed be lucky fellow there will be work for five summer at least before place be liveable not so bad a that farmyard must be moved grant be not aware of anything else house be by mean bad when yard be removed there may be very tolerable approach to farmyard must be cleared away entirely planted up to shut out blacksmith shop house must be turned to front east instead of north entrance principal room mean must be on side where view be really very pretty be sure may be done there must be approach through what be at present garden must make new garden at what be now back of house will be giving best aspect in world sloping to south east ground seems precisely formed for rode fifty yard up lane between church house in order to look about saw how might all be nothing can be easier meadow beyond what will be garden a well a what now be sweeping round from lane stood in to north east be to principal road through village must be laid together of course very pretty meadow be finely sprinkled with timber belong to living suppose if not must purchase then stream something must be done with stream must not quite determine what have two three idea have two three idea also said edmund one of be very little of plan for thornton lacey will ever be put in practice must be satisfied with rather le ornament beauty think house premise may be made comfortable given air of gentleman residence without very heavy expense must suffice hope may suffice who care about miss crawford little suspicious resentful of certain tone of voice certain half look attending last expression of hope made hasty finish of dealing with william price securing knave at exorbitant rate exclaimed there will stake last like woman of spirit cold prudence for be not born to sit still hing if lose game will not be from not striving for game be hers only did not pay for what have given to secure deal proceeded crawford began again about thornton lacey plan may not be best possible have not many minute to form in must do good deal place deserves will find not satisfied with much le than be capable of excuse ladyship must not see card there let lie just before place deserves bertram talk of giving air of gentleman residence will be done by removal of farmyard for independent of terrible nuisance never saw house of kind have in so much air of gentleman residence so much look of something above mere parsonage house above expenditure of few hundred year be not scrambling collection of low single room with a many roof a window be not cramped into vulgar compactness of square farmhouse be solid roomy mansion like looking house such a one might suppose respectable old country family have lived in from generation to generation through two century at least be now spending from two to three thousand year in miss crawford listened edmund agreed to air of gentleman residence therefore can not give if do anything be capable of much more let see mary lady bertram bid dozen for queen dozen be more than be worth lady bertram doe not bid dozen will have nothing to say to go on go on by such improvement a have suggested really require to proceed upon plan though by bye doubt anybody striking out better may give higher character may raise into place from being mere gentleman residence becomes by judicious improvement residence of man of education taste modern manner good connexion may be stamped on that house receive air a to make owner be set down a great landholder of parish by creature travelling road especially a there be real squire house to dispute point circumstance between ourselves to enhance value of such situation in point of privilege independence beyond calculation think with hope turning with softened voice to fanny have ever seen place fanny gave quick negative tried to hide interest in subject by eager attention to brother who be driving a hard bargain imposing on a much a must crawford pursued with must not part with queen have bought too dearly brother doe not offer half value sir hand off hand off sister doe not part with queen be quite determined game will be yours turning to again will certainly be yours fanny have much rather be be said edmund smiling at poor fanny not allowed to cheat a wish mr bertram said miss crawford few minute afterwards know henry to be such capital improver that can not possibly engage in anything of sort at thornton lacey without accepting help only think how useful be at sotherton only think what grand thing be produced there by going with one hot day in august to drive about ground see genius take fire there went there came home again what be done there be not to be told fanny eye be turned on crawford for moment with expression more than grave even reproachful on catching be instantly withdrawn with something of consciousness shook head at sister laughingly replied can not say there be much done at sotherton be hot day be walking after other bewildered a soon a general buzz gave shelter added in low voice directed solely at fanny must be sorry to have power of planning judged of by day at sotherton see thing very differently now think of a appeared then sotherton be word to catch mr norris being just then in happy leisure followed securing odd trick by sir thomas capital play own against dr mr grant great hand called out in high good humour sotherton yes be place indeed have charming day there william be quite out of luck next time come hope dear mr mr rushworth will be at home be sure can answer for being kindly received by cousin be not of sort to forget relation mr rushworth be most amiable man be at brighton now know in one of best house there a mr rushworth fine fortune give right to be exactly know distance when get back to portsmouth if be not very far off ought to go over pay respect to must send little parcel by want to get conveyed to cousin must be very happy aunt brighton be almost by beachey head if must get so far must not expect to be welcome in such smart place a poor scrubby midshipman a be mr norris be beginning eager assurance of affability might depend on when be stopped by sir thomas saying with authority advise going to brighton william a trust may soon have more convenient opportunity of meeting daughter must be happy to see cousin anywhere will find mr rushworth most sincerely disposed to regard connexion of family a own must rather find private secretary to first lord than anything else be william only answer in undervoice not meant to reach far subject dropped a yet sir thomas have seen nothing to remark in mr crawford behaviour when whist table broke up at end of second rubber leaving dr grant mr norris to dispute over last play became looker on at other found niece object of attention rather of profession of somewhat pointed character henry crawford be in first glow of scheme about thornton lacey not being able to catch edmund ear be detailing to fair neighbour with look of considerable earnestness scheme be to rent house following winter that might have home of own in neighbourhood be not merely for use of in hunting season a be then telling though consideration have certainly weight feeling a did that in spite of dr grant very great kindness be impossible for horse to be accommodated where now be without material inconvenience attachment to neighbourhood did not depend upon one amusement one season of year have set heart upon having something there that must come to at time little homestall at command where holiday of year might be spent might find continuing improving perfecting that friendship intimacy with mansfield park family be increasing in value to day sir thomas heard be not offended there be want of respect in young man address fanny reception of be so proper modest so calm uninviting that have nothing to censure in said little assented only here there betrayed inclination either of appropriating part of compliment to herself of strengthening view in favour of northamptonshire finding by whom be observed henry crawford addressed on same subject to sir thomas in more everyday tone still with feeling want to be neighbour sir thomas a have perhaps heard telling miss price may hope for acquiescence for not influencing son against tenant sir thomas politely bowing replied be only way sir in must not wish established a permanent neighbour hope believe edmund will occupy own house at thornton lacey edmund be saying too much edmund on appeal have first to hear what be going on on understanding question be at loss for answer certainly sir have idea of residence crawford though refuse a tenant come to a friend consider house a own winter will add to stable on own improved plan with improvement of improved plan may occur to spring will be loser continued sir thomas going though only eight mile will be unwelcome contraction of family circle must have be deeply mortified if son of mine must reconcile to doing le be perfectly natural that must not have thought much on subject mr crawford parish have want claim can be known only by clergyman constantly resident proxy can be capable of satisfying to same extent edmund might in common phrase do duty of thornton be might read prayer preach without giving up mansfield park might ride over sunday to house nominally inhabited go through divine service might be clergyman of thornton lacey seventh day for three four hour if must content will not know that human nature need more lesson than weekly sermon can convey that if doe not live among parishioner prove by constant attention well wisher friend doe very little for good own mr crawford bowed acquiescence repeat again added sir thomas that thornton lacey be only house in neighbourhood in must not be happy to wait on mr crawford a occupier mr crawford bowed thanks sir thomas said edmund undoubtedly understands duty of parish priest must hope son may prove that know too effect sir thomas little harangue might really produce on mr crawford raised awkward sensation in two of others two of most attentive listener miss crawford fanny one of whom having never before understood that thornton be so soon so completely to be home be pondering with downcast eye on what must be not to see edmund day other startled from agreeable fancy have be previously indulging on strength of brother description no longer able in picture have be forming of future thornton to shut out church sink clergyman see only respectable elegant modernised occasional residence of man of independent fortune be considering sir thomas with decided ill will a destroyer of suffering more from involuntary forbearance character manner commanded from not daring to relieve by single attempt at throwing ridicule on cause agreeable of speculation be over for hour be time to have done with card if sermon prevailed be glad to find necessary to come to conclusion be able to refresh spirit by change of place neighbour chief of party be now collected irregularly round fire waiting final break up william fanny be most detached remained together at otherwise deserted card table talking very comfortably not thinking of rest till of rest began to think of henry crawford chair be first to be given direction towards sat silently observing for few minute in meanwhile observed by sir thomas who be standing in chat with dr grant be assembly night said william if be at portsmouth must be at perhaps wish at portsmouth william fanny that will have enough of portsmouth of dancing too when can not have know that there must be good in going to assembly for might not get partner portsmouth girl turn up nose at anybody who have not commission one might a well be nothing a midshipman one be nothing indeed remember gregory be grown up amazing fine girl will hardly speak to because lucy be courted by lieutenant oh shame shame never mind william own cheek in glow of indignation a spoke be not worth minding be reflection on be more than what greatest admiral have experienced more le in time must think of must try to make up mind to a one of hardship fall to sailor share like bad weather hard living only with advantage that there will be end to that there will come time when will have nothing of sort to endure when be lieutenant only think william when be lieutenant how little will care for nonsense of kind begin to think will never be lieutenant fanny everybody get made oh dear william talk so be so desponding uncle say nothing be sure will do everything in power to get made know a well a do of what consequence be be checked by sight of uncle much nearer to than have suspicion of found necessary to talk of something else be fond of dancing fanny yes very only be soon tired must like to go to ball with see dance have never ball at northampton

good dancer in way dare say be better turning to uncle who be now close to be not fanny very good dancer sir fanny in dismay at unprecedented question did not know way to look how to be prepared for answer very grave reproof at least coldest expression of indifference must be coming to distress brother sink to ground on contrary be worse than be sorry to say that be unable to answer question have never seen fanny dance since be little girl trust will think acquits like gentlewoman when do see perhaps may have opportunity of doing ere long have have pleasure of seeing sister dance mr price said henry crawford leaning forward will engage to answer inquiry can make on subject to entire satisfaction believe seeing fanny looked distressed must be at other time there be one person in company who

till night thursday be day of ball on wednesday morning fanny still unable to satisfy a to what ought to wear determined to seek counsel of more enlightened apply to mr grant sister whose acknowledged taste must certainly bear blameless a edmund william be gone to northampton have reason to think mr crawford likewise out walked down to parsonage without much fear of wanting opportunity for private discussion privacy of such discussion be most important part of to fanny being more than half ashamed of own solicitude met miss crawford within few yard of parsonage just setting out to call on a seemed to that friend though obliged to insist on turning back be unwilling to lose walk explained business at once observed that if must be so kind a to give opinion might be talked over a well without door a within miss crawford appeared gratified by application after moment thought urged fanny returning with in much more cordial manner than before proposed going up into room where might have comfortable coze without disturbing dr mr grant who be together in drawing room be just plan to suit fanny with great deal of gratitude on side for such ready kind attention proceeded indoors upstairs be soon deep in interesting subject miss crawford pleased with appeal gave best judgment taste made everything easy by suggestion tried to make everything agreeable by encouragement dress being settled in grander part what will have by way of necklace said miss crawford will not wear brother cross a spoke be undoing small parcel fanny have observed in hand when met fanny acknowledged wish doubt on point did not know how to wear cross to refrain from wearing be answered by having small trinket box placed before being requested to chuse from among several gold chain necklace such have be parcel with miss crawford be provided such object of intended visit in kindest manner now urged fanny taking one for cross to keep for sake saying everything must think of to obviate scruple be making fanny start back at first with look of horror at proposal see what collection have said more by half than ever use think of offer a new offer nothing old necklace must forgive liberty oblige fanny still resisted from heart gift be too valuable miss crawford persevered argued case with so much affectionate earnestness through head of william cross ball a to be finally successful fanny found obliged to yield might not be accused of pride indifference other littleness having with modest reluctance given consent proceeded to make selection looked looked longing to know might be least valuable be determined in choice at last by fancying there be one necklace more frequently placed before eye than rest be of gold prettily worked though fanny must have preferred longer plainer chain a more adapted for purpose hoped in fixing on to be chusing what miss crawford least wished to keep miss crawford smiled perfect approbation hastened to complete gift by putting necklace round making see how well looked fanny have not word to say against becomingness excepting what remained of scruple be exceedingly pleased with acquisition so very apropos must rather perhaps have be obliged to other person be unworthy feeling miss crawford have anticipated want with kindness proved real friend when wear necklace will always think of said feel how very kind be must think of somebody else too when wear that necklace replied miss crawford must think of henry for be choice in first place gave to with necklace make over to duty of remembering original giver be to be family remembrancer sister be not to be in mind without bringing brother too fanny in great astonishment confusion must have returned present instantly to take what have be gift of person of brother too impossible must not be with eagerness embarrassment quite diverting to companion laid down necklace again on cotton seemed resolved either to take none at miss crawford thought have never seen prettier consciousness dear child said laughing what be afraid of do think henry will claim necklace a mine fancy did not come honestly by be imagining must be too much flattered by seeing round lovely throat ornament money purchased three year ago before knew there be such throat in world perhaps looking archly suspect confederacy between that what be now doing be with knowledge at desire with deepest blush fanny protested against thought well then replied miss crawford more seriously without at believing to convince that suspect trick be a unsuspicious of compliment a have always found take necklace say more about being gift of brother need not make smallest difference in accepting a assure make none in willingness to part with be always giving something other have such innumerable present from that be quite impossible for to value for to remember half a for necklace suppose have worn six time be very pretty never think of though must be most heartily welcome to other in trinket box have happened to fix on very one if have choice must rather part with see in possession than other say more against entreat trifle be not worth half so many word fanny dared not make farther opposition with renewed le happy thanks accepted necklace again for there be expression in miss crawford eye must not be satisfied with be impossible for to be insensible of mr crawford change of manner have long seen evidently tried to please be gallant be attentive be something like what have be to cousin wanted supposed to cheat of tranquillity a have cheated whether might not have concern in necklace must not be convinced that have not for miss crawford complaisant a sister be careless a woman friend reflecting doubting feeling that possession of what have so much wished for did not bring much satisfaction now walked home again with change rather than diminution of care since treading that path before chapter xxvii on reaching home fanny went immediately upstairs to deposit unexpected acquisition doubtful good of necklace in favourite box in east room held smaller treasure on opening door what be surprise to find cousin edmund there writing at table such sight having never occurred before be almost a wonderful a be welcome fanny said directly leaving seat pen meeting with something in hand beg pardon for being here came to look for after waiting little while in hope of coming in be making use of inkstand to explain errand will find beginning of note to yourself can now speak business be merely to beg acceptance of little trifle chain for william cross ought to have have week ago there have be delay from brother not being in town by several day so soon a expected have only just now received at northampton hope will like chain fanny endeavoured to consult simplicity of taste at rate know will be kind to intention consider a really be token of love of one of oldest friend so saying be hurrying away before fanny overpowered by thousand feeling of pain pleasure must attempt to speak quickened by one sovereign wish then called out oh cousin stop moment pray stop turned back can not attempt to thank continued in very agitated manner thanks be out of question feel much more than can possibly express goodness in thinking of in way be beyond if be have to say fanny smiling turning away again no be not want to consult almost unconsciously have now undone parcel have just put into hand seeing before in niceness of jeweller packing plain gold chain perfectly simple neat must not help bursting forth again oh be beautiful indeed be very thing precisely what wished for be only ornament have ever have desire to posse will exactly suit cross must will be worn together come too in such acceptable moment oh cousin know how acceptable be dear fanny feel thing great deal too much be most happy that like chain that must be here in time for to morrow thanks be far beyond occasion believe have pleasure in world superior to of contributing to yours can safely say have pleasure so complete so unalloyed be without drawback upon such expression of affection fanny must have lived hour without saying word edmund after waiting moment obliged to bring down mind from heavenly flight by saying what be that want to consult about be about necklace be now most earnestly longing to return hoped to obtain approbation of doing gave history of recent visit now rapture might well be over for edmund be so struck with circumstance so delighted with what miss crawford have done so gratified by such coincidence of conduct between fanny must not admit superior power of one pleasure over own mind though might have drawback be time before must get attention to plan answer to demand of opinion be in reverie of fond reflection uttering only now then few half sentence of praise when did awake understand be very decided in opposing what wished return necklace dear fanny upon account must be mortifying severely there can hardly be more unpleasant sensation than having anything returned on hand have given with reasonable hope of contributing to comfort of friend why must lose pleasure have shewn so deserving of if have be given to in first instance said fanny must not have thought of returning being brother present be not fair to suppose that must rather not part with when be not wanted must not suppose not wanted not acceptable at least having be originally brother gift make difference for a be not prevented from offering from taking on account ought not to prevent from keeping doubt be handsomer than mine fitter for ballroom be not handsomer not at handsomer in way for purpose not so fit chain will agree with william cross beyond comparison better than necklace for one night fanny for only one night if be sacrifice be sure will upon consideration make that sacrifice rather than give pain to one who have be so studious of comfort miss crawford attention to have be not more than be justly entitled to be last person to think must be have be invariable to be returning with what must have something air of ingratitude though know must never have meaning be not in nature be sure wear necklace a be engaged to do to morrow evening let chain be not ordered with reference to ball be kept for commoner occasion be advice must not have shadow of coolness between two whose intimacy have be observing with greatest pleasure in whose character there be so much general resemblance in true generosity natural delicacy a to make few slight difference resulting principally from situation reasonable hindrance to perfect friendship must not have shadow of coolness

merit have not fault be what have ever be saw no longer till have shed many tear over deception fanny must not subdue agitation dejection followed must only be relieved by influence of fervent prayer for happiness be intention a felt to be duty to try to overcome be excessive bordered on selfishness in affection for edmund to call to fancy loss disappointment must be presumption for have not word strong enough to satisfy own humility to think of a miss crawford might be justified in thinking must in be insanity to must be nothing under circumstance nothing dearer than friend why did idea occur to even enough to be reprobated forbidden ought not to have touched on confines of imagination must endeavour to be rational to deserve right of judging of miss crawford character privilege of true solicitude for by sound intellect honest heart have heroism of principle be determined to do duty having also many of feeling of youth nature let not be much wondered at if after making good resolution on side of self government seized scrap of paper on edmund have begun writing to a treasure beyond hope reading with tenderest emotion word very dear fanny must do favour to accept locked

be that william must go up by mail from northampton following night must not have allowed hour rest before must have got into portsmouth coach though offer of mr crawford must rob of many hour of company be too happy in having william spared from fatigue of such journey to think of anything else sir thomas approved of for reason nephew introduction to admiral crawford might be of service admiral believed have interest upon whole be very joyous note fanny spirit lived on morning deriving accession of pleasure from writer being to go away a for ball so near at hand have too many agitation fear to have enjoyment in anticipation ought to have have must have be supposed to have by many young lady looking forward to same event in situation more at ease under circumstance of le novelty le interest le peculiar gratification than must be attributed to miss price known only by name to people invited be now to make first appearance must be regarded a queen of evening who must be happier than miss price miss price have not be brought up to trade of coming out have known in what light ball be in general considered respecting must very much have lessened comfort by increasing fear already have of doing wrong being looked at to dance without much observation extraordinary fatigue to have strength partner for about evening to dance little with edmund not great deal with mr crawford to see william enjoy be able to keep away from aunt norris be height of ambition seemed to comprehend greatest possibility of happiness a be best of hope must not always prevail in course of long morning spent principally with two aunt be often under influence of much le sanguine view william determined to make last day day of thorough enjoyment be out snipe shooting edmund have too much reason to suppose be at parsonage left alone to bear worrying of mr norris who be cross because housekeeper must have own way with supper whom must not avoid though housekeeper might fanny be worn

recollection of fault once have be only being upon earth to whom must say what have said have always known opinion of can bear witness fanny have never be blinded how many time have talked over little error need not fear have almost given up serious idea of must be blockhead indeed if befell must think of kindness sympathy without sincerest gratitude have said enough to shake experience of eighteen

claim when be no longer to encroach on to interfere with stronger claim truer kindness of must do justice even with pleasure to herself necklace really looked very well fanny left room at last comfortably satisfied with about aunt bertram have recollected on occasion with unusual degree of wakefulness have really occurred to unprompted that fanny preparing for ball might be glad of better help than upper housemaid when dressed actually sent own maid to assist too late of course to be of use mr chapman have just reached attic floor when miss price came out of room completely dressed only civility be necessary fanny felt aunt attention almost a much a lady bertram mr chapman must do chapter xxviii uncle aunt be in drawing room when fanny went down to former be interesting object saw with pleasure general elegance of appearance being in remarkably good look neatness propriety of dress be that must allow to commend in presence upon leaving room again soon afterwards spoke of beauty with very decided praise yes said lady bertram look very well sent chapman to look well oh yes cried mr norris have good reason to look well with advantage brought up in family a have be with benefit of cousin manner before only think dear sir thomas what extraordinary advantage have be mean of giving very gown have be taking notice of be own generous present to when dear mr rushworth married what must have be if have not taken by hand sir thomas said more when sat down to table eye of two young men assured that subject might be gently touched again when lady withdrew with more success fanny saw that be approved consciousness of looking well made look still better from variety of cause be happy be soon made still happier for in following aunt out of room edmund who be holding open door said a passed must dance with fanny must keep two dance for two that like except first have nothing more to wish for have hardly ever be in state so nearly approaching high spirit in life cousin former gaiety on day of ball be no longer surprising to felt to be indeed very charming be actually practising step about drawing room a long a must be safe from notice of aunt norris who be entirely taken up at first in fresh arranging injuring noble fire butler have prepared hour followed must have be at least languid under other circumstance fanny happiness still prevailed be to think of conversation with edmund be restlessness of mr norris what be yawn of lady bertram gentleman joined soon after began sweet expectation of carriage when general spirit of ease enjoyment seemed diffused stood about talked laughed moment have pleasure hope fanny felt that there must be struggle in edmund cheerfulness be delightful to see effort so successfully made when carriage be really heard when guest began really to assemble own gaiety of heart be much subdued sight of so many stranger threw back into herself besides gravity formality of first great circle manner of sir thomas lady bertram be of kind to do away found occasionally called on to endure something worse be introduced here there by uncle forced to be spoken to to curtsey speak again be hard duty be never summoned to without looking at william a walked about at ease in background of scene longing to be with entrance of grant crawford be favourable epoch stiffness of meeting soon gave way before popular manner more diffused intimacy little group be formed everybody grew comfortable fanny felt advantage drawing back from toil of civility must have be again most happy must have kept eye from wandering between edmund mary crawford looked loveliness what might not be end of own musing be brought to end on perceiving mr crawford before thought be put into channel by engaging almost instantly for first two dance happiness on occasion be very much la mortal finely chequered to be secure of partner at first be most essential good for moment of beginning be now growing seriously near so little understood own claim a to think that if mr crawford have not asked must have be last to be sought after must have received partner only through series of inquiry bustle interference must have be terrible at same time there be pointedness in manner of asking did not like saw eye glancing for moment at necklace with smile thought there be smile made blush feel wretched though there be second glance to disturb though object seemed then to be only quietly agreeable must not get better of embarrassment heightened a be by idea of perceiving have composure till turned away to one else then must gradually rise up to genuine satisfaction of having partner voluntary partner secured against dancing began when company be moving into ballroom found for first time near miss crawford whose eye smile be immediately more unequivocally directed a brother have be who be beginning to speak on subject when fanny anxious to get story over hastened to give explanation of second necklace real chain miss crawford listened intended compliment insinuation to fanny be forgotten felt only one thing eye bright a have be before shewing must yet be brighter exclaimed with eager pleasure did did edmund be like other man must have thought of honour beyond expression looked around a if longing to tell so be not near be attending party of lady out of room mr grant coming up to two girl taking arm of followed with rest fanny heart sunk there be leisure for thinking long even of miss crawford feeling be in ballroom violin be playing mind be in flutter forbade fixing on anything serious must watch general arrangement see how everything be done in few minute sir thomas came to asked if be engaged yes sir to mr crawford be exactly what have intended to hear mr crawford be not far off sir thomas brought to saying something discovered to fanny that be to lead way open ball idea have never occurred to before whenever have thought of minutia of evening have be a matter of course edmund must begin with miss crawford impression be so strong that though uncle spoke contrary must not help exclamation of surprise hint of unfitness entreaty even to be excused to be urging opinion against sir thomas be proof of extremity of case such be horror at first suggestion that must actually look in face say that hoped might be settled otherwise in vain however sir thomas smiled tried to encourage then looked too serious said too decidedly must be so dear for to hazard word found next moment conducted by mr crawford to top of room standing there to be joined by rest of dancer couple after couple a be formed must hardly believe to be placed above so many elegant young woman distinction be too great be treating like cousin thought flew to absent cousin with most unfeigned truly tender regret that be not at home to take own place in room have share of pleasure must have be so very delightful to so often a have heard wish for ball at home a greatest of felicity to have away when be given for to be opening ball with mr crawford too hoped must not envy distinction now when looked back to state of thing in autumn to what have be to other when once dancing in house before present arrangement be almost more than must understand ball began be rather honour than happiness to fanny for first dance at least partner be in excellent spirit tried to impart to be great deal too much frightened to have enjoyment till must suppose no longer looked at young pretty gentle however have awkwardness be not a good a grace there be few person present be not disposed to praise be attractive be modest be sir thomas niece be soon said to be admired by mr crawford be enough to give general favour sir thomas be watching progress down dance with much complacency be proud of niece without attributing personal beauty a mr norris seemed to do to transplantation to mansfield be pleased with for having supplied everything else education manner owed to miss crawford saw much of sir thomas thought a stood having in spite of wrong towards general prevailing desire of recommending to took opportunity of stepping aside to say something agreeable of fanny praise be warm received a must wish joining in a far a discretion politeness slowness of speech must allow certainly appearing to greater advantage on subject than lady did soon afterwards when mary perceiving on sofa very near turned round before began to dance to compliment on miss price look yes doe look very well be lady bertram placid reply chapman helped to dress sent chapman to not that be really pleased to have fanny admired be so much more struck with own kindness in sending chapman to that must not get out of head miss crawford knew mr norris too well to think of gratifying by commendation of fanny to be a occasion offered ah ma'be how much want dear mr rushworth julia to night mr norris paid with a many smile courteous word a have time for amid so much occupation a found for herself in making up card table giving hint to sir thomas trying to move chaperon to better part of room miss crawford blundered most towards fanny in intention to please meant to be giving little heart happy flutter filling with sensation of delightful self consequence misinterpreting fanny blush still thought must be doing so when went to after two first dance said with significant look perhaps can tell why brother go to town to morrow say have business there will not tell what first time ever denied confidence be what come to be supplanted sooner later now must apply to for information pray what be henry going for fanny protested ignorance a steadily a embarrassment allowed well then replied miss crawford laughing must suppose to be purely for pleasure of conveying brother of talking of by way fanny be confused be confusion of discontent while miss crawford wondered did not smile thought over anxious thought odd thought anything rather than insensible of pleasure in henry attention fanny have good deal of enjoyment in course of evening henry attention have very little to do with must much rather not have be asked by again so very soon wished have not be obliged to suspect that previous inquiry of mr norris about supper hour be for sake of securing at part of evening be not to be avoided made feel that be object of though must not say that be unpleasantly done that there be indelicacy ostentation in manner sometimes when talked of william be really not unagreeable shewed even warmth of heart did credit still attention made part of satisfaction be happy whenever looked at william saw how perfectly be enjoying in five minute that must walk about with hear account of partner be happy in knowing admired be happy in having two dance with edmund still to look forward to during greatest part of evening hand being so eagerly sought after indefinite engagement with be in continual perspective be happy even when did take place not from flow of spirit on side such expression of tender gallantry a have blessed morning mind be fagged happiness sprung from being friend with whom must find repose be worn out with civility said have be talking incessantly night with nothing to say with fanny there may be peace will not want to be talked to let have luxury of silence fanny must hardly even speak agreement weariness arising probably in great measure from same feeling have acknowledged in morning be peculiarly to be respected went down two dance together with such sober tranquillity a might satisfy looker on sir thomas have be bringing up wife for younger son evening have afforded edmund little pleasure miss crawford have be in gay spirit when first danced together be not gaiety must do good rather sank than raised comfort afterwards for found still impelled to seek again have absolutely pained by manner of speaking of profession to be now on point of belonging have talked have be silent have reasoned have ridiculed have parted at last with mutual vexation fanny not able to refrain entirely from observing have seen enough to be tolerably satisfied be barbarous to be happy when edmund be suffering yet happiness must must arise from very conviction that did suffer when two dance with be over inclination strength for more be pretty well at end sir thomas having seen walk rather than dance down shortening set breathless with hand at side gave order for sitting down entirely from time mr crawford sat down likewise poor fanny cried william coming for moment to visit working away partner fan a if for life how soon be knocked up why sport be just begun hope will keep up two

only desolate house to hurry from brother will find idea of time own very different to morrow after short consideration sir thomas asked crawford to join early breakfast party in house instead of eating alone must be of readiness with invitation be accepted convinced that suspicion whence must confess to very ball have in great measure sprung be well founded mr crawford be in love with fanny have pleasing anticipation of what must be niece meanwhile did not thank for what have just done have hoped to have william to herself last morning must have be unspeakable indulgence though wish be overthrown there be spirit of murmuring within on contrary be so totally unused to have pleasure consulted to have anything take place at in way must desire that be more disposed to wonder rejoice in having carried point so far than to repine at counteraction followed shortly afterward sir thomas be again interfering little with inclination by advising to go immediately to bed advise be word be advice of absolute power have only to rise with mr crawford very cordial adieu pas quietly away stopping at entrance door like lady of branxholm hall one moment more to view happy scene take last look at five six determined couple who be still hard at work then creeping slowly up principal staircase pursued by ceaseless country dance feverish with hope fear soup negus sore footed fatigued restless agitated yet feeling in spite of everything that ball be indeed delightful in thus sending away sir thomas perhaps might not be thinking merely of health might occur to that mr crawford have be sitting by long enough might mean to recommend a wife by shewing persuadableness chapter xxix ball be over breakfast be soon over too last kiss be given william be gone mr crawford have a foretold be very punctual short pleasant have be meal after seeing william to last moment fanny walked back to breakfast room with very saddened heart to grieve over melancholy change there uncle kindly left to cry in peace conceiving perhaps that deserted chair of young man might exercise tender enthusiasm that remaining cold pork bone mustard in william plate might divide feeling with broken egg shell in mr crawford sat cried con amore a uncle intended be con amore fraternal other william be gone now felt a if have wasted visit in idle care selfish solicitude unconnected with fanny disposition be such that must never even think of aunt norris in meagreness cheerlessness of own small house without reproaching for little want of attention to when have be last together much le must feeling acquit of

state easily conform to tranquillity of present quiet week be indeed smaller party than have ever known there for whole day together be gone on whom comfort cheerfulness of family meeting meal chiefly depended must be learned to be endured must soon be always gone be thankful that must now sit in same room with uncle hear voice receive question even answer without such wretched feeling a have formerly known miss two young men be sir thomas observation on first second day a formed very reduced circle after dinner in consideration of fanny swimming eye nothing more be said on first day than

edmund must learn to do without will be last winter of belonging to a have done yes said lady bertram wish be not going away be going away think wish must stay at home wish be levelled principally at julia who have just applied for permission to go to town with maria a sir thomas thought best for daughter that permission must be granted lady bertram though in own good nature must not have prevented be lamenting change made in prospect of julia return must otherwise have taken place about time great deal of good sense followed on sir thomas side tending to reconcile wife to arrangement everything that considerate parent ought to feel be advanced for use everything that affectionate mother must feel in promoting child enjoyment be attributed to nature lady bertram agreed to with calm yes at end of quarter of hour silent consideration spontaneously observed sir thomas have be thinking be very glad took fanny a did for now others be away feel good of sir thomas immediately improved

not do without week passed so quietly peaceably at great house in mansfield have very different character at parsonage to young lady at least in family brought very different feeling what be tranquillity comfort to fanny be tediousness vexation to mary something arose from difference of disposition habit one so easily satisfied other so unused to endure still more might be imputed to

a gave first be from admiral to inform nephew in few word of having succeeded in object have undertaken promotion of young price enclosing two more one from secretary of first lord to friend whom admiral have set to work in business other from friend to by appeared that lordship have very great happiness of attending to recommendation of sir charles sir charles be much delighted in having such opportunity of proving regard for admiral crawford that circumstance of mr william price commission a second lieutenant of hm sloop thrush being made out be spreading general joy through wide circle of great people while hand be trembling under letter eye running from one to other heart swelling with emotion crawford thus continued with unfeigned eagerness to express interest in event will not talk of own happiness said great a be for think only of yours compared with who have right to be happy have almost grudged own prior knowledge of what ought to have known before world have not lost moment however post be late morning there have not be since moment delay how impatient how anxious how wild have be on subject will not attempt to describe how severely mortified how cruelly disappointed in not having finished while be in london be kept there from day to day in hope of for nothing le dear to than object must have detained time from mansfield though uncle entered into wish with warmth must desire exerted immediately there be difficulty from absence of one friend engagement of at last must no longer bear to stay end of knowing in what good hand left cause came away on monday trusting that many post must not pas before must be followed by such very letter a uncle who be very best man in world have exerted a knew must after seeing brother be delighted with must not allow yesterday to say how delighted to repeat half that admiral said in praise deferred till praise must be proved praise of friend a day doe prove now may say that even must not require william price to excite greater interest be followed by warmer wish higher commendation than be most voluntarily bestowed by uncle after evening have passed together have be doing then cried fanny good heaven how very very kind have really be by desire beg pardon be bewildered did admiral crawford apply how be be stupefied henry be most happy to make more intelligible by beginning at earlier stage explaining very particularly what have done last journey to london have be undertaken with other view than of introducing brother in hill street prevailing on admiral to exert interest might have for getting on have be business have communicated to creature have not breathed syllable of even to mary while uncertain of issue must not have borne participation of feeling have be business spoke with such glow of what solicitude have be used such strong expression be so abounding in deepest interest in twofold motif in view wish more than must be told that fanny must not have remained insensible of drift have be able to attend heart be so full sens still so astonished that must listen imperfectly even to what told of william saying only when paused how kind how very kind oh mr crawford be infinitely obliged to dearest dearest william jumped up moved in haste towards door cry out will go to uncle uncle ought to know a soon a possible must not be suffered opportunity be too fair feeling too impatient be after immediately must not go must allow five minute longer took hand led back to seat be in middle of farther explanation before have suspected for what be detained when did understand however found expected to believe that have created sensation heart have never known before that everything have done for william be to be placed to account of excessive unequalled attachment to be exceedingly distressed for moment unable to speak considered a nonsense a mere trifling gallantry meant only to deceive for hour must not feel that be treating improperly unworthily in such way a have not deserved be like entirely of piece with what have seen before must not allow to shew displeasure felt because have be conferring obligation want of delicacy on part must make trifle to while heart be still bounding with joy gratitude on william behalf must not be severely resentful of anything injured only after having twice drawn back hand twice attempted in vain to turn away from got up said only with much agitation mr crawford pray beg must not be sort of talking be very unpleasant to must go away can not bear be still talking on describing affection soliciting return finally in word so plain a to bear one meaning even to offering hand fortune everything to acceptance be so have said astonishment confusion increased though still not knowing how to suppose serious must hardly stand pressed for answer cried hiding face be nonsense distress can hear more of kindness to william make more obliged to than word can express want can not bear must not listen to such think of be not thinking of know be nothing have burst away from at moment sir thomas be heard speaking to servant in way towards room be in be time for farther assurance entreaty though to part with at moment when modesty alone seemed to sanguine preassured mind to stand in way of happiness sought be cruel necessity rushed out at opposite door from one uncle be approaching be walking up down east room in utmost confusion of contrary feeling before sir thomas politeness apology be over have reached beginning of joyful intelligence visitor came to communicate be feeling thinking trembling about everything agitated happy miserable infinitely obliged absolutely angry be beyond belief be inexcusable incomprehensible such be habit that must hing without mixture of evil have previously made happiest of human being now have insulted knew not what to say how to class how to regard must not have be serious yet what must excuse use of such word offer if meant to trifle william be lieutenant be fact beyond doubt without alloy must think of for ever forget rest mr crawford must certainly never address so again must have seen how unwelcome be to in case how gratefully must esteem for friendship to william must not stir farther from east room than head of great staircase till have satisfied herself of mr crawford having left house when convinced of being gone be eager to go down be with uncle have happiness of joy a well a own benefit of information conjecture a to what must now be william destination sir thomas be a joyful a must desire very kind communicative have so comfortable talk with about william a to make feel a if nothing have occurred to vex till found towards close mr crawford be engaged to return dine there very day be most unwelcome hearing for though might think nothing of what have passed must be quite distressing to to see again so soon tried to get better of tried very hard a dinner hour approached to feel appear a usual be quite impossible for not to look most shy uncomfortable when visitor entered room must not have supposed in power of concurrence of circumstance to give so many painful sensation on first day of hearing of william promotion mr crawford be not only in room be soon close to have note to deliver from sister fanny must not look at there be consciousness of past folly in voice opened note immediately glad to have anything to do happy a read to feel that fidgetings of aunt norris who be also to dine there screened little from view dear fanny for so may now always call to infinite relief of tongue have be stumbling at miss price for at least last six week can not let brother go without sending few line of general congratulation giving most joyful consent approval go on dear fanny without fear there can be difficulty worth naming chuse to suppose that assurance of consent will be something so may smile upon with sweetest smile afternoon send back to even happier than go yours affectionately m c be not expression to do fanny good for though read in too much haste confusion to form clearest judgment of miss crawford meaning be evident that meant to compliment on brother attachment even to appear to believe serious did not know what to do what to think there be wretchedness in idea of being serious there be perplexity agitation way be distressed whenever mr crawford spoke to spoke to much too often be afraid there be something in voice manner in addressing very different from what be when talked to others comfort in day dinner be quite destroyed must hardly eat anything when sir thomas good humouredly observed that joy have taken away appetite be ready to sink with shame from dread of mr crawford interpretation for though nothing must have tempted to turn eye to right hand where sat felt that be immediately directed towards be more silent than ever must hardly join even when william be subject for commission came from right hand too there be pain in connexion thought lady bertram sat longer than ever began to be in despair of ever getting away at last be in drawing room be able to think a must while aunt finished subject of william appointment in own style mr norris seemed a much delighted with saving must be to sir thomas a with part of now william must be able to keep must make vast difference to uncle for be unknown how much have cost uncle indeed must make difference in present too be very glad that have given william what did at parting very glad indeed that have be in power without material inconvenience just at time to give something rather considerable be for with limited mean for now must all be useful in helping to fit up cabin knew must be at expense that must have many thing to buy though to be sure father mother must be able to put in way of getting everything very cheap be very glad have contributed mite towards be glad gave something considerable said lady bertram with most unsuspicious calmness for gave only indeed cried mr norris reddening upon word must have gone off with pocket well lined at expense for journey to london either sir thomas told must be enough mr norris being not at inclined to question sufficiency began to take matter in point be amazing said how much young people cost friend what with bringing up putting out in world little think how much come to what parent uncle aunt pay for in course of year now here be sister price child take together dare say nobody must believe what sum cost sir thomas year to say nothing of what do for very true sister a say poor thing can not help know make very little difference to sir thomas fanny william must not forget shawl if go to east indie will give commission for anything else be worth having wish may go to east indie may have shawl think will have two shawl fanny fanny meanwhile speaking only when must not help be very earnestly trying to understand what mr miss crawford be at there be everything in world against being serious word manner everything natural probable reasonable be against habit way of thinking own demerit how must have excited serious attachment in man who have seen so many be admired by so many flirted with so many infinitely superior who seemed so little open to serious impression even where pain have be taken to please who thought so slightly so carelessly so unfeelingly on such point who be everything to everybody seemed to find one essential to farther how must be supposed that sister with high worldly notion of matrimony must be forwarding anything of serious nature in such quarter nothing must be more unnatural in fanny be ashamed of own doubt everything might be possible rather than serious attachment serious approbation of toward have quite convinced herself of before sir thomas mr crawford joined difficulty be in maintaining conviction quite so absolutely after mr crawford be in room for once twice look seemed forced on did not know how to class among common meaning in other man at least must have said that meant something very earnest very pointed still tried to believe more than what might often have expressed towards cousin fifty other woman thought be wishing to speak to unheard by rest fancied be trying for whole evening at interval whenever sir thomas be out of room at engaged with mr norris carefully refused opportunity at last seemed at last to fanny nervousness though not remarkably late began to talk of going away comfort of sound be impaired by turning to next moment saying have nothing to send to mary answer to note will be disappointed if receives nothing from pray write to if be only line oh yes certainly cried fanny rising in haste haste of embarrassment of wanting to get away will write directly went accordingly to table where be in habit of writing for aunt prepared material without knowing what in world to say have read miss crawford note only once how to reply to anything so imperfectly understood be most distressing quite unpractised in such sort of note writing have there be time for scruple fear a to style must have felt in abundance something must be instantly written with only one decided feeling that of wishing not to appear to think anything really intended wrote thus in great trembling of spirit hand be very much obliged to dear miss crawford for kind congratulation a far a relate to dearest william rest of note know mean nothing be so unequal to anything of sort that hope will excuse begging to take farther notice have seen too much of mr crawford not to understand manner if understood a well must dare say behave differently know what write must be great favour of never to mention subject again with thanks for honour of note remain dear miss crawford etc etc conclusion be scarcely intelligible from increasing fright for found that mr crawford under pretence of receiving note be coming towards can not think mean to hurry said in undervoice perceiving amazing trepidation with made up note can not think have such object hurry entreat oh thank have quite done just done will be ready in moment be very much obliged to if will be so good a to give to miss crawford note be held out must be taken a instantly with averted eye walked towards fireplace where sat others have nothing to do to go in good earnest fanny thought have never known day of greater agitation of pain pleasure happily pleasure be not of sort to die with day for day must restore knowledge of william advancement whereas pain hoped must return more have doubt that note must appear excessively ill written that language must disgrace child for distress have allowed arrangement at least must assure of being imposed on gratified by mr crawford attention chapter xxxii fanny have by mean forgotten mr crawford when awoke next morning remembered purport of note be not le sanguine a to effect than have be night before if mr crawford must go away be what most earnestly desired go take sister with a be to do a returned to mansfield on purpose to do why be not done already must not devise for miss crawford certainly wanted delay fanny have hoped in course of yesterday visit to hear day named have only spoken of journey a what must take place ere long having so satisfactorily settled conviction note must convey must not be astonished to see mr crawford a accidentally did coming up to house again at hour a early a day before coming might have nothing to do with must avoid seeing if possible being then on way upstairs resolved there to remain during whole of visit unless actually sent for a mr norris be still in house there seemed little danger of being wanted sat time in good deal of agitation listening trembling fearing to be sent for moment a footstep approached east room grew gradually composed must sit down be able to employ able to hope that mr crawford have come must go without being obliged to know anything of matter nearly hour have passed be growing very comfortable when suddenly sound of step in regular approach be heard heavy step unusual step in part of house be uncle knew a well a voice have trembled at a often began to tremble again at idea of coming up to speak to might be subject be indeed sir thomas who opened door asked if be there if might come in terror of former occasional visit to room seemed renewed felt a if be going to examine again in french english be attention however in placing chair for trying to appear honoured in agitation have quite overlooked deficiency of apartment till stopping short a entered said with much surprise why have fire to day there be snow on ground be sitting in shawl hesitated be not cold sir never sit here long at time of year have fire in general sir how come about here must be mistake understood that have use of room by way of making perfectly comfortable in bedchamber know can not have fire here be great misapprehension must be rectified be highly unfit for to sit be only hour day without fire be not strong be chilly aunt can not be aware of fanny must rather have be silent being obliged to speak must not forbear in justice to aunt loved best from saying something in word aunt norris be distinguishable understand cried uncle recollecting not wanting to hear more understand aunt norris have always be advocate very judiciously for young people being brought up without unnecessary indulgence there must be moderation in everything be also very hardy of course will influence in opinion of want of others on account too can perfectly comprehend know what sentiment have always be principle be good in may have be believe have be carried too far in case be aware that there have be sometimes in point misplaced distinction think too well of fanny to suppose will ever harbour resentment on account have understanding will prevent from receiving thing only in part judging partially by event will take in whole of past will consider time person probability will feel that be not least friend who be educating preparing for mediocrity of condition seemed to be lot though caution may prove eventually unnecessary be kindly meant of may be assured that advantage of affluence will be doubled by little privation restriction may have be imposed be sure will not disappoint opinion of by failing at time to treat aunt norris with respect attention be due to enough of sit down dear must speak to for few minute will not detain long fanny obeyed with eye cast down colour rising after moment pause sir thomas trying to suppress smile went on be not aware perhaps have have visitor morning have not be long in own room after breakfast when mr crawford be shewn in errand may probably conjecture fanny colour grew deeper deeper uncle perceiving that be embarrassed to degree made speaking looking up quite impossible turned away own eye without farther pause proceeded in account of mr crawford visit mr crawford business have be to declare lover of fanny make decided proposal for entreat sanction of uncle who seemed to stand in place of parent have done so well so openly so liberally so properly that sir thomas feeling moreover own reply own remark to have be very much to purpose be exceedingly happy to give particular of conversation little aware of what be passing in niece mind conceived that by such detail must be gratifying far more than talked therefore for several minute without fanny daring to interrupt have hardly even attained wish to do mind be in too much confusion have changed position with eye fixed intently on one of window be listening to uncle in utmost perturbation dismay for moment ceased have barely become conscious of when rising from chair said now fanny having performed one part of commission shewn everything placed on basis most assured satisfactory may execute remainder by prevailing on to accompany downstairs where though can not presume on having be unacceptable companion must submit to finding one still better worth listening to mr crawford a have perhaps foreseen be yet in house be in room hoping to see there there be look start exclamation on hearing astonished sir thomas what be increase of astonishment on hearing exclaim oh sir can not indeed can not go down to mr crawford ought to know must know that told enough yesterday to convince spoke to on subject yesterday told without disguise that be very disagreeable to quite out of power to return good opinion catch meaning said sir thomas sitting down again out of power to return good opinion what be know spoke to yesterday a far a understand received a much encouragement to proceed a well judging young woman must permit to give be very much pleased with what collected to have be behaviour on occasion shewed discretion highly to be commended now when have made overture so properly honourably what be scruple now be mistaken sir cried fanny forced by anxiety of moment even to tell uncle that be wrong be quite mistaken how must mr crawford say such thing gave encouragement yesterday on contrary told can not recollect exact word be sure told must not listen to that be very unpleasant to in respect begged never to talk to in manner again be sure said a much a more must have said still more if have be quite certain of meaning anything seriously did not like to be must not bear to be imputing more than might be intended thought might pas for nothing with must say no more breath be almost gone be to understand said sir thomas after few moment silence that mean to refuse mr crawford yes sir refuse yes sir refuse mr crawford upon what plea for what reason can not like sir well enough to marry be very strange said sir thomas in voice of calm displeasure there be something in comprehension doe not reach here be young man wishing to pay address to with everything to recommend not merely situation in life fortune character with more than common agreeableness with address conversation pleasing to everybody be not acquaintance of to day have now known time sister moreover be intimate friend have be doing that for brother must suppose must have be almost sufficient recommendation to have there be other be very uncertain when interest might have got william on have done already yes said fanny in faint voice looking down with fresh shame did feel almost ashamed of herself after picture a uncle have drawn for not liking mr crawford must have be aware continued sir thomas presently must have be time aware of particularity in mr crawford manner to can not have taken by surprise must have observed attention though always received very properly have accusation to make on head never perceived to be unpleasant to be half inclined to think fanny that quite know own feeling oh yes sir indeed do attention be always what did not like sir thomas looked at with deeper surprise be beyond said requires explanation young a be having seen scarcely one be hardly possible that affection paused eyed fixedly saw lip formed into though sound be inarticulate face be like scarlet however in so modest girl might be very compatible with innocence chusing at least to appear satisfied quickly added know be quite out of question quite impossible well there be nothing more to be said for few minute did say nothing be deep in thought niece be deep in thought likewise trying to harden prepare against farther questioning must rather die than own truth hoped by little reflection to fortify beyond betraying independently of interest mr crawford choice seemed to justify said sir thomas beginning again very composedly wishing to marry at so early be recommendatory to be advocate for early marriage where there be mean in proportion must have young man with sufficient income settle a soon after four twenty a can be so much opinion that be sorry to think how little likely own eldest son cousin mr bertram be to marry early at present a far a can judge matrimony make part of plan thought wish be more likely to fix here be glance at fanny edmund consider from disposition habit a much more likely to marry early than brother indeed have lately thought have seen woman must love be convinced eldest son have not be right do agree with dear yes sir be gently be calmly said sir thomas be easy on score of cousin removal of alarm did niece service a unaccountableness be confirmed displeasure increased getting up walking about room with frown fanny must picture to herself though dared not lift up eye shortly afterwards in voice of authority said have reason child to think ill of mr crawford temper sir longed to add of principle have heart sunk under appalling prospect of discussion explanation probably non conviction ill opinion of be founded chiefly on observation for cousin sake must scarcely dare mention to father maria julia especially maria be so closely implicated in mr crawford misconduct that must not give character such a believed without betraying have hoped that to man like uncle so discerning so honourable so good simple acknowledgment of settled dislike on side must have be sufficient to infinite grief found be not sir thomas came towards table where sat in trembling wretchedness with good deal of cold sternness said be of use perceive to talk to have better put end to most mortifying conference mr crawford must not be kept longer waiting will therefore only add a thinking duty to mark opinion of conduct that have disappointed expectation have formed proved of character very reverse of what have supposed for have fanny a think behaviour must have shewn formed very favourable opinion of from period of return to england have thought peculiarly free from wilfulness of temper self conceit tendency to independence of spirit prevails so much in modern day even in young woman in young woman be offensive disgusting beyond common offence have now shewn that can be wilful perverse that can will decide for without consideration deference for who have surely right to guide without even asking advice have shewn very very different from anything have imagined advantage disadvantage of family of parent brother sister never seems to have have moment share in thought on occasion how might be benefited how must rejoice in such establishment for be nothing to think only of because feel for mr crawford exactly what young heated fancy imago to be necessary for happiness resolve to refuse at once without wishing even for little time to consider of little more time for cool consideration for really examining own inclination be in wild fit of folly throwing away from opportunity of being settled in life eligibly honourably nobly settled a will probably never occur to again here be young man of sense of character of temper of manner of fortune exceedingly attached to seeking hand in most handsome disinterested way let tell fanny that may live eighteen year longer in world without being addressed by man of half mr crawford estate tenth part of merit gladly must have bestowed of own daughter on maria be nobly married have mr crawford sought julia hand must have given to with superior more heartfelt satisfaction than gave maria to mr rushworth after moment pause must have be very much surprised have of daughter on receiving proposal of marriage at time might carry with only eligibility of immediately peremptorily without paying opinion regard compliment of consultation put decided negative on must have be much surprised much hurt by proceeding must have thought gross violation of duty respect be not to be judged by same rule owe duty of child fanny if heart can acquit of ingratitude ceased fanny be by time cry so bitterly that angry a be must not press that article farther heart be almost broke by such picture of what appeared to by such accusation so heavy so multiplied so rising in dreadful gradation self willed obstinate selfish ungrateful thought have deceived expectation have lost good opinion what be to become of be very sorry said inarticulately through tear be very sorry indeed sorry yes hope be sorry will probably have reason to be long sorry for day transaction if be possible for to do otherwise said with strong effort be so perfectly convinced that must never make happy must be miserable burst of tear in spite of burst in spite of great black word miserable served to introduce sir thomas began to think little relenting little change of inclination might have something to do with to augur favourably from personal entreaty of young man knew to be very timid exceedingly nervous thought not improbable that mind might be in such state a little time little pressing little patience little impatience judicious mixture of on lover side might work usual effect on if gentleman must persevere if have love enough to persevere sir thomas began to have hope reflection having passed across mind cheered well said in tone of becoming gravity of le anger well child dry up tear there be use in tear can do good must now come downstairs with mr crawford have be kept waiting too long already must give own answer can not expect to be satisfied with le only can explain to ground of misconception of sentiment unfortunately for certainly have imbibed be totally unequal to fanny shewed such reluctance such misery at idea of going down to that sir thomas after little consideration judged better to indulge hope from gentleman lady suffered small depression in consequence when looked at niece saw state of feature complexion cry have brought into thought there might be a much lost a gained by immediate interview with few word therefore of particular meaning walked off by leaving poor niece to sit cry over what have passed with very wretched feeling mind be disorder past present future everything be terrible uncle anger gave severest pain of selfish ungrateful to have appeared so to be miserable for ever have one to take part to counsel speak for only friend be absent might have softened father perhaps must think selfish ungrateful might have to endure reproach again again might hear see know to exist for ever in connexion about must not feel resentment against mr crawford yet if really loved be unhappy too be wretchedness together in about quarter of hour uncle returned be almost ready to faint at sight of spoke calmly however without austerity without reproach revived little there be comfort too in word a well a manner for began with mr crawford be gone have just left need not repeat what have passed want to add to anything may now be feeling by account of what have felt suffice that have behaved in most gentlemanlike generous manner have confirmed in most favourable opinion of understanding heart temper upon representation of what be suffering immediately with greatest delicacy ceased to urge to see for present here fanny who have looked up looked down again of course continued uncle can not be supposed that must request to speak with alone be only for five minute request too natural claim too just to be denied there be time fixed perhaps to morrow whenever spirit be composed enough for present have only to tranquillise check tear do exhaust if a be willing to suppose wish to shew observance will not give way to emotion endeavour to reason into stronger frame of mind advise to go out air will do good go out for hour on gravel will have shrubbery to will be better for air exercise fanny turning back again for moment will make mention below of what have passed will not even tell aunt bertram there be occasion for spreading disappointment say nothing about be order to be most joyfully obeyed be act of kindness fanny felt at heart to be spared from aunt norris interminable reproach left in glow of gratitude anything might be bearable rather than such reproach even to see mr crawford must be le overpowering walked out directly a uncle recommended followed advice throughout a far a must did check tear did earnestly try to compose spirit strengthen mind wished to prove to that did desire comfort sought to regain favour have given strong motive for exertion in keeping whole affair from knowledge of aunt not to excite suspicion by look manner be now object worth attaining felt equal to almost anything might save from aunt norris be struck quite struck when on returning from walk going into east room again first thing caught eye be fire lighted burning fire seemed too much just at time to be giving such indulgence be exciting even painful gratitude wondered that sir thomas must have leisure to think of trifle again soon found from voluntary information of housemaid who came in to attend so be to be day sir thomas have given order for must be brute indeed if can be really ungrateful said in soliloquy heaven defend from being ungrateful saw nothing more of uncle of aunt norris till met at dinner uncle behaviour to be then a nearly a possible what have be before be sure did not mean there must be change that be only own conscience must fancy aunt be soon quarrelling with when found how much how unpleasantly having only walked out without aunt knowledge must be dwelt on felt reason have to bless kindness saved from same spirit of reproach exerted on more momentous subject if have known be going out must have got just to go a far a house with order for nanny said have since to very great inconvenience be obliged to go carry must very ill spare time might have saved trouble if must only have be so good a to let know be going out must have made difference to suppose whether have walked in shrubbery gone to house recommended shrubbery to fanny a driest place said sir thomas oh said mr norris with moment check be very kind of sir thomas know how dry path be to house fanny must have have quite a good walk there assure with advantage of being of use obliging aunt be fault if must have let know be going out there be something about fanny have often observed before like to go own way to work doe not like to be dictated to take own independent walk whenever can certainly have little spirit of secrecy independence nonsense about must advise to get better of a general reflection on fanny sir thomas thought nothing must be more unjust though have be so lately expressing same sentiment tried to turn conversation tried repeatedly before must succeed for mr norris have not discernment enough to perceive either now at other time to what degree thought well of niece how very far be from wishing to have own child merit set off by depreciation of hers be talking at fanny resenting private walk half through dinner be over however at last evening set in with more composure to fanny more cheerfulness of spirit than must have hoped for after so stormy morning trusted in first place that have done right that judgment have not misled for purity of intention must answer be willing to hope secondly that uncle displeasure be abating must abate farther a considered matter with more impartiality felt a good man must feel how wretched how unpardonable how hopeless how wicked be to marry without affection when meeting with be threatened for morrow be past must not flatter that subject must be finally concluded mr crawford once gone from mansfield that everything must soon be a if such subject have existed must not must not believe that mr crawford affection for must distress long mind be not of sort london must soon bring cure in london must soon learn to wonder at infatuation be thankful for right reason in have saved from evil consequence while fanny mind be engaged in sort of hope uncle be soon after tea called out of room occurrence too common to strike thought nothing of till butler reappeared ten minute afterwards advancing decidedly towards said sir thomas wish to speak with ma'be in own room then occurred to what might be going on suspicion rushed over mind drove colour from cheek instantly rising be preparing to obey when mr norris called out stay stay fanny what be about where be going be in such hurry depend upon be not who be wanted depend upon be looking at butler be so very eager to put forward what must sir thomas want for be baddeley mean be coming moment mean baddeley be sure sir thomas want not miss price baddeley be stout ma'be be miss price be certain of being miss price there be half smile with word meant think must answer purpose at mr norris much discontented be obliged to compose to work again fanny walking off in agitating consciousness found a anticipated in minute alone with mr crawford chapter xxxiii conference be neither so short so conclusive a lady have designed gentleman be not so easily satisfied have disposition to persevere sir thomas must wish have vanity strongly inclined in first place to think did love though might not know secondly when constrained at last to admit that did know own present feeling convinced that must be able in time to make feeling what wished be in love very much in love be love operating on active sanguine spirit of more warmth than delicacy made affection appear of greater consequence because be withheld determined to have glory a well a felicity of forcing to love must not despair must not desist have well grounded reason for solid attachment knew to have worth must justify warmest hope of lasting happiness with conduct at very time by speaking disinterestedness delicacy of character quality believed most rare indeed be of sort to heighten wish confirm resolution knew not that have pre engaged heart to attack of that have suspicion considered rather a one who have never thought on subject enough to be in danger who have be guarded by youth youth of mind a lovely a of person whose modesty have prevented from understanding attention who be still overpowered by suddenness of address so wholly unexpected novelty of situation fancy have never taken into account must not follow of course that when be understood must succeed believed fully love such a in man like must with perseverance secure return at great distance have so much delight in idea of obliging to love in very short time that not loving now be scarcely regretted little difficulty to be overcome be evil to henry crawford rather derived spirit from have be apt to gain heart too easily situation be new animating to fanny however who have known too much opposition life to find charm in be unintelligible found that did mean to persevere how must after such language from a felt obliged to use be not to be understood told that did not love must not love be sure never must love that change be quite impossible that subject be most painful to that must entreat never to mention again to allow to leave at once let be considered a concluded for ever when farther pressed have added that in opinion disposition be so totally dissimilar a to make mutual affection incompatible that be unfitted for other by nature education habit have said with earnestness of sincerity yet be not enough for immediately denied there being anything uncongenial in character anything unfriendly in situation positively declared that must still love still hope fanny knew own meaning be judge of own manner manner be incurably gentle be not aware how much concealed sternness of purpose diffidence gratitude softness made expression of indifference seem almost effort of self denial seem at least to be giving nearly a much pain to herself a to mr crawford be no longer mr crawford who a clandestine insidious treacherous admirer of maria bertram have be abhorrence whom have hated to see to speak to in whom must believe good quality to exist whose power even of being agreeable have barely acknowledged be now mr crawford who be addressing with ardent disinterested love whose feeling be apparently become be honourable upright whose view of happiness be fixed on marriage of attachment who be pouring out sense of merit describing describing again affection proving a far a word must prove in language tone spirit of man of talent too that sought for gentleness goodness to complete whole be now mr crawford who have procured william promotion here be change here be claim must not operate might have disdained in dignity of angry virtue in ground of sotherton theatre at mansfield park approached now with right demanded different treatment must be courteous must be compassionate must have sensation of being honoured whether thinking of herself brother must have strong feeling of gratitude effect of whole be manner so pitying agitated word intermingled with refusal so expressive of obligation concern to temper of vanity hope like crawford truth at least strength of indifference might well be questionable be not so irrational a fanny considered in profession of persevering assiduous not desponding attachment closed interview be with reluctance that suffered to go there be look of despair in parting to belie word give hope of being le unreasonable than professed now be angry resentment did arise at perseverance so selfish ungenerous here be again want of delicacy regard for others have formerly so struck disgusted here be again something of same mr crawford whom have so reprobated before how evidently be there gross want of feeling humanity where own pleasure be concerned ala how always known principle to supply a duty what heart be deficient in have own affection be a free a perhaps ought to have be never must have engaged so thought fanny in good truth sober sadness a sat musing over too great indulgence luxury of fire upstairs wondering at past present wondering at what be yet to come in nervous agitation made nothing clear to persuasion of being never under circumstance able to love mr crawford felicity of having fire to sit over think of sir thomas be obliged obliged to wait till morrow for knowledge of what have passed between young people then saw mr crawford received account first feeling be disappointment have hoped better thing have thought that hour entreaty from young man like crawford must not have worked so little change on gentle tempered girl like fanny there be speedy comfort in determined view sanguine perseverance of lover when seeing such confidence of success in principal sir thomas be soon able to depend on nothing be omitted on side of civility compliment kindness might assist plan mr crawford steadiness be honoured fanny be praised connexion be still most desirable in world at mansfield park mr crawford must always be welcome have only to consult own judgment feeling a to frequency of visit at present in future in niece family friend there must be one opinion one wish on subject influence of who loved must incline one way everything be said that must encourage encouragement received with grateful joy gentleman parted best of friend satisfied that cause be now on footing most proper hopeful sir thomas resolved to abstain from importunity with niece to shew open interference upon disposition believed kindness might be best way of working entreaty must be from one quarter only forbearance of family on point respecting must be in doubt of wish might be surest mean of forwarding accordingly on principle sir thomas took first opportunity of saying to with mild gravity intended to be overcoming well fanny have seen mr crawford again learn from exactly how matter stand between be most extraordinary young man be event must feel that have created attachment of common character though young a be little acquainted with transient varying unsteady nature of love a generally exists can not be struck a be with be wonderful in perseverance of sort against discouragement with be entirely matter of feeling claim merit in perhaps be entitled to none yet having chosen so well constancy have respectable stamp have choice be le unexceptionable must have condemned persevering indeed sir said fanny be very sorry that mr crawford must continue to know that be paying very great compliment feel most undeservedly honoured be so perfectly convinced have told so that never will be in power dear interrupted sir thomas there be occasion for feeling be a well known to a wish regret must be to there be nothing more to be said done from hour subject be never to be revived between will have nothing to fear to be agitated about can not suppose capable of trying to persuade to marry against inclination happiness advantage be have in view nothing be required of to bear with mr crawford endeavour to convince that may not be incompatible with proceeds at own risk be on safe ground have engaged for seeing whenever call a might have done have nothing of sort occurred will see with rest of in same manner a much a can dismissing recollection of everything unpleasant leaf northamptonshire so soon that even slight sacrifice can not be often demanded future must be very uncertain now dear fanny subject be closed between promised departure be that fanny must think of with much satisfaction uncle kind expression however forbearing manner be sensibly felt when considered how much of truth be unknown to believed have right to wonder at line of conduct pursued who have married daughter to mr rushworth romantic delicacy be certainly not to be expected from must do duty trust time might make duty easier than now be must not though only eighteen suppose mr crawford attachment must hold out for ever must not imagine that steady unceasing discouragement from must put end to in time how much time might in own fancy allot for dominion be concern must not be fair to inquire into young lady exact estimate of own perfection in spite of intended silence sir thomas found once more obliged to mention subject to niece to prepare briefly for being imparted to aunt measure must still have avoided if possible became necessary from totally opposite feeling of mr crawford a to secrecy of proceeding have idea of concealment be known at parsonage where loved to talk over future with sister must be rather gratifying to to have enlightened witness of progress of success when sir thomas understood felt necessity of making own wife sister in law acquainted with business without delay though on fanny account almost dreaded effect of communication to mr norris a much a fanny deprecated mistaken well meaning zeal sir thomas indeed be by time not very far from classing mr a one of well meaning people who be always doing mistaken very disagreeable thing mr norris however relieved pressed for strictest forbearance silence towards niece not only promised did observe only looked increased ill will angry be bitterly angry be more angry with fanny for having received such offer than for refusing be injury affront to julia who ought to have be mr crawford choice independently of disliked fanny because have neglected must have grudged elevation to one whom have be always trying to depress sir thomas gave more credit for discretion on occasion than deserved fanny must have blessed for allowing only to see displeasure not to hear lady bertram took differently have be beauty prosperous beauty life beauty wealth be that excited respect to know fanny to be sought in marriage by man of fortune raised therefore very much in opinion by convincing that fanny be very pretty have be doubting about before that must be advantageously married made feel sort of credit in calling niece well fanny said a soon a be alone together afterwards really have known something like impatience to be alone with countenance a spoke have extraordinary animation well fanny have have very agreeable surprise morning must just speak of once told sir thomas must once then will have done give joy dear niece looking at complacently added humph certainly be handsome family fanny coloured doubted at first what to say when hoping to assail on vulnerable side presently answered dear aunt can not wish to do differently from what have done be sure can not wish to marry for must miss must not yes be sure must miss too much for dear must not think of missing when offer a come in way must do very well without if be married to man of such good estate a mr crawford must be aware fanny that be young woman duty to accept very unexceptionable offer a be almost only rule of conduct only piece of advice fanny have ever received from aunt in course of eight year half silenced felt how unprofitable contention must be if aunt feeling be against nothing must be hoped from attacking understanding lady bertram be quite talkative will tell what fanny said be sure fell in love with at ball be sure mischief be done that evening did look remarkably well everybody said so sir thomas said so know have chapman to help to dress be very glad sent chapman to will tell sir thomas that be sure be done that evening still pursuing same cheerful thought soon afterwards added will tell what fanny be more than did for maria next time pug have litter will have puppy chapter xxxiv edmund have great thing to hear on return many surprise be awaiting first that occurred be not least in interest appearance of henry crawford sister walking together through village a rode into have concluded have meant to be far distant absence have be extended beyond fortnight purposely to avoid miss crawford be returning to mansfield with spirit ready to feed on melancholy remembrance tender association when own fair self be before leaning on brother arm found receiving welcome unquestionably friendly from woman whom two moment before have be thinking of a seventy mile off a farther much farther from in inclination than distance must express reception of be of sort must not have hoped for have expected to see coming a did from purport fulfilled a have taken away must have expected anything rather than look of satisfaction word of simple pleasant meaning be enough to set heart in glow to bring home in properest state for feeling full value of other joyful surprise at hand william promotion with particular be soon master of with such secret provision of comfort within own breast to help joy found in source of most gratifying sensation unvarying cheerfulness dinner time after dinner when father be alone have fanny history then great event of last fortnight present situation of matter at mansfield be known to fanny suspected what be going on sat so much longer than usual in dining parlour that be sure must be talking of when tea at last brought away be to be seen by edmund again felt dreadfully guilty came to sat down by took hand pressed kindly at moment thought that for occupation scene tea thing afforded must have betrayed emotion in unpardonable excess be not intending however by such action to be conveying to unqualified approbation encouragement hope drew from be designed only to express participation in interested to tell that have be hearing what quickened feeling of affection be in fact entirely on father side of question surprise be not so great a father at refusing crawford because so far from supposing to consider with anything like preference have always believed to be rather reverse must imagine to be taken perfectly unprepared sir thomas must not regard connexion a more desirable than did have recommendation to while honouring for what have done under influence of present indifference honouring in rather stronger term than sir thomas must quite be most earnest in hoping sanguine in believing that must be match at last that united by mutual affection must appear that disposition be a exactly fitted to make blessed in other a be now beginning seriously to consider crawford have be too precipitate have not given time to attach have begun at wrong end with such power a however such disposition a hers edmund trusted that everything must work out happy conclusion meanwhile saw enough of fanny embarrassment to make scrupulously guard against exciting second time by word look movement crawford called next day on score of edmund return sir thomas felt more than licensed to ask to stay dinner be really necessary compliment staid of course edmund have then ample opportunity for observing how sped with fanny what degree of immediate encouragement for might be extracted from manner be so little so very very little chance possibility of resting upon embarrassment only if there be not hope in confusion there be hope in nothing else that be almost ready to wonder at friend perseverance fanny be worth held to be worth effort of patience exertion of mind did not think must have gone on with woman breathing without something more to warm courage than eye must discern in hers be very willing to hope that crawford saw clearer be most comfortable conclusion for friend that must come to from that observed to pas before at after dinner in evening few circumstance occurred thought more promising when crawford walked into drawing room mother fanny be sitting a intently silently at work a if there be nothing else to care for edmund must not help noticing apparently deep tranquillity have not be so silent time replied mother fanny have be reading to only put book down upon hearing coming sure enough there be book on table have air of being very recently closed volume of shakespeare often read to out of book be in middle of very fine speech of man what be name fanny when heard footstep crawford took volume let have pleasure of finishing speech to ladyship said will find immediately by carefully giving way to inclination of leaf did find within page two quite near enough to satisfy lady bertram who assured a soon a mentioned name of cardinal wolsey that have got very speech not look offer of help have fanny given not syllable for against attention be for work seemed determined to be interested by nothing else taste be too strong in must not abstract mind five minute be forced to listen reading be capital pleasure in good reading extreme to good reading however have be long used uncle read well cousin edmund very well in mr crawford reading there be variety of excellence beyond what have ever met with king queen buckingham wolsey cromwell be given in turn for with happiest knack happiest power of jumping guessing must always alight at will on best scene best speech of whether be dignity pride tenderness remorse be to be expressed must do with equal beauty be truly dramatic acting have first taught fanny what pleasure play might give reading brought acting before again nay perhaps with greater enjoyment for came unexpectedly with such drawback a have be used to suffer in seeing on stage with miss bertram edmund watched progress of attention be amused gratified by seeing how gradually slackened in needlework at beginning seemed to occupy totally how fell from hand while sat motionless over at last how eye have appeared so studiously to avoid throughout day be turned fixed on crawford fixed on for minute fixed on in short till attraction drew crawford upon book be closed charm be broken then be shrinking again into blushing working a hard a ever have be enough to give edmund encouragement for friend a cordially thanked hoped to be expressing be secret feeling too that play must be favourite with said read a if knew well will be favourite believe from hour replied crawford think have have volume of shakespeare in hand before since be fifteen once saw henry eighth acted have heard of from somebody who did be not certain shakespeare one get acquainted with without knowing how be part of englishman constitution thought beauty be so spread abroad that one touch everywhere one be intimate with by instinct man of brain can open at good part of one of play without falling into flow of meaning immediately doubt one be familiar with shakespeare in degree said edmund from one earliest year celebrated passage be quoted by everybody be in book open talk shakespeare use simile describe with description be totally distinct from giving sense a gave to know in bit scrap be common enough to know pretty thoroughly be perhaps not uncommon to read well aloud be everyday talent sir do honour be crawford answer with bow of mock gravity gentleman have glance at fanny to see if word of accordant praise must be extorted from yet feeling that must not be praise have be given in attention that must content lady bertram admiration be expressed strongly too be really like being at play said wish sir thomas have be here crawford be excessively pleased if lady bertram with incompetency languor must feel inference of what niece alive enlightened a be must feel be elevating have great turn for acting be sure mr crawford said ladyship soon afterwards will tell what think will have theatre time other at house in norfolk mean when be settled there do indeed think will fit up theatre at house in norfolk do ma'be cried with quickness will never be ladyship be quite mistaken theatre at everingham oh looked at fanny with expressive smile evidently meant that lady will never allow theatre at everingham edmund saw saw fanny so determined not to see a to make clear that voice be enough to convey full meaning of protestation quick consciousness of compliment such ready comprehension of hint thought be rather favourable than not subject of reading aloud be farther discussed two young men be only talker standing by fire talked over too common neglect of qualification total inattention to in ordinary school system for boy consequently natural yet in instance almost unnatural degree of ignorance uncouthness of men of sensible well informed men when suddenly called to necessity of reading aloud have fallen within notice giving instance of blunder failure with secondary cause want of management of voice of proper modulation emphasis of foresight judgment proceeding from first cause want of early attention habit fanny be listening again with great entertainment even in profession said edmund with smile how little art of reading have be studied how little clear manner good delivery have be attended to speak rather of past however than present there be now spirit of improvement abroad among who be ordained twenty thirty forty year ago larger number to judge by performance must have thought reading be reading preaching be preaching be different now subject be more justly considered be felt that distinctness energy may have weight in recommending most solid truth besides there be more general observation taste more critical knowledge diffused than formerly in congregation there be larger proportion who know little of matter who can judge criticise edmund have already gone through service once since ordination upon being understood have variety of question from crawford a to feeling success question being made though with vivacity of friendly interest quick taste without touch of spirit of banter air of levity edmund knew to be most offensive to fanny have true pleasure in satisfying when crawford proceeded to ask opinion give own a to properest manner in particular passage in service must be delivered shewing to be subject on have thought before thought with judgment edmund be still more more pleased must be way to fanny heart be not to be won by gallantry wit good nature together must do at least must not be won by nearly so soon without assistance of sentiment feeling seriousness on serious subject liturgy observed crawford have beauty not

speaking improperly lightly irreverently on subject only tell if be only tell if be wrong want to be set right nay nay entreat for one moment put down work what did shake of head mean in vain be pray sir pray mr crawford repeated twice over in vain did try to move away in same low eager voice same close neighbourhood went on reurging same question a before grew more agitated displeased how can sir quite astonish wonder how can do astonish said do wonder be there anything in present entreaty that understand will explain to instantly make urge in manner give interest in what look do excites present curiosity will not leave to wonder long in spite of must not help half smile said nothing shook head at acknowledging must not like to engage in duty of clergyman always for constancy yes be word constancy be not afraid of word must spell read write with anybody see nothing alarming in word did think ought perhaps sir said fanny wearied at last into speaking perhaps sir thought be pity did not always know a well a seemed to do at moment crawford delighted to get to speak at rate be determined to keep up poor fanny who have hoped to silence by extremity of reproof found sadly mistaken that be only change from one object of curiosity one set of word to have always something to entreat explanation of opportunity be too fair none such have occurred since seeing in uncle room none such might occur again before leaving mansfield lady bertram being just on other side of table be trifle for might always be considered a only half awake edmund advertisement be still of first utility well said crawford after course of rapid question reluctant answer be happier than be because now understand more clearly opinion of think unsteady easily swayed by whim of moment easily

declare know too well not to entertain warmest hope yes dearest sweetest fanny nay seeing draw back displeased forgive perhaps have a yet right by what other name can call do suppose be ever present to imagination under other be 'fanny ' that think of day dream of night have given name such reality of sweetness that nothing else can now be descriptive of fanny must hardly have kept seat longer have refrained from at least trying to get away in spite of too public opposition foresaw to have not be for sound of approaching relief very sound have be long watching for long thinking strangely delayed solemn procession headed by baddeley of tea board urn cake bearer made appearance delivered from grievous imprisonment of body mind mr crawford be obliged to move be at liberty be busy be protected edmund be not sorry to be admitted again among number of who might speak hear though conference have seemed full long to though on looking at fanny saw rather flush of vexation inclined to hope that so much must not have be said listened to without profit to speaker chapter xxxv edmund have determined that belonged entirely to fanny to chuse whether situation with regard to crawford must be mentioned between not that if did not lead way must never be touched on by after day two of mutual reserve be induced by father to change mind try what influence might do for friend day very early day be actually fixed for crawford departure sir thomas thought might be a well to make one more effort for young man before left mansfield that profession vow of unshaken attachment might have a much hope to sustain a possible sir thomas be most cordially anxious for perfection of mr crawford character in point wished to be model of constancy fancied best mean of effecting must be by not trying too long edmund be not unwilling to be persuaded to engage in business wanted to know fanny feeling have be used to consult in difficulty loved too well to bear to be denied confidence now hoped to be of service to thought must be of service to whom else have to open heart to if did not need counsel must need comfort of communication fanny estranged from silent reserved be unnatural state of thing state must break through must easily learn to think be wanting to break through will speak to sir will take first opportunity of speaking to alone be result of such thought a upon sir thomas information of being at very time walking alone in shrubbery instantly joined be come to walk with fanny said will drawing arm within be long while since have have comfortable walk together assented to rather by look than word spirit be low fanny presently added in order to have comfortable walk something more be necessary than merely pacing gravel together must talk to know have something on mind know what be thinking of can not suppose uninformed be to hear of from everybody fanny fanny at once agitated dejected replied if hear of from everybody cousin there can be nothing for to tell not of fact perhaps of feeling fanny one can tell mean to press however if be not what wish have done have thought might be relief be afraid think too differently for to find relief in talking of what feel do suppose that think differently have idea of dare say that on comparison of opinion must be found a much alike a have be used to be to point consider crawford proposal a most advantageous desirable if must return affection consider a most natural that family must wish must return that a can not have done exactly a ought in refusing can there be disagreement between here oh thought blamed thought be against be such comfort comfort might have have sooner fanny have sought how must possibly suppose against how must imagine advocate for marriage without love be even careless in general on such matter how must imagine so where happiness be at stake uncle thought wrong knew have be talking to a far a have gone fanny think perfectly right may be sorry may be surprised though hardly that for have not have time to attach think perfectly right can admit of question be disgraceful to if doe did not love nothing must have justified accepting fanny have not felt so comfortable for day day so far conduct have be faultless be quite mistaken who wished to do otherwise matter doe not end here crawford be common attachment perseveres with hope of creating regard have not be created before know must be work of time with affectionate smile let succeed at last fanny let succeed at last have proved upright disinterested prove grateful tender hearted then will be perfect model of woman have always believed born for oh never never never never will succeed with spoke with warmth quite astonished edmund blushed at recollection of herself when saw look heard reply never fanny so very determined positive be not like rational self mean cried sorrowfully correcting that think never will a far a future can be answered for think never will return regard must hope better thing be aware more aware than crawford can be that man who mean to make love having due notice of intention must have very uphill work for there be early attachment habit in battle array before can get heart for own use have to unfasten from hold upon thing animate inanimate so many year growth have confirmed be considerably tightened for moment by very idea of separation know that apprehension of being forced to quit mansfield will for time be arming against wish have not be obliged to tell what be trying for wish have known a well a do fanny between think must have won theoretical practical knowledge together must not have failed must have worked upon plan must hope however time proving a firmly believe will to deserve by steady affection will give reward can not suppose that have not wish to love natural wish of gratitude must have feeling of sort must be sorry for own indifference be so totally unlike said fanny avoiding direct answer be so very very different in inclination way consider a quite impossible must ever be tolerably happy together even if must like there never be two people more dissimilar have not one taste in common must be miserable be mistaken fanny dissimilarity be not so strong be quite enough alike have taste in common have moral literary taste in common have warm heart benevolent feeling fanny who heard read saw listen to shakespeare other night will think unfitted a companion forget there be decided difference in temper allow be lively be serious so much better spirit will support yours be disposition to be easily dejected to fancy difficulty greater than be cheerfulness will counteract see difficulty nowhere pleasantness gaiety will be constant support to being so far unlike fanny doe not in smallest degree make against probability of happiness together imagine be convinced that be rather favourable circumstance be perfectly persuaded that temper have better be unlike mean unlike in flow of spirit in manner in inclination for much little company in propensity to talk to be silent to be grave to be gay opposition here be be thoroughly convinced friendly to matrimonial happiness exclude extreme of course very close resemblance in point must be likeliest way to produce extreme counteraction gentle continual be best safeguard of manner conduct full well must fanny guess where thought be now miss crawford power be returning have be speaking of cheerfully from hour of coming home avoiding be quite at end have dined at parsonage only preceding day after leaving to happier thought for minute fanny feeling due to herself returned to mr crawford said be not merely in temper that consider a totally unsuited to myself though in respect think difference between too great infinitely too great spirit often oppress there be something in object to still more must say cousin can not approve character have not thought well of from time of play then saw behaving a appeared to so very improperly unfeelingly may speak of now because be over so improperly by poor mr rushworth not seeming to care how exposed hurt paying attention to cousin maria in short at time of play received impression will never be got over dear fanny replied edmund scarcely hearing to end let not of be judged by what appeared at period of general folly time of play be time hate to recollect maria be wrong crawford be wrong be wrong together none so wrong a myself compared with rest be blameless be playing fool with eye open a bystander said fanny perhaps saw more than did do think that mr rushworth be sometimes very jealous very possibly wonder nothing must be more improper than whole business be shocked whenever think that maria must be capable of if must undertake part must not be surprised at rest before play be much mistaken if julia did not think be paying attention julia have heard before from one of being in love with julia must never see anything of fanny though hope do justice to sister good quality think very possible that might one be more desirous of being admired by crawford might shew that desire rather more unguardedly than be perfectly prudent can remember that be evidently fond of society with such encouragement man like crawford lively may be little unthinking might be led on to there must be nothing very striking because be clear that have pretension heart be reserved for must say that being for have raised inconceivably in opinion doe highest honour shews proper estimation of blessing of domestic happiness pure attachment prof unspoilt by uncle prof in short everything have be used to wish to believe feared be not be persuaded that doe not think a ought on serious subject say rather that have not thought at upon serious subject believe to be good deal case how must be otherwise with such education adviser under disadvantage indeed have have be not wonderful that must be what be crawford feeling be ready to acknowledge have hitherto be too much guide happily feeling have generally be good will supply rest most fortunate man be to attach to creature to woman who firm a rock in own principle have gentleness of character so well adapted to recommend have chosen partner indeed with rare felicity will make happy fanny know will make happy will make everything must not engage in such charge cried fanny in shrinking accent in such office of high responsibility a usual believing unequal to anything fancying everything too much for well though may not be able to persuade into different feeling will be persuaded into trust confess sincerely anxious that may have common interest in crawford well doing next to happiness fanny have first claim on be aware of having common interest in crawford fanny be too well aware of to have anything to say walked on together fifty yard in mutual silence abstraction edmund first began again be very much pleased by manner of speaking of yesterday particularly pleased because have not depended upon seeing everything in so just light knew be very fond of yet be afraid of not estimating worth to brother quite a deserved of regretting that have not rather fixed on woman of distinction fortune be afraid of bias of worldly maxim have be too much used to hear be very different spoke of fanny just a ought desire connexion a warmly a uncle have long talk about must not have mentioned subject though very anxious to know sentiment have not be in room five minute before began introducing with openness of heart sweet peculiarity of manner that spirit ingenuousness be so much part of mr grant laughed at for rapidity be mr grant in room then yes when reached house found two sister together by when once have begun have not done with fanny till crawford dr grant came in be above week since saw miss crawford yes lament yet owns may have be best will see however before go be very angry with fanny must be prepared for call very angry can imagine anger be regret disappointment of sister who think brother have right to everything may wish for at first moment be hurt a must be for william love esteem with heart knew must be very angry with dearest fanny cried edmund pressing arm closer to let idea of anger distress be anger to be talked of rather than felt heart be made for love kindness not for resentment wish must have overheard tribute of praise wish must have seen countenance when said that must be henry wife observed that always spoke of a 'fanny be never used to do have sound of most sisterly cordiality mr grant did say did speak be there time yes be agreeing exactly with sister surprise of refusal fanny seems to have be unbounded that must refuse such man a henry crawford seems more than can understand said what must for in good truth a stated case must prove to be in sens a soon a can by different conduct nothing else will satisfy be teasing have done turn away from must have thought said fanny after pause of recollection exertion that woman must have felt possibility of man be not being approved not being loved by one of sex at least let be ever so generally agreeable let have perfection in world think ought not to be set down a certain that man must be acceptable to woman may happen to like even supposing be so allowing mr crawford to have claim sister think have how be to be prepared to meet with feeling answerable to own took wholly by surprise have not idea that behaviour to before have meaning surely be not to be teaching to like only because be taking what seemed very idle notice of in situation must have be extreme of vanity to be forming expectation on mr crawford be sure sister rating a do must have thought so supposing have meant nothing how then be to be to be in love with moment said be with how be to have attachment at service a soon a be asked for sister must consider a well a higher desert more improper for ever to have thought of think very differently of nature of woman if can imagine woman so very soon capable of returning affection a seems to imply dear dear fanny now have truth know to be truth most worthy of be such feeling have attributed to before thought must understand have now given exactly explanation ventured to make for to friend mr grant be better satisfied though warm hearted friend be still run away with little by enthusiasm of fondness for henry told that be of human creature one over whom habit have most power novelty least that very circumstance of novelty of crawford address be against being so new so recent be in disfavour that must tolerate nothing that be not used to great deal more to same purpose to give knowledge of character miss crawford made laugh by plan of encouragement for brother meant to urge to persevere in hope of being loved in time of having address most kindly received at end of about ten year happy marriage fanny must with difficulty give smile be here asked for feeling be in revolt feared have be doing wrong saying too much overacting caution have be fancying necessary in guarding against one evil laying open to to have miss crawford liveliness repeated to at moment on subject be bitter aggravation edmund saw weariness distress in face immediately resolved to forbear farther discussion not even to mention name of crawford again except a might be connected with what must be agreeable to on principle soon afterwards observed go on monday be sure therefore of seeing friend to morrow sunday really go on monday be within trifle of being persuaded to stay at lessingby till very day have almost promised what difference might have made five six day more at lessingby might have be felt life be near staying there very be most kindly pressed have nearly consented have received letter from mansfield to tell how be going on believe must certainly have staid knew nothing have happened here for fortnight felt have be away long enough spent time pleasantly there yes be be fault of own mind if did not be very pleasant doubt finding so took uneasiness with there be getting rid of till be in mansfield again miss owen liked did not yes very well pleasant good humoured unaffected girl be spoilt fanny for common female society good humoured unaffected girl will not do for man who have be used to sensible woman be two distinct order of being miss crawford have made too nice still however fanny be oppressed wearied saw in look must not be talked away attempting more led directly with kind authority of privileged guardian into house chapter xxxvi edmund now believed perfectly acquainted with fanny must tell must leave to be conjectured of sentiment be satisfied have be a before presumed too hasty measure on crawford side time must be given to make idea first familiar then agreeable to must be used to consideration of being in love with then return of affection might not be very distant gave opinion a result of conversation to father recommended there being nothing more said to farther attempt to influence persuade that everything must be left to crawford assiduity natural working of own mind sir thomas promised that must be so edmund account of fanny disposition must believe to be just supposed have feeling must consider a very unfortunate that have for le willing than son to trust to future must not help fearing that if such very long allowance of time habit be necessary for might not have persuaded into receiving address properly before young man inclination for paying be over there be nothing to be done however to submit quietly hope best promised visit from friend a edmund called miss crawford be formidable threat to fanny lived in continual terror of a sister so partial so angry so little scrupulous of what said in light so triumphant secure be in way object of painful alarm displeasure penetration happiness be fearful to encounter dependence of having others present when met be fanny only support in looking forward to absented a little a possible from lady bertram kept away from east room took solitary walk in shrubbery in caution to avoid sudden attack succeeded be safe in breakfast room with aunt when miss crawford did come first misery over miss crawford looking speaking with much le particularity of expression than have anticipated fanny began to hope there must be nothing worse to be endured than half hour of moderate agitation here hoped too much miss crawford be not slave of opportunity be determined to see fanny alone therefore said to tolerably soon in low voice must speak to for few minute somewhere word that fanny felt over in pulse nerve denial be impossible habit of ready submission on contrary made almost instantly rise lead way out of room did with wretched feeling be inevitable be sooner in hall than restraint of countenance be over on miss crawford side immediately shook head at fanny with arch yet affectionate reproach taking hand seemed hardly able to help beginning directly said nothing however sad sad girl know when will have done scolding have discretion enough to reserve rest till might be secure of having four wall to fanny naturally turned upstairs took guest to apartment be now always fit for comfortable use opening door however with most aching heart feeling that have more distressing scene before than ever that spot have yet witnessed evil ready to burst on be at least delayed by sudden change in miss crawford idea by strong effect on mind finding in east room again produced have cried with instant animation be here again east room once only be in room before after stopping to look about seemingly to retrace

astonishment when opened door at seeing here to be sure uncle returning very evening there never be anything quite like short fit of abstraction followed when shaking off thus attacked companion why fanny be absolutely in reverie thinking hope of one who be always thinking of oh must transport for short time into circle in town that might understand how power over henry be thought of there oh envyings heartburning of dozen dozen wonder incredulity will be felt at hearing what have done for a to secrecy henry be quite hero of old romance glory in chain must come to london to know how to estimate conquest if be to see how be courted how be courted for sake now be well aware that will not be half so welcome to mr fraser in consequence of situation with when come to know truth will very

bertram a husband be standard of perfection poor janet have be sadly taken in yet there be nothing improper on side did not run into match inconsiderately there be want of foresight took three day to consider of proposal during three day asked advice of everybody connected with whose opinion be worth having especially applied to late dear aunt whose knowledge of world made judgment very generally deservedly looked up to by young people of acquaintance be decidedly in favour of mr fraser seems a if nothing be security for matrimonial comfort have not so much to say for friend flora who jilted very nice young man in blue for sake of horrid lord stornaway who have about a much sense fanny a mr rushworth much worse looking with blackguard character have doubt at time about being right for

only insensible fanny who can think of with anything like indifference be so insensible a profess see be not there be indeed so deep blush over fanny face at moment a might warrant strong suspicion in predisposed mind excellent creature will not tease everything will take course dear fanny must allow that be not so absolutely unprepared to have question asked a cousin fancy be not possible that

sensible of little time perhaps two three week then considered a meaning nothing put down a simply being way be a far from supposing a from wishing to have serious thought of have not miss crawford be inattentive observer of what be passing between part of family in summer autumn be quiet be not blind must not see that mr crawford allowed in gallantry did mean nothing ah can not deny have now then be sad flirt cared very little for havoc might be making in young lady affection have often scolded for be only fault there be to be said that very few young lady have affection worth caring for then fanny glory of fixing one who have be shot at by so many of having in one power to pay off debt of one sex oh be sure be not in woman nature to refuse triumph fanny shook head can not think well of man who sport with woman feeling there may often be great deal more suffered than stander by can judge of defend leave entirely to mercy when have got at everingham care how much lecture will say that fault liking to make girl little in love with be not half so dangerous to wife happiness a tendency to fall in love have never be addicted to do seriously truly believe that be attached to in way that never be to woman before that love with heart will love a nearly for ever a possible if man ever loved woman for ever think henry will do a much for fanny must not avoid faint smile have nothing to say can not imagine henry ever to have be happier continued mary presently than when have succeeded in getting brother commission have made sure push at fanny feeling here oh yes how very very kind of know must have exerted very much for know party have to move admiral hate trouble scorn asking favour there be so many young men claim to be attended to in same way that friendship energy not very determined be easily put by what happy creature william must be wish must see poor fanny mind be thrown into most distressing of variety recollection of what have be done for william be always most powerful disturber of decision against mr crawford sat thinking deeply of till mary who have be first watching complacently then musing on something else suddenly called attention by saying must like to sit talking with here day must not forget lady below so good bye dear amiable excellent fanny for though will nominally part in breakfast parlour must take leave of here do take leave longing for happy reunion trusting that when meet again will be under circumstance may open heart to other without remnant shadow of reserve very very kind embrace agitation of manner accompanied word will see cousin in town soon talk of being there tolerably soon sir thomas dare say in course of spring eldest cousin rushworths julia be sure of meeting again again have two favour to ask fanny one be correspondence must write to other that will often call on mr grant make amends for being gone first at least of favour fanny must rather not have be asked be impossible for to refuse correspondence be impossible for even not to accede to more readily than own judgment authorised there be resisting so much apparent affection disposition be peculiarly calculated to value fond treatment from having hitherto known so little of be more overcome by miss crawford besides there be gratitude towards for having made tete tete so much le painful than fear have predicted be over have escaped without reproach without detection secret be still own while be case thought must resign to almost everything in evening there be parting henry crawford came sat time with spirit not being previously in strongest state heart be softened for while towards because really seemed to feel quite unlike usual self scarcely said anything be evidently oppressed fanny must grieve for though hoping might never see again till be husband of other woman when came to moment of parting must take hand must not be denied said nothing however nothing that heard when have left room be better pleased that token of friendship have passed on morrow crawford be gone chapter xxxvii mr crawford gone sir thomas next object be that must be missed entertained great hope that niece must find blank in loss of attention at time have felt fancied evil have tasted of consequence in most flattering form did hope that loss of sinking again into nothing must awaken very wholesome regret in mind watched with idea must hardly tell with what success hardly knew whether there be difference in spirit not be always so gentle retiring that emotion be beyond discrimination did not understand felt that did not therefore applied to edmund to tell how stood affected on present occasion whether be more le happy than have be edmund did not discern symptom of regret thought father little unreasonable in supposing first three four day must produce what chiefly surprised edmund be that crawford sister friend companion who have be so much to must not be more visibly regretted wondered that fanny spoke so seldom of have so little voluntarily to say of concern at separation ala be sister friend companion who be now chief bane of fanny comfort if must have believed future fate a unconnected with mansfield a be determined brother must be if must have hoped return thither to be a distant a be much inclined to think must have be light of heart indeed more recollected observed more deeply be convinced that everything be now in fairer train for miss crawford marrying edmund than have ever be before on side inclination be stronger on hers le equivocal objection scruple of integrity seemed done away nobody must tell how doubt hesitation of ambition be equally got over equally without apparent reason must only be imputed to increasing attachment good bad feeling yielded to love such love must unite be to go to town a soon a business relative to thornton lacey be completed perhaps within fortnight talked of going loved to talk of when once with again fanny must not doubt rest acceptance must be a certain a offer yet there be bad feeling still remaining made prospect of most sorrowful to independently believed independently of self in very last conversation miss crawford in spite of amiable sensation much personal kindness have still be miss crawford still shewn mind led astray bewildered without suspicion of being so darkened yet fancying light might love did not deserve edmund by other sentiment fanny believed there be scarcely second feeling in common between may be forgiven by older sage for looking on chance of miss crawford future improvement a nearly desperate for thinking that if edmund influence in season of love have already done so little in clearing judgment regulating notion worth must be finally wasted on even in year of matrimony experience might have hoped more for young people so circumstanced impartiality must not have denied to miss crawford nature that participation of general nature of woman must lead to adopt opinion of man loved respected a own a such be fanny persuasion suffered very much from must never speak of miss crawford without pain sir thomas meanwhile went on with own hope own observation still feeling right by knowledge of human nature to expect to see effect of loss of power consequence on niece spirit past attention of lover producing craving for return be soon afterwards able to account for not yet completely indubitably seeing by prospect of visitor whose approach must allow to be quite enough to support spirit be watching william have obtained ten day leave of absence to be given to northamptonshire be coming happiest of lieutenant because latest made to shew happiness describe uniform came must have be delighted to shew uniform there too have not cruel custom prohibited appearance except on duty so uniform remained at portsmouth edmund conjectured that before fanny have chance of seeing own freshness freshness of wearer feeling must be worn away must be sunk into badge of disgrace for what can be more unbecoming more worthless than uniform of lieutenant who have be lieutenant year two see others made commander before so reasoned edmund till father made confidant of scheme placed fanny chance of seeing second lieutenant of hm thrush in glory in light scheme be that must accompany brother back to portsmouth spend little time with own family have occurred to sir thomas in one of dignified musing a right desirable measure before absolutely made up mind consulted son edmund considered way saw nothing what be right thing be good in must not be done at better time have doubt of being highly agreeable to fanny be enough to determine sir thomas decisive then so will be closed stage of business sir thomas retiring from with feeling of satisfaction view of good over above what have communicated to son for prime motive in sending away have very little to do with propriety of seeing parent again nothing at with idea of making happy certainly wished to go willingly a certainly wished to be heartily

advantage before be overflowing with gratitude artless maternal gratitude must not be unpleasing mr price be out regretted very much fanny be just recovered enough to feel that must not regret for to many other source of uneasiness be added severe one of shame for home in found might scold for weakness there be scolding away be ashamed must have be yet more ashamed of father than of rest talked of william subject on mr price must never tire mr crawford be a warm in commendation a even heart must wish felt that have never seen so agreeable man in life be only astonished to find so great so

than faint blush after talking little more about subject in interest be most apparent crawford began to hint at expediency of early walk be lovely morning at season of year fine morning so often turned off that be wisest for everybody not to delay exercise such hint producing nothing soon proceeded to positive recommendation to mr price daughter to take walk without loss of time now came to understanding mr price appeared scarcely ever stirred out of door except of sunday owned must seldom with large family find time for walk must not then persuade daughter to take advantage of such

in mr crawford must be struck must be ashamed disgusted altogether must soon give up cease to have smallest inclination for match yet though have be so much wanting affection to be cured be sort of cure must be almost a bad a complaint believe there be scarcely young lady in united kingdom who must not rather put up with misfortune of being sought by clever agreeable man than have driven away by vulgarity of nearest relation mr crawford probably must not regard future father in law with idea of taking for model in dress a fanny instantly to great relief discerned father be very different man very different mr price in behaviour to most highly respected stranger from what be in own family at home manner now though not polished be more than passable be grateful animated manly expression be of attached father sensible man loud tone did very well in open air there be not single oath to be heard such be instinctive compliment to good manner of mr crawford be consequence what might fanny

though have seen dockyard again again hoping to be so much longer with fanny be very gratefully disposed to avail of if miss price be not afraid of fatigue a be somehow other ascertained inferred at least acted upon that be not at afraid to dockyard be to go for mr crawford mr price must have turned thither directly without smallest consideration for daughter errand in high street took care however that must be allowed to go to shop came out expressly to visit did not delay long for fanny must so little bear to excite impatience be waited for before gentleman a stood at door must do more than begin upon last naval regulation settle number of three decker now in commission companion be ready to proceed be then to set forward for dockyard at once walk must have be conducted according to

come to take daily survey of how thing went on who must prove far more worthy companion than after time two officer seemed very well satisfied going about together discussing matter of equal never failing interest while young people sat down upon timber in yard found seat on board vessel in stock went to look at fanny be most conveniently in want of rest crawford must not have wished more fatigued more ready to sit down must have wished sister away quick looking girl of susan age be very worst third in world totally different from lady bertram eye ear there be introducing main point

charity for everingham somebody must make everingham about dearer object than have ever be yet turned away wished must not say such thing be willing to allow might have more good quality than have be wont to suppose began to feel possibility of turning out well at last be must ever be completely unsuited to ought not to think of perceived that enough have be said of everingham that must be a well to talk of something else turned to mansfield must not have chosen better be topic to bring back attention look almost instantly be real indulgence to to hear to speak of mansfield now so long divided from everybody who knew place felt quite voice of friend when mentioned led way to fond exclamation in praise of beauty comfort by honourable tribute to inhabitant allowed to gratify own heart in warmest eulogium in speaking of uncle a be clever good aunt a having sweetest of sweet temper have great attachment to mansfield said so looked forward with hope of spending much very much of time there always there in neighbourhood particularly built upon very happy summer autumn there year felt that must be so depended upon summer autumn infinitely superior to last a animated a diversified a

in vicinity of everything so dear for a to partnership in thornton lacey a edmund bertram once good humouredly proposed hope foresee two objection two fair excellent irresistible objection to plan fanny be doubly silenced here though when moment be passed must regret that have not forced into acknowledged comprehension of one half of meaning encouraged to say something more of sister edmund be subject must learn to speak of weakness shrunk from must soon be quite unpardonable when mr price friend have seen that wished have time for others be ready to return in course of walk back mr crawford contrived minute privacy for telling fanny that only business in portsmouth be to see that be come down for couple of day on account hers only because must not endure longer total separation be sorry really sorry yet in spite of two three other thing wished have not said thought altogether improved since have seen be much more gentle obliging attentive to other people feeling than have

share of beauty sunday dressed in cleanest skin best attire sunday always brought comfort to fanny on sunday felt more than ever poor mother now did not look so very unworthy of being lady bertram sister a be too apt to look often grieved to heart to think of contrast between to think that where nature have made so little difference circumstance must have made so much that mother a handsome a lady bertram year junior must have appearance so much more worn faded so comfortless so slatternly so shabby sunday made very creditable tolerably cheerful looking mr price coming abroad with fine family of child feeling little respite of weekly care only discomposed if saw boy run into danger rebecca pas by with flower in hat in chapel be obliged to divide mr crawford took care not to be

not acknowledge be letter to be run through eagerly to be read deliberately to supply matter for much reflection to leave everything in greater suspense than ever only certainty to be drawn from be that nothing decisive have yet taken place edmund have not yet spoken how miss crawford really felt how meant to act might act without against meaning whether importance to be quite what have be before last separation whether if lessened be likely to lessen more to recover be subject for endless conjecture to be thought of on day many day to come without producing conclusion idea returned

allow must hesitate must tease must condition must require great deal must finally accept be fanny be most frequent expectation house in town that thought must be impossible yet there be saying what miss crawford might not ask prospect for cousin grew worse worse woman who must speak of speak only of appearance what unworthy attachment to be deriving support from commendation of mr fraser who have known intimately year fanny be ashamed of part of letter related only to mr crawford touched in comparison slightly whether mr crawford went into norfolk before after th be certainly concern of hers though everything considered thought must go without delay miss crawford must endeavour to secure meeting between mr rushworth be in worst line of conduct grossly unkind ill judged hoped must not

must not indulge in dwelling on so beloved theme hoped be not wrong though after time susan very great admiration of everything said done in uncle house earnest longing to go into northamptonshire seemed almost to blame for exciting feeling must not be gratified poor susan be very little better fitted for home than elder sister a fanny grew thoroughly to understand began to feel that when own release from portsmouth came happiness must have material drawback in leaving susan behind that girl so capable of being made everything good must be left in such hand distressed more more be likely to have home to invite to what blessing must be have be possible for to return mr crawford regard probability of being very far from objecting to measure must have be greatest increase of own comfort

a possible at end of long letter instead of having to spread over largest part of page of own for though lady bertram rather shone in epistolary line having early in marriage from want of other employment circumstance of sir thomas being in parliament got into way of making keeping correspondent formed for very creditable common place amplifying style so that very little matter be enough for must not do entirely without must have something to write about even to niece being so soon to lose benefit of dr grant gouty symptom mr grant morning call be very hard upon to be deprived of one of last epistolary us must put to there be rich amends however preparing for lady bertram hour of good luck came within few day from receipt of edmund letter fanny have one from aunt beginning thus dear fanny take up pen to communicate very alarming intelligence make doubt will give much concern be great deal better than to have to take up pen to acquaint with particular of grant intended journey for

be a ready a physician to have letter despatched to mansfield distressing intelligence a may suppose observed ladyship after giving substance of have agitated exceedingly can not prevent from being greatly alarmed apprehensive for poor invalid whose state sir thomas fear may be very critical edmund kindly proposes attending brother immediately be happy to add sir thomas will not leave on distressing occasion a must be too trying for will greatly miss edmund in small circle trust hope will find poor invalid in le alarming state than might be apprehended that will be able to bring to mansfield shortly sir thomas proposes must be done think best on account flatter poor sufferer will soon be able to bear removal without material inconvenience injury a have little doubt of feeling for dear fanny under distressing circumstance will write again very soon fanny feeling on occasion be indeed considerably more warm genuine than aunt style of writing felt truly for tom dangerously ill edmund gone to attend sadly small party remaining at mansfield be care to shut out other care almost other must just find selfishness enough to wonder whether edmund have written to miss crawford before summons came sentiment dwelt long with be not purely affectionate disinterestedly anxious aunt did not neglect wrote again again be receiving frequent account from edmund account be a regularly transmitted to fanny in same diffuse style same medley of trust hope fear following producing other at haphazard be sort of playing at being frightened suffering lady bertram did not see have little

for fanny be finished in different style in language of real feeling alarm then wrote a might have spoken be just come dear fanny be taken upstairs be so shocked to see know what to do be sure have be

said to live upon letter pas time between suffering from of to day looking forward to to morrow without particular affection for eldest cousin tenderness of heart made feel that must not spare purity of principle added yet keener solicitude when considered how little useful how little self denying life have apparently be susan be only companion listener on a on more common occasion susan be always ready to hear to sympathise nobody else must be interested in so remote evil a illness in family above hundred mile off not even mr price beyond brief question two if saw daughter with letter in hand

apprehension father have imbibed from physician with respect to strong hectic symptom seemed to seize frame on departure of fever judged best that lady bertram must not be harassed by alarm be to be hoped must prove unfounded there be reason why fanny must not know truth be apprehensive for lung very few line from edmund shewed patient sickroom in juster stronger light than lady bertram sheet of paper must do there be hardly one in house who might not have described from personal observation better than not one who be not more useful at time to son must hing glide in quietly look at when able

impossible for to understand much of strange letter must only perceive that must relate to wimpole street mr crawford only conjecture that something very imprudent have just occurred in quarter to draw notice of world to excite jealousy in miss crawford apprehension if heard miss crawford need not be alarmed for be only sorry for party concerned for mansfield if report must spread so far hoped might not if rushworths be gone to mansfield a be to be inferred from what miss crawford said be not likely that anything unpleasant must have preceded at least must make impression a to mr crawford hoped might give knowledge of own disposition convince that be not capable of being steadily attached to one woman in world shame from persisting longer in addressing be very strange have begun to think really loved to fancy affection for something more than common sister still said that cared for nobody else yet there must have be marked display of attention to cousin there must have be strong indiscretion since correspondent be not of sort to regard slight one very uncomfortable be must continue till heard from miss crawford again be impossible to banish letter from thought must not relieve herself by speaking of to human being miss crawford need not have urged secrecy with so much warmth might have trusted to sense of what be due to cousin next day came brought second letter fanny be disappointed must still think of little else morning when father came back in afternoon with daily newspaper a usual be so far from expecting elucidation through channel that subject be for moment out of head be deep in other musing remembrance of first evening in room of father newspaper came across candle be now wanted sun be yet hour half above horizon felt that have indeed be three

sickly glare serving to bring forward stain dirt might otherwise have slept there be health gaiety in sunshine in town sat in blaze of oppressive heat in cloud of moving dust eye must only wander from wall marked by father head to table cut notched by brother where stood tea board never thoroughly cleaned cup saucer wiped in streak milk mixture of mote floating in thin blue bread butter growing minute more greasy than even rebecca hand have first produced father read newspaper mother lamented over ragged carpet a usual while tea be in preparation wished rebecca must mend fanny be first roused by calling out to after humphing considering over particular paragraph what be name of great cousin in town fan moment recollection enabled to say rushworth sir live in wimpole street yes sir then there be devil to pay among be there holding out paper to much good may such fine relation do know what sir thomas may think of such matter may be too much of courtier fine gentleman to like daughter le by g if belonged to 'd give rope end a long a must stand over little flogging for man woman too must be best way of preventing such thing fanny read to herself that be with infinite concern newspaper have to announce to world matrimonial fracas in family of mr r of wimpole street beautiful mr r whose name have not long be enrolled in list of hymen who have promised to become so brilliant leader in fashionable world having quitted husband roof in company with well known captivating mr c intimate friend associate of mr r be not known even to editor of newspaper whither be gone

about report to make much answer might be lie acknowledged so many fine lady be going to devil nowadays way that there be answering for anybody indeed hope be not true said mr price plaintively must be so very shocking if have spoken once to rebecca about carpet be sure have spoke at least dozen time have not betsey must not be ten minute work horror of mind like fanny a received conviction of such guilt began to take in part of misery must ensue can hardly be described at first be sort of stupefaction moment be quickening perception of horrible evil must not doubt dared not indulge hope of paragraph being false miss crawford letter have read so often a to make line own be in frightful conformity with eager defence of brother hope of being hushed up evident agitation be of piece with something very bad if there be woman of character in existence who must treat a trifle sin of first magnitude who must try to gloss over desire to have unpunished must believe miss crawford to be woman now must see own mistake a to who be gone said to be gone be not mr mr rushworth be mr rushworth mr crawford fanny seemed to herself never to have be shocked before there be possibility of rest evening passed without pause of misery night be totally sleepless passed only from feeling of sickness to shudderings of horror from hot fit of fever to cold event be so shocking that there be moment even when heart revolted from a impossible when thought must not be woman married only six month ago man professing devoted even engaged to that other near relation whole family family connected a be by tie upon tie friend intimate together be too horrible confusion of guilt too gross complication of evil for human nature not in state of utter barbarism to be capable of yet judgment told be so unsettled affection wavering with vanity maria decided attachment sufficient principle on side gave possibility miss crawford letter stampt fact what must be consequence whom must not injure whose view might not affect whose peace must not cut up for ever miss crawford edmund be dangerous perhaps to tread such ground confined tried to confine to simple indubitable family misery must envelop if

evening emma be a much pleased with manner a person quite determined to continue acquaintance be not struck by thing remarkably clever in miss smith conversation found altogether very engaging not inconveniently shy not unwilling to talk yet so far from pushing shewing so proper becoming deference seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to hartfield so artlessly impressed by appearance of thing in so superior style to what have be used to must have good sense deserve encouragement encouragement must be given soft blue eye natural grace must not be wasted on inferior society of highbury connexion acquaintance have already formed be unworthy of friend from whom have just parted though very good sort of people must be doing harm be family of name of martin whom emma well knew by character a renting large farm of mr knightley residing in parish of donwell very creditably believed knew mr knightley thought highly of must be coarse unpolished very unfit to be intimate of girl who wanted only little more knowledge elegance to be quite perfect must notice must improve must detach from bad acquaintance introduce into good society must form opinion manner must be interesting certainly very kind undertaking highly becoming own situation in life leisure power be so busy in admiring soft blue eye in talking listening forming scheme in in betweens that evening flew away at very unusual rate supper table always closed such party for have be used to sit watch due time be set out ready moved forward to fire before be aware with alacrity beyond common impulse of spirit yet be never indifferent to credit of doing thing well attentively with real good will of mind delighted with own idea did then do honour of meal help recommend minced chicken scalloped oyster with urgency knew must be acceptable to early hour civil scruple of guest upon such occasion poor mr woodhouses feeling be in sad warfare loved to have cloth laid because have be fashion of

off with highly gratified feeling delighted with affability with miss woodhouse have treated evening actually shaken hand with at last chapter iv harriet smith intimacy at hartfield be soon settled thing quick decided in way emma lost time in inviting encouraging telling to come very often a acquaintance increased so did satisfaction in other a walking companion emma have very early foreseen how useful might find in respect mr weston loss have be important father never went beyond shrubbery where two division of ground sufficed for long walk short a year varied since mr weston marriage exercise have be too much confined have ventured once alone to randalls be not pleasant harriet smith therefore one whom must summon at time to walk must be valuable addition to privilege in respect a saw more of approved be confirmed in kind design harriet certainly be not clever have sweet docile grateful disposition be totally free from conceit only desiring to be guided by one looked up to early attachment to herself be very amiable inclination for good company power of appreciating what be elegant clever shewed that there be want of taste though strength of understanding must not be expected altogether be quite convinced of harriet smith being exactly young friend wanted exactly something home required friend a mr weston be out of question two such must never be granted two such did not want be quite different sort of thing sentiment distinct independent mr weston be object of regard have basis in gratitude esteem harriet must be loved a one to whom must be useful for mr weston there be nothing to be done for harriet thing first attempt at usefulness be in endeavour to find out who be parent harriet must not tell be ready to tell thing in power on subject question be vain emma be obliged to fancy what liked must never believe that in same situation must not have discovered truth harriet have penetration have be satisfied to hear believe just what mr goddard chose to tell looked farther mr goddard teacher girl affair of school in general formed naturally great part of conversation for acquaintance with martin of abbey mill farm must have be whole martin occupied thought good deal have spent two very happy month with now loved to talk of pleasure of visit describe many comfort wonder of place emma encouraged talkativeness amused by such picture of set of being enjoying youthful simplicity must speak with so much exultation of mr martin having two parlour two very good parlour indeed one of quite a large a mr goddard drawing room of having upper maid who have lived five twenty year with of having eight cow two of alderneys one little welch cow very pretty little welch cow indeed of mr martin saying a be so fond of must be called cow of having very handsome summer house in garden where day next year be to drink tea very handsome summer house large enough to hold dozen people for time be amused without thinking beyond immediate cause a came to understand family better other feeling arose have taken up wrong idea fancying be mother daughter son son wife who lived together when appeared that mr martin who bore part in narrative be always mentioned with approbation for great good nature in doing something other be single man that there be young mr martin wife in case did suspect danger to poor little friend from hospitality kindness that if be not taken care of might be required to sink forever with inspiriting notion question increased in number meaning particularly led harriet to talk more of mr martin there be evidently dislike to harriet be very ready to speak of share have have in moonlight walk merry evening game dwelt good deal upon being so very good humoured obliging have gone three mile round one day in order to bring walnut because have said how fond be of in thing else be so very obliging have shepherd son into parlour one night on purpose to sing to be very fond of singing must sing little believed be very clever understood thing have very fine flock while be with have be bid more for wool than body in country believed body spoke well of mother sister be very fond of mr martin have told one day there be blush a said that be impossible for body to be better son therefore be sure whenever married must make good husband not that wanted to marry be in hurry at well done mr martin thought emma know what be about when have come away mr martin be so very kind a to send mr goddard beautiful goose finest goose mr goddard have ever seen mr goddard have dressed on sunday asked three teacher miss nash miss prince miss richardson to sup with mr martin suppose be not man of information beyond line of own business doe not read oh yes be know believe have read good deal not what must think thing of read agricultural report other book that lay in one of window seat read to sometimes of evening before went to card must read something aloud out of elegant extract very entertaining know have read vicar of wakefield never read romance of forest child of abbey have never heard of such book before mentioned be determined to get now a soon a ever can next question be what sort of looking man be mr martin oh not handsome not at handsome thought very plain at first think so plain now one doe not know after time did never see be in highbury now then be sure to ride through week in way to kingston have passed very often may be may have seen fifty time without having idea of name young farmer whether on horseback on foot be very last sort of person to raise curiosity yeomanry be precisely order of people with whom feel can have nothing to do degree two lower creditable appearance might interest might hope to be useful to family in way other farmer can need none of help be therefore in one sense a much above notice a in other be below to be sure oh yes be not likely must ever have observed know very well indeed mean by sight have doubt of being very respectable young man know indeed that be so a such wish well what do imagine age to be be four twenty th of last june birthday be rd just fortnight day difference be very odd only four twenty be too young to settle mother be perfectly right not to be in hurry seem very comfortable a be if be to take pain to marry must probably repent six year hence if must meet with good sort of young woman in same rank a own with little money might be very desirable six year hence dear miss woodhouse must be thirty year old well be a early a most men can afford to marry who be not born to independence mr martin imagine have fortune entirely to make can not be at beforehand with world money might come into when father died share of family property be dare say afloat employed in stock so forth though with diligence good luck may be rich in time be next to impossible that must have realised thing yet to be sure so be live very comfortably have indoors man else want for thing mr martin talk of taking boy year wish may not get into scrape harriet whenever doe marry mean a to being acquainted with wife for though sister from superior education be not to be altogether objected to doe not follow that might marry body at fit for to notice misfortune of birth ought to make particularly careful a to associate there can be doubt of being gentleman daughter must support claim to station by thing within own power there will be plenty of people who must take pleasure in degrading yes to be sure suppose there be while visit at hartfield be so kind to miss woodhouse be not afraid of what body can do understand force of influence pretty well harriet must have so firmly established in good society a to be independent even of hartfield miss woodhouse want to see permanently well connected to end will be advisable to have a few odd acquaintance a may be therefore say that if must still be in country when mr martin marries wish may not be drawn in by intimacy with sister to be acquainted with wife who will probably be mere farmer daughter without education to be sure yes not that think mr martin must ever marry body what have have education be very well brought up however mean to set up opinion against yours be sure will not wish for acquaintance of wife will always have great regard for miss martin especially elizabeth must be very sorry to give up for be quite a well educated a if marries very ignorant vulgar woman certainly have better not visit if can help emma watched through fluctuation of speech saw alarming symptom of love young man have be first admirer trusted there be other hold that there must be no serious difficulty on harriet side to oppose friendly arrangement of own met mr martin very next day a be walking on donwell road be on foot after looking very respectfully at looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at companion emma be not sorry to have such opportunity of survey walking few yard forward while talked together soon made quick eye sufficiently acquainted with mr robert martin appearance be very neat looked like sensible young man person have other advantage when came to be contrasted with gentleman thought must lose ground have gained in harriet inclination harriet be not insensible of manner have voluntarily noticed father gentleness with admiration a well a wonder mr martin looked a if did not know what manner be remained few minute together a miss woodhouse must not be kept waiting harriet then came running to with smiling face in flutter of spirit miss woodhouse hoped very soon to compose only think of happening to meet how very odd be quite chance said that have not gone round by randalls did not think ever walked road thought walked towards randalls most day have not be able to get romance of forest yet be so busy last time be at kingston that quite forgot go again to morrow so very odd must happen to meet well miss woodhouse be like what expected what do think of do think so very plain be very plain undoubtedly remarkably plain be nothing compared with entire want of gentility have right to expect much did not expect much have idea that must be so very clownish so totally without air have imagined confess degree two nearer gentility to be sure said harriet in mortified voice be not so genteel a real gentleman think harriet since acquaintance with have be repeatedly in company of such very real gentleman that must be struck with difference in mr martin at hartfield have have very good specimen of well educated well bred men must be surprized if after seeing must be in company with mr martin again without perceiving to be very inferior creature rather wondering at for having ever thought at agreeable before begin to feel that now be not struck be sure must have be struck by awkward look abrupt manner uncouthness of voice heard to be wholly unmodulated a stood here certainly be not like mr knightley have not such fine air way of walking a mr knightley see difference plain enough mr knightley be so very fine man mr knightley air be so remarkably good that be not fair to compare mr martin with might not see one in hundred with gentleman so plainly written a in mr knightley be not only gentleman have be lately used to what say to mr weston mr elton compare mr martin with of compare manner of carrying of walking of speaking of being silent must see difference oh yes there be great difference mr weston be almost old man mr weston must be between forty fifty make good manner more valuable older person grows more important be that manner must not be bad more glaring disgusting loudness coarseness awkwardness becomes what be passable in youth be detestable in later age mr martin be now awkward abrupt what will be at mr weston time of life there be saying indeed replied harriet rather solemnly there may be pretty good guessing will be completely gross vulgar farmer totally inattentive to appearance thinking of nothing profit loss will indeed will be very bad how much business engrosses already be very plain from circumstance of forgetting to inquire for book recommended be great deal too full of market to think of thing else be just a must be for thriving man what have to do with book have doubt that will thrive be very rich man in time being illiterate coarse need not disturb wonder did not remember book be harriet answer spoken with degree of grave displeasure emma thought might be safely left to therefore said more for time next beginning be in one respect perhaps mr elton manner be superior to mr knightley mr weston have more gentleness might be more safely held up a pattern there be openness quickness almost bluntness in mr weston body like in because there be so much good humour with must not do to be copied must mr knightley downright decided commanding sort of manner though suit very well figure look situation in life seem to allow if young man be to set about copying must not be sufferable on contrary think young man might be very safely recommended to take mr elton a model mr elton be good humoured cheerful obliging gentle seems to to be grown particularly gentle of late know whether have design of ingratiating with of harriet by additional softness strike that manner be softer than used to be if mean thing must be to please did not tell what said of other day then repeated warm personal praise have drawn from mr elton now did full justice to harriet blushed smiled said have always thought mr elton very agreeable mr elton be very person fixed on by emma for driving young farmer out of harriet head thought must be excellent match only too palpably desirable natural probable for to have much merit in planning feared be what body else must think of predict be not likely however that body must have equalled in date of plan a have entered brain during very first evening of harriet coming to hartfield longer considered greater be sense of expediency mr elton situation be most suitable quite gentleman without low connexion at same time not of family must fairly object to doubtful birth of harriet have comfortable home for emma imagined very sufficient income for though vicarage of highbury be not large be known to have independent property thought very highly of a good humoured well meaning respectable young man without deficiency of useful understanding knowledge of world have already satisfied that thought harriet beautiful girl trusted with such frequent meeting at hartfield be foundation enough on side on harriet there must be little doubt that idea of being preferred by must have usual weight efficacy be really very pleasing young man young man whom woman not fastidious might like be reckoned very handsome person much admired in general though not by there being want of elegance of feature must not dispense with girl who must be gratified by robert martin riding about country to get walnut for might very well be conquered by mr elton admiration chapter v know what opinion may be mr weston said mr knightley of great intimacy between emma harriet smith think bad thing bad thing do really think bad thing why so think will of do other good surprize emma must do harriet good by supplying with new object of interest harriet may be said to do emma good have be seeing intimacy with greatest pleasure how very differently feel not think will do other good will certainly be beginning of one of quarrel about emma mr knightley perhaps think be come on purpose to quarrel with knowing weston to be out that must still fight own battle mr weston must undoubtedly support if be here for think exactly a do on subject be speaking of only yesterday agreeing how fortunate be for emma that there must be such girl in highbury for to associate with mr knightley will not allow to be fair judge in case be so much used to live alone that know value of companion perhaps man can be good judge of comfort woman feel in society of one of own sex after being used to life can imagine objection to harriet smith be not superior young woman emma friend ought to be on other hand a emma want to see better informed will be inducement to to read more will read together mean know emma have be meaning to read more ever since be twelve year old have seen great many list of drawing up at various time of book that meant to read regularly through very good list be very well chosen very neatly arranged sometimes alphabetically sometimes by other rule list drew up when only fourteen remember thinking did judgment so much credit preserved time dare say may have made out very good list now have done with expecting course of steady reading from emma will never submit to thing requiring industry patience subjection of fancy to understanding where miss taylor failed to stimulate may safely affirm that harriet smith will hing never must persuade to read half so much a wished know must not dare say replied mr weston smiling thought so then since have parted can never remember emma omitting to do thing wished there be hardly desiring to refresh memory a said mr knightley feelingly for moment two have done soon added who have have such charm thrown over sens must still see hear remember emma be spoiled by being cleverest of family at ten year old have misfortune of being able to answer question puzzled sister at seventeen be always quick assured isabella slow diffident ever since be twelve emma have be mistress of house of in mother lost only person able to cope with inherits mother talent must have be under subjection to must have be sorry mr knightley to be dependent on recommendation have quitted mr woodhouse family wanted situation think must have spoken good word for to body be sure always thought unfit for office held yes said smiling be better placed here very fit for wife not at for governess be preparing to be excellent wife time be at hartfield might not give emma complete education a power must seem to promise be receiving very good education from on very material matrimonial point of submitting own will doing a be bid if weston have asked to recommend wife must certainly have named miss taylor thank there will be very little merit in making good wife to man a mr weston why to own truth be afraid be rather thrown away that with disposition to bear there will be nothing to be borne will not despair however weston may grow cross from wantonness of comfort son may plague hope not that be not likely mr knightley foretell vexation from quarter not indeed only name possibility pretend to emma genius for foretelling guessing hope with heart young man may be weston in merit churchill in fortune harriet smith have not half done about harriet smith think very worst sort of companion that emma must possibly have know nothing look upon emma a knowing thing be flatterer in way so much worse because undesigned ignorance be hourly flattery how can emma imagine have thing to learn while harriet be presenting such delightful inferiority a for harriet will venture to say that can not gain by acquaintance hartfield will only put out of conceit with other place belongs to will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable with among whom birth circumstance have placed home be much mistaken if emma doctrine give strength of mind tend at to make girl adapt rationally to variety of situation in life only give little polish depend more upon emma good sense than do be more anxious for present comfort for can not lament acquaintance how well looked last night oh must rather talk of person than mind must very well will not attempt to deny emma being pretty pretty say beautiful rather can imagine thing nearer perfect beauty than emma altogether face figure know what must imagine confess have seldom seen face figure more pleasing to than hers be partial old friend eye true hazle eye so brilliant regular feature open countenance with complexion oh what bloom of full health pretty height size such firm upright figure there be health not merely in bloom in air head glance one hears sometimes of child being 'the picture of health ' now emma always give idea of being complete picture of grown up health be loveliness mr knightley be not have not fault to find with person replied think describe love to look at will add praise think personally vain considering how very handsome be appears to be little occupied with vanity lie way mr weston be not to be talked out of dislike of harriet smith dread of doing harm mr knightley be equally stout in confidence of not doing harm with dear emma little fault be excellent creature where will see better daughter kinder sister truer friend have quality may be trusted will never lead one really wrong will make lasting blunder where emma errs once be in right hundred time very well will not plague more emma will be angel will keep spleen to myself till christmas brings john isabella john love emma with reasonable therefore not blind affection isabella always think a doe except when be not quite frightened enough about child be sure of having opinion with know that love really too well to be unjust unkind excuse mr knightley if take liberty consider know a having somewhat of privilege of speech that emma mother might have have liberty of hinting that think possible good can arise from harriet smith intimacy being made matter of much discussion among pray excuse supposing little inconvenience may be apprehended from intimacy can not be expected that emma accountable to nobody father who perfectly approves acquaintance must put end to so long a be source of pleasure to herself have be so many year province to give advice that can not be surprized mr knightley at little remains of office not at cried be much obliged to for be very good advice will have better fate than advice have often found for will be attended to mr john knightley be easily alarmed might be made unhappy about sister be satisfied said will not raise outcry will keep ill humour to have very sincere interest in emma isabella doe not seem more sister have never excited greater interest perhaps hardly so great there be anxiety curiosity in what one feel for emma wonder what will become of so do said mr weston gently very much always declares will never marry of course mean just nothing at have idea that have yet ever seen man cared for must not be bad thing for to be very much in love with proper object must like to see emma in love in doubt of return must do good there be nobody hereabouts to attach go so seldom from home there doe indeed seem a little to tempt to break resolution at

exactly will be 'exactly so a say doe sigh languish study for compliment rather more than must endure a principal come in for pretty good share a second be gratitude on harriet account chapter vii very day of mr elton going to london produced fresh occasion for emma service towards friend harriet have be at hartfield a usual soon after breakfast after time have gone home to return again to dinner returned sooner than have be talked of with agitated hurried look announcing something extraordinary to have happened be longing to tell minute brought out have heard a soon a got back to mr goddard that mr martin have be there hour before finding be not at home particularly expected have left little parcel for from one of sister gone away on opening parcel have actually found besides two song have lent elizabeth to copy letter to herself letter be from from mr martin contained direct proposal of marriage who must have thought be so surprized did not know what to do yes quite proposal of marriage very good letter at least thought so wrote a if really loved very much did not know so be come a fast a must to ask miss woodhouse what must do be half ashamed of friend for seeming so pleased so doubtful upon word cried young man be determined not to lose thing for want of asking will connect well if can will read letter cried harriet pray do 'd rather must emma be not sorry to be pressed read be surprized style of letter be much above expectation there be not merely grammatical error a composition must not have disgraced gentleman language though plain be strong unaffected sentiment conveyed very much to credit of writer be short expressed good sense warm attachment liberality propriety even delicacy of feeling paused over while harriet stood anxiously watching for opinion with well well be at last forced to add be good letter be too short yes indeed very good letter replied emma rather slowly so good letter harriet thing considered think one of sister must have helped can hardly imagine young man whom saw talking with other day must express so well if left quite to own power yet be not style of woman certainly be too strong concise not diffuse enough for woman doubt be sensible man suppose may have natural talent for think strongly clearly when take pen in hand thought naturally find proper word be so with men yes understand sort of mind vigorous decided with sentiment to certain point not coarse better written letter harriet returning than have expected well said still waiting harriet well what will do what will do in what respect do mean with regard to letter yes what be in doubt of must answer of course speedily yes what will say dear miss woodhouse do advise oh letter have much better be own will express very properly be sure there be danger of not being intelligible be first thing meaning must be unequivocal doubt demur such expression of gratitude concern for pain be inflicting a propriety requires will present unbidden to mind be persuaded need not be prompted to write with appearance of sorrow for disappointment think ought to refuse then said harriet looking down ought to refuse dear harriet what do mean be in doubt a to thought beg pardon perhaps have be under mistake certainly have be misunderstanding if feel in doubt a to purport of answer have imagined be consulting only a to wording of harriet be silent with little reserve of manner emma continued mean to return favourable answer collect be mean what will do what must advise to do pray dear miss woodhouse tell ought to do will not give advice harriet will have nothing to do with be point must settle with feeling have notion that liked so very much said harriet contemplating letter for little while emma persevered in silence beginning to apprehend bewitching flattery of letter might be too powerful thought best to say lay down a general rule harriet that if woman doubt a to whether must accept man not certainly ought to refuse if can hesitate a to 'yes ' ought to say 'no directly be not state to be safely entered into with doubtful feeling with heart thought duty a friend older than to say thus much to imagine want to influence oh be sure be great deal too kind to if must just advise have best do mean that a say one mind ought to be quite made up one must not be hesitating be very serious thing will be safer to say 'no perhaps do think have better say 'no ' not for world said emma smiling graciously must advise way must be best judge of own happiness if prefer mr martin to other person if think most agreeable man have ever be in company with why must hesitate blush harriet doe body else occur to at moment under definition harriet harriet deceive be run away with by gratitude compassion at moment whom be thinking of symptom be favourable instead of answering harriet turned away confused stood thoughtfully by fire though letter be still in hand be now mechanically twisted about without regard emma waited result with impatience not without strong hope at last with hesitation harriet said miss woodhouse a will not give opinion must do a well a can by have now quite determined really almost made up mind to refuse mr martin do think be right perfectly perfectly right dearest harriet be doing just what ought while be at in suspense kept feeling to myself now that be so completely decided have hesitation in approving dear harriet give joy of must have grieved to lose acquaintance must have be consequence of marrying mr martin while be in smallest degree wavering said nothing about because must not influence must have be loss of friend to must not have visited mr robert martin of abbey mill farm now be secure of for ever harriet have not surmised own danger idea of struck forcibly must not have visited cried looking aghast to be sure must not never thought of before must have be too dreadful what escape dear miss woodhouse must not give up pleasure honour of being intimate with for thing in world indeed harriet must have be severe pang to lose must have be must have thrown out of good society must have given up dear how must ever have borne must have killed never to come to hartfield more dear affectionate creature banished to abbey mill farm confined to society of illiterate vulgar life wonder how young man must have assurance to ask must have pretty good opinion of think be conceited either in general said harriet conscience opposing such censure at least be very good natured will always feel much obliged to have great regard for be quite different thing from know though may like doe not follow must certainly must confess that since visiting here have seen people if one come to compare person manner there be comparison at one be so very handsome agreeable however do really think mr martin very amiable young man have great opinion of being so much attached to writing letter a to leaving be what must not do upon consideration thank thank own sweet little friend will not be parted woman be not to marry man merely because be asked because be attached to can write tolerable letter oh be short letter too emma felt bad taste of friend let pas with very true must be small consolation to for clownish manner might be offending hour of day to know that husband must write good letter oh yes very nobody care for letter thing be to be always happy with pleasant companion be quite determined to refuse how will do what will say emma assured there must be difficulty in answer advised being written directly be agreed to in hope of assistance though emma continued to protest against assistance being wanted be in fact given in formation of sentence looking over letter again in replying to have such softening tendency that be particularly necessary to brace up with few decisive expression be so very much concerned at idea of making unhappy thought so much of what mother sister must think say be so anxious that must not fancy ungrateful that emma believed if young man have come in way at moment must have be accepted after letter however be written sealed sent business be finished harriet safe be rather low evening emma must allow for amiable regret sometimes relieved by speaking of own affection sometimes by bringing forward idea of mr elton will never be invited to abbey mill again be said in rather sorrowful tone if be must ever bear to part with harriet be great deal too necessary at hartfield to be spared to abbey mill be sure must never want to go there for be never happy at hartfield time afterwards be think mr goddard must be very much surprized if knew what have happened be sure miss nash must for miss nash think own sister very well married be only linen draper one must be sorry to see greater pride refinement in teacher of school harriet dare say miss nash must envy opportunity a of being married even conquest must appear valuable in eye a to thing superior for suppose be quite in dark attention of certain person can hardly be among tittle tattle of highbury yet hitherto fancy be only people to whom look manner have explained harriet blushed smiled said something about wondering that people must like so much idea of mr elton be certainly cheering still after time be tender hearted again towards rejected mr martin now have got letter said softly wonder what be doing whether sister know if be unhappy will be unhappy too hope will not mind so very much let think of among absent friend who be more cheerfully employed cried emma at moment perhaps mr elton be shewing picture to mother sister telling how much more beautiful be original after being asked for five six time allowing to hear name own dear name picture have left picture in bond street have so then know nothing of mr elton dear little modest harriet depend upon picture will not be in bond street till just before mount horse to morrow be companion evening solace delight open design to family introduces among diffuses through party pleasantest feeling of nature eager curiosity warm prepossession how cheerful how animated how suspicious how busy imagination be harriet smiled again smile grew stronger chapter viii harriet slept at hartfield night for week past have be spending more than half time there gradually getting to have bed room appropriated to herself emma judged best in respect safest kindest to keep with a much a possible just at present be obliged to go next morning for hour two to mr goddard be then to be settled that must return to hartfield to make regular visit of day while be gone mr knightley called sat time with mr woodhouse emma till mr woodhouse who have previously made up mind to walk out be persuaded by daughter not to defer be induced by entreaty of though against scruple of own civility to leave mr knightley for purpose mr knightley who have nothing of ceremony about be offering by short decided answer amusing contrast to protracted apology civil hesitation of other well believe if will excuse mr knightley if will not consider a doing very rude thing will take emma advice go out for quarter of hour a sun be out believe have better take three turn while can treat without ceremony mr knightley invalid think be privileged people dear sir make stranger of leave excellent substitute in daughter emma will be happy to entertain therefore think will beg excuse take three turn winter walk can not do better sir must ask for pleasure of company mr knightley be very slow walker pace must be tedious to besides have long walk before to donwell abbey thank sir thank be going moment think sooner go better will fetch greatcoat open garden door for mr woodhouse at last be off mr knightley instead of being immediately off likewise sat down again seemingly inclined for more chat began speaking of harriet speaking of with more voluntary praise than emma have ever heard before can not rate beauty a do said be pretty little creature be inclined to think very well of disposition character depends upon be with in good hand will turn out valuable woman be glad think so good hand hope may not be wanting come said be anxious for compliment so will tell that have improved have cured of school girl giggle really doe credit thank must be mortified indeed if did not believe have be of use be not body who will bestow praise where may often overpower with be expecting again say morning almost moment have be gone longer already than intended something have happened to delay visitor perhaps highbury gossip tiresome wretch harriet may not consider body tiresome that must emma knew be too true for contradiction therefore said nothing presently added with smile pretend to fix on time place must tell have good reason to believe little friend will soon hear of something to advantage indeed how so of what sort very serious sort assure still smiling very serious can think of one thing who be in love with who make confidant emma be more than half in hope of mr elton having dropt hint mr knightley be sort of general friend adviser knew mr elton looked up to have reason to think replied that harriet smith will soon have offer of marriage from most unexceptionable quarter robert martin be man visit to abbey mill summer seems to have done business be desperately in love mean to marry be very obliging said emma be sure that harriet mean to marry well well mean to make offer then will do came to abbey two evening ago on purpose to consult about know have thorough regard for family believe considers a one of best friend came to ask whether thought must be imprudent in to settle so early whether thought too young in short whether approved choice altogether having apprehension perhaps of being considered especially since making so much of a in line of society above be very much pleased with that said never hear better sense from one than robert martin always speaks to purpose open straightforward very well judging told thing circumstance plan what proposed doing in event of marriage be excellent young man a son brother have hesitation in advising to marry proved to that must afford that being case be convinced must not do better praised fair lady too altogether sent away very happy if have never esteemed opinion before must have thought highly of then dare say left house thinking best friend counsellor man ever have happened night before last now a may fairly suppose must not allow much time to pas before spoke to lady a doe not appear to have spoken yesterday be not unlikely that must be at mr goddard to day may be detained by visitor without thinking at tiresome wretch pray mr knightley said emma who have be smiling to herself through great part of speech how do know that mr martin did not speak yesterday certainly replied surprized absolutely know may be inferred be not whole day with come said will tell something in return for what have told did speak yesterday be wrote be refused be obliged to be repeated before must be believed mr knightley actually looked red with surprize displeasure a stood up in tall indignation said then be greater simpleton than ever believed what be foolish girl about oh to be sure cried emma be always incomprehensible to man that woman must ever refuse offer of marriage man always imago woman to be ready for body who asks nonsense man doe not imagine such thing what be meaning of harriet smith refuse robert martin madness if be so hope be mistaken saw answer nothing must be clearer saw answer wrote answer too emma be doing persuaded to refuse if did however be far from allowing must not feel that have done wrong mr martin be very respectable young man can not admit to be harriet equal be rather surprized indeed that must have ventured to address by account doe seem to have have scruple be pity that be ever got over not harriet equal exclaimed mr knightley loudly warmly with calmer asperity added few moment afterwards be not equal indeed for be a much superior in sense a in situation emma infatuation about girl blind be harriet smith claim of birth nature education to connexion higher than robert martin be natural daughter of nobody know whom with probably settled provision at certainly respectable relation be known only a parlour boarder at common school be not sensible girl girl of information have be taught nothing useful be too young too simple to have acquired thing herself at age can have experience with little wit be not very likely ever to have can avail be pretty be good tempered be only scruple in advising match be on account a being beneath desert bad connexion for felt that a to fortune in probability might do much better that a to rational companion useful helpmate must not do worse must not reason so to man in love be willing to trust to there being harm in to having that sort of disposition in good hand like might be easily led aright turn out very well advantage of match felt to be on side have not smallest doubt have now that there must be general cry out upon extreme good luck even satisfaction made sure of crossed mind immediately that must not regret friend leaving highbury for sake of being settled so well remember saying to myself 'even emma with partiality for harriet will think good match ' can not help wondering at knowing so little of emma a to say such thing what think farmer with sense merit mr martin be nothing more good match for intimate friend not regret leaving highbury for sake of marrying man whom must never admit a acquaintance of own wonder must think possible for to have such feeling assure mine be very different must think statement by mean fair be not just to harriet claim must be estimated very differently by others a well a mr martin may be richest of two be undoubtedly inferior a to rank in society sphere in move be much above must be degradation degradation to illegitimacy ignorance to be married to respectable intelligent gentleman farmer a to circumstance of birth though in legal sense may be called nobody will not hold in common sense be not to pay for offence of others by being held below level of with whom be brought up there can scarcely be doubt that father be gentleman gentleman of fortune allowance be very liberal nothing have ever be grudged for improvement comfort that be gentleman daughter be indubitable to that associate with gentleman daughter one apprehend will deny be superior to mr robert martin whoever might be parent said mr knightley whoever may have have charge of doe not appear to have be part of plan to introduce into what must call good society after receiving very indifferent education be left in mr goddard hand to shift a can to move in short in mr goddard line to have mr goddard acquaintance friend evidently thought good enough for be good enough desired nothing better till chose to turn into friend mind have distaste for own set ambition beyond be a happy a possible with martin in summer have sense of superiority then if have now have given have be friend to harriet smith emma robert martin must never have proceeded so far if have not felt persuaded of not being disinclined to know well have too much real feeling to address woman on haphazard of selfish passion a to conceit be farthest from of man know depend upon have encouragement be most convenient to emma not to make direct reply to assertion chose rather to take up own line of subject again be very warm friend to mr martin a said before be unjust to harriet harriet claim to marry well be not so contemptible a represent be not clever girl have better sense than be aware of doe not deserve to have understanding spoken of so slightingly waiving that point however supposing to be a describe only pretty good natured let tell that in degree posse be not trivial recommendation to world in general for be in fact beautiful girl must be thought so by ninety nine people out of hundred till appears that men be much more philosophic on subject of beauty than be generally supposed till do fall in love with well informed mind instead of handsome face girl with such loveliness a harriet have certainty of being admired sought after of having power of chusing from among many consequently claim to be nice good nature too be not so very slight claim comprehending a doe real thorough sweetness of temper manner very humble opinion of herself great readiness to be pleased with other people be very much mistaken if sex in general must not think such beauty such temper highest claim woman must posse upon word emma to hear abusing reason have be almost enough to make think so too better be without sense than misapply a do to be sure cried playfully know be feeling of know that girl a harriet be exactly what man delight in what at once bewitches sens satisfies judgment oh harriet may pick chuse be ever to marry be very woman for be at seventeen just entering into life just beginning to be known to be wondered at because doe not accept first offer receives pray let have time to look about have always thought very foolish intimacy said mr knightley presently though have kept thought to myself now perceive that will be very unfortunate one for harriet will puff up with such idea of own beauty of what have claim to in little while nobody within reach will be good enough for vanity working on weak head produce sort of mischief nothing so easy a for young lady to raise expectation too high miss harriet smith may not find offer of marriage flow in so fast though be very pretty girl men of sense may chuse to say want silly wife men of family must not be very fond of connecting with girl of such obscurity most prudent men must be afraid of inconvenience disgrace might be involved in when mystery of parentage came to be revealed let marry robert martin be safe respectable happy for ever if encourage to expect to marry greatly teach to be satisfied with nothing le than man of consequence large fortune may be parlour boarder at mr goddard rest of life at least for harriet smith be girl who will marry somebody other till grow desperate be glad to catch at old writing master son think so very differently on point mr knightley that there can be use in canvassing will only be making other more angry a to letting marry robert martin be impossible have refused so decidedly think a must prevent second application must abide by evil of having refused whatever may be a to refusal will not pretend to say might not influence little assure there be very little for for body to do appearance be so much against manner so bad that if ever be disposed to favour be not now can imagine that before have seen body superior might tolerate be brother of friend took pain to please altogether having seen nobody better must have be great assistant might not while be at abbey mill find disagreeable case be altered now know now what gentleman be nothing gentleman in education manner have chance with harriet nonsense errant nonsense a ever be talked cried mr knightley robert martin manner have sense sincerity good humour to recommend mind have more true gentility than harriet smith must understand emma made answer tried to look cheerfully unconcerned be really feeling uncomfortable wanting very much to be gone did not repent what have done still thought better judge of such point of female right refinement than must be yet have sort of habitual respect for judgment in general made dislike having so loudly against to have sitting just opposite to in angry state be very disagreeable minute passed in unpleasant silence with only one attempt on emma side to talk of weather made answer be thinking result of thought appeared at last in word robert martin have great loss if can think so hope will not be long before doe view for harriet be best known to yourself a make secret of love of match making be fair to suppose view plan project have a friend will just hint to that if elton be man think will be labour in vain emma laughed disclaimed continued depend upon will not do elton be very good sort of man very respectable vicar of highbury not at likely to make imprudent match know value of good income a well a body elton may talk sentimentally will act rationally be a well acquainted with own claim a can be with harriet know that be very handsome young man great favourite wherever go from general way of talking in unreserved moment when there be only men present be convinced that doe not mean to throw away have heard speak with great animation of large family of young lady that sister be intimate with who have twenty thousand pound apiece be very much obliged to said emma laughing again if have set heart on mr elton marrying harriet must have be very kind to open eye at present only want to keep harriet to have done with match making indeed must never hope to equal own doings at randalls will leave off while be well good morning to said rising walking off abruptly be very much vexed felt disappointment of young man be mortified to have be mean of promoting by sanction have given part be persuaded emma have taken in affair be provoking exceedingly emma remained in state of vexation too there be more indistinctness in cause of be than in did not always feel so absolutely satisfied with so entirely convinced that opinion be right adversary wrong a mr knightley walked off in more complete self approbation than left for be not so materially cast down however that little time return of harriet be very adequate restorative harriet staying away so long be beginning to make uneasy possibility of young man coming to mr goddard that morning meeting with harriet pleading own cause gave alarming idea dread of failure after became prominent uneasiness when harriet appeared in very good spirit without having such reason to give for long absence felt satisfaction settled with own mind convinced that let mr knightley think say what must have done nothing woman friendship woman feeling must not justify have frightened little about mr elton when considered that mr knightley must not have observed a have done neither with interest must be allowed to tell in spite of mr knightley pretension with skill of such observer on question a herself that have spoken hastily in anger be able to believe that have rather said what wished resentfully to be true than what knew thing about certainly might have heard mr elton speak with more unreserve than have ever done mr elton might not be of imprudent inconsiderate disposition a to money matter might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to then mr knightley did not make due allowance for influence of strong passion at war with interested motif mr knightley saw such passion of course thought nothing of effect saw too much of to feel doubt of overcoming hesitation that reasonable prudence might originally suggest more than reasonable becoming degree of prudence be very sure did not belong to mr elton be cheerful look manner established hers came back not to think of mr martin to talk of mr elton miss nash have be telling something repeated immediately with great delight mr perry have be to mr goddard to attend sick child miss nash have seen have told miss nash that a be coming back yesterday from clayton park have met mr elton found to great surprize mr be actually on road to london not meaning to return till morrow though be whist club night have be never known to miss before mr perry have remonstrated with about told how shabby be in best player to absent tried very much to persuade to put off journey only one day must not do mr elton have be determined to go on have said in very particular way indeed that be going on business must not put off for inducement in world something about very enviable commission being bearer of something exceedingly precious mr perry must not quite understand be very sure there must be lady in case told so mr elton only looked very conscious smiling rode off in great spirit miss nash have told have talked great deal more about mr elton said looking so very significantly at that did not pretend to understand what business might be only knew that woman whom mr elton must prefer must think luckiest woman in world for beyond doubt mr elton have not equal for beauty agreeableness chapter ix mr knightley might quarrel with emma must not quarrel with be so much displeased that be longer than usual before came to hartfield again when did meet grave look shewed that be not forgiven be sorry must not repent on contrary plan proceeding be more more justified endeared to by general appearance of next few day picture elegantly framed came safely to hand soon after mr elton return being hung over mantelpiece of common sitting room got up to look at sighed out half sentence of admiration just a ought a for harriet feeling be visibly forming into a strong steady attachment a youth sort of mind admitted emma be soon perfectly satisfied of mr martin being otherwise remembered than a furnished contrast with mr elton of utmost advantage to latter view of improving little friend mind by great deal of useful reading conversation have never yet led to more than few first chapter intention of going on to morrow be much easier to chat than to study much pleasanter to let imagination range work at harriet fortune than to be labouring to enlarge comprehension exercise on sober fact only literary pursuit engaged harriet at present only mental provision be making for evening of life be collecting transcribing riddle of sort that must meet with into thin quarto of hot pressed paper made up by friend ornamented with cipher trophy in age of literature such collection on very grand scale be not uncommon miss

much to honour of be handsome reply do see sir tolerably often asked isabella in plaintive tone just suited father mr woodhouse hesitated not near so often dear a must wish oh papa have missed seeing one entire day since married in morning evening of day excepting one have seen mr weston mr weston generally at randalls here a may suppose isabella most frequently here be very very kind in visit mr weston be really a kind a herself papa if speak in melancholy way will be giving isabella false idea of body must be aware that miss taylor must be missed body ought also to be assured that mr mr weston do really prevent missing by mean to extent anticipated be exact truth just a must be said mr john knightley just a hoped be from letter wish of shewing attention must not be doubted being disengaged social man make easy have be always telling love have idea of change being so very material to hartfield a apprehended now have emma account hope will be satisfied why to be sure said mr woodhouse yes certainly can not deny that mr weston poor mr weston doe come see pretty often then be always obliged to go away again must be very hard upon mr weston if did not papa quite forget poor mr weston think indeed said john knightley pleasantly that mr weston have little claim emma will venture to take part of poor husband being husband not being wife claim of man may very likely strike with equal force a for isabella have be married long enough to see convenience of putting mr weston aside a much a can love cried wife hearing understanding only in part be talking about be sure nobody ought to be can be greater advocate for matrimony than be if have not be for misery of leaving hartfield must never have thought of miss taylor a most fortunate woman in world a to slighting mr

never must comprehend how mr weston must part with to give up one child really never must think well of body who proposed thing to body else nobody ever did think well of churchill fancy observed mr john knightley coolly need not imagine mr weston to have felt what must feel in giving up henry john mr weston be rather easy cheerful tempered man than man of strong feeling take thing a find make enjoyment of somehow other depending suspect much more upon what be called society for comfort be upon power of eating drinking playing whist with neighbour five time week than upon family affection thing that home affords emma must not like what bordered on reflection on mr weston have half mind to take up struggled let pas must keep peace if possible there be something honourable valuable in strong domestic habit sufficiency of home to whence resulted brother disposition to look down on common rate of social intercourse to whom be important have high claim to forbearance chapter xii mr

reached point a must not wonder at brother in law breaking out mr perry said in voice of very strong displeasure must do a well to keep opinion till be asked for why doe make business of to wonder at what do at taking family to one part of coast may be allowed hope use of judgment a well a mr perry want direction more than drug paused growing cooler in moment added with only sarcastic dryness if mr perry can tell how to convey wife five child distance of hundred thirty mile with greater expense inconvenience than distance of forty must be a willing to prefer cromer to south end a must true true cried mr knightley with most ready interposition very true be consideration indeed john a to what be telling of idea of moving path to langham of turning more to right that may not cut through home meadow can not conceive difficulty must not attempt if be to be mean of inconvenience to highbury people if call to mind exactly present line of path only way of proving however will be to turn to map will see at abbey to morrow morning hope then will look over will give opinion mr woodhouse be rather agitated by such harsh reflection on friend perry to whom have in fact though unconsciously be attributing many of own feeling expression soothing attention of daughter gradually removed present evil immediate alertness of one brother better recollection of other prevented renewal of chapter xiii there must hardly be happier creature in world than mr john knightley in short visit to hartfield going about morning among old acquaintance with five child talking over what have done evening with father sister have nothing to wish otherwise that day did not pas so swiftly be delightful visit perfect in being much too short in general evening be le engaged with friend than morning one complete dinner engagement out of house too there be avoiding though at christmas mr weston must take denial must dine at randalls one day even mr woodhouse be persuaded to think possible thing in preference to division of party how be to be conveyed must have made difficulty if must a son daughter carriage horse be actually at hartfield be not able to make more than simple question on head hardly amounted to doubt did occupy emma long to convince that might in one of carriage find room for harriet also harriet mr elton mr knightley own especial set be only person invited to meet hour be to be early a well a number few mr woodhouse habit inclination being consulted in thing evening before great event for be very great event mr woodhouse must dine out on th of december have be spent by harriet at hartfield have gone home so much indisposed with cold for own earnest wish of being nursed by mr goddard emma must not have allowed to leave house emma called on next day found doom already signed with regard to randalls be very feverish have bad sore throat mr goddard be full of care affection mr perry be talked of harriet herself be too ill low to resist authority excluded from delightful engagement though must not speak of loss without many tear emma sat with a long a must to attend in mr goddard unavoidable absence raise spirit by representing how much mr elton must be depressed when knew state left at last tolerably comfortable in sweet dependence of having most comfortless visit of missing very much have not advanced many yard from mr goddard door when be met by mr elton evidently coming towards a walked on slowly together in conversation about invalid of whom on rumour of considerable illness have be going to inquire that might carry report of to hartfield be overtaken by mr john knightley returning from daily visit to donwell with two eldest boy whose healthy glowing face shewed benefit of country run seemed to ensure quick despatch of roast mutton rice pudding be hastening home for joined company proceeded together emma be just describing nature of friend complaint throat very much inflamed with great deal of heat about quick low pulse c be sorry to find from mr goddard that harriet be liable to very bad sore throat have often alarmed with mr elton looked alarm on occasion a exclaimed sore throat hope not infectious hope not of putrid infectious sort have perry seen indeed must take care of a well a of friend let entreat to run risk why doe not perry see emma who be not really at frightened tranquillised excess of apprehension by assurance of mr goddard experience care a there must still remain degree of uneasiness must not wish to reason away must rather feed assist than not added soon afterwards a if quite subject be so cold so very cold look feel so very much like snow that if be to other place with other party must really try not to go out to day dissuade father from venturing a have made up mind doe not seem to feel cold like to interfere a know must be so great disappointment to mr mr weston upon word mr elton in case must certainly excuse appear to little hoarse already when consider what demand of voice what fatigue to morrow will bring think must be no more than common prudence to stay at home take care of to night mr elton looked a if did not very well know what answer to make be exactly case for though very much gratified by kind care of fair lady not liking to resist advice of have not really least inclination to give up visit emma too eager busy in own previous conception view to hear impartially see with clear vision be very well satisfied with muttering acknowledgment of being very cold certainly very cold walked on rejoicing in having extricated from randalls secured power of sending to inquire after harriet hour of evening do quite right said will make apology to mr mr weston hardly have so spoken when found brother be civilly offering seat in carriage if weather be mr elton only objection mr elton actually accepting offer with much prompt satisfaction be done thing mr elton be to go never have broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at moment never have smile be stronger eye more exulting than when next looked at well said to herself be most strange after have got off so well to chuse to go into company leave harriet ill behind most strange indeed there be believe in many men especially single men such inclination passion for dining out dinner engagement be so high in class of pleasure employment dignity almost duty that thing give way to must be case with mr elton most valuable amiable pleasing young man undoubtedly very much in love with harriet still can not refuse invitation must dine out wherever be asked what strange thing love be can see ready wit in harriet will not dine alone for soon afterwards mr elton quitted must not do justice of feeling that there be great deal of sentiment in manner of naming harriet at parting in tone of voice while assuring that must call at mr goddard for news of fair friend last thing before prepared for happiness of meeting again when hoped to be able to give better report sighed smiled off in way left balance of approbation much in favour after few minute of entire silence between john knightley began with never in life saw man more intent on being agreeable than mr elton be downright labour to where lady be concerned with men can be rational unaffected when have lady to please feature work mr elton manner be not perfect replied emma where there be wish to please one ought to overlook one doe overlook great deal where man doe best with only moderate power will have advantage over negligent superiority there be such perfect good temper good will in mr elton a one can not value yes said mr john knightley presently with slyness seems to have great deal of good will towards replied with smile of astonishment be imagining to be mr elton object imagination have crossed own emma if never occurred to before may a well take into consideration now mr elton in love with what idea say be so will do well to consider whether be so not to regulate behaviour accordingly think manner to encouraging speak a friend emma have better look about ascertain what do what mean to do thank assure be quite mistaken mr elton be very good friend nothing more walked on amusing in consideration of blunder often arise from partial knowledge of circumstance of mistake people of high pretension to judgment be for ever falling into not very well pleased with brother for imagining blind ignorant in want of counsel said more mr woodhouse have so completely made up mind to visit that in spite of increasing coldness seemed to have idea of shrinking from set forward at last most punctually with eldest daughter in own carriage with le apparent consciousness of weather than of others too full of wonder of own going pleasure be to afford at randalls to see that be cold too well wrapt up to feel cold however be severe by time second carriage be in motion few flake of snow be finding way down sky have appearance of being so overcharged a to want only milder air to produce very white world in very short time emma soon saw that companion be not in happiest humour preparing going abroad in such weather with sacrifice of child after dinner be evil be disagreeables at least mr john knightley did not by mean like anticipated nothing in visit must be at worth purchase whole of drive to vicarage be spent by in expressing discontent man said must have very good opinion of when asks people to leave own fireside encounter such day a for sake of coming to see must think most agreeable fellow must not do thing be greatest absurdity actually snowing at moment folly of not allowing people to be comfortable at home folly of people not staying comfortably at home when can if be obliged to go out evening a by call of duty business what hardship must deem here be probably with rather thinner clothing than usual setting forward voluntarily without excuse in defiance of voice of nature tell man in thing given to view feeling to stay at home keep under shelter that can here be setting forward to spend five dull hour in man house with nothing to say to hear be not said heard yesterday may not be said heard again to morrow going in dismal weather to return probably in worse four horse four servant taken out for nothing to convey five idle shivering creature into colder room worse company than might have have at home emma did not find equal to give pleased assent doubt be in habit of receiving to emulate very true love must have be usually administered by travelling companion have resolution enough to refrain from making answer at must not be complying dreaded being quarrelsome heroism reached only to silence allowed to talk arranged glass wrapped up without opening lip arrived carriage turned step be let down mr elton spruce black smiling be with instantly emma thought with pleasure of change of subject mr elton be obligation cheerfulness be so very cheerful in civility indeed that began to think must have received different account of harriet from what have reached have sent while dressing answer have be much same not better report from mr goddard said presently be not so pleasant a have hoped 'not better ' be answer face lengthened immediately voice be voice of sentiment a answered oh be grieved to find be on point of telling that when called at mr goddard door did very last thing before returned to dress be told that miss smith be not better by mean better rather worse very much grieved concerned have flattered that must be better after such cordial a knew have be given her in morning emma smiled answered visit be of use to nervous part of complaint hope not even can charm away sore throat be most severe cold indeed mr perry have be with a probably heard yes imagined be did not have be used to in complaint hope to morrow morning will bring more comfortable report be impossible not to feel uneasiness sad loss to party to day dreadful exactly so indeed will be missed moment be very proper sigh accompanied be really estimable must have lasted longer emma be rather in dismay when only minute afterwards began to speak of other thing in voice of greatest alacrity enjoyment what excellent device said use of sheepskin for carriage how very comfortable make impossible to feel cold with such precaution contrivance of modern day indeed have rendered gentleman carriage perfectly complete one be so fenced guarded from weather that not breath of air can find way unpermitted weather becomes absolutely of consequence be very cold afternoon in carriage know nothing of matter have snow little see yes said john knightley think will have good deal of christmas observed mr elton quite seasonable extremely fortunate may think that did not begin yesterday prevent day party might very possibly have done for mr woodhouse must hardly have ventured have there be much snow on ground now be of consequence be quite season indeed for friendly meeting at christmas body invite friend about people think little of even worst weather be snowed up at friend house once for week nothing must be pleasanter went for only one night must not get away till very day se'nnight mr john knightley looked a if did not comprehend pleasure said only coolly can not wish to be snowed up week at randalls at time emma might have be amused be too much astonished now at mr elton spirit for other feeling harriet seemed quite forgotten in expectation of pleasant party be sure of excellent fire continued thing in greatest comfort charming people mr mr weston mr weston indeed be much beyond praise be exactly what one value so hospitable so fond of society will be small party where small party be select be perhaps most agreeable of mr weston dining room doe not accommodate more than ten comfortably for part must rather under such circumstance fall short by two than exceed by two think will agree with turning with soft air to emma think will certainly have approbation though mr knightley perhaps from being used to large party of london may not quite enter into feeling know nothing of large party of london sir never dine with body indeed in tone of wonder pity have idea that law have be so great slavery well sir time must come when will be paid for when will have little labour great enjoyment first enjoyment replied john knightley a passed through sweep gate will be to find safe at hartfield again chapter xiv change of countenance be necessary for gentleman a walked into mr weston drawing room mr elton must compose joyous look mr john knightley disperse ill mr elton must smile le mr john knightley more to fit for place emma only might be a nature prompted shew just a happy a be to be real enjoyment to be with weston mr weston be great favourite there be not creature in world to whom spoke with such unreserve a to wife not one to whom related with such conviction of being listened to understood of being always interesting always intelligible little affair arrangement perplexity pleasure of father must tell nothing of hartfield in mr weston have not lively concern hour uninterrupted communication of little matter on daily happiness of private life depends be one of first gratification of be pleasure perhaps whole day visit might not afford certainly did not belong to present half hour very sight of mr weston smile touch voice be grateful to emma determined to think a little a possible of mr elton oddity of thing else unpleasant enjoy be enjoyable to utmost misfortune of harriet cold have be pretty well gone through before arrival mr woodhouse have be safely seated long enough to give history of besides history of own isabella coming of emma being to follow have indeed just got to end of satisfaction that james must come see daughter when others appeared mr weston who have be almost wholly engrossed by attention to be able to turn away welcome dear emma emma project of forgetting mr elton for while made rather sorry to find when have taken place that be close to difficulty be great of driving strange insensibility towards harriet from mind while not only sat at elbow be continually obtruding happy countenance on notice solicitously addressing upon occasion instead of forgetting behaviour be such that must not avoid internal suggestion of can really be a brother imagined can be possible for man to be beginning to transfer affection from harriet to absurd insufferable yet must be so anxious for being perfectly warm must be so interested about father so delighted with mr weston at last must begin admiring drawing with so much zeal so little knowledge a seemed terribly like must be lover made effort with to preserve good manner for own sake must not be rude for harriet in hope that must yet turn out right be even positively civil be effort especially a something be going on amongst others in most overpowering period of mr elton nonsense particularly wished to listen to heard enough to know mr weston be giving information about son heard word son frank son repeated several time over from few other half syllable very much suspected that be announcing early visit from son before must quiet mr elton subject be so completely past that reviving question from must have be awkward now so happened that in spite of emma resolution of never marrying there be something in name in idea of mr frank churchill always interested have frequently thought especially since father marriage with miss taylor that if be to marry be very person to suit in age character condition seemed by connexion between family quite to belong to must not suppose to be match body who knew must think of mr mr weston did think of be very strongly persuaded though not meaning to be induced by by body else to give up situation believed more replete with good than must change for have great curiosity to see decided intention of finding pleasant of being liked by to certain degree sort of pleasure in idea of being coupled in friend imagination with such sensation mr elton civility be dreadfully ill timed have comfort of appearing very polite while feeling very cross of thinking that rest of visit must not possibly pas without bringing forward same information again substance of from open hearted mr weston so proved for when happily released from mr elton seated by mr weston at dinner made use of very first interval in care of hospitality very first leisure from saddle of mutton to say to want only two more to be just right number must like to see two more here pretty little friend miss smith son then must say be quite complete believe did not hear telling others in drawing room that be expecting frank have letter from morning will be with within fortnight emma spoke with very proper degree of pleasure fully assented to proposition of mr frank churchill miss smith making party quite complete have be wanting to come to continued mr weston ever since september letter have be full of can not command own time have to please who must be pleased who between ourselves be sometimes to be pleased only by good many sacrifice now have doubt of seeing here about second week in january what very great pleasure will be to mr weston be so anxious to be acquainted with that must be almost a happy a yes must be that think there will be put off doe not depend upon coming so much a do doe not know party so well a do case see be be quite between ourselves did not mention syllable of in other room there be secret in family know case be that party of friend be invited to pay visit at enscombe in january frank coming depends upon being put off if be not put off can not stir know will because be family that certain lady of consequence at enscombe have particular dislike to though be thought necessary to invite once in two three year always be put off when come to point have not smallest doubt of issue be a confident of seeing frank here before middle of january a be of being here good friend there nodding towards upper end of table have so few vagary have be so little used to at hartfield that can not calculate on effect a have be long in practice of doing be sorry there must be thing like doubt in case replied emma be disposed to side with mr weston if think will come will think so too for know enscombe yes have right to knowledge though have never be at place in life be odd woman never allow to speak ill of on frank account for do believe to be very fond of used to think be not capable of being fond of body except have always be kind to in way allowing for little whim caprice expecting thing to be a like be small credit in opinion to that must excite affection for though must not say to body else have more heart than stone to people in general devil of temper emma liked subject so well that began upon to mr weston very soon after moving into drawing room wishing joy yet observing that knew first meeting must be rather alarming mr weston agreed to added that must be very glad to be secure of undergoing anxiety of first meeting at time talked of for can not depend upon coming can not be so sanguine a mr weston be very much afraid that will end in nothing mr weston dare say have be telling exactly how matter stand yes seems to depend upon nothing ill humour of mr churchill imagine to be most certain thing in world emma replied mr weston smiling what be certainty of caprice then turning to isabella who have not be attending before must know dear mr knightley that be by mean so sure of seeing mr frank churchill in opinion a father think depends entirely upon aunt spirit pleasure in short upon temper to to two daughter may venture on truth mr churchill rule at enscombe be very odd tempered woman coming now depends upon being willing to spare oh mr churchill body know mr churchill replied isabella be sure never think of poor young man without greatest compassion to be constantly living with ill tempered person must be dreadful be what happily have never known thing of must be life of misery what blessing that never have child poor little creature how unhappy must have made emma wished have be alone with mr weston must then have heard more mr weston must speak to with degree of unreserve must not hazard with isabella really believed must scarcely try to conceal thing relative to churchill from excepting view on young man of own imagination have already given such instinctive knowledge at present there be nothing more to be said mr woodhouse very soon followed into drawing room to be sitting long after dinner be confinement that must not endure wine conversation be thing to gladly did move to with whom be always comfortable while talked to isabella however emma found opportunity of saying so consider visit from son a by mean certain be sorry for introduction must be unpleasant whenever take place sooner must be over better yes delay make one more apprehensive of other delay even if family braithwaites be put off be still afraid that excuse may be found for disappointing can not bear to imagine reluctance on side be sure there be great wish on churchill to keep to there be jealousy be jealous even of regard for father in short can feel dependence on coming wish mr be le sanguine ought to come said emma if must stay only couple of day ought to come one can hardly conceive young man be not having in power to do a much a that young woman if fall into bad hand may be teased kept at distance from want to be with one can not comprehend young man being under such restraint a not to be able to spend week with father if like one ought to be at enscombe know way of family before one decides upon what can do replied mr weston one ought to use same caution perhaps in judging of conduct of one individual of one family enscombe believe certainly must not be judged by general rule be so very unreasonable thing give way to be so fond of nephew be so very great favourite now according to idea of mr churchill must be most natural that while make sacrifice for comfort of husband to whom owes thing while exercise incessant caprice towards must frequently be governed by nephew to whom owes nothing at dearest emma pretend with sweet temper to understand bad one to lay down rule for must let go own way have doubt of having at time considerable influence may be perfectly impossible for to know beforehand when will be emma listened then coolly said will not be satisfied unless come may have great deal of influence on point continued mr weston on others very little among on be beyond reach be too likely may be very circumstance of coming away from to visit chapter xv mr woodhouse be soon ready for tea when have drank tea be quite ready to go home be a much a three companion must do to entertain away notice of lateness of hour before other gentleman appeared mr weston be chatty convivial friend to early separation of sort at last drawing room party did receive augmentation mr elton in very good spirit be one of first to walk in mr weston emma be sitting together on sofa joined immediately with scarcely invitation seated between emma in good spirit too from amusement afforded mind by expectation of mr frank churchill be willing to forget late impropriety be a well satisfied with a before on making harriet very first subject be ready to listen with most friendly smile professed extremely anxious about fair friend fair lovely amiable friend did know have heard thing about since being at randalls felt much anxiety must confess that nature of complaint alarmed considerably in style talked on for time very properly not much attending to answer altogether sufficiently awake to terror of bad sore throat emma be quite in charity with at last there seemed perverse turn seemed at once a if be more afraid of being bad sore throat on account than on harriet more anxious that must escape infection than that there must be infection in complaint began with great earnestness to entreat to refrain from visiting sick chamber again for present to entreat to promise not to venture into such hazard till have seen mr perry learnt opinion though tried to laugh off bring subject back into proper course there be putting end to extreme solicitude about be vexed did appear there be concealing exactly like pretence of being in love with instead of harriet inconstancy if real most contemptible abominable have difficulty in behaving with temper turned to mr weston to implore assistance must not give support must not add persuasion to to induce miss woodhouse not to go to mr goddard till be certain that miss smith disorder have infection must not be satisfied without promise must not give influence in procuring so scrupulous for others continued yet so careless for wanted to nurse cold by staying at home to day yet will not promise to avoid danger of catching ulcerated sore throat be fair mr weston judge between have not right to complain be sure of kind support aid emma saw mr weston surprize felt that must be great at address in word manner be assuming to right of first interest in a for herself be too much provoked offended to have power of directly saying thing to purpose must only give look be such look a thought must restore to sens then left sofa removing to seat by sister giving attention have not time to know how mr elton took reproof so rapidly did subject succeed for mr john knightley now came into room from examining weather opened on with information of ground being covered with snow of still snowing fast with strong drifting wind concluding with word to mr woodhouse will prove spirited beginning of winter engagement sir something new for coachman horse to be making way through storm of snow poor mr woodhouse be silent from consternation body else have something to say body be surprized not surprized have question to ask comfort to offer mr weston emma tried earnestly to cheer turn attention from son in law who be pursuing triumph rather unfeelingly admired resolution very much sir said in venturing out in such weather for of course saw there must be snow very soon body must have seen snow coming on admired spirit dare say will get home very well hour two snow can hardly make road impassable be two carriage if one be blown over in bleak part of common field there will be other at hand dare say will be safe at hartfield before midnight mr weston with triumph of different sort be confessing that have known to be snowing time have not said word lest must make mr woodhouse uncomfortable be excuse for hurrying away a to there being quantity of snow fallen likely to fall to impede return be mere joke be afraid must find difficulty wished road might be impassable that might be able to keep at randalls with utmost good will be sure that accommodation might be found for body calling on wife to agree with that with little contrivance body might be lodged hardly knew how to do from consciousness of there being two spare room in house what be to be done dear emma what be to be done be mr woodhouse first exclamation that must say for time to looked for comfort assurance of safety representation of excellence of horse of james of having so many friend about revived little eldest daughter alarm be equal to own horror of being blocked up at randalls while child be at hartfield be full in imagination fancying road to be now just passable for adventurous people in state admitted delay be eager to have settled that father emma must remain at randalls while husband set forward instantly through possible accumulation of drifted snow might impede have better order carriage directly love said dare say will be able to get along if set off directly if do come to thing very bad can get out walk be not at afraid must not mind walking way must change shoe know moment got home be not sort of thing give cold indeed replied then dear isabella be most extraordinary sort of thing in world for in general thing doe give cold walk home be prettily shod for walking home dare say will be bad enough for horse isabella turned to mr weston for approbation of plan mr weston must only approve isabella then went to emma emma must not so entirely give up hope of being able to get away be still discussing point when mr knightley who have left room immediately after brother first report of snow came back again told that have be out of door to examine must answer for there not being smallest difficulty in getting home whenever liked either now hour hence have gone beyond sweep way along highbury road snow be nowhere above inch deep in many place hardly enough to whiten ground very few flake be falling at present cloud be parting there be appearance of being soon over have seen coachman agreed with in there being nothing to apprehend to isabella relief of such tidings be very great be scarcely le acceptable to emma on father account who be immediately set a much at ease on subject a nervous constitution allowed alarm have be raised must not be appeased so a to admit of comfort for while continued at randalls be satisfied of there being present danger in returning home assurance must convince that be safe to stay while others be variously urging recommending mr knightley emma settled in few brief sentence thus father will not be easy why go be ready if others be will ring bell yes do bell be rung carriage spoken for few minute more emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in own house to get sober cool other recover temper happiness when visit of hardship be over carriage came mr woodhouse always first object on such occasion be carefully attended to own by mr knightley mr weston not that must say must prevent renewal of alarm at sight of snow have actually fallen discovery of much darker night than have be prepared for be afraid must have very bad drive be afraid poor isabella must not like there must be poor emma in carriage behind did not know what have best do must keep a much together a must james be talked to given charge to go very slow wait for other carriage isabella stept in after father john knightley forgetting that did not belong to party stept in after wife very naturally so that

begun scarcely have passed sweep gate joined other carriage than found subject cut up hand seized attention demanded mr elton actually making violent love to availing of precious opportunity declaring sentiment must be already well known hoping fearing adoring ready to die if refused flattering that ardent attachment unequalled love unexampled passion must not fail of having effect in short very much resolved on being seriously accepted a soon a possible really be so without scruple without apology without much apparent diffidence mr elton lover of harriet be professing lover tried to stop vainly must go on say angry a be thought of moment made resolve to restrain when did speak felt that folly must be drunkenness therefore must hope that might belong only to passing hour accordingly with mixture of serious playful hoped must best suit half half state replied be very much astonished mr elton to forget take for friend message to miss smith will be happy to deliver more of to if please miss smith message to miss smith what must possibly mean repeated word with such assurance of accent such boastful pretence of amazement that must not help replying with quickness mr elton be most extraordinary conduct can account for only in one way be not must not speak to of harriet in such manner command enough to say more will endeavour to forget mr elton have only drunk wine enough to elevate spirit not at to confuse intellect perfectly knew own meaning having warmly protested against suspicion a most injurious slightly touched upon respect for miss smith a friend acknowledging wonder that miss smith must be mentioned at resumed subject of own passion be very urgent for favourable answer a thought le of inebriety thought more of inconstancy presumption with fewer struggle for politeness replied be impossible for to doubt longer have made too clear mr elton astonishment be much beyond thing can express after such behaviour a have witnessed during last month to miss smith such attention a have be in daily habit of observing to be addressing in manner be unsteadiness of character indeed have not supposed possible believe sir be far very far from gratified in being object of such profession good heaven cried mr elton what can be meaning of miss smith never thought of miss smith in whole course of existence never paid attention a friend never cared whether be dead alive a friend if have fancied otherwise own wish have misled be very sorry extremely sorry miss smith indeed oh miss woodhouse who can think of miss smith when miss woodhouse be near upon honour there be unsteadiness of character have thought only of protest against having paid smallest attention to one else thing have said done for many week past have be with sole view of marking adoration of can not really seriously doubt no in accent meant to be insinuating be sure have seen understood must be impossible to say what emma felt on hearing of unpleasant sensation be uppermost be too completely overpowered to be immediately able to reply two moment of silence being ample encouragement for mr elton sanguine state of mind tried to take hand again a joyously exclaimed charming miss woodhouse allow to interpret interesting silence confesses that have long understood sir cried emma confesses such thing so far from having long understood have be in most complete error with respect to view till moment a to be very sorry that must have be giving way to feeling nothing must be farther from wish attachment to friend harriet pursuit of pursuit appeared gave great pleasure have be very earnestly wishing success have supposed that be not attraction to hartfield must certainly have thought judged ill in making visit so frequent be to believe that have never sought to recommend particularly to miss smith that have never thought seriously of never madam cried affronted in turn never assure think seriously of miss smith miss smith be very good sort of girl must be happy to see respectably settled wish extremely well doubt there be men who might not object to body have level a for be not think quite so much at loss need not so totally despair of equal alliance a to be addressing to miss smith madam visit to hartfield have be for only encouragement received encouragement give encouragement sir have be entirely mistaken in supposing have seen only a admirer of friend in other light must have be more to than common acquaintance be exceedingly sorry be well that mistake end where doe have same behaviour continued miss smith might have be led into misconception of view not being aware probably more than myself of very great inequality be so sensible of a be disappointment be single trust will not be lasting have thought of matrimony at present be too angry to say word manner too decided to invite supplication in state of swelling resentment mutually deep mortification have to continue together few minute longer for fear of mr woodhouse have confined to foot pace if there have not be so much anger there must have be desperate awkwardness straightforward emotion left room for little zigzag of embarrassment without knowing when carriage turned into vicarage lane when stopped found at once at door of house be out before syllable passed emma then felt indispensable to wish good night compliment be just returned coldly proudly under indescribable irritation of spirit be then conveyed to hartfield there be welcomed with utmost delight by father who have be trembling for danger of solitary drive from vicarage lane turning corner must never bear to think of in strange hand mere common coachman james there seemed a if return only be wanted to make thing go well for mr john knightley ashamed of ill humour be now kindness attention so particularly solicitous for comfort of father a to seem if not quite ready to join in basin of gruel perfectly sensible of being exceedingly wholesome day be concluding in peace comfort to little party except mind have never be in such perturbation needed very strong effort to appear attentive cheerful till usual hour of separating allowed relief of quiet reflection chapter xvi hair be curled maid sent away emma sat down to think be miserable be wretched business indeed overthrow of thing have be wishing for development of thing most unwelcome such blow for harriet be worst of part of brought pain humiliation of sort other compared with evil to harriet be light must gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken more in error more disgraced by mi judgment than actually be must effect of blunder have be confined to herself if have not persuaded harriet into liking man must have borne thing might have doubled presumption to poor harriet how must have be so deceived protested that have never thought seriously of harriet never looked back a well a must be confusion have taken up idea supposed made thing bend to manner however must have be unmarked wavering dubious must not have be so misled picture how eager have be about picture charade hundred other circumstance how clearly have seemed to point at harriet to be sure charade with ready wit then soft eye in fact suited be jumble without taste truth who must have seen through such thick headed nonsense certainly have often especially of late thought manner to herself unnecessarily gallant have passed a way a mere error of judgment of knowledge of taste a one proof among others that have not always lived in best society that with gentleness of address true elegance be sometimes wanting till very day have never for instant suspected to mean thing grateful respect to a harriet friend to mr john knightley be indebted for first idea on subject for first start of possibility there be denying that brother have penetration remembered what mr knightley have once said to about mr elton caution have given conviction have professed that mr elton must never marry indiscreetly blushed to think how much truer knowledge of character have be there shewn than have reached be dreadfully mortifying mr elton be proving in many respect very reverse of what have meant believed proud assuming conceited very full of own claim little concerned about feeling of others contrary to usual course of thing mr elton wanting to pay address to have sunk in opinion profession proposal did service thought nothing of attachment be insulted by hope wanted to marry well having arrogance to raise eye to pretended to be in love be perfectly easy a to not suffering disappointment need be cared for there have be no real affection either in language manner sigh fine word have be given in abundance must hardly devise set of expression fancy tone of voice allied with real love need not trouble to pity only wanted to aggrandise enrich if miss woodhouse of hartfield heiress of thirty thousand pound be not quite so easily obtained a have fancied must soon try for miss somebody else with twenty with ten that must talk of encouragement must consider a aware of view accepting attention meaning in short to marry must suppose equal in connexion mind look down upon friend so well understanding gradation of rank below be so blind to what rose above a to fancy shewing presumption in addressing be most provoking perhaps be not fair to expect to feel how very much be inferior in talent elegancies of mind very want of such equality might prevent perception of must know that in fortune consequence be greatly superior must know that woodhouses have be settled for several generation at younger branch of very ancient family that eltons be nobody landed property of hartfield certainly be inconsiderable being sort of notch in donwell abbey estate to rest of highbury belonged fortune from other source be such a to make scarcely secondary to donwell abbey in other kind of consequence woodhouses have long held high place in consideration of neighbourhood mr elton have first entered not two year ago to make way a must without alliance in trade thing to recommend to notice situation civility have fancied in love with evidently must have be dependence after raving little about seeming incongruity of gentle manner conceited head emma be obliged in common honesty to stop admit that own behaviour to have be so complaisant obliging so full of courtesy attention a supposing real motive unperceived might warrant man of ordinary observation delicacy like mr elton in fancying very decided favourite if have so misinterpreted feeling have little right to wonder that with self interest to blind must have mistaken hers first error worst lay at door be foolish be wrong to take so active part in bringing two people together be adventuring too far assuming too much making light of what ought to be serious trick of what ought to be simple be quite concerned ashamed resolved to do such thing more here have said actually talked poor harriet into being very much attached to man might never have thought of for certainly never must have thought of with hope if have not assured her of attachment for be a modest humble a used to think oh have be satisfied with persuading not to accept young martin there be quite right be well done of there must have stopped left rest to time chance be introducing into good company giving opportunity of pleasing one worth having ought not to have attempted more now poor girl peace be cut up for time have be friend to if be not to feel disappointment so very much be sure have not idea of body else who must be at desirable for william coxe oh must not endure william coxe pert young lawyer stopt to blush laugh at own relapse then resumed more serious more dispiriting cogitation upon what have be might be must be distressing explanation have to make to harriet poor harriet must be suffering with awkwardness of future meeting difficulty of continuing discontinuing acquaintance of subduing feeling concealing resentment avoiding eclat be enough to occupy in most unmirthful reflection time longer went to bed at last with nothing settled conviction of having blundered most dreadfully to youth natural cheerfulness like emma though under temporary gloom at night return of day will hardly fail to bring return of spirit youth cheerfulness of morning be in happy analogy of powerful operation if distress be not poignant enough to keep eye unclosed will be sure to open to sensation of softened pain brighter hope emma got up on morrow more disposed for comfort than have gone to bed more ready to see alleviation of evil before to depend on getting tolerably out of be great consolation that mr elton must not be really in love with so particularly amiable a to make shocking to disappoint that harriet nature must not be of superior sort in feeling be most acute retentive that there must be necessity for body knowing what have passed except three principal especially for father being given moment uneasiness about be very cheering thought sight of great deal of snow on ground did further service for thing be welcome that might justify three being quite asunder at present weather be most favourable for though christmas day must not go to church mr woodhouse must have be miserable have daughter attempted be therefore safe from exciting receiving unpleasant most unsuitable idea ground covered with snow atmosphere in unsettled state between frost thaw be of others most unfriendly for exercise morning beginning in rain snow evening setting in to freeze be for many day most honourable prisoner intercourse with harriet possible by note church for on sunday more than on christmas day need to find excuse for mr elton absenting be weather might fairly confine body at home though hoped believed to be really taking comfort in society other be very pleasant to have father so well satisfied with being alone in own house too wise to stir out to hear say to mr knightley whom weather must keep entirely from ah mr knightley why stay at home like poor mr elton day of confinement must have be for private perplexity remarkably comfortable a such seclusion exactly suited brother whose feeling must always be of great importance to companion have besides so thoroughly cleared off ill humour at randalls that amiableness never failed during rest of stay at hartfield be always agreeable obliging speaking pleasantly of body with hope of cheerfulness present comfort of delay there be still such evil hanging over in hour of explanation with harriet a made impossible for emma to be ever perfectly at ease chapter xvii mr mr john knightley be not detained long at weather soon improved enough for to move who must move mr woodhouse having a usual tried to persuade daughter to stay behind with child be obliged to see whole party set off return to lamentation over destiny of poor isabella poor isabella passing life with doated on full of merit blind to fault always innocently busy might have be model of right feminine evening of very day on went brought note from mr elton to mr woodhouse long civil ceremonious note to say with mr elton best compliment that be proposing to leave following morning in way to bath where in compliance with pressing entreaty of friend have engaged to spend few week very much regretted impossibility be under from various circumstance of weather business of taking personal leave of mr woodhouse of whose friendly civility must ever retain grateful sense have mr woodhouse command must be happy to attend to emma be most agreeably surprized mr elton absence just at time be very thing to be desired admired for contriving though not able to give much credit for manner in be announced resentment must not have be more plainly spoken than in civility to father from be so pointedly excluded have not even share in opening compliment name be not mentioned there be so striking change in ill judged solemnity of leave taking in graceful acknowledgment a thought at first must not escape father suspicion did however father be quite taken up with surprize of so sudden journey fear that mr elton might never get safely to end of saw nothing extraordinary in language be very useful note for supplied with fresh matter for thought conversation during rest of lonely evening mr woodhouse talked over alarm emma be in spirit to persuade away with usual promptitude now resolved to keep harriet longer in dark have reason to believe nearly recovered from cold be desirable that must have a much time a possible for getting better of other complaint before gentleman return went to mr goddard accordingly very next day to undergo necessary penance of communication severe one be have to destroy hope have be so industriously feeding to appear in ungracious character of one preferred acknowledge grossly mistaken mi judging in idea on one subject observation conviction prophecy for last six week confession completely renewed first shame sight of harriet tear made think that must never be in charity with herself again harriet bore intelligence very well blaming nobody in thing testifying such ingenuousness of disposition lowly opinion of a must appear with particular advantage at moment to friend emma be in humour to value simplicity modesty to utmost be amiable ought to be attaching seemed on harriet side not own harriet did not consider a having thing to complain of affection of such man a mr elton must have be too great distinction never must have deserved nobody so partial kind friend a miss woodhouse must have thought possible tear fell abundantly grief be so truly artless that dignity must have made more respectable in emma eye listened to tried to console with heart understanding really for time convinced that harriet be superior creature of two that to resemble must be more for own welfare happiness than genius intelligence must do be rather too late in day to set about being simple minded ignorant left with previous resolution confirmed of being humble discreet repressing imagination rest of life second duty now inferior only to father claim be to promote harriet comfort endeavour to prove own affection in better method than by match making got to hartfield shewed most unvarying kindness striving to occupy amuse by book conversation to drive mr elton from thought time knew must be allowed for being thoroughly done must suppose indifferent judge of such matter in general very inadequate to sympathise in attachment to mr elton in particular seemed to reasonable that at harriet age with entire extinction of hope progress might be made towards state of composure by time of mr elton return a to allow to meet again in common routine of acquaintance without danger of betraying sentiment increasing harriet did think perfection maintained non existence of body equal to in person goodness did in truth prove more resolutely in love than emma have foreseen yet appeared to so natural so inevitable to strive against inclination of sort unrequited that must not comprehend continuing very long in equal force if mr elton on return made own indifference a evident indubitable a must not doubt must anxiously do must not imagine harriet persisting to place happiness in sight recollection of being fixed so absolutely fixed in same place be bad for for three not one of have power of removal of effecting material change of society must encounter other make best of harriet be farther unfortunate in tone of companion at mr goddard mr elton being adoration of teacher great girl in school must be at hartfield only that must have chance of hearing spoken of with cooling moderation repellent truth where wound have be given there must cure be found if anywhere emma felt that till saw in way of cure there must be true peace for chapter xviii mr frank churchill did not come when time proposed drew near mr weston fear be justified in arrival of letter of excuse for present must not be spared to very great mortification regret still looked forward with hope of coming to randalls at distant period mr weston be exceedingly disappointed much more disappointed in fact than husband though dependence on seeing young man have be so much more sober sanguine temper though for ever expecting more good than occurs doe not always pay for hope by proportionate depression soon fly over present failure begin to hope again for hour mr weston be surprized sorry then began to perceive frank coming two three month later must be much better plan better time of year better weather that must be able without doubt to stay considerably longer with than if have come sooner feeling rapidly restored comfort while mr weston of more apprehensive disposition foresaw nothing repetition of excuse delay after concern for what husband be to suffer great deal more emma be not at time in state of spirit to care really about mr frank churchill not coming except a disappointment at randalls acquaintance at present have charm for wanted rather to be quiet out of temptation still a be desirable that must appear in general like usual self took care to express a much interest in circumstance enter a warmly into mr mr weston disappointment a might naturally belong to friendship be first to announce to mr knightley exclaimed quite a much a be necessary being acting part perhaps rather more at conduct of churchill in keeping away then proceeded to say good deal more than felt of advantage of such addition to confined society in surry pleasure of looking at somebody new gala day to highbury entire sight of must have made ending with reflection on churchill again found directly involved in disagreement with mr knightley to great amusement perceived that be taking other side of question from real opinion making use of mr weston argument against churchill be very likely in fault said mr knightley coolly dare say might come if must know why must say so wish exceedingly to come uncle aunt will not spare can not believe that have not power of coming if made point of be too unlikely for to believe without proof how odd be what have mr frank churchill done to make suppose such unnatural creature be not supposing at unnatural creature in suspecting that may have learnt to be above connexion to care very little for thing own pleasure from living with who have always set example of be great deal more natural than one must wish that young man brought up by who be proud luxurious selfish must be proud luxurious selfish too if frank churchill have wanted to see father must have contrived between september january man at age what be three four twenty can not be without mean of doing a much a that be impossible that be easily said easily felt by who have always be own master be worst judge in world mr knightley of difficulty of dependence know what be to have temper to manage be not to be conceived that man of three four twenty must not have liberty of mind limb to amount can not want money can not want leisure know on contrary that have so much of that be glad to get rid of at idlest haunt in kingdom hear of for ever at watering place other little while ago be at weymouth prof that can leave churchill yes sometimes can time be whenever think worth while whenever there be temptation of pleasure be very unfair to judge of body conduct without intimate knowledge of situation nobody who have not be in interior of family can say what difficulty of individual of family may be ought to be acquainted with enscombe with mr churchill temper before pretend to decide upon what nephew can do may at time be able to do great deal more than can at others there be one thing emma man can always do if chuses be duty not by manoeuvring finessing by vigour resolution be frank churchill duty to pay attention to father know to be so by promise message if wished to do might be done man who felt rightly must say at once simply resolutely to mr churchill 'every sacrifice of mere pleasure will always find ready to make to convenience must go see father immediately know must be hurt by failing in such mark of respect to on present occasion will therefore set off to morrow ' if must say so to at once in tone of decision becoming man there must be opposition made to going said emma laughing perhaps there might be made to coming back again such language for young man entirely dependent to use nobody mr knightley must imagine possible have not idea of what be requisite in situation directly opposite to own mr frank churchill to be making such speech a to uncle aunt who have brought up be to provide for standing up in middle of room suppose speaking a loud a must how can imagine such conduct practicable depend upon emma sensible man must find difficulty in must feel in right declaration made of course a man of sense must make in proper manner must do more good raise higher fix interest stronger with people depended on than that line of shift expedient can ever do respect must be added to affection must feel that must trust that nephew who have done rightly by father must do rightly by for know a well a doe a well a world must know that ought to pay visit to father while meanly exerting power to delay be in heart not thinking better of for submitting to whim respect for right conduct be felt by body if must act in sort of manner on principle consistently regularly little mind must bend to rather doubt that be very fond of bending little mind where little mind belong to rich people in authority think have knack of swelling out till be quite a unmanageable a great one can imagine that if a be mr knightley be to be transported placed at once in mr frank churchill situation must be able to say do just what have be recommending for might have very good effect churchill might not have word to say in return then must have habit of early obedience long observance to break through to who have might not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence set claim on gratitude regard at nought may have a strong sense of what must be right a can have without being so equal under particular circumstance to act up to then must not be so strong sense if failed to produce equal exertion must not be equal conviction oh difference of situation habit wish must try to understand what amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly opposing whom a child boy have be looking up to life amiable young man be very weak young man if be first occasion of carrying through resolution to do right against will of others ought to have be habit with by time of following duty instead of consulting expediency can allow for fear of child not of man a became rational ought to have roused shaken off be unworthy in authority ought to have opposed first attempt on side to make slight father have begun a ought there must have be difficulty now will never agree about cried emma be nothing extraordinary have not least idea of being

agreeable can have english delicacy towards feeling of other people nothing really amiable about seem determined to think ill of not at replied mr knightley rather displeased want to think ill of must be a ready to acknowledge merit a other man hear of none except what be merely personal that be well grown good looking with smooth plausible manner well if have nothing else to recommend will be treasure at highbury often look upon fine young men well bred agreeable must not be nice ask for virtue into bargain can not imagine mr knightley what sensation coming will produce there will be one

without being at ashamed of love for mr mr weston give decided prejudice in favour be person never think of from one month end to said mr knightley with degree of vexation made emma immediately talk of something else though must not comprehend why must be angry to take dislike to young man only because appeared to be of different disposition from be unworthy real liberality of mind be always used

suffer to be so know have wife family to maintain be not to be giving away time well now have just given hint of what jane writes about will turn to letter be sure tell own story great deal better than can tell for be afraid must be running away said emma glancing at harriet beginning to rise father will be expecting have intention thought have power of staying more than five minute when first entered house merely called because must not pas door without inquiring after mr bates have be so pleasantly detained now however must wish mr bates good morning not must be urged to detain succeeded

colonel campbell who have very highly regarded fairfax a excellent officer most deserving young man farther have be indebted to for such attention during severe camp fever a believed have saved life be claim did not learn to overlook though year passed away from death of poor fairfax before own return to england put thing in power when did return sought out child took notice of be married man with only one living child girl about jane age jane became guest paying long visit growing favourite with before be nine year old daughter great fondness for own wish of being real friend united to produce offer from colonel campbell of undertaking whole charge of education be accepted from period jane have belonged to colonel campbell family have lived with entirely only visiting grandmother from time to time plan be that must be brought up for educating others very few hundred pound inherited from father making independence impossible to provide for otherwise be out of colonel campbell power for though income by pay appointment be handsome fortune be moderate must be daughter by giving education hoped to be supplying mean of respectable subsistence hereafter such be jane fairfax history have fallen into good hand known nothing kindness from campbell be given excellent education living constantly with right minded well informed people heart understanding have received advantage of discipline culture colonel campbell residence being in london lighter talent have be done full justice to by attendance of first rate master disposition ability be equally worthy of friendship must do at eighteen nineteen be a far a such early age can be qualified for care of child fully competent to office of instruction be too much beloved to be parted with father mother must promote daughter must not endure evil day be put off be easy to decide that be still too young jane remained with sharing a daughter in rational pleasure of elegant society judicious mixture of home amusement with only drawback of future sobering suggestion of own good understanding to remind that might soon be over affection of whole family warm attachment of miss campbell in particular be more honourable to party from circumstance of jane decided superiority in beauty acquirement that nature have given in feature must not be unseen by young woman must higher power of mind be unfelt by parent continued together with unabated regard however till marriage of miss campbell who by chance that luck so often defies anticipation in matrimonial affair giving attraction to what be moderate rather than to what be superior engaged affection of mr dixon young man rich agreeable almost a soon a be acquainted be eligibly happily settled while jane fairfax have yet bread to earn event have very lately taken place too lately for thing to be yet attempted by le fortunate friend towards entering on path of duty though have now reached age own judgment have fixed on for beginning have long resolved that one twenty must be period with fortitude of devoted novitiate have resolved at one twenty to complete sacrifice retire from pleasure of life of rational intercourse equal society peace hope to penance mortification for ever good sense of colonel mr campbell must not oppose resolution though feeling did a long a lived exertion must be necessary home might be hers for ever for own comfort must have retained wholly must be selfishness what must be at last have better be soon perhaps began to feel might have be kinder wiser to have resisted temptation of delay spared from taste of such enjoyment of ease leisure a must now be relinquished still however affection be glad to catch at reasonable excuse for not hurrying on wretched moment have never be quite well since time of daughter marriage till must have completely recovered usual strength must forbid engaging in duty so far from being compatible with weakened frame varying spirit seemed under most favourable circumstance to require something more than human perfection of body mind to be discharged with tolerable comfort with regard to not accompanying to ireland account to aunt contained nothing truth though there might be truth not told be own choice to give time of absence to highbury to spend perhaps last month of perfect liberty with kind relation to whom be so very dear campbell might be motive motif whether single double treble gave arrangement ready sanction said that depended more on few month spent in native air for recovery of health than on thing else certain be that be to come that highbury instead of welcoming that perfect novelty have be so long promised mr frank churchill must put up for present with jane fairfax who must bring only freshness of two year absence emma be sorry to have to pay civility to person did not like through three long month to be always doing more than wished le than ought why did not like jane fairfax might be difficult question to answer mr knightley have once told be because saw in really accomplished young woman wanted to be thought though accusation have be eagerly refuted at time there be moment of self examination in conscience must not quite acquit must never get acquainted with did not know how be there be such coldness reserve such apparent indifference whether pleased not then aunt be such eternal talker be made fuss with by body have be always imagined that be to be so intimate because age be same body have supposed must be so fond of other be reason have better be dislike so little just imputed fault be so magnified by fancy that never saw jane fairfax first time after considerable absence without feeling that have injured now when due visit be paid on arrival after two year interval be particularly struck with very appearance manner for two whole year have be depreciating jane fairfax be very elegant remarkably elegant have highest value for elegance height be pretty just such a almost body must think tall nobody must think very tall figure particularly graceful size most becoming medium between fat thin though slight appearance of ill health seemed to point out likeliest evil of two emma must not feel then face feature there be more beauty in altogether than have remembered be not regular be very pleasing beauty eye deep grey with dark eye lash eyebrow have never be denied praise skin have be used to cavil at a wanting colour have clearness delicacy really needed fuller bloom be style of beauty of elegance be reigning character a such must in honour by principle admire elegance whether of person of mind saw so little in highbury there not to be vulgar be distinction merit in short sat during first visit looking at jane fairfax with twofold complacency sense of pleasure sense of rendering justice be determining that must dislike no longer when took in history indeed situation a well a beauty when considered what elegance be destined to what be going to sink from how be going to live seemed impossible to feel thing compassion respect especially if to well known particular entitling to interest be added highly probable circumstance of attachment to mr dixon have so naturally started to herself in case nothing must be more pitiable more honourable than sacrifice have resolved on emma be very willing now to acquit of having seduced mr dixon action from wife of thing mischievous imagination have suggested at first if be love might be simple single successless love on side alone might have be unconsciously sucking in sad poison while sharer of conversation with friend from best purest of motif might now be denying visit to ireland resolving to divide effectually from connexion by soon beginning career of laborious duty upon whole emma left with such softened charitable feeling a made look around in walking home lament that highbury afforded young man worthy of giving independence nobody that must wish to scheme about for be charming feeling not lasting before have committed by public profession of eternal friendship for jane fairfax done more towards recantation of past prejudice error than saying to mr knightley certainly be handsome be better than handsome jane have spent evening at hartfield with grandmother aunt thing be relapsing much into usual state former provocation reappeared aunt be a tiresome a ever more tiresome because anxiety for health be now added to admiration of power have to listen to description of exactly how little bread butter ate for breakfast how small slice of mutton for dinner a well a to see exhibition of new cap new workbag for mother jane offence rose again have music emma be obliged to play thanks praise necessarily followed appeared to affectation of candour air of greatness meaning only to shew off in higher style own very superior performance be besides be worst of so cold so cautious there be getting at real opinion wrapt up in cloak of politeness seemed determined to hazard nothing be disgustingly be suspiciously reserved if thing must be more where be most be more reserved on subject of weymouth dixons than thing seemed bent on giving real insight into mr dixon character own value for company opinion of suitableness of match be general approbation smoothness nothing delineated distinguished did service however caution be thrown away emma saw artifice returned to first surmise there probably be something more to conceal than own preference mr dixon perhaps have be very near changing one friend for other be fixed only to miss campbell for sake of future twelve thousand pound like reserve prevailed on other topic mr frank churchill have be at weymouth at same time be known that be little acquainted not syllable of real information must emma procure a to what truly be be handsome believed be reckoned very fine young man be agreeable be generally thought so did appear sensible young man young man of information at watering place in common london acquaintance be difficult to decide on such point manner be must be safely judged of under much longer knowledge than have yet have of mr churchill believed body found manner pleasing emma must not forgive chapter iii emma must not forgive a provocation resentment be discerned by mr knightley who have be of party have seen only proper attention pleasing behaviour on side be expressing next

feel that must hope be by giving first information to save from hearing abruptly from others be now about time that be likely to call if be to meet miss bates in way upon beginning to rain emma be obliged to expect that weather must be detaining at mr goddard that intelligence must undoubtedly rush upon without preparation shower be heavy short have not be over five minute when in came harriet with just heated agitated look hurrying thither with full heart be likely to give oh miss woodhouse what do think have happened instantly burst forth have evidence of corresponding perturbation a blow be given emma felt that must not now shew greater kindness than in listening harriet unchecked ran eagerly through what have to tell have set out from mr goddard hour ago have be afraid must rain have be afraid must pour down moment thought might get to hartfield first have hurried on a fast a possible then a be passing by house where young woman be making up gown for thought must just step in see how went on though did not seem to stay moment there soon after came out began to rain did not know what to do so ran on directly a fast a must took shelter at ford ford be principal woollen draper linen draper haberdasher shop united shop first in size fashion in place so there have set without idea of thing in world full ten minute perhaps when of sudden who must come in to be sure be so very odd always dealt at ford who must come in martin brother dear miss woodhouse only think thought must have fainted did not know what to do be sitting near door elizabeth saw directly did not be busy with umbrella be sure saw looked away directly took notice went to quite farther end of shop kept sitting near door oh dear be so miserable be sure must have be a white a gown must not go away know because of rain did so wish anywhere in world there oh dear miss woodhouse well at last fancy looked round saw for instead of going on with buying began whispering to one be sure be talking of must not help thinking that be persuading to speak to do think be miss woodhouse for presently came forward came quite up to asked how did seemed ready to shake hand if must did not do of in same way that used must see be altered however seemed to try to be very friendly shook hand stood talking time know more what said be in such tremble remember said be sorry never met now thought almost too kind dear miss woodhouse be absolutely miserable by time be beginning to hold up be determined that nothing must stop from getting away then only think found be coming up towards too slowly know a if did not quite know what to do so came spoke answered stood for minute feeling dreadfully know one ca tell how then took courage said did not rain must go so off set have not got three yard from door when came after only to say if be going to hartfield thought have much better go round by mr cole stable for must find near way quite floated by rain oh dear thought must have be death of so said be very much obliged to know must not do le then went back to elizabeth came round by stable believe did hardly knew where be thing about oh miss woodhouse must rather done thing than have happen yet know there be sort of satisfaction in seeing behave so pleasantly so kindly elizabeth too oh miss woodhouse do talk to make comfortable again very sincerely did emma wish to do so be not immediately in power be obliged to stop think be not thoroughly comfortable young man conduct sister seemed result of real feeling must not pity a harriet described there have be interesting mixture of wounded affection genuine delicacy in behaviour have believed to be well meaning worthy people before what difference did make in evil of connexion be folly to be disturbed by of course must be sorry to lose must be sorry ambition a well a love have probably be mortified might have hoped to rise by harriet acquaintance besides be value of harriet description so easily pleased so little discerning what signified praise exerted did try to make comfortable by considering have passed a mere trifle quite unworthy of being dwelt on might be distressing for moment said seem to have behaved extremely well be over may never can never a first meeting occur again therefore need not think about harriet said very true must not think about still talked of still must talk of nothing else emma at last in order to put martin out of head be obliged to hurry on news have meant to give with so much tender caution hardly knowing whether to rejoice be angry ashamed only amused at state of mind in poor harriet such conclusion of mr elton importance with mr elton right however gradually revived though did not feel first intelligence a might have done day before hour before interest soon increased before first conversation be over have talked into sensation of curiosity wonder regret pain pleasure a to fortunate miss hawkins must conduce to place martin under proper subordination in fancy emma learned to be rather glad that there have be meeting have be serviceable in deadening first shock without retaining influence to alarm a harriet now lived martin must not get at without seeking where hitherto have wanted either courage condescension to seek for since refusal of brother sister never have be at mr goddard twelvemonth might pas without being thrown together again with necessity even power of speech chapter iv human nature be so well disposed towards who be in interesting situation that young person who marries dy be sure of being kindly spoken of week have not passed since miss hawkins name be first mentioned in highbury before be by mean other discovered to have recommendation of person mind to be handsome elegant highly accomplished perfectly amiable when mr elton arrived to triumph in happy prospect circulate fame of merit there be very little more for to do than to tell christian name say whose music principally played mr elton returned very happy man have gone away rejected mortified disappointed in very sanguine hope after series of what appeared to strong encouragement not only losing right lady finding debased to level of very wrong one have gone away deeply offended came back engaged to to a superior of course to first a under such circumstance what be gained always be to what be lost came back gay self satisfied eager busy caring nothing for miss woodhouse defying miss smith charming augusta hawkins in addition to usual advantage of perfect beauty merit be in possession of independent fortune of so many thousand a must always be called ten point of dignity a well a convenience story told well have not thrown away have gained woman of l thereabouts have gained with such delightful rapidity first hour of introduction have be so very soon followed by distinguishing history have to give mr cole of rise progress of affair be so glorious step so quick from accidental rencontre to dinner at mr green party at mr brown smile blush rising in importance with consciousness agitation richly scattered lady have be so easily impressed so sweetly disposed have in short to use most intelligible phrase be so very ready to have vanity prudence be equally contented have caught substance shadow fortune affection be just happy man ought to be talking only of own concern expecting to be congratulated ready to be laughed at with cordial fearless smile now addressing young lady of place to whom few week ago must have be more cautiously gallant wedding be distant event a party have only to please nothing necessary preparation to wait for when set out for bath again there be general expectation certain glance of mr cole did not seem to contradict when next entered highbury must bring bride during present short stay emma have barely seen just enough to feel that first meeting be over to give impression of not being improved by mixture of pique pretension now spread over air be in fact beginning very much to wonder that have ever thought pleasing at sight be so inseparably connected with very disagreeable feeling except in moral light a penance lesson source of profitable humiliation to own mind must have be thankful to be assured of never seeing again wished very well gave pain welfare twenty mile off must administer most satisfaction pain of continued residence in highbury however must certainly be lessened by marriage many vain solicitude must be prevented many awkwardness smoothed by mr elton must be excuse for change of intercourse former intimacy might sink without remark must be almost beginning life of civility again of lady individually emma thought very little be good enough for mr elton doubt accomplished enough for highbury handsome enough to look plain probably by harriet side a to connexion there emma be perfectly easy persuaded that after own vaunted claim disdain of harriet have done nothing on article truth seemed attainable what be must be uncertain who be might be found out setting aside l did not appear that be at harriet superior brought name no blood alliance miss hawkins be youngest of two daughter of bristol merchant of course must be called a whole of profit of mercantile life appeared so very moderate be not unfair to guess dignity of line of trade have be very moderate also part of winter have be used to spend in bath bristol be home very heart of bristol for though father mother have died year ago uncle remained in law line nothing more distinctly honourable be hazarded of than that be in law line with daughter have lived emma guessed to be drudge of attorney too stupid to rise grandeur of connexion seemed dependent on elder sister who be very well married to gentleman in great way near bristol who kept two carriage be wind up of history be glory of miss hawkins must have given harriet feeling about have talked into love ala be not so easily to be talked out of charm of object to occupy many vacancy of harriet mind be not to be talked away might be superseded by certainly must indeed nothing must be clearer even robert martin must have be sufficient nothing else feared must cure harriet be one of who having once begun must be always in love now poor girl be considerably worse from reappearance of mr elton be always having glimpse of somewhere other emma saw only once two three time day harriet be sure just to meet with just to miss just to hear voice see shoulder just to have something occur to preserve in fancy in favouring warmth of surprize conjecture be moreover perpetually hearing about for excepting when at hartfield be always among who saw fault in mr elton found nothing so interesting a discussion of concern report therefore guess have already occurred might occur in arrangement of affair comprehending income servant furniture be continually in agitation around regard be receiving strength by invariable praise of regret kept alive feeling irritated by ceaseless repetition of miss hawkins happiness continual observation of how much seemed attached air a walked by house very sitting of hat being in proof of how much be in love have be allowable entertainment have there be pain to friend reproach to herself in wavering of harriet mind emma must have be amused by variation sometimes mr elton predominated sometimes martin be occasionally useful a check to other mr elton engagement have be cure of agitation of meeting mr martin unhappiness produced by knowledge of engagement have be little put aside by elizabeth martin calling at mr goddard few day afterwards harriet have not be at home note have be prepared left for written in very style to touch small mixture of reproach with great deal of kindness till mr elton appeared have be much occupied by continually pondering over what must be done in return wishing to do more than dared to confess mr elton in person have driven away such care while staid martin be forgotten on very morning of setting off for bath again emma to dissipate of distress occasioned judged best for to return elizabeth martin visit how visit be to be acknowledged what must be necessary what might be safest have be point of doubtful consideration absolute neglect of mother sister when invited to come must be ingratitude must not be yet danger of renewal of acquaintance after much thinking must determine on nothing better than harriet returning visit in way that if have understanding must convince that be to be only formal acquaintance meant to take in carriage leave at abbey mill while drove little farther call for again so soon a to allow time for insidious application dangerous recurrence to past give most decided proof of what degree of intimacy be chosen for future must think of nothing better though there be something in own heart must not approve something of ingratitude merely glossed over must be done what must become of harriet chapter v small heart have harriet for visiting only hour before friend called for at mr goddard evil star have led to very spot where at moment trunk directed to rev philip elton white hart bath be to be seen under operation of being lifted into butcher cart be to convey to where coach past thing in world excepting that trunk direction be consequently blank went however when reached farm be to be put down at end of broad neat gravel walk led between espalier apple tree to front door sight of thing have given so much pleasure autumn before be beginning to revive little local agitation when parted emma observed to be looking around with sort of fearful curiosity determined not to allow visit to exceed proposed quarter of hour went on to give portion of time to old servant who be married settled in donwell quarter of hour brought punctually to white gate again miss smith receiving summons be with without delay unattended by alarming young man came solitarily down gravel walk miss martin just appearing at door parting with seemingly with ceremonious civility harriet must not very soon give intelligible account be feeling too much at last emma collected from enough to understand sort of meeting sort of pain be creating have seen only mr martin two girl have received doubtingly if not coolly nothing beyond merest commonplace have be talked almost time till just at last when mr martin saying of sudden that thought miss smith be grown have brought on more interesting subject warmer manner in very room have be measured last september with two friend there be pencilled mark memorandum on wainscot by window have done seemed to remember day hour party occasion to feel same consciousness same regret to be ready to return to same good understanding be just growing again like harriet a emma must suspect a ready a best of to be cordial happy when carriage reappeared be over style of visit shortness of be then felt to be decisive fourteen minute to be given to with whom have thankfully passed six week not six month ago emma must not picture feel how justly might resent how naturally harriet must suffer be bad business must have given great deal endured great deal to have have martin in higher rank of life be so deserving that little higher must have be enough a be how must have done otherwise impossible must not repent must be separated there be great deal of pain in process so much to herself at time that soon felt necessity of little consolation resolved on going home by way of randalls to procure mind be quite sick of mr elton martin refreshment of randalls be absolutely necessary be good scheme on driving to door heard that master mistress be at home have be out time man believed be gone to hartfield be too bad cried emma a turned away now will just miss too provoking know when have be so disappointed leaned back in corner to indulge murmur to reason away probably little of such being commonest process of not ill disposed mind presently carriage stopt looked up be stopt by mr mr weston who be standing to speak to there be instant pleasure in sight of still greater pleasure be conveyed in sound for mr weston immediately accosted with how d 'ye do how d 'ye do have be sitting with father glad to see so well frank come to morrow have

weston gave history of engagement at enscombe allowed son to answer for having entire fortnight at command a well a route method of journey listened smiled congratulated will soon bring over to hartfield said at conclusion emma must imagine saw touch of arm at speech from wife have better move on mr weston said be detaining girl well well be ready turning again to emma must not be expecting

manner be prepared for said confess that considering thing have not expected more than very tolerably well looking woman of certain age did not know be to find pretty young woman in mr weston can not see too much perfection in mr weston for feeling said emma be to guess to be eighteen must listen with pleasure must be ready to quarrel with for using such word let imagine that have spoken of a pretty young woman hope must know better replied depend upon with gallant bow that in addressing mr weston must understand whom might praise without danger of being thought extravagant in term emma wondered whether same suspicion of what might be expected from knowing other have taken strong possession of mind have ever crossed whether compliment be to be considered a mark of acquiescence proof of defiance must see more of to understand way at present only felt be agreeable have doubt of what mr weston be often thinking about quick eye detected again again glancing towards with happy expression even when might have determined not to look be confident that be often listening own father perfect exemption from thought of kind entire deficiency in of such sort of penetration suspicion be most comfortable circumstance happily be not farther from approving matrimony than from foreseeing though always objecting to marriage be arranged never suffered beforehand from apprehension of seemed a if must not think so ill of two person understanding a to suppose meant to marry till be proved against blessed favouring blindness must now without drawback of single unpleasant surmise without glance forward at possible treachery in guest give way to natural kind hearted civility in solicitous inquiry after mr frank churchill accommodation on journey through sad evil of sleeping two night on road express very genuine unmixed anxiety to know that have certainly escaped catching cold however must not allow to feel quite assured of till after night reasonable visit paid mr weston began to move must be going have business at crown about hay great many errand for mr weston at ford need not hurry body else son too well bred to hear hint rose immediately also saying a be going farther on business sir will take opportunity of paying visit must be paid day other therefore may a well be paid now have honour of being acquainted with neighbour of yours turning to emma lady

want of attention to here must be carefully avoided saw with campbell when be equal of body mixed with here be with poor old grandmother who have barely enough to live on if call early will be slight son looked convinced have heard speak of acquaintance said emma be very elegant young woman agreed to with so quiet yes a inclined almost to doubt real concurrence yet there must be very distinct sort of elegance for fashionable world if jane fairfax must be thought only ordinarily gifted with if be never particularly struck by manner before said think will to day will see to advantage see hear be afraid will not hear at for have aunt who never hold tongue be acquainted with miss jane fairfax sir be said mr woodhouse always last to make way in conversation then give leave to assure that will find very agreeable young lady be staying here on visit to grandmama aunt very worthy people have known life will be extremely glad to see be sure one of servant will go with to shew way dear sir upon account in world father can direct father be not going so far be only going to crown quite on other side of street there be great many house might be very much at loss be very dirty walk unless keep on footpath coachman can tell where have best cross street mr frank churchill still declined looking a serious a must father gave hearty support by calling out good friend be quite unnecessary frank know puddle of water when see a to mr bates may get there from crown in hop step jump be permitted to go alone with cordial nod from one graceful bow from other two gentleman took leave emma remained very well pleased with beginning of acquaintance must now engage to think of at randalls hour of day with full confidence in comfort chapter vi next morning brought mr frank churchill again came with mr weston to whom to highbury seemed to take very cordially have be sitting with appeared most companionably at home till usual hour of exercise on being desired to chuse walk immediately fixed on highbury did not doubt there being very pleasant walk in direction if left to must always chuse same highbury that airy cheerful happy looking highbury must be constant attraction highbury with mr weston stood for hartfield trusted to bearing same construction with walked thither directly emma have hardly expected for mr weston who have called in for minute in order to hear that son be very handsome knew nothing of plan be agreeable surprize to therefore to perceive walking up to house together arm in arm be wanting to see again especially to see in company with mr weston upon behaviour to whom opinion of be to depend if be deficient there nothing must make amends for on seeing together became perfectly satisfied be not merely in fine word hyperbolical compliment that paid duty nothing must be more proper pleasing than whole manner to nothing must more agreeably denote wish of considering a friend securing affection there be time enough for emma to form reasonable judgment a visit included rest of morning be three walking about together for hour two first round shrubbery of hartfield afterwards in highbury be delighted with thing admired hartfield sufficiently for mr woodhouse ear when going farther be resolved on confessed wish to be made acquainted with whole village found matter of commendation interest much oftener than emma must have supposed of object of curiosity spoke very amiable feeling begged to be house father have lived in so long have be home of father father on recollecting that old woman who have nursed be still living walked in quest of cottage from one end of street to other though in point of pursuit observation there be positive merit shewed altogether good will towards highbury in general must be very like merit to be with emma watched decided that with such feeling a be now shewn must not be fairly supposed that have be ever voluntarily absenting that have not be acting part making parade of insincere profession mr knightley certainly have not done justice first pause be at crown inn inconsiderable house though principal one of sort where couple of pair of post horse be kept more for convenience of neighbourhood than from run on road companion have not expected to be detained by interest excited there in passing gave history of large room visibly added have be built many year ago for ball room while neighbourhood have be in particularly populous dancing state have be occasionally used a such such brilliant day have long passed away now highest purpose for be ever wanted be to accommodate whist club established among gentleman half gentleman of place be immediately interested character a ball room caught instead of passing on stopt for several minute at two superior sashed window be open to look in contemplate capability lament that original purpose must have ceased saw fault in room must acknowledge none suggested be long enough broad enough handsome enough must hold very number for comfort ought to have ball there at least fortnight through winter why have not miss woodhouse revived former good old day of room who must do thing in highbury want of proper family in place conviction that none beyond place immediate environs must be tempted to attend be mentioned be not satisfied must not be persuaded that so many good looking house a saw around must not furnish number enough for meeting even when particular be given family described be still unwilling to admit that inconvenience of such mixture must be thing that there must be smallest difficulty in body returning into proper place next morning argued like young man very much bent on dancing emma be rather surprized to see constitution of weston prevail so decidedly against habit of churchill seemed to have life spirit cheerful feeling social inclination of father nothing of pride reserve of enscombe of pride indeed there be perhaps scarcely enough indifference to confusion of rank bordered too much on inelegance of mind must be judge however of evil be holding cheap be effusion of lively spirit at last be persuaded to move on from front of crown being now almost facing house where bateses lodged emma recollected intended visit day before asked if have paid yes oh yes replied be just going to mention very successful visit saw three lady felt very much obliged to for preparatory hint if talking aunt have taken quite by surprize must have be death of a be be only betrayed into paying most unreasonable visit ten minute must have be be necessary perhaps be proper have told father must certainly be at home before there be getting away pause to utter astonishment found when finding nowhere else joined there at last have be actually sitting with very nearly three quarter of hour good lady have not given possibility of escape before how did think miss fairfax looking ill very ill be if young lady can ever be allowed to look ill expression be hardly admissible mr weston be lady can never look ill seriously miss fairfax be naturally so pale a almost always to give appearance of ill health most deplorable want of complexion emma must not agree to began warm defence of miss fairfax complexion be certainly never brilliant must not allow to have sickly hue in general there be softness delicacy in skin gave peculiar elegance to character of face listened with due deference acknowledged that have heard many people say same yet must confess that to nothing must make amends for want of fine glow of health where feature be indifferent fine complexion gave beauty to where be good effect be fortunately need not attempt to describe what effect be well said emma there be disputing about taste at least admire except complexion shook head laughed can not separate miss fairfax complexion did see often at weymouth be often in same society at moment be approaching ford hastily exclaimed have must be very shop that body attends day of life a father informs come to highbury say six day out of seven have always business at ford if be not inconvenient to pray let go in may prove to belong to place to be true citizen of highbury must buy something at ford will be taking out freedom dare say sell glove oh yes glove thing do admire patriotism will be adored in highbury be very popular before came because be mr weston son lay out guinea at ford popularity will stand upon own virtue went in while sleek well tied parcel of men beaver york tan be bringing down displaying on counter said beg pardon miss woodhouse be speaking to be saying something at very moment of burst of amor patriae let lose assure utmost stretch of public fame must not make amends for loss of happiness in private life merely asked whether have known much of miss fairfax party at weymouth now that understand question must pronounce to be very unfair one be always lady right to decide on degree of acquaintance miss fairfax must already have given account will not commit by claiming more than may chuse to allow upon word answer a discreetly a must do account of thing leaf so much to be guessed be so very reserved so very unwilling to give least information about body really think may say what like of acquaintance with may indeed then will speak truth nothing suit so well met frequently at weymouth have known campbell little in town at weymouth be very much in same set colonel campbell be very agreeable man mr campbell friendly warm hearted woman like know miss fairfax situation in life conclude what be destined to be yes rather hesitatingly believe do get upon delicate subject emma said mr weston smiling remember that be here mr frank churchill hardly know what to say when speak of miss fairfax situation in life will move little farther off certainly do forget to think of said emma a having ever be thing friend dearest friend looked a if fully understood honoured sentiment when glove be bought have quitted shop again did ever hear young lady be speaking of play said frank churchill ever hear repeated emma forget how much belongs to highbury have heard year of life since began play charmingly think so do wanted opinion of one who must really judge appeared to to play well be with considerable taste know nothing of matter be excessively fond of music without smallest skill right of judging of body performance have be used to hear admired remember one proof of being thought to play well man very musical man in love with woman engaged to on point of marriage must yet never ask that other woman to sit down to instrument if lady in question must sit down instead never seemed to like to hear one if must hear other thought in man of known musical talent be proof proof indeed said emma highly amused mr dixon be very musical be will know more about in hour from than miss fairfax must have vouchsafed in year yes mr dixon miss campbell be person thought very strong proof certainly very strong be to own truth great deal stronger than if have be miss campbell must have be at agreeable to must not excuse man having more music than love more ear than eye more acute sensibility to fine sound than to feeling how did miss campbell appear to like be very particular friend know poor comfort said emma laughing one must rather have stranger preferred than one very particular friend with stranger might not recur again misery of having very particular friend always at hand to do thing better than one doe poor mr dixon well be glad be gone to settle in ireland be right be not very flattering to miss campbell really did not seem to feel so much better so much worse know be sweetness be stupidity in quickness of friendship dulness of feeling there be one person think who must have felt miss fairfax must have felt improper dangerous distinction a to oh imagine expect account of miss fairfax sensation from from body else be known to human being guess if continued to play whenever be asked by mr dixon one may guess what one chuses there appeared perfectly good understanding among began rather quickly checking added however be impossible for to say on what term really be how might all be behind scene can only say that there be smoothness outwardly who have known miss fairfax from child must be better judge of character of how be likely to conduct in critical situation than can be have known from child undoubtedly have be child woman together be natural to suppose that must be intimate that must have taken to other whenever visited friend never did hardly know how have happened little perhaps from wickedness on side be prone to take disgust towards girl so idolized so cried up a always be by aunt grandmother set then reserve never must attach to one so completely reserved be most repulsive quality indeed said oftentimes very convenient doubt never pleasing there be safety in reserve attraction one can not love reserved person not till reserve cease towards then attraction may be greater must be more in want of friend agreeable companion than have yet be to take trouble of conquering body reserve to procure one intimacy between miss fairfax be quite out of question have reason to think ill of not least except such extreme perpetual cautiousness of word manner such dread of giving distinct idea about body be apt to suggest suspicion of there being something to conceal perfectly agreed with after walking together so long thinking so much alike emma felt so well acquainted with that must hardly believe to be only second meeting be not exactly what have expected le of man of world in of notion le of spoiled child of fortune therefore better than have expected idea seemed more moderate feeling warmer be particularly struck by manner of considering mr elton house a well a church must go look at must not join in finding much fault with must not believe bad house not house a man be to be pitied for having if be to be shared with woman loved must not think man to be pitied for having house there must be ample room in for real comfort man must be blockhead who wanted more mr weston laughed said did not know what be talking about used only to large house without ever thinking how many advantage accommodation be attached to size must be judge of privation inevitably belonging to small one emma in own mind determined that did know what be talking about that shewed very amiable inclination to settle early in life to marry from worthy motif might not be aware of inroad on domestic peace to be occasioned by housekeeper room bad butler pantry doubt did perfectly feel that enscombe must not make happy whenever be attached must willingly give up much of wealth to be allowed early establishment chapter vii emma very good opinion of frank churchill be little shaken following day by hearing that be gone off to london merely to have hair cut sudden freak seemed to have seized at breakfast have sent for chaise set off intending to return to dinner with more important view that appeared than having hair cut there be certainly no harm in travelling sixteen mile twice over on such errand there be air of foppery nonsense in must not approve did not accord with rationality of plan moderation in expense even unselfish warmth of heart have believed to discern in yesterday vanity extravagance love of change restlessness of temper must be doing something good bad heedlessness a to pleasure of father mr weston indifferent a to how conduct might appear in general became liable to charge father only called coxcomb thought very good story that mr weston did not like be clear enough by passing over a quickly a possible making other comment than young people must have little whim with exception of little blot emma found that visit hitherto have given friend only good idea of mr weston be very ready to say how attentive pleasant companion made how much saw to like in disposition altogether appeared to have very open temper certainly very cheerful lively one must observe nothing wrong in notion great deal decidedly right spoke of uncle with warm regard be fond of talking of said must be best man in world if be left to though there be being attached to aunt acknowledged kindness with gratitude seemed to mean always to speak of with respect be very promising for such unfortunate fancy for having hair cut there be nothing to denote unworthy of distinguished honour imagination have given honour if not of being really in love with her of being at least very near saved only by own indifference for still resolution held of never marrying honour in short of being marked out for by joint acquaintance mr weston on side added virtue to account must have weight gave to understand frank admired extremely thought very beautiful very charming with so much to be said for altogether found must not judge harshly a mr weston observed young people must have little whim there be one person among new acquaintance in surry not so leniently disposed in general be judged throughout parish of donwell highbury with great candour liberal allowance be made for little excess of such handsome young man one who smiled so often bowed so well there be one spirit among not to be softened from power of censure by bow smile mr knightley circumstance be told at hartfield for moment be silent emma heard almost immediately afterwards say to over newspaper held in hand hum just trifling silly fellow took for have mind to resent instant observation convinced that be really said only to relieve own feeling not meant to provoke therefore let pas although in one instance bearer of not good tidings mr mr weston visit morning be in respect particularly opportune something occurred while be at hartfield to make emma want advice be still more lucky wanted exactly advice gave be occurrence cole have be settled year in highbury be very good sort of people friendly liberal unpretending on other hand be of low origin in trade only moderately genteel on first coming into country have lived in proportion to income quietly keeping little company little unexpensively last year two have brought considerable increase of mean house in town have yielded greater profit fortune in general have smiled on with wealth view increased want of larger house inclination for more company added to house to number of servant to expense of sort by time be in fortune style of living second only to family at love of society new dining room prepared body for keeping dinner company few party chiefly among single men have already taken place regular best family emma must hardly suppose must presume to invite donwell hartfield randalls nothing must tempt to go if did regretted that father known habit must be giving refusal le meaning than must wish cole be very respectable in way ought to be taught that be not for to arrange term on superior family must visit lesson very much feared must receive only from have little hope of mr knightley none of mr weston have made up mind how to meet presumption so many week before appeared that when insult came at last found very differently affected donwell randalls have received invitation none have come for father mr weston accounting for with suppose will not take liberty with know dine out be not quite sufficient felt that must like to have have power of refusal afterwards a idea of party to be assembled there consisting precisely of whose society be dearest to occurred again again did not know that might not have be tempted to accept harriet be to be there in evening bateses have be speaking of a walked about highbury day before frank churchill have most earnestly lamented absence might not evening end in dance have be question of bare possibility of acted a farther irritation on spirit being left in solitary grandeur even supposing omission to be intended a compliment be poor comfort be arrival of very invitation while weston be at hartfield made presence so acceptable for though first remark on reading be that of course must be declined so very soon proceeded to ask what advised to do advice for going be most prompt successful owned that considering thing be not absolutely without inclination for party cole expressed so properly there be so much real attention in manner of so much consideration for father must have solicited honour earlier have be waiting arrival of folding screen from london hoped might keep mr woodhouse from draught of air therefore induce more readily to give honour of company upon whole be very persuadable being briefly settled among how might be done without neglecting comfort how certainly mr goddard if not mr bates might be depended on for bearing company mr woodhouse be to be talked into acquiescence of daughter going out to dinner on day now near at hand spending whole evening away from a for going emma did not wish to think possible hour must be too late party too numerous be soon pretty well resigned be not fond of dinner visiting said never be more be emma late hour agree with be sorry mr mr cole must have done think must be much better if must come in one afternoon next summer take tea with take in afternoon walk might do a hour be so reasonable yet get home without being out in damp of evening dew of summer evening be what must not expose body to however a be so very desirous to have dear emma dine with a will be there mr knightley too to take care of can not wish to prevent provided weather be what ought neither damp cold windy then turning to mr weston with look of gentle reproach ah miss taylor if have not married must have staid at home with well sir cried mr weston a took miss taylor away be incumbent on to supply place if can will step to mr goddard in moment if wish idea of thing to be done in moment be increasing not lessening mr woodhouse agitation lady knew better how to allay mr weston must be quiet thing deliberately arranged with treatment mr woodhouse be soon composed enough for talking a usual must be happy to see mr goddard have great regard for mr goddard emma must write line invite james must take note first of there must be answer written to mr cole will make excuse dear a civilly a possible will say that be quite invalid go where therefore must decline obliging invitation beginning with compliment of course will do thing right need not tell be to be done must remember to let james know that carriage will be wanted on tuesday will have fear for with have never be there above once since new approach be made still have doubt that james will take very safely when get there must tell at what time must have come for again have better name early hour will not like staying late will get very tired when tea be over must not wish to come away before be tired papa oh love will soon be tired there will be great many people talking at once will not like noise dear sir cried mr weston if emma come away early will be breaking up party great harm if doe said mr woodhouse sooner party break up better consider how may appear to cole emma be going away directly after tea might be giving offence be good natured people think little of own claim still must feel that body hurrying away be great compliment miss woodhouse doing must be more thought of than other person in room must not wish to disappoint mortify cole be sure sir friendly good sort of people a ever lived who have be neighbour ten year upon account in world mr weston be much obliged to for reminding must be extremely sorry to be giving pain know what worthy people be perry tell that mr cole never touch malt liquor must not think to look at be bilious mr cole be very bilious must not be mean of giving pain dear emma must consider be sure rather than run risk of hurting mr mr cole must stay little longer than might wish will not regard being tired will be perfectly safe know among friend oh yes papa have fear at for myself must have scruple of staying a late a mr weston on account be only afraid of sitting up for be not afraid of not being exceedingly comfortable with mr goddard love piquet know when be gone home be afraid will be sitting up by instead of going to bed at usual time idea of must entirely destroy comfort must promise not to sit up did on condition of promise on side such a if came home cold must be sure to warm thoroughly if hungry that must take something to eat that own maid must sit up for that serle butler must see that thing be safe in house a usual chapter viii frank churchill came back again if kept father dinner waiting be not known at hartfield for mr weston be too anxious for being favourite with mr woodhouse to betray imperfection must be concealed came back have have hair cut laughed at with very good grace without seeming really at ashamed of what have done have reason to wish hair longer to conceal confusion of face reason to wish money unspent to improve spirit be quite a undaunted a lively a ever after seeing emma thus moralised to herself know whether ought to be so certainly silly thing do cease to be silly if be done by sensible people in impudent way wickedness be always wickedness folly be not always folly depends upon character of who handle mr knightley be not trifling silly young man if be must have done differently must either have gloried in achievement be ashamed of there must have be ostentation of coxcomb evasion of mind too weak to defend own vanity be perfectly sure that be not trifling silly with tuesday came agreeable prospect of seeing again for longer time than hitherto of judging of general manner by inference of meaning of manner towards herself of guessing how soon might be necessary for to throw coldness into air of fancying what observation of might be who be now seeing together for first time meant to be very happy in spite of scene being laid at mr cole without being able to forget that among failing of mr elton even in day of favour none have disturbed more than propensity to dine with mr cole father comfort be amply secured mr bates a well a mr goddard being able to come last pleasing duty before left house be to pay respect to a sat together after dinner while father be fondly noticing beauty of dress to make two lady amends in power by helping to large slice of cake full glass of wine for unwilling denial care of constitution might have obliged to practise during meal have provided plentiful dinner for wished must know that have be allowed to eat followed carriage to mr cole door be pleased to see that be mr knightley for mr knightley keeping horse having little spare money great deal of health activity independence be too apt in emma opinion to get about a must not use carriage so often a became owner of donwell abbey have opportunity now of speaking approbation while warm from heart for stopped to hand out be coming a must do said like gentleman be quite glad to see thanked observing how lucky that must arrive at same moment for if have met first in drawing room doubt whether must have discerned to be more of gentleman than usual might not have distinguished how came by look manner yes must be sure must there be always look of consciousness bustle when people come in way know to be beneath think carry off very well dare say with be sort of bravado air of affected unconcern always observe whenever meet under circumstance now have nothing to try for be not afraid of being supposed ashamed be not striving to look taller than body else now will really be very happy to walk into same room with nonsensical girl be reply not at in anger emma have a much reason to be satisfied with rest of party a with mr knightley be received with cordial respect must not please given consequence must wish for when weston arrived kindest look of love strongest of admiration be for from husband wife son approached with cheerful eagerness marked a peculiar object at dinner found seated by a firmly believed not without dexterity on side party be rather large a included one other family proper unobjectionable country family whom cole have advantage of naming among acquaintance male part of mr cox family lawyer of highbury le worthy female be to come in evening with miss bates miss fairfax miss smith already at dinner be too numerous for subject of conversation to be general while politics mr elton be talked over emma must fairly surrender attention to pleasantness of neighbour first remote sound to felt obliged to attend be name of jane fairfax mr cole seemed to be relating something of be expected to be very interesting listened found well worth listening to very dear part of emma fancy received amusing supply mr cole be telling that have be calling on miss bates a soon a entered room have be struck by sight of pianoforte very elegant looking instrument not grand large sized square pianoforte substance of story end of dialogue ensued of surprize inquiry congratulation on side explanation on miss bates be that pianoforte have arrived from broadwood day before to great astonishment of aunt niece entirely unexpected that at first by miss bates account jane be quite at loss quite bewildered to think who must possibly have ordered now be perfectly satisfied that must be from only one quarter of course must be from colonel campbell one can suppose nothing else added mr cole be only surprized that there must ever have be doubt jane seems have letter from very lately not word be said about know way best must not consider silence a reason for not meaning to make present might chuse to surprize mr cole have many to agree with body who spoke on subject be equally convinced that must come from colonel campbell equally rejoiced that present have be made there be enough ready to speak to allow emma to think own way still listen to mr cole declare know when have heard thing have given more satisfaction always have quite hurt that jane fairfax who play so delightfully must not have instrument seemed quite shame especially considering how many house there be where fine instrument be absolutely thrown away be like giving slap to be sure be yesterday be telling mr cole really be ashamed to look at new grand pianoforte in drawing room while know one note from little girl who be just beginning perhaps may never make thing of there be poor jane fairfax who be mistress of music have not thing of nature of instrument not even pitifullest old spinet in world to amuse with be saying to mr cole yesterday quite agreed with only be so particularly fond of music that must not help indulging in purchase hoping that of good neighbour might be so obliging occasionally to put to better use than can really be reason why instrument be bought else be sure ought to be ashamed of be in great hope that miss woodhouse may be prevailed with to try evening miss woodhouse made proper acquiescence finding that nothing more be to be entrapped from communication of mr cole turned to frank churchill why do smile said nay why do suppose smile for pleasure at colonel campbell being so rich so liberal be handsome present very rather wonder that be never made before perhaps miss fairfax have never be staying here so long before that did not give use of own instrument must now be shut up in london untouched by body be grand pianoforte might think too large for mr bates house may say what chuse countenance testifies that thought on subject be very much like mine know rather believe be giving more credit for acuteness than deserve smile because smile will probably suspect find suspect at present see what there be to question if colonel campbell be not person who can be what do say to mr dixon mr dixon very true indeed have not thought of mr dixon must know a well a father how acceptable instrument must be perhaps mode of mystery surprize be more like young woman scheme than elderly man be mr dixon dare say told that suspicion must guide mine if so must extend suspicion comprehend mr dixon in mr dixon very well yes immediately perceive that must be joint present of mr mr dixon be speaking other day know of being so warm admirer of performance yes what told on head confirmed idea have entertained before mean to reflect upon good intention of mr dixon miss fairfax can not help suspecting that after making proposal to friend have misfortune to fall in love with that became conscious of little attachment on side one might guess twenty thing without guessing exactly right be sure there must be particular cause for chusing to come to highbury instead of going with campbell to ireland here must be leading life of privation penance there must have be enjoyment a to pretence of trying native air look upon a mere excuse in summer might have passed what can body native air do for in month of january february march good fire carriage must be much more to purpose in most case of delicate health dare say in require to adopt suspicion though make so noble profession of doing honestly tell what be upon word have air of great probability mr dixon preference of music to friend can answer for being very decided then saved life did ever hear of that water party by accident be falling overboard caught did be there one of party be really well observed nothing of course for seems to be new idea to if have be there think must have made discovery dare say must simple saw nothing fact that miss fairfax be nearly dashed from vessel that mr dixon caught be work of moment though consequent shock alarm be very great much more durable indeed believe be hour before of be comfortable again yet be too general sensation for thing of peculiar anxiety to be observable mean to say however that might not have made discovery conversation be here interrupted be called on to share in awkwardness of rather long interval between course obliged to be a formal a orderly a others when table be again safely covered when corner dish be placed exactly right occupation ease be generally restored emma said arrival of pianoforte be decisive with wanted to know little more tell quite enough depend upon will soon hear that be present from mr mr dixon if dixons must absolutely deny knowledge of must conclude to come from campbell be sure be not from campbell miss fairfax know be not from campbell must have be guessed at first must not have be puzzled have dared fix on may not have convinced perhaps be perfectly convinced that mr dixon be principal in business indeed injure if suppose unconvinced reasoning carry judgment along with entirely at first while supposed satisfied that colonel campbell be giver saw only a paternal kindness thought most natural thing in world when mentioned dixon felt how much more probable that must be tribute of warm female friendship now can see in other light than a offering of love there be occasion to press matter farther conviction seemed real looked a if felt said more other subject took turn rest of dinner passed away dessert succeeded child came in be talked to admired amid usual rate of conversation few clever thing said few downright silly by much larger proportion one other nothing worse than everyday remark dull repetition old news heavy joke lady have not be long in drawing room before other lady in different division arrived emma watched entree of own particular little friend if must not exult in dignity grace must not only love blooming sweetness artless manner must most heartily rejoice in light cheerful unsentimental disposition allowed so many alleviation of pleasure in midst of pang of disappointed affection there sat who must have guessed how many tear have be lately shedding to be in company nicely dressed seeing others nicely dressed to sit smile look pretty say nothing be enough for happiness of present hour jane fairfax did look move superior emma suspected might have be glad to change feeling with harriet very glad to have purchased mortification of having loved yes of having loved even mr elton in vain by surrender of dangerous pleasure of knowing beloved by husband of friend in so large party be not necessary that emma must approach did not wish to speak of pianoforte felt too much in secret herself to think appearance of curiosity interest fair therefore purposely kept at distance by others subject be almost immediately introduced saw blush of consciousness with congratulation be received blush of guilt accompanied name of excellent friend colonel campbell mr weston kind hearted musical be particularly interested by circumstance emma must not help being amused at perseverance in dwelling on subject having so much to ask to say a to tone touch pedal totally unsuspicious of wish of saying a little about a possible plainly read in fair heroine countenance be soon joined by of gentleman very first of early be frank churchill in walked first handsomest after paying compliment en passant to miss bates niece made way directly to opposite side of circle where sat miss woodhouse till must find seat by must not sit at emma divined what body present must be thinking be object body must perceive introduced to friend miss smith at convenient moment afterwards heard what thought of other have never seen so lovely face be delighted with naivete only to be sure be paying too great compliment did think there be look little like mr elton emma restrained indignation only turned from in silence smile of intelligence passed between gentleman on first glancing towards miss fairfax be most prudent to avoid speech told that have be impatient to leave dining room hated sitting long be always first to move when must that father mr knightley mr cox mr cole be left very busy over parish business that a long a have staid however have be pleasant enough a have found in general set of gentlemanlike sensible men spoke so handsomely of highbury altogether thought so abundant in agreeable family emma began to feel have be used to despise place rather too much questioned a to society in extent of neighbourhood about enscombe sort must make out from answer that a far a enscombe be concerned there be very little going on visiting be among range of great family none very near that even when day be fixed invitation accepted be even chance that mr churchill be not in health spirit for going that made point of visiting fresh person that though have separate engagement be not without difficulty without considerable address at time that must get away introduce acquaintance for night saw that enscombe must not satisfy that highbury taken at best might reasonably please young man who have more retirement at home than liked importance at enscombe be very evident did not boast naturally betrayed that have persuaded aunt where uncle must hing on laughing noticing owned that believed excepting one two point must with time persuade to thing one of point on influence failed then mentioned have wanted very much to go abroad have be very eager indeed to be allowed to travel must not hear of have happened year before now said be beginning to have no longer same wish unpersuadable point did not mention emma guessed to be good behaviour to father have made most wretched discovery said after short pause have be here week to morrow time never knew day fly so fast week to morrow have hardly begun to enjoy just got acquainted with mr weston others hate recollection perhaps may now begin to regret that spent one whole day out of so few in having hair cut said smiling be subject of regret at have pleasure in seeing friend unless can believe fit to be seen rest of gentleman being now in room emma found obliged to turn from for few minute listen to mr cole when mr cole have moved away attention must be restored a before saw frank churchill looking intently across room at miss fairfax who be sitting exactly opposite what be matter said started thank for rousing replied believe have be very rude really miss fairfax have done hair in so odd way so very odd way can not keep eye from never saw thing so outree curl must be fancy of own see nobody else looking like must go ask whether be irish fashion will yes will declare will will see how take whether colour be gone immediately emma soon saw standing before miss fairfax talking to a to effect on young lady a have improvidently placed exactly between exactly in front of miss fairfax must absolutely distinguish nothing before must return to chair be taken by mr weston be luxury of large party said one can get near body say thing dear emma be longing to talk to have be making discovery forming plan just like must tell while idea be fresh do know how miss bates niece came here how be invited be not oh yes how be conveyed manner of coming walked conclude how else must come very true well little while ago occurred to how very sad must be to have jane fairfax walking home again late at night cold a night be now a looked at though never saw appear to more advantage struck that be heated must therefore be particularly liable to take cold poor girl must not bear idea of so a soon a mr weston came into room must get at spoke to about carriage may guess how readily came into wish having approbation made way directly to miss bates to assure that carriage must be at service before took home for thought must be making comfortable at once good soul be a grateful a possible may be sure 'nobody be ever so fortunate a herself ' with many many thanks be occasion to trouble for mr knightley carriage have brought be to take home again ' be quite surprized very glad be sure really quite surprized very kind attention so thoughtful attention sort of thing so few men must think of in short from knowing usual way be very much inclined to think that be for accommodation carriage be used at do suspect must not have have pair of horse for that be only a excuse for assisting very likely said emma nothing more likely know man more likely than mr knightley to do sort of thing to do thing really good natured useful considerate benevolent be not gallant man be very humane one considering jane fairfax ill health must appear case of humanity to for act of unostentatious kindness there be nobody whom must fix on more than on mr knightley know have horse to day for arrived together laughed at about said not word must betray well said mr weston smiling give credit for more simple disinterested benevolence in instance than do for while miss bates be speaking suspicion darted into head have never be able to get out again more think of more probable appears in short have made match between mr knightley jane fairfax see consequence of keeping company what do say to mr knightley jane fairfax exclaimed emma dear mr weston how must think of thing mr knightley mr knightley must not marry must not have little henry cut out from donwell oh henry must have donwell can not at consent to mr knightley marrying be sure be not at likely be amazed that must think of thing dear emma have told what led to think of want match want to injure dear little henry idea have be given by circumstance if mr knightley really wished to marry must not have refrain on henry account boy of six year old who know nothing of matter yes must must not bear to have henry supplanted mr knightley marry have never have such idea can not adopt now jane fairfax too of woman nay have always be first favourite with a very well know imprudence of such match be not speaking of prudence merely probability see probability in unless have better foundation than what mention good nature humanity a tell must be quite enough to account for horse have great regard for bateses know independent of jane fairfax be always glad to shew attention dear mr weston take to match making do very ill jane fairfax mistress of abbey oh feeling revolt for own sake must not have do so mad thing imprudent if please not mad excepting inequality of fortune perhaps little disparity of age can see nothing unsuitable mr knightley doe not want to marry be sure have not least idea of put into head why must marry be a happy a possible by with farm sheep library parish to manage be extremely fond of brother child have occasion to marry to fill up time heart dear emma a long a think so be so if really love jane fairfax nonsense doe not care about jane fairfax in way of love be sure doe not must do good to family well said mr weston laughing perhaps greatest good must do must be to give jane respectable home if must be good to be sure must be evil to very shameful degrading connexion how must bear to have miss bates belonging to to have haunting abbey thanking day long for great kindness in marrying jane beo very kind obliging always have be such very kind neighbour then fly off through sentence to mother old petticoat 'not that be such very old petticoat either for still must last great while indeed must thankfully say that petticoat be very strong ' for shame emma mimic divert against conscience upon word think mr knightley must be much disturbed by miss bates little thing irritate might talk on if wanted to say thing must only talk louder drown voice question be not whether must be bad connexion for whether wish think doe have heard speak so must so very highly of jane fairfax interest take in anxiety about health concern that must have happier prospect have heard express so warmly on point such admirer of performance on pianoforte of voice have heard say that must listen to for ever oh have almost forgotten one idea occurred to pianoforte have be sent here by somebody though have be so well satisfied to consider present from campbell may not be from mr knightley can not help suspecting think be just person to do even without being in love then can be argument to prove that be in love think be at likely thing for to do mr knightley doe nothing mysteriously have heard lamenting having instrument repeatedly oftener than must suppose circumstance must in common course of thing occur to very well if have intended to give one must have told so there might be scruple of delicacy dear emma have very strong notion that come from be sure be particularly silent when mr cole told of at dinner take up idea mr weston run away with a have many time reproached with doing see sign of attachment believe nothing of pianoforte proof only will convince that mr knightley have thought of marrying jane fairfax combated point time longer in same way emma rather gaining ground over mind of friend for mr weston be most used of two to yield till little bustle in room shewed that tea be over instrument in preparation at same moment mr cole approaching to entreat miss woodhouse must do honour of trying frank churchill of whom in eagerness of conversation with mr weston have be seeing nothing except that have found seat by miss fairfax followed mr cole to add very pressing entreaty a in respect suited emma best to lead gave very proper compliance knew limitation of own power too well to attempt more than must perform with credit wanted taste spirit in little thing be generally acceptable must accompany own voice well one accompaniment to song took agreeably by surprize second slightly correctly taken by frank churchill pardon be duly begged at close of song thing usual followed be accused of having delightful voice perfect knowledge of music be properly denied that knew nothing of matter have voice at roundly asserted sang together once more emma must then resign place to miss fairfax whose performance vocal instrumental never must attempt to conceal from herself be infinitely superior to own with mixed feeling seated at little distance from number round instrument to listen frank churchill sang again have sung together once twice appeared at weymouth sight of mr knightley among most attentive soon drew away half emma mind fell into train of thinking on subject of mr weston suspicion to sweet sound of united voice gave only momentary interruption objection to mr knightley marrying did not in least subside must see nothing evil in must be great disappointment to mr john knightley consequently to isabella real injury to child most mortifying change material loss to very great deduction from father daily comfort a to herself must not at endure idea of jane fairfax at donwell abbey mr knightley for to give way to mr knightley must never marry little henry must remain heir of donwell presently mr knightley looked back came sat down by talked at first only of performance admiration be certainly very warm yet thought for mr weston must not have struck a sort of touchstone however began to speak of kindness in conveying aunt niece though answer be in spirit of cutting matter short believed to indicate only disinclination to dwell on kindness of own often feel concern said dare not make carriage more useful on such occasion be not that be without wish know how impossible father must deem that james must put to for purpose quite out of question quite out of question replied must often wish be sure smiled with such seeming pleasure at conviction that must proceed step present from campbell said pianoforte be very kindly given yes replied without smallest apparent embarrassment must have done better have given notice of surprizes be foolish thing pleasure be not enhanced inconvenience be often considerable must have expected better judgment in colonel campbell from moment emma must have taken oath that mr knightley have have concern in giving instrument whether be entirely free from peculiar attachment whether there be actual preference remained little longer doubtful towards end of jane second song voice grew thick will do said when be finished thinking aloud have sung quite enough for one evening now be quiet song however be soon begged for one more must not fatigue miss fairfax on account must only ask for one more frank churchill be heard to say think must manage without effort first part be so very trifling strength of song fall on second mr knightley grew angry that fellow said indignantly think of nothing shewing off own voice must not be touching miss bates who at moment passed near miss bates be mad to let niece sing hoarse in manner go interfere have mercy on miss bates in real anxiety for jane must hardly stay even to be grateful before stept forward put end to farther singing here ceased concert part of evening for miss woodhouse miss fairfax be only young lady performer soon within five minute proposal of dancing originating nobody exactly knew where be so effectually promoted by mr mr cole thing be rapidly clearing away to give proper space mr weston capital in country dance be seated beginning irresistible waltz frank churchill coming up with most becoming gallantry to emma have secured hand led up to top while waiting till other young people must pair off emma found time in spite of compliment be receiving on voice taste to look about see what became of mr knightley must be trial be dancer in general if be to be very alert in engaging jane fairfax now might augur something there be immediate appearance no be talking to mr cole be looking on unconcerned jane be asked by somebody else be still talking to mr cole emma have longer alarm for henry interest be yet safe led off dance with genuine spirit enjoyment not more than five couple must be mustered rarity suddenness of made very delightful found well matched in partner be couple worth looking at two dance unfortunately be must be allowed be growing late miss bates became anxious to get home on mother account after attempt therefore to be permitted to begin again be obliged to thank mr weston look sorrowful have done perhaps be a well said frank churchill a attended emma to carriage must have asked miss fairfax languid dancing must not have agreed with after yours chapter ix emma did not repent condescension in going to cole visit afforded many pleasant recollection next day might be supposed to have lost on side of dignified seclusion must be amply repaid in splendour of popularity must have delighted cole worthy people who deserved to be made happy left name behind must not soon die away perfect happiness even in memory be not common there be two point on be not quite easy doubted whether have not transgressed duty of woman by woman in betraying suspicion of jane fairfax feeling to frank churchill be hardly right have be so strong idea that must escape submission to that told be compliment to penetration made difficult for to be quite certain that ought to have held tongue other circumstance of regret related also to jane fairfax there have doubt did unfeignedly unequivocally regret inferiority of own playing singing did most heartily grieve over idleness of childhood sat down practised vigorously hour half be then interrupted by harriet coming in if harriet praise must have satisfied might soon have be comforted oh if must play a well a miss fairfax class together harriet playing be more like than lamp be like sunshine oh dear think play best of two think play quite a well a doe be sure have much rather hear body last night said how well played who knew thing about must have felt difference truth be harriet that playing be just good enough to be praised jane fairfax be much beyond well always will think that play quite a well a doe that if there be difference nobody must ever find out mr cole said how much taste have mr frank churchill talked great deal about taste that valued taste much more than execution ah jane fairfax have harriet be sure saw have execution did not know have taste nobody talked about hate italian singing there be understanding word of besides if doe play so very well know be more than be obliged to do because will have to teach cox be wondering last night whether must get into great family how did think cox looked just a always do very vulgar told something said harriet rather hesitatingly be nothing of consequence emma be obliged to ask what have told though fearful of producing mr elton told that mr martin dined with last saturday oh came to father upon business asked to stay to dinner oh talked great deal about especially anne cox know what meant asked if thought must go stay there again next summer meant to be impertinently curious just a such anne cox must be said be very agreeable day dined there sat by at dinner miss nash think of cox must be very glad to marry very likely think be without exception most vulgar girl in highbury harriet have business at ford emma thought most prudent to go with accidental meeting with martin be possible in present state must be dangerous harriet tempted by thing swayed by word be always very long at purchase while be still hanging over muslin changing mind emma went to door for amusement much must not be hoped from traffic of even busiest part of highbury mr perry walking hastily by mr william cox letting in at office door mr cole carriage horse returning from exercise stray letter boy on obstinate mule be liveliest object must presume to expect when eye fell only on butcher with tray tidy old woman travelling homewards from shop with full basket two cur quarrelling over dirty bone string of dawdling child round baker little bow window eyeing gingerbread knew have reason to complain be amused enough quite enough still to stand at door mind lively at ease can do with seeing nothing can see nothing doe not answer looked down randalls road scene enlarged two person appeared mr weston son in law be walking into highbury to hartfield of course be stopping however in first place at mr bates whose house be little nearer randalls than ford have knocked when emma caught eye immediately crossed road came forward to agreeableness of yesterday engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure to present meeting mr weston informed that be going to call on bateses in order to hear new instrument for companion tell said absolutely promised miss bates last night must come morning be not aware of did not know have fixed day a say did be going now while mr weston pay visit may be allowed hope said frank churchill to join party wait for at hartfield if be going home mr weston be disappointed thought meant to go with must be very much pleased must be quite in way perhaps may be equally in way here miss woodhouse look a if did not want aunt always sends off when be shopping say fidget to death miss woodhouse look a if must almost say same what be to do be here on business of own said emma be only waiting for friend will probably have soon done then will go home have better go with mr weston hear instrument well if advise with smile if colonel campbell must have employed careless friend if must prove to have indifferent tone what will say will be support to mr weston might do very well by disagreeable truth must be palatable through lip be wretchedest being in world at civil falsehood believe such thing replied emma be persuaded that can be a insincere a neighbour when be necessary there be reason to suppose instrument be indifferent quite otherwise indeed if understood miss fairfax opinion last night do come with said mr weston if be not very disagreeable to need not detain long will go to hartfield afterwards will follow to hartfield really wish to call with will be felt so great attention always thought meant must say more with hope of hartfield to reward returned with mr weston to mr bates door emma watched in then joined harriet at interesting counter trying with force of own mind to convince that if wanted plain muslin be of use to look at figured that blue ribbon be ever so beautiful must still never match yellow pattern at last be settled even to destination of parcel must send to mr goddard ma'be asked mr ford yes yes to mr goddard only pattern gown be at hartfield no will send to hartfield if please then mr goddard will want to see must take pattern gown home day will want ribbon

able to have apple tart spring told patty bid not mind be sure not to say thing to about for mr hodges must be cross sometimes a long a so many sack be sold did not signify who ate remainder so patty told be excessively shocked indeed must not have mr knightley know thing about for world must be so very wanted to keep from jane knowledge unluckily have mentioned before be aware miss bates have just done a patty opened door visitor walked upstairs without having regular narration to attend to pursued only by sound of desultory good will pray take care mr weston there be step at turning pray take care miss woodhouse ours be rather dark staircase rather darker narrower than one must wish miss smith pray take care miss woodhouse be quite concerned be sure hit foot miss smith step at turning chapter x appearance of little sitting room a entered be tranquillity mr bates deprived of usual employment slumbering on one side of fire frank churchill at table near most deedily occupied about spectacle jane fairfax standing with back to intent on pianoforte busy a be however young man be yet able to shew most happy countenance on seeing emma again be pleasure said in rather low voice coming at least ten minute earlier than have calculated find trying to be useful tell if think will succeed what said mr weston have not finished yet must not earn very good livelihood a working silversmith at rate have not be working uninterruptedly replied have be assisting miss fairfax in trying to make instrument stand steadily be not quite firm unevenness in floor believe see have be wedging one leg with paper be very kind of to be persuaded to come be almost afraid must be hurrying home contrived that must be seated by be sufficiently employed in looking out best baked apple for trying to make help advise in work till jane fairfax be quite ready to sit down to pianoforte again that be not immediately ready emma did suspect to arise from state of nerve have not yet possessed instrument long enough to touch without emotion must reason into power of performance emma must not pity such feeling origin must not resolve never to expose to neighbour again at last jane began though first bar be feebly given power of instrument be gradually done full justice to mr weston have be delighted before be delighted again emma joined in praise pianoforte with proper discrimination be pronounced to be altogether of highest promise whoever colonel campbell might employ said frank churchill with smile at person have not chosen ill heard good deal of colonel campbell taste at weymouth softness of upper note be sure be exactly what party must particularly prize dare say miss fairfax that either gave friend very minute direction wrote to broadwood think so jane did not look round be not obliged to hear mr weston have be speaking to at same moment be not fair said emma in whisper mine be random guess distress shook head with smile looked a if have very little doubt very little mercy soon afterwards began again how much friend in ireland must be enjoying pleasure on occasion miss fairfax dare say often think of wonder will be day precise day of instrument coming to hand do imagine colonel campbell know business to be going forward just at time do imagine to be consequence of immediate commission from that may have sent only general direction order indefinite a to time to depend upon contingency convenience paused must not hear must not avoid answering till have letter from colonel campbell said in voice of forced calmness can imagine nothing with confidence must be conjecture conjecture aye sometimes one conjecture right sometimes one conjecture wrong wish must conjecture how soon will make rivet quite firm what nonsense one talk miss woodhouse when hard at work if one talk at real workman suppose hold tongue gentleman labourer if get hold of word miss fairfax said something about conjecturing there be done have pleasure madam to mr bates of restoring spectacle healed for present be very warmly thanked by mother daughter to escape little from latter went to pianoforte begged miss fairfax who be still sitting at to play something more if be very kind said will be one of waltz danced last night let live over again did not enjoy a did appeared tired whole time believe be glad danced no longer must have given world world one ever have to give for half hour played what felicity be to hear tune again have made one happy if mistake not be danced at weymouth looked up at for moment coloured deeply played something else took music from chair near pianoforte turning to emma said here be something quite new to do know cramer here be new set of irish melody that from such quarter one might expect be sent with instrument very thoughtful of colonel campbell be not knew miss fairfax must have music here honour that part of attention particularly shews to have be so thoroughly from heart nothing hastily done nothing incomplete true affection only must have prompted emma wished must be le pointed yet must not help being amused when on glancing eye towards jane fairfax caught remains of smile when saw that with deep blush of consciousness there have be smile of secret delight have le scruple in amusement much le compunction with respect to amiable upright perfect jane fairfax be apparently cherishing very reprehensible feeling brought music to looked over together emma took opportunity of whispering speak too plain must understand hope doe must have understand be not in least ashamed of meaning really be half ashamed wish have never taken up idea be very glad did that communicated to have now key to odd look way leave shame to if doe wrong ought to feel be not entirely without think see much sign of be playing robin adair at moment favourite shortly afterwards miss bates passing near window descried mr knightley on horse back not far off mr knightley declare must speak to if possible just to thank

instance have be known of young people passing many many month successively without being at ball of description material injury accrue to body mind when beginning be made when felicity of rapid motion have once be though slightly felt must be very heavy set doe not ask for more frank churchill have danced once at highbury longed to dance again last half hour of evening mr woodhouse be persuaded to spend with daughter at randalls be passed by two young people in scheme on subject frank be first idea greatest zeal in pursuing for lady be best judge of difficulty most solicitous for accommodation appearance still have inclination enough for shewing people again how delightfully mr frank churchill miss woodhouse danced for doing in need not blush to compare with jane fairfax even for simple dancing without of wicked aid of vanity to assist first in pacing out room be in to see what must be made to hold then in taking dimension of other parlour in hope of discovering in spite of mr weston must say of exactly equal size that be little largest first proposition request that dance begun at mr cole must be finished there that same party must be collected same musician engaged met with readiest acquiescence mr weston entered into idea with thorough enjoyment mr weston most willingly undertook to play a long a must wish to dance interesting employment have followed of reckoning up exactly who there must be portioning out indispensable division of space to couple miss smith miss fairfax will be three two miss cox five have be repeated many time over there will be two gilbert young cox father besides mr knightley yes will be quite enough for pleasure miss smith miss fairfax will be three two miss cox five for five couple there will be plenty of room soon came to be on one side will there be good room for five couple really think there will on after five couple be not enough to make worth while to stand up five couple be nothing when one think seriously about will not do to invite five couple can be allowable only a thought of moment somebody said that miss gilbert be expected at brother must be invited with rest somebody else believed mr gilbert must have danced other evening if have be asked word be put in for second young cox at last mr weston naming one family of cousin who must be included of very old acquaintance who must not be left out became certainty that five couple must be at least ten very interesting speculation in what possible manner must be disposed of door of two room be just opposite other might not use room dance across passage seemed best scheme yet be not so good that many of wanted better emma said must be awkward mr weston be in distress about supper mr woodhouse opposed earnestly on score of health made so very unhappy indeed that must not be persevered in oh said must be extreme of imprudence must not bear for emma emma be not strong must catch dreadful cold so must poor little harriet so must all mr weston must be quite laid up let talk of such wild thing pray let talk of that young man speaking lower be very thoughtless tell father that young man be not quite thing have be opening door very often evening keeping open very inconsiderately doe not think of draught mean to set against indeed be not quite thing mr weston be sorry for such charge knew importance of said thing in power to do away door be now closed passage plan given up first scheme of dancing only in room be in resorted to again with such good will on frank churchill part that space quarter of hour before have be deemed barely sufficient for five couple be now endeavoured to be made out quite enough for ten be too magnificent said allowed unnecessary room ten couple may stand here very well emma demurred must be crowd sad crowd what must be worse than dancing without space to turn in very true gravely replied be very bad still went on measuring still ended with think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple said be quite unreasonable must be dreadful to be standing so close nothing can be farther from pleasure than to be dancing in crowd crowd in little room there be denying replied agree with exactly crowd in little room miss woodhouse have art of giving picture in few word exquisite quite exquisite still however having proceeded so far one be unwilling to give matter up must be disappointment to father altogether know be rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very well emma perceived that nature of gallantry be little self willed that must rather oppose than lose pleasure of dancing with took compliment forgave rest have intended ever to marry might have be worth while to pause consider try to understand value of preference character of temper for purpose of acquaintance be quite amiable enough before middle of next day be at hartfield entered room with such agreeable smile a certified continuance of scheme soon appeared that came to announce improvement well miss woodhouse almost immediately began inclination for dancing have not be quite frightened away hope by terror of father little room bring new proposal on subject thought of father wait only approbation to be acted upon may hope for honour of hand for two first dance of little projected ball to be given not at randalls at crown inn crown yes if mr woodhouse see objection trust can not father hope friend will be so kind a to visit there better accommodation can promise not le grateful welcome than at randalls be own idea mr weston see objection to provided be satisfied be what feel oh be perfectly right ten couple in of randalls room must have be insufferable dreadful felt how right be whole time be too anxious for securing thing to like to yield be not good exchange consent hope consent appears to plan that nobody can object to if mr mr weston think admirable a far a can answer for will be most happy seems only improvement must be papa do not think excellent improvement be obliged to repeat explain before be fully comprehended then being quite new farther representation be necessary to make acceptable no thought very far from improvement very bad plan much worse than other room at inn be always damp dangerous never properly aired fit to be inhabited if must dance have better dance at randalls have never be in room at crown in life did not know people who kept by sight oh very bad plan must catch worse cold at crown than anywhere be going to observe sir said frank churchill that one of great recommendation of change must be very little danger of body catching cold so much le danger at crown than at randalls mr perry might have reason to regret alteration nobody else must sir said mr woodhouse rather warmly be very much mistaken if suppose mr perry to be sort of character mr perry be extremely concerned when of be ill understand how room at crown can be safer for than father house from very circumstance of being larger sir will have occasion to open window at not once whole evening be that dreadful habit of opening window letting in cold air upon heated body a well know sir doe mischief open window surely mr churchill nobody must think of opening window at randalls nobody must be so imprudent never heard of such thing dancing with open window be sure father mr weston poor miss taylor be must suffer ah sir thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind window curtain throw up sash without being suspected have often known done have indeed sir bless never must have supposed live out of world be often astonished at what hear however doe make difference perhaps when come to talk over sort of thing require good deal of consideration one can not resolve upon in hurry if mr mr weston will be so obliging a to call here one morning may talk over see what can be done unfortunately sir time be so limited oh interrupted emma there will be plenty of time for talking thing over there be hurry at if can be contrived to be at crown papa will be very convenient for horse will be so near own stable so will dear be great thing not that james ever complains be right to spare horse when can if must be sure of room being thoroughly aired be mr stokes to be trusted doubt know even by sight can answer for thing of nature sir because will be under mr weston care mr weston undertakes to direct whole there papa now must be satisfied own dear mr weston who be carefulness remember what mr perry said so many year ago when have measles miss taylor undertakes to wrap miss emma up need not have fear sir how often have heard

week said from first be very good sort be great comfort measles be dreadful complaint hope whenever poor isabella little one have measles will send for perry father mr weston be at crown at moment said frank churchill examining capability of house left there came on to hartfield impatient for opinion hoping might be persuaded to join give advice on spot be desired to say so from must be greatest pleasure to if must allow to attend there can hing satisfactorily without emma be most happy to be called to council father engaging to think over while be gone two young people set off together without delay for crown there be mr mr weston delighted to see receive approbation very busy very happy in different way in little distress finding thing perfect emma said paper be worse than expected look in place see be dreadfully dirty wainscot be more yellow forlorn than thing must have imagined dear be too particular said husband what doe that signify will see nothing of by candlelight will be a clean a randalls by candlelight never see thing of on club night lady here probably exchanged look meant men never know when thing be dirty not gentleman perhaps thought to woman will have little nonsense needle care one perplexity however arose gentleman did not disdain regarded supper room at time of ballroom being built supper have not be in question small card room adjoining be only addition what be to be done card room must be wanted a card room now if card be conveniently voted unnecessary by four self still be not too small for comfortable supper room of much better size might be secured for purpose be at other end of house long awkward passage must be gone through to get at made difficulty mr weston be afraid of draught for young people in passage emma gentleman must tolerate prospect of being miserably crowded at supper mr weston proposed having regular supper merely sandwich c set out in little room be scouted a wretched suggestion private dance without sitting down to supper be pronounced infamous fraud upon right of men woman mr weston must not speak of again then took line of expediency looking into doubtful room observed think be so very small will not be many know mr weston at same time walking briskly with long step through passage be calling out talk great deal of length of passage dear be mere nothing after not least draught from stair wish said mr weston one must know arrangement guest in general must like best to do what must be most generally pleasing must be object if one must tell what must be yes very true cried frank very true want neighbour opinion wonder at if one must ascertain what chief of cole for instance be not far off will call upon miss bates be still nearer know whether miss bates be not a likely to understand inclination of rest of people a body think do want larger council suppose go invite miss bates to join well if please said mr weston rather hesitating if think will be of use will get nothing to purpose from miss bates said emma will be delight gratitude will tell nothing will not even listen to question see advantage in consulting miss bates be so amusing so extremely amusing be very fond of hearing miss bates talk need not bring whole family know here mr weston joined on hearing what be proposed gave decided approbation aye do frank go fetch miss bates let end matter at once will enjoy scheme be sure know properer person for shewing how to do away difficulty fetch miss bates be growing little too nice be standing lesson of how to be happy fetch invite sir can old lady old lady no young lady to be sure will think great blockhead frank if bring aunt without niece oh beg pardon sir did not immediately recollect undoubtedly if wish will endeavour to persuade away ran long before reappeared attending short neat brisk moving aunt elegant niece mr weston like sweet tempered woman good wife have examined passage again found evil of much le than have supposed before indeed very trifling here ended difficulty of decision rest in speculation at least be perfectly smooth minor arrangement of table chair light music tea supper made be left a mere trifle to be settled at time between mr weston mr stokes body invited be certainly to come frank have already written to enscombe to propose staying few day beyond fortnight must not possibly be refused delightful dance be to be most cordially when miss bates arrived did agree that must a counsellor be not wanted a approver much safer character be truly welcome approbation at once general minute warm incessant must not please for half hour be walking to fro between different room suggesting attending in happy enjoyment of future party did not break up without emma being positively secured for two first dance by hero of evening without overhearing mr weston whisper to wife have asked dear that be right knew must chapter xii one thing only be wanting to make prospect of ball completely satisfactory to emma being fixed for day within granted term of frank churchill stay in surry for in spite of mr weston confidence must not think so very impossible that churchill might not allow nephew to remain day beyond fortnight be not judged feasible preparation must take time nothing must be properly ready till third week be entered on for few day must be planning proceeding hoping in uncertainty at risk in opinion great risk of being in vain enscombe however be gracious gracious in fact if not in word wish of staying longer evidently did not please be not opposed be safe prosperous a removal of one solicitude generally make way for emma being now certain of ball began to adopt a next vexation mr knightley provoking indifference about either because did not dance because plan have be formed without being consulted seemed resolved that must not interest determined against exciting present curiosity affording future amusement to voluntary communication emma must get more approving reply than very well if weston think worth while to be at trouble for few hour of noisy entertainment have nothing to say against that will not chuse pleasure for oh yes must be there must not refuse will keep a much awake a can must rather be at home looking over william larkins week account much rather confess pleasure in seeing dancing not indeed never look at know who doe fine dancing believe like virtue must be own reward who be standing by be usually thinking of something very different emma felt be aimed at made quite angry be not in compliment to jane fairfax however that be so indifferent so indignant be not guided by feeling in reprobating ball for enjoyed thought of to extraordinary degree made animated open hearted voluntarily said oh miss woodhouse hope nothing may happen to prevent ball what disappointment must be do look forward to own with very great pleasure be not to oblige jane fairfax therefore that must have preferred society of william larkins be more more convinced that mr weston be quite mistaken in surmise there be great deal of friendly of compassionate attachment on side love ala there be soon leisure for quarrelling with mr knightley two day of joyful security be immediately followed by over throw of thing letter arrived from mr churchill to urge nephew instant return mr churchill be unwell far too unwell to do without have be in very suffering state so said husband when writing to nephew two day before though from usual unwillingness to give pain constant habit of never thinking of herself have not mentioned now be too ill to trifle must entreat to set off for enscombe without delay substance of letter be forwarded to emma in note from mr weston instantly a to going be inevitable must be gone within few hour though without feeling real alarm for aunt to lessen repugnance knew illness never occurred for own convenience mr weston added that must only allow time to hurry to highbury after breakfast take leave of few friend there whom must suppose to feel interest in that might be expected at hartfield very soon wretched note be finale of emma breakfast when once have be read there be doing thing lament exclaim loss of ball loss of young man that young man might be feeling be too wretched such delightful evening a must have be body so happy partner happiest said must be so be only consolation father feeling be quite distinct thought principally of mr churchill illness wanted to know how be treated a for ball be shocking to have dear emma disappointed must all be safer at home emma be ready for visitor time before appeared if reflected at upon impatience sorrowful look total want of spirit when did come might redeem felt going away almost too much to speak of dejection be most evident sat really lost in thought for first few minute when rousing be only to say of horrid thing leave taking be worst will come again said emma will not be only visit to randalls ah shaking head uncertainty of when may be able to return will try for with zeal will be object of thought care if uncle aunt go to town spring be afraid did not stir last spring be afraid be custom gone for ever poor ball must be quite given up ah that ball why did wait for thing why not seize pleasure at once how often be happiness destroyed by preparation foolish preparation told must be so oh miss woodhouse why be always so right indeed be very sorry to be right in instance must much rather have be merry than wise if can come again be still to have ball father depends on forget engagement emma looked graciously such fortnight a have be continued day more precious more delightful than day before day making le fit to bear other place happy who can remain at highbury a do such ample justice now said emma laughing will venture to ask whether did not come little doubtfully at first rather surpass expectation be sure do be sure did not much expect to like must not have be so long in coming if have have pleasant idea of highbury laughed rather consciously though denying sentiment emma be convinced that have be so must be off very morning yes father be to join here will walk back together must be off immediately be almost afraid that moment will bring not five minute to spare even for friend miss fairfax miss bates how unlucky miss bates powerful argumentative mind might have strengthened yours yes have called there passing door thought better be right thing to do went in for three minute be detained by miss bates being absent be out felt impossible not to wait till came in be woman that one may one must laugh at that one must not wish to slight be better to pay visit then hesitated got up walked to window in short said perhaps miss woodhouse think can hardly be quite without suspicion looked at a if wanting to read thought hardly knew what to say seemed like forerunner of something absolutely serious did not wish forcing to speak therefore in hope of putting by calmly said be quite in right be most natural to pay visit then be silent believed be looking at probably reflecting on what have said trying to understand manner heard sigh be natural for to feel that have cause to sigh must not believe to be encouraging few awkward moment passed sat down again in more determined manner said be something to feel that rest of time might be given to hartfield regard for hartfield be most warm stopt again rose again seemed quite embarrassed be more in love with than emma have supposed who can say how might have ended if father have not made appearance mr woodhouse soon followed necessity of exertion made composed very few minute more however completed present trial mr weston always alert when business be to be done a incapable of procrastinating evil be inevitable a of foreseeing be doubtful said be time to go young man though might did sigh must not agree to take leave will hear about said be chief consolation will hear of thing be going on among have engaged mr weston to correspond with have be so kind a to promise oh blessing of female correspondent when one be really interested in absent will tell thing in letter will be at dear highbury again very friendly shake of hand very earnest good bye closed speech door have soon shut out frank churchill short have be notice short meeting be gone emma felt so sorry to part foresaw so great loss to little society from absence a to begin to be afraid of being too sorry feeling too much be sad change have be meeting almost day since arrival certainly being at randalls have given great spirit to last two week indescribable spirit idea expectation of seeing morning have brought assurance of attention liveliness manner have be very happy fortnight forlorn must be sinking from into common course of hartfield day to complete other recommendation have almost told that loved what strength what constancy of affection might be subject to be point at present must not doubt having decidedly warm admiration conscious preference of herself persuasion joined to rest made think that must be little in love with in spite of previous determination against certainly must said sensation of listlessness weariness stupidity disinclination to sit down employ feeling of thing being dull insipid about house must be in love must be oddest creature in world if be not for few week at least well evil to be always good to others will have many fellow mourner for ball if not for frank churchill mr knightley will be happy may spend evening with dear william larkins now if like mr knightley however shewed triumphant happiness must not say that be sorry on own account very cheerful look must have contradicted if have said very steadily that be sorry for disappointment of others with considerable kindness added emma who have so few opportunity of dancing be really out of luck be very much out of luck be day before saw jane fairfax to judge of honest regret in woeful change when did meet composure be odious have be particularly unwell however suffering from headache to degree made aunt declare have ball taken place did not think jane must have attended be charity to impute of unbecoming indifference to languor of ill health chapter xiii emma continued to entertain doubt of being in love idea only varied a to how much at first thought be good deal afterwards little have great pleasure in hearing frank churchill talked of for sake greater pleasure than ever in seeing mr mr weston be very often thinking of quite impatient for letter might know how be how be spirit how be aunt be chance of coming to randalls again spring on other hand must not admit to be unhappy after first morning to be le disposed for employment than usual be still busy cheerful pleasing a be must yet imagine to have fault farther though thinking of so much a sat drawing working forming thousand amusing scheme for progress close of attachment fancying interesting dialogue inventing elegant letter conclusion of imaginary declaration on side be that refused affection be always to subside into friendship thing tender charming be to mark parting still be to part when became sensible of struck that must not be very much in love for in spite of previous fixed determination never to quit father never to marry strong attachment certainly must produce more of struggle than must foresee in own feeling find making use of word sacrifice said in not one of clever reply delicate negative be there allusion to making sacrifice do suspect that be not really necessary to happiness so much better certainly will not persuade to feel more than do be quite enough in love must be sorry to be more upon whole be equally contented with view of feeling be undoubtedly very much in love thing denotes very much in love indeed when come again if affection continue must be on guard not to encourage must be most inexcusable to do otherwise a own mind be quite made up not that imagine can think have be encouraging hitherto if have believed at to share feeling must not have be so wretched must have thought encouraged look language at parting must have be different still however must be on guard be in supposition of attachment continuing what now be know that expect will look upon to be quite sort of man altogether build upon steadiness constancy feeling be warm can imagine rather changeable consideration of subject in short make thankful that happiness be not more deeply involved will do very well again after little while then will be good thing over for say body be in love once in life will have be let off easily when letter to mr weston arrived emma have perusal of read with degree of pleasure admiration made at first shake head over own sensation think have undervalued strength be long well written letter giving particular of journey of feeling expressing affection gratitude respect be natural honourable describing thing exterior local must be supposed attractive with spirit precision suspicious flourish now of apology concern be language of real feeling towards mr weston transition from highbury to enscombe contrast between place in of first blessing of social life be just enough touched on to shew how keenly be felt how much more might have be said for restraint of propriety charm of own name be not wanting miss woodhouse appeared more than once never without something of pleasing connexion compliment to taste remembrance of what have said in very last time of meeting eye unadorned a be by such broad wreath of gallantry yet must discern effect of influence acknowledge greatest compliment perhaps of conveyed compressed into very lowest vacant corner be word have not spare moment on tuesday a know for miss woodhouse beautiful little friend pray make excuse adieu to emma must not doubt be for harriet be remembered only from being friend information prospect a to enscombe be worse better than have be anticipated mr churchill be recovering dared not yet even in own imagination fix time for coming to randalls again gratifying however stimulative a be letter in material part sentiment yet found when be folded up returned to mr weston that have not added lasting warmth that must still do without writer that must learn to do without intention be unchanged resolution of refusal only grew more interesting by addition of scheme for subsequent consolation happiness recollection of harriet word clothed beautiful little friend suggested to idea of harriet succeeding in affection be impossible harriet undoubtedly be greatly inferior in understanding have be very much struck with loveliness of face warm simplicity of manner probability of circumstance connexion be in favour for harriet must be advantageous delightful indeed must not dwell upon said must not think of know danger of indulging such speculation stranger thing have happened when cease to care for other a do now will be mean of confirming in sort of true disinterested friendship can already look forward to with pleasure be well to have comfort in store on harriet behalf though might be wise to let fancy touch seldom for evil in quarter be at hand a frank churchill arrival have succeeded mr elton engagement in conversation of highbury a latest interest have entirely borne down first so now upon frank churchill disappearance mr elton concern be assuming most irresistible form wedding day be named must soon be among again mr elton bride there be hardly time to talk over first letter from enscombe before mr elton bride be in body mouth frank churchill be forgotten emma grew sick at sound have have three week of happy exemption from mr elton harriet mind have be willing to hope have be lately gaining strength with mr weston ball in view at least there have be great deal of insensibility to other thing be now too evident that have not attained state of composure a must stand against actual approach new carriage bell ringing poor harriet be in flutter of spirit required reasoning soothings attention of kind that emma must give emma felt that must not do too much for harriet have right to ingenuity patience be heavy work to be for ever convincing without producing effect for ever agreed to without being able to make opinion same harriet listened submissively said be very true be just a miss woodhouse described be not worth while to think about must not think about longer change of subject must avail next half hour saw a anxious restless about eltons a before at last emma attacked on ground allowing to be so occupied so unhappy about mr elton marrying harriet be strongest reproach can make must not give greater reproof for mistake fell into be doing know have not forgotten assure deceived did very miserably deceive will be painful reflection to for ever imagine in danger of forgetting harriet felt too much to utter more than few word of eager exclamation emma continued have not said exert harriet for sake think le talk le of mr elton for sake because for own sake rather must wish to be done for sake of what be more important than comfort habit of self command in consideration of what be duty attention to propriety endeavour to avoid suspicion of others to save health credit restore tranquillity be motif have be pressing on be very important sorry be that can not feel sufficiently to act upon being saved from pain be very secondary consideration want to save from greater pain perhaps may sometimes have felt that harriet must not forget what be due rather what must be kind by appeal to affection did more than rest idea of wanting gratitude consideration for miss woodhouse whom really loved extremely made wretched for while when violence of grief be comforted away still remained powerful enough to prompt to what be right support in very tolerably who have be best friend ever have in life want gratitude to nobody be equal to care for nobody a do for oh miss woodhouse how ungrateful have be such expression assisted a be by thing look manner must do made emma feel that have never loved harriet so well valued affection so highly before there be charm equal to tenderness of heart said afterwards to herself there be nothing to be compared to warmth tenderness of heart with affectionate open manner will beat clearness of head in world for attraction be sure will be tenderness of heart make dear father so generally beloved give isabella popularity have not know how to prize respect harriet be superior in charm felicity give dear harriet must not change for clearest headed longest sighted best judging female breathing oh coldness of jane fairfax harriet be worth hundred such for wife sensible man wife be invaluable mention name happy man who change emma for harriet chapter xiv mr elton be first seen at church though devotion might be interrupted curiosity must not be satisfied by bride in pew must be left for visit in form be then to be paid to settle whether be very pretty indeed only rather pretty not pretty at emma have feeling le of curiosity than of pride propriety to make resolve on not being last to pay respect made point of harriet going with that worst of business might be gone through a soon a possible must not enter house again must not be in same room to have with such vain artifice retreated three month ago to lace up boot without recollecting thousand vexatious thought must recur compliment charade horrible blunder be not to be supposed that poor harriet must not be recollecting too behaved very well be only rather pale silent visit be of course short there be so much embarrassment occupation of mind to shorten that emma must not allow entirely to form opinion of lady on account to give one beyond nothing meaning term of being elegantly dressed very pleasing did not really like must not be in hurry to find fault suspected that there be elegance ease not elegance be almost sure that for young woman stranger bride there be too much ease person be rather good face not unpretty feature air voice manner be elegant emma thought at least must turn out so a for mr elton manner did not appear must not permit hasty witty word from about manner be awkward ceremony at time to be receiving wedding visit man have need be grace to acquit well through woman be better off might have assistance of fine clothes privilege of bashfulness man have only own good sense to depend on when considered how peculiarly unlucky poor mr elton be in being in same room at once with woman have just married woman have wanted to marry woman whom have be expected to marry must allow to have right to look a little wise to be a much affectedly a little really easy a must be well miss woodhouse said harriet when have quitted house after waiting in vain for friend to begin well miss woodhouse with gentle sigh what do think of be not very charming there be little hesitation in emma answer oh yes very very pleasing young woman think beautiful quite beautiful very nicely dressed indeed remarkably elegant gown be not at surprized that must have fallen in love oh there be nothing to surprize one at pretty fortune came in way dare say returned harriet sighing again dare say be very much attached to perhaps might be not man fate to marry woman who love best miss hawkins perhaps wanted home thought best offer be likely to have yes said harriet earnestly well might nobody must ever have better well wish happy with heart now miss woodhouse think will mind seeing again be just a superior a ever being married know be quite different thing indeed miss woodhouse need not be afraid can sit admire now without great misery to know that have not thrown away be such comfort doe seem charming young woman just what deserves happy creature called 'augusta how delightful when visit be returned emma made up mind must then see more judge better from harriet happening not to be at hartfield father being present to engage mr elton have quarter of hour of lady conversation to herself must composedly attend to quarter of hour quite convinced that mr elton be vain woman extremely well satisfied with thinking much of own importance that meant to shine be very superior with manner have be formed in bad school pert familiar that notion be drawn from one set of people one style of living that if not foolish be ignorant that society must certainly do mr elton good harriet must have be better match if not wise refined must have connected with who be miss hawkins might be fairly supposed from easy conceit have be best of own set rich brother in law near bristol be pride of alliance place carriage be pride of very first subject after being seated be maple grove brother mr suckling seat comparison of hartfield to maple grove ground of hartfield be small neat pretty house be modern well built mr elton seemed most favourably impressed by size of room entrance that must see imagine very like maple grove indeed be quite struck by likeness that room be very shape size of morning room at maple grove sister favourite room mr elton be appealed to be not astonishingly like must really almost fancy at maple grove staircase know a came in observed how very like staircase be placed exactly in same part of house really must not help exclaiming assure miss woodhouse be very delightful to to be reminded of place be so extremely partial to a maple grove have spent so many happy month there with little sigh of sentiment charming place undoubtedly body who see be struck by beauty to have be quite home whenever be transplanted like miss woodhouse will understand how very delightful be to meet with thing at like what one have left behind always say be quite one of evil of matrimony emma made a slight reply a must be fully sufficient for mr elton who only wanted to be talking so extremely like maple grove be not merely house ground assure a far a must observe be strikingly like laurel at maple grove be in same profusion a here stand very much in same way just across lawn have glimpse of fine large tree with bench round put so exactly in mind brother sister will be enchanted with place people who have extensive ground be always pleased with thing in same style emma doubted truth of sentiment have great idea people who have extensive ground cared very little for extensive ground of body else be not worth while to attack error so double dyed therefore only said in reply when have seen more of country be afraid will think have overrated hartfield surry be full of beauty oh yes be quite aware of that be garden of england know surry be garden of england yes must not rest claim on distinction many county believe be called garden of england a well a surry fancy not replied mr elton with most satisfied smile never heard county surry called so emma be silenced brother sister have promised visit in spring summer at farthest continued mr elton will be time for exploring while be with will explore great deal dare say will have barouche landau of course hold four perfectly therefore without saying thing of carriage must be able to explore different beauty extremely well must hardly come in chaise think at season of year indeed when time draw on will decidedly recommend bringing barouche landau will be so very much preferable when people come into beautiful country of sort know miss woodhouse one naturally wish to see a much a possible mr suckling be extremely fond of exploring explored to king weston twice last summer in way most delightfully just after first having barouche landau have many party of kind here suppose miss woodhouse summer not immediately here be rather out of distance of very striking beauty attract sort of party speak of be very quiet set of people believe more disposed to stay at home than engage in scheme of pleasure ah there be nothing like staying at home for real comfort nobody can be more devoted to home than be be quite proverb for at maple grove many time have selina said when have be going to bristol ' really can not get girl to move from house absolutely must go in by though hate being stuck up in barouche landau without companion augusta believe with own good will must never stir beyond park paling ' many time have said so yet be advocate for entire seclusion think on contrary when people shut up entirely from society be very bad thing that be much more advisable to mix in world in proper degree without living in either too much too little perfectly understand situation however miss woodhouse looking towards mr woodhouse father state of health must be great drawback why doe not try bath indeed must let recommend bath to assure have doubt of doing mr woodhouse good father tried more than once formerly without receiving benefit mr perry whose name dare say be not unknown to doe not conceive must be at more likely to be useful now ah be great pity for assure miss woodhouse where water do agree be quite wonderful relief give in bath life have seen such instance of be so cheerful place that must not fail of being of use to mr woodhouse spirit understand be sometimes much depressed a to recommendation to fancy need not take much pain to dwell on advantage of bath to young be pretty generally understood must be charming introduction for who have lived so secluded life must immediately secure of best society in place line from must bring little host of acquaintance particular friend mr partridge lady have always resided with when in bath must be most happy to shew attention must be very person for to go into public with be a much a emma must bear without being idea of being indebted to mr elton for what be called introduction of going into public under auspex of friend of mr elton probably vulgar dashing widow who with help of boarder just made shift to live dignity of miss woodhouse of hartfield be sunk indeed restrained however from of reproof must have given only thanked mr elton coolly going to bath be quite out of question be not perfectly convinced that place might suit better than father then to prevent farther outrage indignation changed subject directly ask whether be musical mr elton upon occasion lady character generally precedes highbury have long known that be superior performer oh indeed must protest against such idea superior performer very far from assure consider from how partial quarter information came be doatingly fond of music passionately fond friend say be not entirely devoid of taste a to thing else upon honour performance be mediocre to last degree miss woodhouse well know play delightfully assure have be greatest satisfaction comfort delight to to hear what musical society be got into absolutely can not do without music be necessary of life to having always be used to very musical society at maple grove in bath must have be most serious sacrifice honestly said a much to mr e when be speaking of future home expressing fear lest retirement of must be disagreeable inferiority of house too knowing what have be accustomed to of course be not wholly without apprehension when be speaking of in way honestly said that world must give up party ball play for have fear of retirement blessed with so many resource within world be not necessary to must do very well without to who have resource be different thing resource made quite independent a to smaller sized room than have be used to really must not give thought hoped be perfectly equal to sacrifice of description certainly have be accustomed to luxury at maple grove did assure that two carriage be not necessary to happiness be spacious apartment ' said be quite honest think can live without something of musical society condition for nothing else without music life must be blank to ' can not suppose said emma smiling mr elton must hesitate to assure of there being very musical society in highbury hope will not find have outstepped truth more than may be pardoned in consideration of motive indeed have doubt at on head be delighted to find in circle hope will have many sweet little concert together think miss woodhouse must establish musical club have regular weekly meeting at house ours will not be good plan if exert think will not be long in want of ally something of nature must be particularly desirable for a inducement to keep in practice for married woman know there be sad story against in general be too apt to give up music who be so extremely fond of there can be no danger surely must hope not really when look around among acquaintance tremble selina have entirely given up music never touch instrument though played sweetly same may be said of mr jeffereys clara partridge be of two milmans now mr bird mr james cooper of more than can enumerate upon word be enough to put one in fright used to be quite angry with selina really begin now to comprehend that married woman have many thing to call attention believe be hour morning shut up with housekeeper thing of kind said emma will soon be in so regular train well said mr elton laughing will see emma finding so determined upon neglecting music have nothing more to say after moment pause mr elton chose subject have be calling at randalls said found at home very pleasant people seem to be like extremely mr weston seems excellent creature quite first rate favourite with already assure appears so truly good there be something so motherly kind hearted about that win upon one directly be governess think emma be almost too much astonished to answer mr elton hardly waited for affirmative before went on having understood a much be rather astonished to find so very lady like be really quite gentlewoman mr weston manner said emma be always particularly good propriety simplicity elegance must make safest model for young woman who do think came in while be there emma be quite at loss tone implied old acquaintance how must possibly guess knightley continued mr elton knightley be not lucky for not being within

never met with equal much beyond hope harriet be disgraced by comparison oh what must frank churchill say to if be here how angry how diverted must be ah there be thinking of directly always first person to be thought of how catch out frank churchill come a regularly into mind ran so glibly through thought that by time father have arranged after bustle of eltons departure be ready to speak be very tolerably capable of attending well dear deliberately began considering never saw before seems very pretty sort of young lady dare say be very much pleased with speaks little too quick little quickness of voice there be rather hurt ear believe be nice like strange voice nobody speaks like poor miss taylor however seems very obliging pretty behaved young lady doubt will make very good wife though think have better not have married made best excuse must for not having be able to wait on mr elton on happy occasion said that hoped must in course of summer ought to have gone before not to wait upon bride be very remiss ah shews what sad invalid be like corner into vicarage lane dare say apology be accepted sir mr elton know yes young lady bride ought to have paid respect to if possible be being very deficient dear papa be friend to matrimony therefore why must be so anxious to pay respect to bride ought to be recommendation to be encouraging people to marry if make so much of dear never encouraged body to marry must always wish to pay proper attention to lady bride especially be never to be neglected more be avowedly due to bride know dear be always first in company let others be who may well papa if be not encouragement to marry know what be must never have expected to be lending sanction to such vanity bait for poor young lady dear understand be matter of mere common politeness good breeding have nothing to do with encouragement to people to marry emma have done father be growing nervous must not understand mind returned to mr elton offence long very long did occupy chapter xv emma be not required by subsequent discovery to retract ill opinion of mr elton observation have be pretty correct such a mr elton appeared to on second interview such appeared whenever met again self important presuming familiar ignorant ill bred have little beauty little accomplishment so little judgment that thought coming with superior knowledge of world to enliven improve country neighbourhood conceived miss hawkins to have held place in society a mr elton consequence only must surpass there be reason to suppose mr elton thought at differently from wife seemed not merely happy with proud have air of congratulating on having brought woman to highbury a not even miss woodhouse must equal greater part of new acquaintance disposed to commend not in habit of judging following lead of miss bates good will taking for granted that bride must be a clever a agreeable a professed be very well satisfied so that mr elton praise passed from one mouth to a ought to do unimpeded by miss woodhouse who readily continued first contribution talked with good grace of being very pleasant very elegantly dressed in one respect mr elton grew even worse than have appeared at first feeling altered towards emma offended probably by little encouragement proposal of intimacy met with drew back in turn gradually became much more cold distant though effect be agreeable ill will produced be necessarily increasing emma dislike manner too mr elton be unpleasant towards harriet be sneering negligent emma hoped must rapidly work harriet cure sensation must prompt such behaviour sunk very much be not to be doubted that poor harriet attachment have be offering to conjugal unreserve own share in story under colouring least favourable to most soothing to have in likelihood be given also be of course object of joint dislike when have nothing else to say must be always easy to begin abusing miss woodhouse enmity dared not shew in open disrespect to found broader vent in contemptuous treatment of harriet mr elton took great fancy to jane fairfax from first not merely when state of warfare with one young lady might be supposed to recommend other from very first be not satisfied with expressing natural reasonable admiration without solicitation plea privilege must be wanting to assist befriend before emma have forfeited confidence about third time of meeting heard mr elton knight errantry on subject jane fairfax be absolutely charming miss woodhouse quite rave about jane fairfax sweet interesting creature so mild ladylike with such talent assure think have very extraordinary talent scruple to say that play extremely well know enough of music to speak decidedly on point oh be absolutely charming will laugh at warmth upon word talk of nothing jane fairfax situation be so calculated to affect one miss woodhouse must exert endeavour to do something for must bring forward such talent a hers must not be suffered to remain unknown dare say have heard charming line of poet 'full many flower be born to blush unseen 'and waste fragrance on desert air must not allow to be verified in sweet jane fairfax can not think there be danger of be be calm answer when be better acquainted with miss fairfax situation understand what home have be with colonel mr campbell have idea that will suppose talent can be unknown oh dear miss woodhouse be now in such retirement such obscurity so thrown away advantage may have enjoyed with campbell be so palpably at end think feel be sure doe be very timid silent one can see that feel want of encouragement like better for must confess be recommendation to be great advocate for timidity be sure one doe not often meet with in who be at inferior be extremely prepossessing oh assure jane fairfax be very delightful character interest more than can express appear to feel great deal be not aware how of miss fairfax acquaintance here of who have known longer than can shew other attention than dear miss woodhouse vast deal may be done by who dare to act need not be afraid if set example many will follow a far a can though have not situation have carriage to fetch convey home live in style must not make addition of jane fairfax at time least inconvenient must be extremely displeased if wright be to send up such dinner a must make regret having asked more than jane fairfax to partake of have idea of sort of thing be not likely that must considering what have be used to greatest danger perhaps in housekeeping may be quite other way in doing too much being too careless of expense maple grove will probably be model more than ought to be for at affect to equal brother mr suckling in income however resolution be taken a to noticing jane fairfax will certainly have very often at house will introduce wherever can will have musical party to draw out talent will be constantly on watch for eligible situation acquaintance be so very extensive have little doubt of hearing of something to suit shortly will introduce of course very particularly to brother sister when come to be sure will like extremely when get little acquainted with fear will completely wear off for there really be nothing in manner of what be highly conciliating will have very often indeed while be with dare say will sometimes find seat for in barouche landau in of exploring party poor jane fairfax thought emma have not deserved may have done wrong with regard to mr dixon be punishment beyond what can have merited kindness protection of mr elton fairfax jane fairfax ' heaven let not suppose that dare go about emma woodhouse ing upon honour there seems limit to licentiousness of woman tongue emma have not to listen to such paradings again to so exclusively addressed to herself so disgustingly decorated with dear miss woodhouse change on mr elton side soon afterwards appeared be left in peace neither forced to be very particular friend of mr elton under mr elton guidance very active patroness of jane fairfax only sharing with others in general way in knowing what be felt what be meditated what be done looked on with amusement miss bates gratitude for mr elton attention to jane be in first style of guileless simplicity warmth be quite one of worthy most amiable affable delightful woman just a accomplished condescending a mr elton meant to be considered emma only surprize be that jane fairfax must accept attention tolerate mr elton a seemed to do heard of walking with eltons sitting with eltons spending day with eltons be astonishing must not have believed possible that taste pride of miss fairfax must endure such society friendship a vicarage have to offer be riddle quite riddle said to chuse to remain here month after month under privation of sort now to chuse mortification of mr elton notice penury of conversation rather than return to superior companion who have always loved with such real generous affection jane have come to highbury professedly for three month campbell be gone to ireland for three month now campbell have promised daughter to stay at least till midsummer fresh invitation have arrived for to join there according to miss bates came from mr dixon have written most pressingly must jane go mean be to be found servant sent friend contrived travelling difficulty allowed to exist still have declined must have motive more powerful than appears for refusing invitation be emma conclusion must be under sort of penance inflicted either by campbell there be great fear great caution great resolution somewhere be not to be with dixons decree be issued by somebody why must consent to be with eltons here be quite separate puzzle upon speaking wonder aloud on part of subject before few who knew opinion of mr elton mr weston ventured apology for jane can not suppose that have great enjoyment at vicarage dear emma be better than being always at home aunt be good creature a constant companion must be very tiresome must consider what miss fairfax quits before condemn taste for what go to be right mr weston said mr knightley warmly miss fairfax be a capable a of of forming just opinion of mr elton must have chosen with whom to associate must not have chosen with reproachful smile at emma receives attention from mr elton nobody else pay emma felt that mr weston be giving momentary glance be struck by warmth with faint blush presently replied such attention a mr elton must have imagined must rather disgust than gratify miss fairfax mr elton invitation must have imagined thing inviting must not wonder said mr weston if miss fairfax be to have be drawn on beyond own inclination by aunt eagerness in accepting mr elton civility for poor miss bates may very likely have committed niece hurried into greater appearance of intimacy than own good sense must have dictated in spite of very natural wish of little change felt rather anxious to hear speak again after few minute silence said thing must be taken into consideration too mr elton doe not talk to miss fairfax a speaks of know difference between pronoun thou plainest spoken amongst feel influence of something beyond common civility in personal intercourse with other something more early implanted can not give body disagreeable hint that may have be very full of hour before feel thing differently besides operation of a general principle may be sure that miss fairfax awe mr elton by superiority of mind manner face to face mr elton treat with respect have claim to woman a jane fairfax probably never fell in mr elton way before degree of vanity can prevent acknowledging own comparative littleness in action if not in consciousness know how highly think of jane fairfax said emma little henry be in thought mixture of alarm delicacy made irresolute what else to say yes replied body may know how highly think of yet said emma beginning hastily with arch look soon stopping be better however to know worst at once hurried on yet perhaps may hardly be aware how highly be extent of admiration may take by surprize day other mr knightley be hard at work upon lower button of thick leather gaiter exertion of getting together other cause brought colour into face a answered oh be there be miserably behindhand mr cole gave hint of six week ago stopped emma felt foot pressed by mr weston did not herself know what to think in moment went on will never be however can assure miss fairfax dare say must not have if be to ask be very sure will never ask emma returned friend pressure with interest be pleased enough to exclaim be not vain mr knightley will say that for seemed hardly to hear be thoughtful in manner shewed not pleased soon afterwards said so have be settling must marry jane fairfax indeed have not have scolded too much for match making for to presume to take liberty with said just now meant nothing one say sort of thing of course without idea of serious meaning oh upon word have not smallest wish for marrying jane fairfax jane body must not come in sit with in comfortable way if be married mr knightley be thoughtful again result of reverie be emma think extent of admiration for will ever take by surprize never have thought of in way assure soon afterwards jane fairfax be very charming young woman not even jane fairfax be perfect have fault have not open temper man must wish for in wife emma must not rejoice to hear that have fault well said soon silenced mr cole suppose yes very soon gave quiet hint told be mistaken asked pardon said more cole doe not want to be wiser wittier than neighbour in respect how unlike dear mr elton who want to be wiser wittier than world wonder how speaks of cole what call how can find appellation for deep enough in familiar vulgarity call knightley what can do for mr cole so be not to be surprized that jane fairfax accepts civility consent to be with mr weston argument weighs most with can much more readily enter into temptation of getting away from miss bates than can believe in triumph of miss fairfax mind over mr elton have faith in mr elton acknowledging inferior in thought word deed in being under restraint beyond own scanty rule of good breeding can not imagine that will not be continually insulting visitor with praise encouragement offer of service that will not be continually detailing magnificent intention from procuring permanent situation to including in delightful exploring party be to take place in barouche landau jane fairfax have feeling said mr knightley accuse of want of feeling sensibility suspect be strong temper excellent in power of forbearance patience self control want openness be reserved more reserved think than used to be love open temper till cole alluded to supposed attachment have never entered head saw jane fairfax conversed with with admiration pleasure always with thought beyond well mr weston said emma triumphantly when left what do say now to mr knightley marrying jane fairfax why really dear emma say that be so very much occupied by idea of not being in love with must not wonder if be to end in being so at last beat chapter xvi body in about highbury who have ever visited mr elton be disposed to pay attention on marriage dinner party evening party be made for lady invitation flowed in so fast that have soon pleasure of apprehending be never to have disengaged day see how be said see what life be to lead among upon word will be absolutely dissipated really seem quite fashion if be living in country be nothing very formidable from monday next to saturday assure have not disengaged day woman with fewer resource than have need not have be at loss invitation came amiss to bath habit made evening party perfectly natural to maple grove have given taste for dinner be little shocked at want of two drawing room at poor attempt at rout cake there being ice in highbury card party mr bates mr perry mr goddard others be good deal behind hand in knowledge of world must soon shew how thing ought to be arranged in course of spring must return civility by one very superior party in card table must be set out with separate candle unbroken pack in true style more waiter engaged for evening than own establishment must furnish to carry round refreshment at exactly proper hour in proper order emma in meanwhile must not be satisfied without dinner at hartfield for eltons must not do le than others must be exposed to odious suspicion imagined capable of pitiful resentment dinner there must be after emma have talked about for ten minute mr woodhouse felt unwillingness only made usual stipulation of not sitting at bottom of table with usual regular difficulty of deciding who must do for person to be invited required little thought besides eltons must be weston mr knightley so far be of course be hardly le inevitable that poor little harriet must be asked to make eighth invitation be not given with equal satisfaction on many account emma be particularly pleased by harriet begging to be allowed to decline must rather not be in company more than must help be not yet quite able to see charming happy wife together without feeling uncomfortable if miss woodhouse must not be displeased must rather stay at home be precisely what emma must have wished have deemed possible enough for wishing be delighted with fortitude of little friend for fortitude knew be in to give up being in company stay at home must now invite very person whom really wanted to make eighth jane fairfax since last conversation with mr weston mr knightley be more conscience stricken about jane fairfax than have often be mr knightley word dwelt with have said that jane fairfax received attention from mr elton nobody else paid be very true said at least a far a relates to be be meant be very shameful of same age always knowing ought to have be more friend will never like now have neglected too long will shew greater attention than have done invitation be successful be disengaged happy preparatory interest of dinner however be not yet over circumstance rather unlucky occurred two eldest little knightleys be engaged to pay grandpapa aunt visit of week in spring papa now proposed bringing staying one whole day at hartfield one day must be very day of party professional engagement did not allow of being put off father daughter be disturbed by happening so mr woodhouse considered eight person at dinner together a utmost that nerve must bear here must be ninth emma apprehended that must be ninth very much out of humour at not being able to come even to hartfield for forty eight hour without falling in with dinner party comforted father better than must comfort by representing that though certainly must make nine yet always said so little that increase of noise must be very immaterial thought in reality sad exchange for herself to have with grave look reluctant conversation opposed to instead of brother event be more favourable to mr woodhouse than to emma john knightley came mr weston be unexpectedly summoned to town must be absent on very day might be able to join in evening certainly not to dinner mr woodhouse be quite at ease seeing so with arrival of little boy philosophic composure of brother on hearing fate removed chief of even emma vexation day came party be punctually assembled mr john knightley seemed early to devote to business of being agreeable instead of drawing brother off to window while waited for dinner be talking to miss fairfax mr elton a elegant a lace pearl must make looked at in silence wanting only to observe enough for isabella information miss fairfax be old acquaintance quiet girl must talk to have met before breakfast a be returning from walk with little boy when have be just beginning to rain be natural to have

dearest connexion therefore can not expect that simply growing older must make indifferent about letter indifferent oh never conceived must become indifferent letter be matter of indifference be generally very positive curse be speaking of letter of business mine be letter of friendship have often thought worst of two replied coolly business know may bring money friendship hardly ever doe ah be not serious now know mr john knightley too well be very sure understands value of friendship a well a body can easily believe that letter be very little to much le than to be not being ten year older than make difference be not age situation have body dearest to always at hand probably never will again therefore till have outlived affection post office think must always have power to draw out in worse weather than to day when talked of being altered by time by progress of year said john knightley meant to imply change of situation time usually brings consider one a including other time will generally lessen interest of attachment not within daily circle be not change have in view for a old friend will allow to hope miss fairfax ten year hence may have a many concentrated object a have be kindly said very far from giving offence pleasant thank seemed meant to laugh off blush quivering lip tear in eye shewed that be felt beyond laugh attention be now claimed by mr woodhouse who

made inquiry two a to expedition expense of irish mail be at tongue end abstained be quite determined not to utter word must hurt jane fairfax feeling followed other lady out of room arm in arm with appearance of good will highly becoming to beauty grace of chapter xvii when lady returned to drawing room after dinner emma found hardly possible to prevent making two distinct party with so much perseverance in judging behaving ill did mr elton engross jane fairfax slight mr weston be obliged to be almost always talking together silent together mr elton left choice if jane repressed for little time soon began again though much that passed between be in half whisper especially on mr elton side there be avoiding knowledge of principal subject post office catching cold fetching letter

cold sleety april day rush out again into world must by touch of finger have instantly taken back wife there must have be motive coming must probably prolong rather than break up party john knightley

agitation rather thought be considerable mr weston however too eager to be very observant too communicative to want others to talk be very well satisfied with what did say soon moved away to make rest of friend happy by partial communication of what whole room must have overheard already be well that took body joy for granted might not have thought either mr woodhouse mr knightley particularly delighted be first entitled after mr weston emma to be made happy from must have proceeded to miss fairfax be so deep in conversation with john knightley that must have be too positive interruption finding close to mr elton attention disengaged necessarily began on subject with chapter xviii hope will soon have pleasure of introducing son to said mr weston mr elton very willing to suppose

of mind give most spirit delight hope will be pleased with son must not expect prodigy be generally thought fine young man expect prodigy mr weston partiality for be very great a may suppose most gratifying to think nobody equal to assure mr weston have very little doubt that opinion will be decidedly in favour have heard so much in praise of mr frank churchill at same time be fair to observe

dancing not classing with husband father whist player who be pretending to feel interest in dance till rubber be made up so young a looked must not have appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere than where have placed tall firm upright figure among bulky form stooping shoulder of elderly men be such a emma felt must draw body eye excepting own partner there be not one among whole row of young men who must be compared with moved few step nearer few step be enough to prove in how gentlemanlike manner with what natural grace must have danced must take trouble whenever caught eye forced to smile in general be looking grave wished must love ballroom better must like frank churchill better seemed often observing must not flatter that thought of dancing if be criticising behaviour did not feel afraid there be nothing like flirtation between partner seemed more like cheerful easy friend than lover frank churchill thought le of than have done be indubitable ball proceeded pleasantly anxious care incessant attention of mr weston be not thrown away body seemed happy praise of being delightful ball be seldom bestowed till after ball have ceased to be be repeatedly given in very beginning of existence of of very important very recordable event be not more productive than such meeting usually be there be one however emma thought something of two last dance before supper be begun harriet have partner only young lady sitting down so equal have be hitherto number of dancer how there must be one disengaged be wonder emma wonder lessened soon afterwards on seeing mr elton sauntering about must not ask harriet to dance if be possible to be avoided be sure must not be expecting moment to escape into card room escape however be not plan came to part of room where sitter by be collected spoke to walked about in front of a if to shew liberty resolution of maintaining did not omit being sometimes directly before miss smith speaking to who be close to emma saw be not yet

after supper when be in ballroom again eye invited irresistibly to come to be thanked be warm in reprobation of mr elton conduct have be unpardonable rudeness mr elton look also received due share of censure aimed at wounding more than harriet said emma why be that be enemy looked with smiling penetration on receiving answer added ought not to be angry with suspect whatever may be to surmise say nothing of course confess emma that did want to marry harriet did replied emma can not forgive shook head there be smile of indulgence with only said will not scold leave to own reflection can trust

littleness about discovered did not be fully convinced of being in love with harriet be through series of strange blunder in return for acknowledging so much will do justice to say that must have chosen for better than have chosen for harriet smith have first rate quality mr elton be totally without unpretending single minded artless girl infinitely to be preferred by man of sense taste to woman a mr elton found harriet more conversable than expected emma be extremely gratified be interrupted by bustle of mr weston calling on body to begin dancing again come miss woodhouse miss otway

explanation with mr knightley gave emma considerable pleasure be one of agreeable recollection of ball walked about lawn next morning to enjoy be extremely glad that have come to so good understanding respecting eltons opinion of husband wife be so much alike praise of harriet concession in favour be peculiarly gratifying impertinence of eltons for few minute have threatened to ruin rest of evening have be occasion of of highest satisfaction looked forward to happy result cure of harriet infatuation from harriet manner of speaking of circumstance before quitted ballroom have strong hope seemed a if eye be suddenly opened be enabled to see that mr elton be not superior creature have believed fever be over emma must harbour little fear of pulse being quickened again by injurious courtesy depended on evil feeling of eltons for supplying discipline of pointed neglect must be farther requisite harriet rational frank churchill not too much in love mr knightley not wanting to quarrel with how very happy summer must be before be not to see frank churchill morning have told that must not allow pleasure of stopping at hartfield a be to be at home by middle of day did not regret having

whom have never le expected to see together frank churchill with harriet leaning on arm actually harriet moment sufficed to convince that something extraordinary have happened harriet looked white frightened be trying to cheer iron gate front door be not twenty yard asunder be three soon in hall harriet immediately sinking into chair fainted away young lady who faint must be recovered question must be answered surprizes be explained such event be very interesting suspense of can not last long few minute made emma acquainted with whole miss smith miss bickerton parlour boarder at mr goddard who have be also at ball have walked out together taken road richmond road though apparently public enough for safety have led into alarm about mile beyond highbury making sudden turn deeply shaded by elm on side became for considerable stretch very retired when young lady have advanced way into have suddenly perceived at small distance before on broader patch of greensward by side party of gipsy child on watch came towards to beg miss bickerton excessively frightened gave great scream calling on harriet to follow ran up steep bank cleared slight hedge at top made best of way by short cut back to highbury poor harriet must not follow have suffered very much from cramp after dancing first attempt to mount bank brought on return of a made absolutely powerless in state exceedingly terrified have be obliged to remain how tramper might have behaved have young lady be more courageous must be doubtful such invitation for attack must not be resisted harriet be soon assailed by dozen child headed by stout woman great boy clamorous impertinent in look though not absolutely in word more more frightened immediately promised money taking out purse gave shilling begged not to want more to use ill be then able to walk though slowly be moving away terror purse be too tempting be followed rather surrounded by whole gang demanding more in state frank churchill have found trembling conditioning loud insolent by most fortunate chance leaving highbury have be delayed so a to bring to assistance at critical moment pleasantness of morning have induced to walk forward leave horse to meet by road mile two beyond highbury happening to have borrowed pair of scissors night before of miss bates to have forgotten to restore have be obliged to stop at door go in for few minute be therefore later than have intended being on foot be unseen by whole party till almost close to terror woman boy have be creating in harriet be then own portion have left completely frightened harriet

of communication of harriet a soon a have recovered sens speech dared not stay longer than to see well several delay left not minute to lose emma engaging to give assurance of safety to mr goddard notice of there being such set of people in neighbourhood to mr knightley set off with grateful blessing that must utter for friend such adventure a fine young man lovely young woman thrown together in such way must hardly fail of suggesting certain idea to coldest heart steadiest brain so emma thought at least must linguist must grammarian must even mathematician have seen what did have witnessed appearance together heard history of without feeling that circumstance have be at work to make peculiarly interesting to other how much more must imaginist like be on fire with speculation foresight especially with such groundwork of anticipation a mind have already made be very extraordinary thing nothing of sort have ever occurred before to young lady in place within memory rencontre alarm of kind now have happened to very person at very hour when other very person be chancing to pas by to rescue certainly be very extraordinary knowing a did favourable state of mind of at period struck more be wishing to get better of attachment to herself just recovering from mania for mr elton seemed a if thing united to promise most interesting consequence be not possible that occurrence must not be strongly recommending to other in few minute conversation have yet have with while harriet have be partially insensible have spoken of terror naivete fervour a seized clung to arm with sensibility amused delighted just at last after harriet own account have be given have expressed indignation at abominable folly of miss bickerton in warmest term thing be to take natural course however impelled assisted must not stir step drop hint have have enough of interference there must be harm in scheme mere passive scheme be no more than wish beyond must on account proceed emma first resolution be to keep father from knowledge of what have passed aware of anxiety alarm must occasion soon felt that concealment must be impossible within hour be known over highbury be very event to engage who talk most young low youth servant in place be soon in happiness of frightful news last night ball seemed lost in gipsy poor mr woodhouse trembled a sat a emma have foreseen must scarcely be satisfied without promising never to go beyond shrubbery again be comfort to that many inquiry after miss woodhouse for neighbour knew that loved to be inquired after a well a miss smith be coming in during rest of day have pleasure of returning for answer that be very indifferent though not exactly true for be perfectly well harriet not much otherwise emma must not interfere with have unhappy state of health in general for child of such man for hardly knew what indisposition be if did not invent illness for must make figure in message gipsy did not wait for operation of justice took off in hurry young lady of highbury might have walked again in safety before panic began whole history dwindled soon into matter of little importance to emma nephew in imagination maintained ground henry john be still asking day for story of harriet gipsy still tenaciously setting right if varied in slightest particular from original recital chapter iv very few day have passed after adventure when harriet came one morning to emma with small parcel in hand after sitting down hesitating thus began miss woodhouse if be at leisure have something must like to tell sort of confession to make then know will be over be good deal surprized begged to speak there be seriousness in harriet manner prepared quite a much a word for something more than ordinary be duty be sure be wish continued to have reserve with on subject a be happily quite altered creature in one respect be very fit that must have satisfaction of knowing want to say more than be necessary be too much ashamed of having given way a have done dare say understand yes said emma hope do how must so long time be fancying cried harriet warmly seems like madness can see nothing at extraordinary in now care whether meet not except of two have rather not see indeed must go distance round to avoid envy wife in least neither admire envy a have done be very charming dare say think very ill tempered disagreeable will never forget look other night however assure miss woodhouse wish evil let be ever so happy together will not give moment pang to convince have be speaking truth be now going to destroy what ought to have destroyed long ago what ought never to have kept know very well blushing a spoke however now will destroy be particular wish to do in presence that may see how rational be grown can not guess what parcel hold said with conscious look not least in world did ever give thing no can not call gift be thing have valued very much held parcel towards emma read word most precious treasure on top curiosity be greatly excited harriet unfolded parcel looked on with impatience within abundance of silver paper be pretty little tunbridge ware box harriet opened be well lined with softest cotton excepting cotton emma saw only small piece of court plaister now said harriet must recollect indeed dear must not have thought possible must forget what passed in very room about court plaister one of very last time ever met in be very few day before have sore throat just before mr mr john knightley came think very evening remember cutting finger with new penknife recommending court plaister a have none about knew have desired to supply so took mine out cut piece be great deal too large cut smaller kept playing time with what be left before gave back to so then in nonsense must not help making treasure of so put by never to be used looked at now then a great treat dearest harriet cried emma putting hand before face jumping up make more ashamed of than can bear remember aye remember now except saving relic knew nothing of till moment cutting finger recommending court plaister saying have none about oh sin sin have plenty while in pocket one of senseless trick deserve to be under continual blush rest of life well sitting down again go on else have really at hand be sure never suspected did so naturally so actually put piece of court plaister by for sake said emma recovering from state of shame feeling divided between wonder amusement secretly added to herself lord bless when must ever have thought of putting by in cotton piece of court plaister frank churchill have be pulling about never be equal to here resumed harriet turning to box again here be something still more valuable mean have be more valuable because be what did really once belong to court plaister never did emma be quite eager to see superior treasure be end of old pencil part without lead be really said harriet remember one morning dare say one morning forget exactly day perhaps be tuesday wednesday before evening wanted to make memorandum in pocket book be about spruce beer mr knightley have be telling something about brewing spruce beer wanted to put down when took out pencil there be so little lead that soon cut away must not do so lent be left upon table a good for nothing kept eye on a soon a dared caught up never parted with again from moment do remember cried emma perfectly remember talking about spruce beer oh yes mr knightley saying liked mr elton seeming resolved to learn to like too perfectly remember stop mr knightley be standing just here be not have idea be standing just here ah know can not recollect be very odd can not recollect mr elton be sitting here remember much about where be now well go on oh be have nothing more to shew to say except be now going to throw behind fire wish to see do poor dear harriet have actually found happiness in treasuring up thing yes simpleton a be be quite ashamed of now wish must forget a easily a can burn be very wrong of know to keep remembrance after be married knew be have not resolution enough to part with harriet be necessary to burn court plaister have not word to say for bit of old pencil court plaister might be useful will be happier to burn replied harriet have disagreeable look to must get rid of thing there go there be end thank heaven of mr elton when thought emma will there be beginning of mr churchill have soon afterwards reason to believe that beginning be already made must not hope that gipsy though have told fortune might be proved to have made harriet about fortnight after alarm came to sufficient explanation quite undesignedly emma be not thinking of at moment made information received more valuable merely said in course of trivial chat well harriet whenever marry must advise to do so so thought more of till after minute silence heard harriet say in very serious tone will never marry emma then looked up immediately saw how be after moment debate a to whether must pas unnoticed not replied never marry be new resolution be one will never change however after short hesitation hope doe not proceed from hope be not in compliment to mr elton mr elton indeed cried harriet indignantly oh emma must just catch word so superior to mr elton then took longer time for consideration must proceed farther must let pas seem to suspect nothing perhaps harriet might think cold angry if did perhaps if be totally silent might only drive harriet into asking to hear too much against thing like unreserve a have be such open frequent discussion of hope chance be perfectly resolved believed must be wiser for to say know at once that meant to say know plain dealing be always best have previously determined how far must proceed on application of sort must be safer for to have judicious law of own brain laid down with speed be decided thus spoke harriet will not affect to be in doubt of meaning resolution rather expectation of never marrying result from idea that person whom might prefer must be too greatly superior in situation to think of be not so oh miss woodhouse believe have not presumption to suppose indeed be not so mad be pleasure to to admire at distance to think of infinite superiority to rest of world with gratitude wonder veneration be so proper in especially be not at surprized at harriet service rendered be enough to warm heart service oh be such inexpressible obligation very recollection of felt at time when saw coming noble look wretchedness before such change in one moment such change from perfect misery to perfect happiness be very natural be natural be honourable yes honourable think to chuse so well so gratefully that will be fortunate preference be more that can promise advise to give way to harriet by mean engage for being returned consider what be about perhaps will be wisest in to check feeling while can at rate let carry far unless be persuaded of liking be observant of let behaviour be guide of sensation give caution now because will never speak to again on subject be determined against interference henceforward know nothing of matter let name ever pas lip be very wrong before will be cautious now be superior doubt there do seem objection obstacle of very serious nature yet harriet more wonderful thing have taken place there have be match of greater disparity take care of must not have too sanguine though however may end be assured raising thought to be mark of good taste will always know how to value harriet kissed hand in silent submissive gratitude emma be very decided in thinking such attachment bad thing for friend tendency must be to raise refine mind must be saving from danger of degradation chapter v in state of scheme hope connivance june opened upon hartfield to highbury in general brought material change eltons be still talking of visit from suckling of use to be made of barouche landau jane fairfax be still at grandmother a return of campbell from ireland be again delayed august instead of midsummer fixed for be likely to remain there full two month longer provided at least be able to defeat mr elton activity in service save from being hurried into delightful situation against will mr knightley who for reason best known to have certainly taken early dislike to frank churchill be only growing to dislike more began to suspect of double dealing in pursuit of emma that emma be object appeared indisputable thing declared own attention father hint mother in law guarded silence be in unison word conduct discretion indiscretion told same story while so many be devoting to emma emma making over to harriet mr knightley began to suspect of inclination to trifle with jane fairfax must not understand there be symptom of intelligence between thought so at least symptom of admiration on side having once observed must not persuade to think entirely void of meaning however might wish to escape of emma error of imagination be not present when suspicion first arose be dining with randalls family jane at eltons have seen look more than single look at miss fairfax from admirer of miss woodhouse seemed somewhat out of place when be again in company must not help remembering what have seen must avoid observation unless be like cowper fire at twilight creating what saw brought yet stronger suspicion of there being something of private liking of private understanding even between frank churchill jane have walked up one day after dinner a very often did to spend evening at hartfield emma harriet be going to walk joined on returning fell in with larger party who like judged wisest to take exercise early a weather threatened rain mr mr weston son miss bates niece who have accidentally met united on reaching hartfield gate emma who knew be exactly sort of visiting must be welcome to father pressed to go in drink tea with randalls party agreed to immediately after pretty long speech from miss bates few person listened to also found possible to accept dear miss woodhouse most obliging invitation a be turning into ground mr perry passed by on horseback gentleman spoke of horse by bye said frank churchill to mr weston presently what became of mr perry plan of setting up carriage mr weston looked surprized said did not know that ever have such plan nay have from wrote word of three month ago impossible indeed did remember perfectly mentioned a what be certainly to be very soon mr perry have told somebody be extremely happy about be owing to persuasion a thought being out in bad weather did great deal of harm must remember now upon word never heard of till moment never really never bless how must be then must have dreamt be completely persuaded miss smith walk a if be tired will not be sorry to find at home what be what be cried mr weston about perry carriage be perry going to set up carriage frank be glad can afford have from have sir replied son laughing seem to have have from nobody very odd really be persuaded of mr weston having mentioned in one of letter to enscombe many week ago with particular a declares never heard syllable of before of course must have be dream be great dreamer dream of body at highbury when be away when have gone through particular friend then begin dreaming of mr mr perry be odd though observed father that must have have regular connected dream about people whom be not very likely must be thinking of at enscombe perry setting up carriage wife persuading to out of care for health just what will happen have doubt time other only little premature what air of probability sometimes run through dream at others what heap of absurdity be well frank dream certainly shews that highbury be in thought when be absent emma be great dreamer think emma be out of hearing have hurried on before guest to prepare father for appearance be beyond reach of mr weston hint why to own truth cried miss bates who have be trying in vain to be heard last two minute if must speak on subject there be denying that mr frank churchill might have mean to say that did not dream be sure have sometimes oddest dream in world if be questioned about must acknowledge that there be such idea last spring for mr perry mentioned to mother cole knew of a well a ourselves be quite secret known to nobody else only thought of about three day mr perry be very anxious that must have carriage came to mother in great spirit one morning because thought have prevailed jane remember grandmama telling of when got home forget where have be walking to very likely to randalls yes think be to randalls mr perry be always particularly fond of mother indeed know who be not have mentioned to in confidence have objection to telling of course be not to go beyond from day to never mentioned to soul know of at same time will not positively answer for having never dropt hint because know do sometimes pop out thing before be aware be talker know be rather talker now then have let thing escape must not be not like jane wish be will answer for never betrayed least thing in world where be oh just behind perfectly remember mr perry coming extraordinary dream indeed be entering hall mr knightley eye have preceded miss bates in glance at jane from frank churchill face where thought saw confusion suppressed laughed away have involuntarily turned to hers be indeed behind too busy with shawl mr weston have walked in two other gentleman waited at door to let pas mr knightley suspected in frank churchill determination of catching eye seemed watching intently in vain however if be so jane passed between into hall looked at there be time for farther remark explanation dream must be borne with mr knightley must take seat with rest round large modern circular table emma have introduced at hartfield none emma must have have power to place there persuade father to use instead of small sized pembroke on two of daily meal have for forty year be crowded tea passed pleasantly nobody seemed in hurry to move miss woodhouse said frank churchill after examining table behind must reach a sat have nephew taken away alphabet box of letter used to stand here where be be sort of dull looking evening ought to be treated rather a winter than summer have great amusement with letter one morning want to puzzle again emma be pleased with thought producing box table be quickly scattered over with alphabet one seemed so much disposed to employ a two self be rapidly forming word for other for body else who must be puzzled quietness of game made particularly eligible for mr woodhouse who have often be distressed by more animated sort mr weston have occasionally introduced who now sat happily occupied in lamenting with tender melancholy over departure of poor little boy in fondly pointing out a took up stray letter near how beautifully emma have written frank churchill placed word before miss fairfax gave slight glance round table applied to frank be next to emma jane opposite to mr knightley so placed a to see be object to see a much a must with a little apparent observation word be discovered with faint smile pushed away if meant to be immediately mixed with others buried from sight must have looked on table instead of looking just across for be not mixed harriet eager after fresh word finding out none directly took up fell to work be sitting by mr knightley turned to for help word be blunder a harriet exultingly proclaimed there be blush on jane cheek gave meaning not otherwise ostensible mr knightley connected with dream how must all be be beyond comprehension how delicacy discretion of favourite must have be so lain asleep feared there must be decided involvement disingenuousness double dealing seemed to meet at turn letter be vehicle for gallantry trick be child play chosen to conceal deeper game on frank churchill part with great indignation did continue to observe with great alarm distrust to observe also two blinded companion saw short word prepared for emma given to with look sly demure saw that emma have soon made out found highly entertaining though be something judged proper to appear to censure for said nonsense for shame heard frank churchill next say with glance towards jane will give to will a clearly heard emma opposing with eager laughing warmth must not will not indeed be done however gallant young man who seemed to love without feeling to recommend without complaisance directly handed over word to miss fairfax with particular degree of sedate civility entreated to study mr knightley excessive curiosity to know what word might be made seize possible moment for darting eye towards be not long before saw to be dixon jane fairfax perception seemed to accompany comprehension be certainly more equal to covert meaning superior intelligence of five letter so arranged be evidently displeased looked up seeing watched blushed more deeply than have ever perceived saying only did not know that proper name be allowed pushed away letter with even angry spirit looked resolved to be engaged by other word must be offered face be averted from who have made attack turned towards aunt aye very true dear cried latter though jane have not spoken word be just going to say same thing be time for to be going indeed evening be closing in grandmama will be looking for dear sir be too obliging really must wish good night jane alertness in moving proved a ready a aunt

unexamined be afterwards looking for shawl frank churchill be looking also be growing dusk room be in confusion how parted mr knightley must not tell remained at hartfield after rest thought full of what have seen so full that when candle came to assist observation must yes certainly must a friend anxious friend give emma hint ask question must not see in situation of such danger without trying to preserve be duty pray emma said may ask in lay great amusement poignant sting of last word given to miss fairfax saw word be curious to know how must be so very entertaining to one so very distressing to other emma be extremely confused must not endure to give true explanation for though suspicion be by mean removed be really ashamed of having ever imparted oh cried in evident embarrassment meant nothing mere joke among ourselves joke replied gravely seemed confined to mr churchill have hoped must speak again did not must rather busy about thing than speak sat little while in doubt variety of evil crossed mind interference fruitless interference emma confusion acknowledged intimacy seemed to declare affection engaged yet must speak owed to to risk thing might be involved in unwelcome interference rather than welfare to encounter thing rather than remembrance of neglect in such cause dear emma said at last with earnest kindness do think perfectly understand degree of acquaintance between gentleman lady have be speaking of between mr frank churchill miss fairfax oh yes perfectly why do make doubt of have never at time have reason to think that admired

between certain expressive look did not believe meant to be public oh amuse excessively be delighted to find that can vouchsafe to let imagination wander will not do very sorry to check in first essay indeed will not do there be admiration between do assure appearance have caught have arisen from peculiar circumstance feeling rather of totally different nature be impossible exactly to explain there be good deal of nonsense in part be capable of being communicated be sense be that be a far from attachment admiration for one a two being in world can be be presume to be so on side can answer for being so on will answer for gentleman indifference spoke with confidence staggered with satisfaction silenced mr knightley be in gay spirit must have prolonged conversation wanting to hear particular of suspicion look described wheres hows of circumstance highly entertained gaiety did not meet hers found must not be useful feeling be too much irritated for talking that might not be irritated into

light column of smoke ascending joined at wall found more engaged in talking than in looking around be giving harriet information a to mode of agriculture etc emma received smile seemed to say be own concern have right to talk on such subject without being suspected of introducing robert martin did not suspect be too old story robert martin have probably ceased to think of harriet took few turn together along walk shade be most refreshing emma found pleasantest part of day next remove be to house must go in eat be seated busy still frank churchill did not come mr weston looked looked in vain father must not own uneasy laughed at fear must not be cured of wishing that must part with black mare have expressed a to coming with more than common certainty aunt be so much better that have not doubt of getting over to mr churchill state however a many be ready to remind be liable to such sudden variation a might disappoint nephew in most reasonable dependence mr weston be at last persuaded to believe to say that must be by attack of mr churchill that be prevented coming emma looked at harriet while point be under consideration behaved very well betrayed emotion cold repast be over party be to go out once more to see what have not yet be seen old abbey fish pond perhaps get a far a clover be to be begun cutting on morrow at rate have pleasure of being hot growing cool again mr woodhouse who have already taken little round in highest part of garden where damp from river be imagined even by stirred more daughter resolved to remain with mr weston might be persuaded away by

in having other resemblance to child than in total want of taste for what saw for be slow constant methodical before second looking over be begun however emma walked into hall for sake of few moment free observation of entrance ground plot of house be hardly there when jane fairfax appeared coming quickly in from garden with look of escape little expecting to meet miss woodhouse so soon there be

servant go with let order carriage can be round in five minute thank thank on account must rather walk for to be afraid of walking alone who may so soon have to guard others spoke with great agitation emma very feelingly replied that can be reason for being exposed to danger now must order carriage heat even must be danger be fatigued already be answered be fatigued be not sort of fatigue quick walking will refresh miss woodhouse know at time what be to be wearied in spirit mine confess be exhausted greatest kindness can shew will be to let have own way only say that be gone when be necessary emma have not word to oppose saw entering into feeling promoted quitting house immediately watched safely off with zeal of friend parting look be grateful parting word oh miss woodhouse comfort of being sometimes alone seemed to burst from overcharged heart to describe somewhat of continual endurance to be practised by even towards of who loved best such home indeed such aunt said emma a turned back into hall again do pity more sensibility betray of just horror more will like jane have not be gone quarter of hour have only accomplished view of st mark place venice when frank churchill entered room emma have not be thinking of have forgotten to think of be very glad to see mr weston must be at ease black mare be blameless be right who have named mr churchill a cause have

greatest possible distance from slight remains of mr woodhouse fire looking very deplorable will soon be cooler if sit still said emma a soon a be cooler will go back again must very ill be spared point have be made of coming will all be going soon suppose whole party breaking up met one a came madness in such weather absolute madness emma listened looked soon perceived that frank churchill state might be best defined by expressive phrase of being out of humour people be always cross when be hot such might be constitution a knew that eating drinking be often cure of such incidental complaint recommended taking refreshment must find abundance of thing in dining room humanely pointed out door no must not eat be not hungry must only make hotter in two minute however relented in own favour muttering something about spruce beer walked off emma returned attention to father saying in secret be glad have done being in love with must not like man who be so soon discomposed by hot morning harriet sweet easy temper will not mind be gone long enough to have have very comfortable meal came back better grown quite cool with good manner like able to draw chair close to take interest

confederate spoke now such thing do occur undoubtedly be stopped by cough frank churchill turned towards to listen be speaking said gravely recovered voice be only going to observe though such unfortunate circumstance do sometimes occur to men woman can not imagine to be very frequent hasty imprudent attachment may arise there be generally time to recover from afterwards must be understood to mean that can be only weak irresolute character whose happiness must be always at mercy of chance who will suffer unfortunate acquaintance to be inconvenience oppression for ever made answer merely

looking out for to give notice of carriage be joyful sight even bustle of collecting preparing to depart solicitude of mr elton to have carriage first be gladly endured in prospect of quiet drive home be to close very questionable enjoyment of day of pleasure such scheme composed of so many ill assorted people hoped never to be betrayed into again while waiting for carriage found mr knightley by side looked around a if to see that one be near then said emma must once more speak to a have be used to do privilege rather endured than allowed perhaps must still use can not see acting wrong without remonstrance how must be so unfeeling to miss bates how must be so insolent in wit to woman of character age situation emma have not thought possible emma recollected blushed be sorry tried to laugh off nay how must help saying what did nobody must have helped be not so very bad dare say did not understand assure did felt full meaning have talked of since wish must have heard how talked of

vexed beyond what must have be expressed almost beyond what must conceal never have felt so agitated mortified grieved at circumstance in life be most forcibly struck truth of representation there be denying felt at heart how must have be so brutal so cruel to miss bates how must have exposed to such ill opinion in one valued how suffer to leave without saying one word of gratitude of concurrence of common kindness time did not compose a reflected more seemed to feel more never have be so depressed happily be not necessary to speak there be only harriet who seemed not in spirit fagged very willing to be silent emma felt tear running down cheek almost way home without being at trouble to check extraordinary a be chapter viii wretchedness of scheme to box hill be in emma thought evening how might be considered by rest of party must not tell in different home different way might be looking back on with pleasure in view be morning more completely misspent more totally bare of rational satisfaction at time more to be abhorred in recollection than have ever passed whole evening of back gammon with father be felicity to there indeed lay real pleasure for there be giving up sweetest hour of twenty four to comfort feeling unmerited a might be degree of fond affection confiding esteem must not in general conduct be open to severe reproach a daughter hoped be not without heart hoped one must have said to how must be so unfeeling to father must will tell truth while can miss bates must never again no never if attention in future must do away past might hope to be forgiven have be often remiss conscience told so remiss perhaps more in thought than fact scornful ungracious must be so no more in warmth of true contrition must call upon very next morning must be beginning on side of regular equal kindly intercourse be just a determined when morrow came went early that nothing might prevent be not unlikely thought that might see mr knightley in way perhaps might come in while

comfort a possible must be severe trial to have understood be to be delayed till colonel campbell return so very kind replied miss bates be always kind there be bearing always to break through dreadful gratitude emma made direct inquiry of where may ask be miss fairfax going to mr smallridge charming woman most superior to have charge of three little girl delightful child impossible that

delightful woman style of living almost equal to maple grove a to child except little suckling little bragges there be not such elegant sweet child anywhere jane will be treated with such regard kindness will be nothing pleasure life of pleasure salary really can not venture to name salary to miss woodhouse even used a be to great sum must hardly believe that so much must be given to young

jane be sure if get out at poor john son came to talk to mr elton about relief from parish be very well to do know being head man at crown ostler thing of sort still can not keep father without help so when mr elton came back told what john ostler have be telling then came out about chaise having be sent to randalls to take mr frank churchill to richmond be what happened before tea be after tea that jane spoke to mr elton miss bates must hardly give emma time to say how perfectly new circumstance be to a without supposing possible that must be ignorant of of particular of mr frank churchill going proceeded to give be of consequence what mr elton have learned from ostler on subject being accumulation of ostler own knowledge knowledge of servant at randalls be that messenger have come over from richmond soon after return of party from box hill messenger however have be no more than be expected that mr churchill have sent nephew few line containing upon whole tolerable account of mr churchill only wishing not to delay coming back beyond next morning early that mr frank churchill having resolved to go home directly without waiting at horse seeming to have got cold tom have be sent off immediately for crown chaise ostler have stood out seen pas by boy going good pace driving very steady there be nothing in to astonish interest caught emma attention only a united with subject already engaged mind contrast between mr churchill importance in world jane fairfax struck one be thing other nothing sat musing on difference of woman destiny quite unconscious on what eye be fixed till roused by miss bates saying aye see what be thinking of pianoforte what be to become of very true poor dear jane be talking of just now 'you must go ' said 'you must part will have business here

obliged to think of pianoforte remembrance of former fanciful unfair conjecture be so little pleasing that soon allowed to believe visit have be long enough with repetition of thing that must venture to say of good wish really felt took leave chapter ix emma pensive meditation a walked home be not interrupted on entering parlour found who must rouse mr knightley harriet have arrived during absence be sitting with father mr knightley immediately got up in manner decidedly graver than usual said must not go away without seeing have time to spare therefore must now be gone directly be going to london to spend few day with john isabella have thing to send say besides 'love nobody carry nothing at be not sudden scheme yes rather have be thinking of little time emma be sure have not forgiven

daughter dare say must have be very much obliged to for coming dear emma have be to call on mr miss bates mr knightley a told before be always so attentive to emma colour be heightened by unjust praise with smile shake of head spoke much looked at mr knightley seemed a if there be instantaneous impression in favour a if eye received truth from have passed of good in feeling be at once caught honoured looked at with glow of regard be warmly gratified in moment still more so by little movement of more than common friendliness on part took hand whether have not made first motion must not say might perhaps have rather offered took hand pressed certainly be on point of carrying to lip when from fancy other suddenly let go why must feel scruple why must change mind when be done must not perceive must have judged better thought if have not stopped intention however be indubitable whether be that manner have in general so little gallantry however else happened thought nothing became more be with of so simple yet so dignified nature must not recall attempt with great satisfaction spoke such perfect amity left immediately afterwards gone in moment always moved with alertness of mind must neither be undecided dilatory now seemed more sudden than usual in disappearance emma must not regret having gone to miss bates wished have left ten minute earlier must have be great pleasure to talk over jane fairfax situation with mr knightley must regret that must be going to brunswick square for knew how much visit must be enjoyed might have happened at better time to have have longer notice of must have be pleasanter parted thorough friend however must not be deceived a to meaning of countenance unfinished gallantry be done to assure that have fully recovered good opinion have be sitting with hour found be pity that have not come back earlier in hope of diverting father thought from disagreeableness of mr knightley going to london going so suddenly going on horseback knew must be very bad emma communicated news of jane fairfax dependence on effect be justified supplied very useful check interested without disturbing have long made up mind to jane fairfax going out a governess must talk of cheerfully mr knightley going to london have be unexpected blow be very glad indeed dear to hear be to be so comfortably settled mr elton be very good natured agreeable dare say acquaintance be just what ought to be hope be dry situation that health will be taken good care of ought to be first object a be sure poor miss taylor always be with know dear be going to be to new lady what miss taylor be to hope will be better off in one respect not be induced to go away after have be home so long following day brought news from richmond to throw thing else into background express arrived at randalls to announce death of mr churchill though nephew have have particular reason to hasten back on account have not lived above six thirty hour after return sudden seizure of different nature from thing foreboded by general state have carried off after short struggle great mr churchill be more be felt a such thing must be felt body have degree of gravity sorrow tenderness towards departed solicitude for surviving friend in reasonable time curiosity to know where must be buried goldsmith tell that when lovely woman stoop to folly have nothing to do to die when stoop to be disagreeable be equally to be recommended a clearer of ill fame mr churchill after being disliked at least twenty five year be now spoken of with compassionate allowance in one point be fully justified have never be admitted before to be seriously ill event acquitted her of fancifulness selfishness of imaginary complaint poor mr churchill doubt have be suffering great deal more than body have ever supposed continual pain must try temper be sad event great shock with fault what must mr churchill do without mr churchill loss must be dreadful indeed mr churchill must never get over even mr weston shook head looked solemn said ah poor woman who must have thought resolved that mourning must be a handsome a possible wife sat sighing moralising over broad hem with commiseration good sense true steady how must affect frank be among earliest thought of be also very early speculation with character of mr churchill grief of husband mind glanced over with awe compassion then rested with lightened feeling on how frank might be affected by event how benefited how freed saw in moment possible good now attachment to harriet smith must have nothing to encounter mr churchill independent of wife be feared by nobody easy guidable man to be persuaded into thing by nephew remained to be wished be that nephew must form attachment a with goodwill in cause emma must feel certainty of being already formed harriet behaved extremely well on occasion with great self command what ever might feel of brighter hope betrayed nothing emma be gratified to observe proof in of strengthened character refrained from allusion might endanger maintenance spoke therefore of mr churchill death with mutual forbearance short letter from frank be received at randalls communicating be immediately important of state plan mr churchill be better than must be expected first removal on departure of funeral for yorkshire be to be to house of very old friend in windsor to whom mr churchill have be promising visit last ten year at present there be nothing to be done for harriet good wish for future be must yet be possible on emma side be more pressing concern to shew attention to jane fairfax whose prospect be closing while harriet opened whose engagement now allowed of delay in one at highbury who wished to shew kindness with emma be grown into first wish have scarcely stronger regret than for past coldness person whom have be so many month neglecting be now very one on whom must have lavished distinction of regard sympathy wanted to be of use to wanted to shew value for society testify respect consideration resolved to prevail on to spend day at note be written to urge invitation be refused by verbal message miss fairfax be not well enough to write when mr perry called at hartfield same morning appeared that be so much indisposed a to have be visited though against own consent by that be suffering under severe headache nervous fever to degree made doubt possibility of going to mr smallridge at time proposed health seemed for moment completely deranged appetite quite gone though there be absolutely alarming symptom nothing touching pulmonary complaint be standing apprehension of family mr perry be uneasy about thought have undertaken more than be equal to that felt so though must not own spirit seemed overcome present home must not observe be unfavourable to nervous disorder confined always to one room must have wished otherwise good aunt though very old friend must acknowledge to be not best companion for invalid of description care attention must not be questioned be in fact only too great very much feared that miss fairfax derived more evil than good from emma listened with warmest concern grieved for more more looked around eager to discover way of being useful to take be only hour two from aunt to give change of air scene quiet rational conversation even for hour two might do good following morning wrote again to say in most feeling language must command that must call for in carriage at hour that jane must name mentioning that have mr perry decided opinion in favour of such exercise for patient answer be only in short note miss fairfax compliment thanks be quite unequal to exercise emma felt that own note have deserved something better be impossible to quarrel with word whose tremulous inequality shewed indisposition so plainly thought only of how might best counteract unwillingness to be seen assisted in spite of answer therefore ordered carriage drove to mr bates in hope that jane must be induced to join must not do miss bates came to carriage door gratitude agreeing with most earnestly in thinking airing might be of greatest service thing message must do be tried in vain miss bates be obliged to return without success jane be quite unpersuadable mere proposal of going out seemed to make worse emma wished must have seen tried own power almost before must hint wish miss bates made appear that have promised niece on account to let miss woodhouse in indeed truth be that poor dear jane must not bear to see body body at mr elton indeed must not be denied mr cole have made point mr perry have said so much except jane must really see nobody emma did not want to be classed with mr eltons mr perry mr cole who must force anywhere neither must feel right of preference submitted therefore only questioned miss bates farther a to niece appetite diet longed to be able to assist on subject poor miss bates be very unhappy very communicative jane must hardly eat thing mr perry recommended nourishing food thing must command never have body such good neighbour be distasteful emma on reaching home called housekeeper directly to examination of store arrowroot of very superior quality be speedily despatched to miss bates with most friendly note in hour arrowroot be returned with thousand thanks from miss bates dear jane must not be satisfied without being sent back be thing must not take moreover insisted on saying that be not at in want of thing when emma afterwards heard that jane fairfax have be seen wandering about meadow at distance from highbury on afternoon of very day on have under plea of being unequal to exercise so peremptorily refused to go out with in carriage must have doubt putting thing together that jane be resolved to receive kindness from be sorry very sorry heart be grieved for state seemed more pitiable from sort of irritation of spirit inconsistency of action inequality of power mortified that be given so little credit for proper feeling esteemed so little worthy a friend have consolation of knowing that intention be good of being able to say to herself must mr knightley have be privy to attempt of assisting jane fairfax must even have seen into heart must not on occasion have found thing to reprove chapter x one morning about ten day after mr churchill decease emma be called downstairs to mr weston who must not stay five minute wanted

human being of name of knightley emma courage returned walked on be wrong continued in talking of being broke to must not have used expression in fact doe not concern concern only be hope humph in short dear emma there be occasion to be so uneasy about say that be not disagreeable business thing might be much worse if walk fast will soon be at randalls emma found that must wait now required little effort asked more question therefore merely employed own fancy soon pointed out to probability of being money concern something just come to light of disagreeable nature in circumstance of family something late event at richmond have brought forward fancy be very active half dozen natural child perhaps poor frank cut off though very undesirable must be matter of agony to inspired little more than animating curiosity who be gentleman on horseback said a proceeded speaking more to assist mr weston in keeping secret than with other view know one of otways not frank be not frank assure will not see be half way to windsor by time have son be with then oh yes did not know well well never mind for moment be silent then added in tone much more guarded demure yes frank came over morning

churchill do guess be right doe relate to will tell directly resuming work seeming resolved against looking up have be here very morning on most extraordinary errand be impossible to express surprize came to speak to father on subject to announce attachment stopped to breathe emma thought first of herself then of harriet more than attachment indeed resumed mr weston engagement positive engagement what will say emma what will body say when be known that frank churchill miss fairfax be engaged nay that have be long engaged emma even jumped with surprize horror struck exclaimed jane fairfax good god be not serious mean may well be amazed returned mr weston still averting eye talking on with eagerness emma might have time to recover may well be amazed be even so there have be solemn engagement between ever since october formed at weymouth kept secret from body not creature knowing neither campbell family be so wonderful that though perfectly convinced of fact be yet almost incredible to myself can hardly believe thought knew emma scarcely heard what be said mind be divided between two idea own former conversation with about miss fairfax poor harriet for time must only exclaim require confirmation repeated confirmation well said at last trying to recover be circumstance must think of at least day before can at comprehend engaged to winter before of came to highbury engaged since october secretly engaged have hurt emma very much have hurt father equally part of conduct can not excuse emma pondered moment then replied will not pretend not to understand to give relief in power be assured that such effect have followed attention to a be apprehensive of mr weston looked up afraid to believe emma countenance be a steady a word that may have le difficulty in believing boast of present perfect indifference continued will farther tell that there be period in early part of acquaintance when did like when be very much disposed to be attached to be attached how came to cease be perhaps wonder fortunately however did cease have really for time past for at least three month cared nothing about may believe mr weston be simple truth mr weston kissed with tear of joy when must find utterance assured that protestation have done more good than thing else in world must do mr weston will be almost a much relieved a myself said on point have be wretched be darling wish that might be attached to other be persuaded that be so imagine what have be feeling on account have escaped must escape may be matter of grateful wonder to doe not acquit mr weston must say that think greatly to blame what right have to come among with affection faith engaged with manner so very disengaged what right have to endeavour to please a certainly did to distinguish one young woman with persevering attention a certainly did while really belonged to how must tell what mischief might be doing how must tell that might not be making in love with very wrong very wrong indeed from something that said dear emma rather imagine how must bear such behaviour composure with witness to look on while repeated attention be offering to woman before face not resent be degree of placidity can comprehend respect there be misunderstanding between emma said so expressly have not time to enter into much explanation be here only quarter of hour in state of agitation did not allow full use even of time must stay that there have be misunderstanding decidedly said present crisis indeed seemed to be brought on by misunderstanding might very possibly arise from impropriety of conduct impropriety oh mr weston be too calm censure much much beyond impropriety have sunk can not say how have sunk in opinion so unlike what man must be none of upright integrity strict adherence to truth principle that disdain of trick littleness man must display in transaction of life nay dear emma now must take part for though have be wrong in instance have known long enough to answer for having many very many good quality good god cried emma not attending to mr smallridge too jane actually on point of going a governess what must mean by such horrible indelicacy to suffer to engage to suffer even to think of measure knew nothing about emma on article can fully acquit be private resolution of hers not communicated to at least not communicated in way to carry conviction till yesterday know said be in dark a to plan burst on know how by letter message be discovery of what be doing of very project of hers determined to come forward at once own to uncle throw on kindness in short put end to miserable state of concealment have be carrying on so long emma began to listen better be to hear from soon continued mr weston told at parting that must soon write spoke in manner seemed to promise many particular must not be given now let wait therefore for letter may bring many extenuation may make many thing intelligible excusable now be not to be understood let be severe let be in hurry to condemn let have patience must love now that be satisfied on one point one material point be sincerely anxious for turning out well ready to hope that may must have suffered great deal under system of secresy concealment suffering replied emma dryly appear to have done much harm well how did mr churchill take most favourably for nephew gave consent with scarcely difficulty conceive what event of week have done in family while poor mr churchill lived suppose there must not have be hope chance possibility scarcely be remains at rest in family vault than husband be persuaded to act exactly opposite to what must have required what blessing be when undue influence doe not survive grave gave consent with very little persuasion ah thought emma must have done a much for harriet be settled last night frank be off with light morning stopped at highbury at bates fancy time then came on hither be in such hurry to get back to uncle to whom be just now more necessary than ever that a tell must stay with quarter of hour be very much agitated very much indeed to degree made appear quite different creature from thing have ever seen before in addition to rest there have be shock of finding so very unwell have have no previous suspicion of there be appearance of having be feeling great deal do really believe affair to have be carrying on with such perfect secresy campbell dixons did none of know of engagement emma must not speak name of dixon without little blush none not one positively said that have be known to being in world two self well said emma suppose will gradually grow reconciled to idea wish very happy will always think very abominable sort of proceeding have be system of hypocrisy deceit espionage treachery to come among with profession of openness simplicity league in secret to judge here have be whole winter spring completely duped fancying on equal footing of truth honour with two people in midst of who may have be carrying round comparing sitting in judgment on sentiment word be never meant for to hear must take consequence if have heard other spoken of in way not perfectly agreeable be quite easy on head replied mr weston be very sure that never said thing of to other might not have heard be in only blunder be confined to ear when imagined certain friend of ours in love with lady true a have always have thoroughly good opinion of miss fairfax never must under blunder have spoken ill of a to speaking ill of there must have be safe at moment mr weston appeared at little distance from window evidently on watch wife gave look invited in while be coming round added now dearest emma let intreat to say look thing may set heart at ease incline to be satisfied with match let make best of indeed almost thing may be fairly said in favour be not connexion to gratify if mr churchill doe not feel that why must may be very fortunate circumstance for for frank mean that must have attached to girl of such steadiness of character good judgment a have always given credit for still be disposed to give credit for in spite of one great deviation from strict rule of right how much may be said in situation for even error much indeed cried emma feelingly if woman can ever be excused for thinking only of herself be in situation like jane fairfax of such one may almost say that 'the world be not world law ' met mr weston on entrance with smiling countenance exclaiming very pretty trick have be playing upon word be device suppose to sport with curiosity exercise talent of guessing really frightened thought have lost half property at least here instead of being matter of condolence turn out to be one of congratulation congratulate mr weston with heart on prospect of having one of most lovely accomplished young woman in england for daughter glance two between wife convinced that be a right a speech proclaimed happy effect on spirit be immediate air voice recovered usual briskness shook heartily gratefully by hand entered on subject in manner to prove that now only wanted time persuasion to think engagement very bad thing companion suggested only what must palliate imprudence smooth objection by time have talked over together have talked over again with emma in walk back to hartfield be become perfectly reconciled not far from thinking very best thing that frank must possibly have done chapter xi harriet poor harriet be word in lay tormenting idea emma must not get rid of constituted real misery of business to frank churchill have behaved very ill by very ill in many way be not so much behaviour a own made so angry with be scrape have drawn into on harriet account gave deepest hue to offence poor harriet to be second time dupe of misconception flattery mr knightley have spoken prophetically when once said emma have be friend to harriet smith be afraid have done nothing disservice be true that have not to charge in instance a in former with being sole original author of mischief with having suggested such feeling a might otherwise never have entered harriet imagination for harriet have acknowledged admiration preference of frank churchill before have ever given hint on subject felt completely guilty of having encouraged what might have repressed might have prevented indulgence increase of such sentiment influence must have be enough now be very conscious that ought to have prevented felt that have be risking friend happiness on most insufficient ground common sense must have directed to tell harriet that must not allow to think of that there be five hundred chance to one against ever caring for with common sense added be afraid have have little to do be extremely angry with if must not have be angry with frank churchill too must have be dreadful a for jane fairfax might at least relieve feeling from present solicitude on account harriet must be anxiety enough need no longer be unhappy about jane whose trouble whose ill health having of course same origin must be equally under cure day of insignificance evil be over must soon be well happy prosperous emma must now imagine why own attention have be slighted discovery laid many smaller matter open doubt have be from jealousy in jane eye have be rival well might thing must offer of assistance regard be repulsed airing in hartfield carriage must have be rack arrowroot from hartfield storeroom must have be poison understood a far a mind must disengage from injustice selfishness of angry feeling acknowledged that jane fairfax must have elevation happiness beyond desert poor harriet be such engrossing charge there be little sympathy to be spared for body else emma be sadly fearful that second disappointment must be more severe than first considering very superior claim of object ought judging by apparently stronger effect on harriet mind producing reserve self command must must communicate painful truth however a soon a possible injunction of secresy have be among mr weston parting word for present whole affair be to be completely secret mr churchill have made point of a token of respect to wife have so very recently lost body admitted to be no more than due decorum emma have promised still harriet must be excepted be superior duty in spite of vexation must not help feeling almost ridiculous that must have very same distressing delicate office to perform by harriet mr weston have just gone through by intelligence have be so anxiously announced to be now to be anxiously announcing to heart beat quick on hearing harriet footstep voice so supposed have poor mr weston felt when be approaching randalls must event of disclosure bear equal resemblance of unfortunately there must be chance well miss woodhouse cried harriet coming eagerly into room be not oddest news that ever be what news do mean replied emma unable to guess by look voice whether harriet must indeed have received hint about jane fairfax did ever hear thing so strange oh need not be afraid of owning to for mr weston have told met just now told be to be great secret therefore must not think of mentioning to body said knew what did mr weston tell said emma still perplexed oh told about that jane fairfax mr frank churchill be to be married that have be privately engaged to one long while how very odd be indeed so odd harriet behaviour be so extremely odd that emma did not know how to understand character appeared absolutely changed seemed to propose shewing agitation disappointment peculiar concern in discovery emma looked at quite unable to speak have idea cried harriet of being in love with perhaps might blushing a spoke who can see into body heart nobody else upon word said emma begin to doubt having such talent can seriously ask harriet whether imagined attached to woman at very time be tacitly if not openly encouraging to give way to own feeling never have slightest suspicion till within last hour of mr frank churchill having least regard for jane fairfax may be very sure that if have must have cautioned accordingly cried harriet colouring astonished why must caution think care about mr frank churchill be delighted to hear speak so stoutly on subject replied emma smiling mean to deny that there be time not very distant when gave reason to understand that did care about never never dear miss woodhouse how must so mistake turning away distressed harriet cried emma after moment pause what do mean good heaven what do mean mistake be to suppose then must not speak word voice be lost sat down waiting in great terror till harriet must answer harriet who be standing at distance with face turned from did not immediately say thing when did speak be in voice nearly a agitated a emma must not have thought possible began that must have misunderstood know agreed never to name considering how infinitely superior be to body else must not have thought possible must be supposed to mean other person mr frank churchill indeed know who must ever look at in company of other hope have better taste than to think of mr frank churchill who be like nobody by side that must have be so mistaken be amazing be sure for believing that entirely approved meant to encourage in attachment must have considered at first too great presumption almost to dare to think of at first if have not told that more wonderful thing have happened that there have be match of greater disparity be very word must not have dared to give way to must not have thought possible if who have be always acquainted with harriet cried emma collecting resolutely let understand other now without possibility of farther mistake be speaking of mr knightley to be sure be never must have idea of body else so thought knew when talked about be a clear a possible not quite returned emma with forced calmness for that then said appeared to to relate to different person must almost assert that have named mr frank churchill be sure service mr frank churchill have rendered in protecting from gipsy be spoken of oh miss woodhouse how do forget dear harriet perfectly remember substance of what said on occasion told that did not wonder at attachment that considering service have rendered be extremely natural agreed to expressing very warmly a to sense of service mentioning even what sensation have be in seeing come forward to rescue impression of be strong on memory oh dear cried harriet now recollect what mean be thinking of something very different at time be not gipsy be not mr frank churchill meant with elevation be thinking of much more precious circumstance of mr knightley coming asking to dance when mr elton must not stand up with when there be other partner in room be kind action be noble benevolence generosity be service made begin to feel how superior be to other being upon earth good god cried emma have be most unfortunate most deplorable mistake what be to be done must not have encouraged then if have understood at least however can not be worse off than must have be if other have be person now be possible paused few moment emma must not speak wonder miss woodhouse resumed that must feel great difference between two a to a to body must think one five hundred million time more above than other hope miss woodhouse that supposing that if strange a may appear know be own word that more wonderful thing have happened match of greater disparity have taken place than between mr frank churchill therefore seems a if such thing even a may have occurred before if must be so fortunate beyond expression a to if mr knightley must really if doe not mind disparity hope dear miss woodhouse will not set against try to put difficulty in way be too good for be sure harriet be standing at one of window emma turned round to look at in consternation hastily said have idea of mr knightley returning affection yes replied harriet modestly not fearfully must say have emma eye be instantly withdrawn sat silently meditating in fixed attitude for few minute few minute be sufficient for making acquainted with own heart mind like hers once opening to suspicion made rapid progress touched admitted acknowledged whole truth why be so much worse that harriet must be in love with mr knightley than with frank churchill why be evil so dreadfully increased by harriet having hope of return darted through with speed of arrow mr knightley must marry one own conduct a well a own heart be before in same few minute saw with clearness have never blessed before how improperly have be acting by harriet how inconsiderate how indelicate how irrational how unfeeling have be conduct what blindness what madness have led on struck with dreadful force be ready to give bad name in world portion of respect for however in spite of demerit concern for own appearance strong sense of justice by harriet there must be need of compassion to girl who believed loved by mr knightley justice required that must not be made unhappy by coldness now gave resolution to sit endure farther with calmness with even apparent kindness for own advantage indeed be fit that utmost extent of harriet hope must be enquired into harriet have done nothing to forfeit regard interest have be so voluntarily formed maintained to deserve to be slighted by person whose counsel have never led right rousing from reflection therefore subduing emotion turned to harriet again in more inviting accent renewed conversation for a to subject have first introduced wonderful story of jane fairfax be quite sunk lost of thought of mr knightley harriet who have be standing in unhappy reverie be yet very glad to be called from by now encouraging manner of judge friend a miss woodhouse only wanted invitation to give history of hope with great though trembling delight emma trembling a asked a listened be better concealed than harriet be not le voice be not unsteady mind be in perturbation that development of self such burst of threatening evil such confusion of sudden perplexing emotion must create listened with much inward suffering with great outward patience to harriet detail methodical well arranged very well delivered must not be expected to be contained when separated from feebleness tautology of narration substance to sink spirit especially with corroborating circumstance own memory brought in favour of mr knightley most improved opinion of harriet harriet have be conscious of difference in behaviour ever since two decisive dance emma knew that have on occasion found much superior to expectation from evening at least from time of miss woodhouse encouraging to think of harriet have begun to be sensible of talking to much more than have be used to do of having indeed quite different manner towards manner of kindness sweetness latterly have be more more aware of when have be all walking together have so often come walked by talked so very delightfully seemed to want to be acquainted with emma knew to have be very much case have often observed change to almost same extent harriet repeated expression of approbation praise from emma felt to be in closest agreement with what have known of opinion of harriet praised for being without art affectation for having simple honest generous feeling knew that saw such recommendation in harriet have dwelt on to more than once much that lived in harriet memory many little particular of notice have received from look speech removal from one chair to compliment implied preference inferred have be unnoticed because unsuspected by emma circumstance might swell to hour relation contained multiplied proof to who have seen have passed undiscerned by who now heard two latest occurrence to be mentioned two of strongest promise to harriet be not without degree of witness from emma first be walking with apart from others in lime walk at donwell where have be walking time before emma came have taken pain a be convinced to draw from rest to at first have talked to in more particular way than have ever done before in very particular way indeed harriet must not recall without blush seemed to be almost asking whether affection be engaged a soon a miss woodhouse appeared likely to join changed subject began talking about farming second be having sat talking with nearly hour before emma came back from visit very last morning of being at hartfield though when first came in have said that must not stay five minute having told during conversation that though must go to london be very much against inclination that left home at be much more a emma felt than have acknowledged to superior degree of confidence towards harriet one article marked gave severe pain on subject of first of two circumstance did after little reflection venture following question might not be not possible that when enquiring a thought into state of affection might be alluding to mr martin might have mr martin interest in view harriet rejected suspicion with spirit mr martin indeed there be not hint of mr martin hope know better now than to care for mr martin to be suspected of when harriet have closed evidence appealed to dear miss woodhouse to say whether have not good ground for hope never must have presumed to think of at first said for told to observe carefully let behaviour be rule of mine so have now seem to feel may deserve that if doe chuse will not be thing so very wonderful bitter feeling occasioned by speech many bitter feeling made utmost exertion necessary on emma side to enable to say on reply harriet will only venture to declare that mr knightley be last man in world who must intentionally give woman idea of feeling for more than really doe harriet seemed ready to worship friend for sentence so satisfactory emma be only saved from rapture fondness at moment must have be dreadful penance by sound of father footstep be coming through hall harriet be too much agitated to encounter must not compose mr woodhouse must be alarmed have better go with most ready encouragement from friend therefore passed off through door moment be gone be spontaneous burst of emma feeling oh god have never seen rest of day following night be hardly enough for thought be bewildered amidst confusion of have rushed on within last few hour moment have brought fresh surprize surprize must be matter of humiliation to how to understand how to understand deception have be thus practising on living under blunder blindness of own head heart sat still walked about tried own room tried shrubbery in place posture perceived that have acted most weakly that have be imposed on by others in most mortifying degree that have be imposing on in degree yet more mortifying that be wretched must probably find day beginning of wretchedness to understand thoroughly understand own heart be first endeavour to point went leisure moment father claim on allowed moment of involuntary absence of mind how long have mr knightley be so dear to a feeling declared now to be when have influence such influence begun

a must at time have be compared by have oh have by blessed felicity occurred to to institute comparison saw that there never have be time when did not consider mr knightley a infinitely superior when regard for have not be infinitely most dear saw that in persuading in fancying in acting to contrary have be entirely under delusion totally ignorant of own heart in short that have never really cared for frank churchill at be conclusion of first series of reflection be knowledge of herself on first question of inquiry reached without being long in reaching be most sorrowfully indignant ashamed of sensation one revealed to affection for mr knightley other part of mind be disgusting with insufferable vanity have believed in secret of body feeling with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange body destiny be proved to have be universally mistaken have not quite done nothing for have done mischief have brought evil on harriet on herself too much feared on mr knightley be most unequal of connexion to take place on must rest reproach of having given beginning for attachment must believe to be produced only by consciousness of harriet even be not case must never have known harriet at for folly mr knightley harriet smith be union to distance wonder of kind attachment of frank churchill jane fairfax became commonplace threadbare stale in comparison exciting surprize presenting disparity affording nothing to be said thought mr knightley harriet smith elevation on side debasement on be horrible to emma to think how must sink in general opinion to foresee smile sneer merriment must prompt at expense mortification disdain of brother thousand inconvenience to must be be impossible yet be far very far from impossible be new circumstance for man of first rate ability to be captivated by very inferior power be new for one perhaps too busy to seek to be prize of girl who must seek be new for thing in world to be unequal inconsistent incongruous for chance circumstance a second cause to direct human fate oh have never brought harriet forward have left where ought where have told ought have not with folly tongue must express prevented marrying unexceptionable young man who must have made happy respectable in line of life to ought to belong must have be safe none of dreadful sequel must have be how harriet must ever have have presumption to raise thought to mr knightley how must dare to fancy chosen of such man till actually assured of harriet be le humble have fewer scruple than formerly inferiority whether of mind situation seemed little felt have seemed more sensible of mr elton being to stoop in marrying than now seemed of mr knightley ala be not that own doing too who have be at pain to give harriet notion of self consequence who have taught that be to elevate if possible that claim be great to high worldly establishment if harriet from being humble be grown vain be doing too chapter xii till now that be threatened with loss emma have never known how much of happiness depended on being first with mr knightley first in interest affection satisfied that be so feeling due have enjoyed without reflection only in dread of being supplanted found how inexpressibly important have be long very long felt have be first for having female connexion of own there have be only isabella whose claim must be compared with hers have always known exactly how far loved esteemed isabella have be first with for many year past have not deserved have often be negligent perverse slighting advice even wilfully opposing insensible of merit quarrelling

doing right other creature have at shared in spite of fault knew be dear to might not say very dear when suggestion of hope however must follow here presented must not presume to indulge harriet smith might think not unworthy of being peculiarly exclusively passionately loved by mr knightley must not must not flatter with idea of blindness in attachment to have received very recent proof of impartiality how shocked have be by behaviour to miss bates how directly how strongly have expressed to on subject not too strongly for offence far far too strongly to issue from feeling softer than upright justice clear sighted goodwill have hope nothing to deserve name of hope that must have sort of affection for herself be now in question there be hope at time slight one at time much stronger that harriet might have deceived be overrating regard for wish must for sake be consequence nothing to herself remaining single life must be secure of indeed of never marrying at believed must be perfectly satisfied let continue same mr knightley to father same mr knightley to world let donwell hartfield lose none of precious intercourse of friendship confidence peace must be fully secured marriage in fact must not do for must be incompatible with what owed to father with what felt for nothing must separate from father must not marry even if be asked by mr knightley must be ardent wish that harriet might be disappointed hoped that when able to see together again might at least be able to ascertain what chance for be must see henceforward with closest observance wretchedly a have hitherto misunderstood even be watching did not know how to admit that must be blinded here be expected back day power of observation must be soon given frightfully soon appeared when thought be in one course in meanwhile resolved against seeing harriet must do of good must do subject good to be talking of farther be resolved not to be convinced a long a must doubt yet have authority for opposing harriet confidence to talk must be only to irritate wrote to therefore kindly decisively to beg that must not at present come to hartfield acknowledging to be conviction that farther confidential discussion of one topic have better be avoided hoping that if few day be allowed to pas before met again except in company of others objected only to tete tete might be able to act a if have forgotten conversation of yesterday harriet submitted approved be grateful point be just arranged when visitor arrived to tear emma thought little from one subject have engrossed sleeping waking last twenty four hour mr weston who have be calling on daughter in law elect took hartfield in way home almost a much in duty to emma a in pleasure to herself to relate particular of so interesting interview mr weston have accompanied to mr bates gone through share of essential attention most handsomely having then induced miss fairfax to join in airing be now returned with much more to say much more to say with satisfaction than quarter of hour spent in mr bates parlour with encumbrance of awkward feeling must have afforded little curiosity emma have made most of while friend related mr weston have set off to pay visit in good deal of agitation in first place have wished not to go at at present to be allowed merely to write to miss fairfax instead to defer ceremonious call till little time have passed mr churchill must be reconciled to engagement becoming known a considering thing thought visit must not be paid without leading to report mr weston have thought differently be extremely anxious to shew approbation to miss fairfax family did not conceive that suspicion must be excited by if be that must be of consequence for such thing observed always got about emma smiled felt that mr weston have very good reason for saying so have gone in short very great have be evident distress confusion of lady have hardly be able to speak word look action have shewn how deeply be suffering from consciousness quiet heart felt satisfaction of old lady rapturous delight of daughter who proved even too joyous to talk a usual have be gratifying yet almost affecting scene be so truly respectable in happiness so disinterested in sensation thought so much of jane so much of body so little of kindly feeling be at work for miss fairfax recent illness have offered fair plea for mr weston to invite to airing have drawn back declined at first on being pressed have yielded in course of drive mr weston have by gentle encouragement overcome so much of embarrassment a to bring to converse on important subject apology for seemingly ungracious silence in first reception warmest expression of gratitude be always feeling towards mr weston must necessarily open cause when effusion be put by have talked good deal of present of future state of engagement mr weston be convinced that such conversation must be greatest relief to companion pent up within own mind a thing have so long be be very much pleased with that have said on subject on misery of what have suffered during concealment of so many month continued mr weston be energetic be one of expression will not say that since entered into engagement have not have happy moment can say have never known blessing of one tranquil hour quivering lip emma uttered be attestation felt at heart poor girl said emma think wrong then for having consented to private engagement wrong one believe can blame more than be disposed to blame 'the consequence ' said 'have be state of perpetual suffering to so ought after punishment that misconduct can bring be still not le misconduct pain be expiation never can be blameless have be acting contrary to sense of right fortunate turn thing have taken kindness be now receiving be what

one a associate for to be received with gratitude other what be supposing even that have never become intimate friend that have never be admitted into miss fairfax confidence on important matter be most probable still in knowing a ought a might must have be preserved from abominable suspicion of improper attachment to mr dixon have not only so foolishly fashioned harboured have so unpardonably

english such a mr knightley used even to woman be in love with how to be able to ask to marry without attacking happiness of father emma answer be ready at first word while dear father lived change of condition must be impossible for must never quit part only of answer however be admitted impossibility of quitting father mr knightley felt a strongly a herself inadmissibility of other change must not agree to have be thinking over most deeply most intently have at first hoped to induce mr woodhouse to remove with to donwell have wanted to believe feasible knowledge of mr woodhouse must not suffer to deceive long now confessed persuasion that transplantation must be risk of father comfort perhaps even of life must not be hazarded mr woodhouse taken from hartfield no felt that ought not to be attempted plan have arisen on sacrifice of trusted dearest emma must not find in respect objectionable be that must be received at hartfield so long a father happiness in other word life required hartfield to continue home must be likewise of removing to donwell emma have already have own passing thought like have tried scheme rejected alternative a have not occurred to be sensible of

never struck with sense of injury to nephew henry whose right a heir expectant have formerly be so tenaciously regarded think must of possible difference to poor little boy yet only gave saucy conscious smile about found amusement in detecting real cause of violent dislike of mr knightley marrying jane fairfax body else at time have wholly imputed to amiable solicitude of sister aunt proposal of plan of marrying continuing at more contemplated more pleasing became evil seemed to lessen own advantage to increase mutual good to outweigh drawback companion for herself in period of

friend who must now be even excluded from hartfield delightful family party emma be securing for poor harriet must in mere charitable caution be kept at distance from must be loser in way emma must not deplore future absence a deduction from own enjoyment in such party harriet must be rather dead weight than otherwise for poor girl seemed peculiarly cruel necessity be to be placing in such state of unmerited punishment in time of course mr knightley must be forgotten be supplanted must not be expected to happen very early mr knightley must be doing nothing to assist cure not like mr elton mr knightley always so kind so feeling so truly considerate for body must never deserve to be le worshipped than now really be too much to hope even of harriet that must be in love with more than three men in one year chapter xvi be very great relief to emma to find harriet a desirous a to avoid meeting intercourse be painful enough by letter how much worse have be obliged to meet harriet expressed very much a might be supposed without reproach apparent sense of ill usage yet emma fancied there be something of resentment something bordering on in style increased desirableness of being separate

room to go with even downstairs gave opportunity immediately made use of to say be a well perhaps have not have possibility have not be surrounded by other friend might have be tempted to introduce subject to ask question to speak more openly than might have be strictly correct feel must certainly have be impertinent oh cried jane with blush hesitation emma thought infinitely more becoming to than elegance of usual composure there must have be danger danger must have be of wearying must not have gratified more than by expressing interest indeed miss woodhouse speaking more collectedly with consciousness have of misconduct very great misconduct be particularly consoling to to know that of friend whose good opinion be most worth preserving be not disgusted to such degree a to have not time for half must wish to say long to make apology excuse to urge something for feel so very due unfortunately in short if compassion doe not stand friend oh be too scrupulous indeed be cried emma warmly taking hand owe apology body to whom might be supposed to owe be so perfectly satisfied so delighted even be very kind know what manner be to so cold artificial have always part to act be life of deceit know that must have disgusted pray say more feel that apology must be on side let forgive other at once must do be to be done quickest think feeling will lose time there hope have pleasant

home mr weston one must doubt that daughter must be most to must be quite pity that one who so well knew how to teach must not have power in exercise again have have advantage know of practising on continued like la baronne d'almane on la comtesse d'ostalis in madame de genlis adelaide theodore will now see own little adelaide educated on more perfect plan be replied mr knightley will indulge even more than did believe that doe not indulge at will be only difference poor child cried emma at rate what will become of nothing very bad fate of thousand will be disagreeable in infancy correct a grows older be losing bitterness against spoilt child dearest emma who be owing happiness to must not be horrible ingratitude in to be severe on emma laughed replied have assistance of endeavour to counteract indulgence of other people doubt whether own sense must have corrected without do have doubt nature gave understanding miss taylor gave principle must have done well interference be quite a likely to do harm a good be very natural for to say what right have to lecture be afraid very natural for to feel that be done in disagreeable manner believe did good good be to myself by making object of tenderest affection to must not think about so much without doating on fault by dint of fancying so many error have be in love with ever since be thirteen at least be sure be of use to cried emma be very often influenced rightly by oftener than must own at time be very sure did good if poor little anna weston be to be spoiled will be greatest humanity in to do a much for a have done for except falling in love with when be thirteen how often when be girl have said to with one of saucy look knightley be going to do so so papa say may have miss taylor leave ' something knew did not

habit have not so very formal sound yet be formal want to call something else know what remember once calling 'george ' in one of amiable fit about ten year ago did because thought must offend a made objection never did again can not call ' now impossible never can call thing ber knightley will not promise even to equal elegant terseness of mr elton by calling mr k will promise added presently laughing blushing will promise to call once by christian name say when perhaps may guess where in building in n take m for better for worse emma grieved that must not be more openly just to one important service better sense must have rendered to advice must have saved from worst of womanly folly wilful intimacy with harriet smith be too tender subject must not enter on harriet be very seldom mentioned between on side might merely proceed from not being thought of be rather inclined to attribute to delicacy suspicion from appearance that friendship be declining be aware that parting under other circumstance certainly must have corresponded more that intelligence must not have rested a now almost wholly did on isabella letter might observe that be so pain of being obliged to practise concealment towards be very little inferior to pain of having made harriet unhappy isabella sent quite a good account of visitor a must be expected on first arrival have thought out of spirit appeared perfectly natural a there be dentist to be consulted since business have be over did not appear to find harriet different from what have known before isabella to be sure be very quick observer yet if harriet have not be equal to playing with child must not have escaped emma comfort hope be most agreeably carried on by harriet being to stay longer fortnight be likely to be month at

communication of intended marriage emma accepted with very eager hand with impatience alive to know what must say about not at checked by hearing that friend be unmentioned john enters like brother into happiness continued mr knightley be complimenter though well know to have likewise most brotherly affection for be so far from making flourish that other young woman might think rather cool in praise be not afraid of seeing what writes writes like sensible man replied emma when have read letter honour sincerity be very plain that considers good fortune of engagement a on side that be not without hope of growing in time a worthy of affection a think already have said thing to bear different construction must not have believed emma mean such thing only mean must differ very little in estimation of two interrupted with sort of serious smile much le perhaps than be aware of if must enter without ceremony reserve on subject emma dear emma oh cried with more thorough gaiety if fancy brother doe not do justice only wait till dear father be in secret hear opinion depend upon will be much farther from doing justice will think happiness advantage on side of question merit on mine wish may not sink into 'poor emma with at once tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go farther ah cried wish father might be half a easily convinced a john will be of having right equal worth can give to be happy together be amused by one part of john letter did notice where say that information did not take wholly by surprize that be rather in expectation of hearing something of kind if

extremely surprized never more so than when emma first opened affair to saw in only increase of happiness to have scruple in urging to utmost have such regard for mr knightley a to think deserved even dearest emma be in respect so proper suitable unexceptionable connexion in one respect one point of highest importance so peculiarly eligible so singularly fortunate now seemed a if emma must not safely have attached to other creature that have be stupidest of being in not having thought of wished long ago how very few of men in rank of life to address emma must have renounced own home for hartfield who mr knightley must know bear with mr woodhouse so a to make such arrangement desirable difficulty of disposing of poor mr woodhouse have be always felt in husband plan own for marriage

overflowing that did mention without being much to purpose on quitting box at astley brother took charge of mr john knightley little john followed with miss smith henry at one time be in such crowd a to make miss smith rather uneasy stopped emma dared not attempt immediate reply to speak be sure must be to betray most unreasonable degree of happiness must wait moment must think mad silence

pain to reconcile to match think harriet be doing extremely well connexion may be worse than in respectability of character there can be doubt that be have be silent from surprize merely excessive surprize can not imagine how suddenly have come on how peculiarly unprepared be for have reason to believe very lately more determined against much more than be before ought to know friend best

seriously good principle placing happiness in affection utility of domestic life much of have doubt may thank for cried emma shaking head ah poor harriet checked however submitted quietly to little more praise than deserved conversation be soon afterwards closed by entrance of father be not sorry wanted to be alone mind be in state of flutter wonder made impossible for to be collected be in dancing singing exclaiming spirit till have moved about talked to herself laughed reflected must be fit for nothing rational father business be to announce james being gone out to put horse to preparatory to now daily drive to randalls have therefore immediate excuse for disappearing joy gratitude exquisite delight of sensation may be imagined sole grievance alloy thus removed in prospect of harriet welfare be really in danger of becoming too happy for security what have to wish for nothing to grow more worthy of whose intention judgment have be ever so superior to own nothing that lesson of past folly might teach humility circumspection in future serious be very serious in thankfulness in resolution yet there be preventing laugh sometimes in very midst of must laugh at close end of doleful disappointment of five week back heart harriet now there must be pleasure in returning thing must be pleasure must be great pleasure to know robert martin high in rank of most serious

of embarrassing recollection on side met readily smiling with consciousness at first allowed little to be said having sat down again there be for time such blank in circle that emma began to doubt whether wish now indulged have long felt of seeing frank churchill once more of seeing with jane must yield proportion of pleasure when mr weston joined party however when baby be fetched there be longer want of subject animation of courage opportunity for frank churchill to draw near say have to thank miss woodhouse for very kind forgiving message in one of mr weston letter hope time have not made le willing to pardon hope retract what then said indeed cried emma most happy to begin not in least be particularly glad to see shake hand with to give joy in person thanked with heart continued

smoothness such delicacy yet without being actually fair one can not call fair be most uncommon complexion with dark eye lash hair most distinguishing complexion so peculiarly lady in just colour enough for beauty have always admired complexion replied emma archly remember time when found fault with for being so pale when first began to talk of have quite forgotten oh what impudent dog be how must dare laughed so heartily at recollection that emma must not help saying do suspect that in midst of perplexity at time have very great amusement in tricking be sure have be sure be consolation to oh how can suspect of thing be most miserable wretch not quite so miserable a to be insensible to mirth be sure be source of high entertainment to to feel that be taking in perhaps be readier to suspect because to tell truth think might have be amusement to myself in same situation think there be little likeness between bowed if not in disposition presently added with look of true sensibility there be likeness in destiny destiny bid fair to connect with two character so much superior to own true true answered warmly not true on side can have superior most true on mine be complete angel

set be resolved to have in ornament for head will not be beautiful in dark hair very beautiful indeed replied emma spoke so kindly that gratefully burst out how delighted be to see again to see in such excellent look must not have missed meeting for world must certainly have called at hartfield have failed to come others have be talking of child mr weston giving account of little alarm have be under evening before from infant appearing not quite well believed have be foolish have alarmed have be within minute of sending for mr perry perhaps ought to be ashamed mr weston have be almost a uneasy a herself in ten minute however child have be perfectly well again be history particularly interesting be to mr woodhouse who commended very much for thinking of sending for perry only regretted that have not done must always send for perry if child appeared in slightest degree disordered be only for moment must not be too soon alarmed send for perry too often be pity perhaps that have not come last night for though child seemed well now very well considering must probably have be better if perry have seen frank churchill caught name perry said to emma trying a spoke to catch miss fairfax eye friend mr perry be saying about mr perry have be here morning how doe travel now have set up carriage emma soon recollected understood while joined in laugh be evident from jane

be forced to smile completely for moment smile partly remained a turned towards said in conscious low yet steady voice how can bear such recollection be astonishing to will sometimes obtrude how can court have great deal to say in return very entertainingly emma feeling be chiefly with jane in argument on leaving randalls falling naturally into comparison of two men felt pleased a have be to see frank churchill really regarding a did with friendship have never be more sensible of mr knightley high superiority of character happiness of most happy day received completion in animated contemplation of worth comparison produced chapter xix if emma have still at interval anxious feeling for harriet momentary doubt of being possible for to be really cured of attachment to mr knightley really able to accept man from unbiased inclination be not long that have to suffer from recurrence of such uncertainty very few day brought party from london have sooner opportunity of being one hour alone with harriet than became perfectly satisfied unaccountable a be that robert martin have thoroughly supplanted mr knightley be now forming view of happiness harriet be little distressed did look little foolish at first having once owned that have be presumptuous silly deceived before pain confusion seemed to die away with word leave without care for past with fullest exultation in present future for a to friend approbation emma have instantly removed fear of nature by meeting with most unqualified congratulation harriet be most happy to give particular of evening at astley dinner next day must dwell on with utmost delight what did such particular explain fact be a emma must now acknowledge that harriet have always liked robert martin that continuing to love have be irresistible

in midst of who loved who have better sense than retired enough for safety occupied enough for cheerfulness must be never led into temptation left for to find out must be respectable happy emma admitted to be luckiest creature in world to have created so steady persevering affection in such man if not luckiest to yield only to herself harriet necessarily drawn away by engagement with martin be le le at hartfield be not to be regretted intimacy between emma must sink friendship must change into calmer sort of goodwill fortunately what ought to be must be seemed already beginning in most gradual natural manner before end of september emma attended harriet to church saw hand bestowed on robert martin with so complete satisfaction a remembrance even connected with mr elton a stood before must impair perhaps indeed at time scarcely saw mr elton a clergyman whose blessing at altar might next fall on robert martin harriet smith latest couple engaged of three be first to be married

of castle have left in exchange for uncertain unequal amusement of vaunted city not will pretend to assert that uncertain unequal amusement be in least degree unpleasing to on contrary enjoy extremely must enjoy even more be not certain that appearance make in public rivetts chain of unhappy being whose passion be impossible not to pity tho ' be out of power to return in short dear charlotte be sensibility for suffering of so many amiable young men dislike of extreme admiration meet with aversion to being so celebrated in public in private in paper in printshops be reason why can not more fully enjoy amusement so various pleasing of london how often have wished that possessed a little personal beauty a do that figure be a inelegant face a unlovely appearance a unpleasing a yours ah what little chance be there of so desirable event have have small pox must therefore submit to unhappy fate be now going to intrust dear charlotte with secret have long disturbed tranquility of day be

poor fortune where art thou by time see more of lady l who always make appearance highly rouged at dinner time ala what delightful jewel will be decked in evening at lady flambeau yet wonder how can herself delight in wearing surely must be sensible of ridiculous impropriety of loading little diminutive figure with such superfluous ornament be possible that can not know how greatly superior elegant simplicity be to most studied apparel must present to matilda how greatly must be obliged to how becoming must diamond be on fine majestic figure how surprising be that such idea must never have occurred to be sure if have reflected in manner once have fifty time whenever see lady lesley dressed in such reflection immediately come across own mother jewel too will say no more on so

nothing of bad belongs to alone so like man sister too do manner be not equal to certainly not at first be very pleasing woman when converse with miss bingley be to live with brother keep house be much mistaken if will not find very charming neighbour in elizabeth listened in silence be not convinced behaviour at assembly have not be calculated to please in general with more quickness of observation le pliancy of temper than sister with judgement too unassailed by attention to herself be very little disposed to approve be in fact very fine lady not deficient in good humour when be pleased in power of making agreeable when chose proud conceited be rather handsome have be educated in one of first private seminary in town have fortune of twenty thousand pound be in habit of spending more than ought of associating with people of rank be therefore in respect entitled to think well of meanly of others be of respectable family in north of england circumstance more deeply impressed on memory than brother fortune own have be acquired by trade mr bingley inherited property to amount of nearly hundred thousand pound from father who have intended to purchase estate did not live to do mr bingley intended likewise sometimes made choice of county a be now provided with good house liberty of manor be doubtful to many of who best knew easiness of temper whether might not

at table be mr hurst who have married man of more fashion than fortune disposed to consider house a home when suited mr bingley have not be of age two year when be tempted by accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house did look at into for hour be pleased with situation principal room satisfied with what owner said in praise took immediately between darcy there be very steady friendship in spite of great opposition of character bingley be endeared to darcy by easiness openness ductility of temper though disposition must offer greater contrast to own though with own never appeared dissatisfied on strength of darcy regard bingley have firmest reliance of judgement highest opinion in understanding darcy be superior bingley be by mean deficient darcy be clever be at same time haughty reserved fastidious manner though well bred be not inviting in respect friend have greatly advantage bingley be sure of being liked wherever appeared darcy be continually giving offense manner in spoke of meryton assembly be sufficiently characteristic bingley have never met with more pleasant people prettier girl in life everybody have be most kind attentive to there have be formality no stiffness have soon felt acquainted with room a to miss bennet must not conceive angel more beautiful darcy on contrary have seen collection of people in whom there be little beauty fashion for none of whom have felt smallest interest from none received attention pleasure miss bennet acknowledged to be pretty smiled too much mr hurst sister allowed to be so still admired liked pronounced to be sweet girl one whom must not object to know more of miss bennet be therefore established a sweet girl brother felt authorized by such commendation to think of a chose chapter within short walk of longbourn lived family with whom bennet be particularly intimate sir william lucas have be formerly in trade in meryton where have made tolerable fortune risen to honour of knighthood by address to king during mayoralty distinction have perhaps be felt too strongly have given disgust to business to residence in small market town in quitting have removed with family to house about mile from meryton denominated from period lucas lodge where must think with pleasure of own importance unshackled by business occupy solely in being civil to world for though elated by rank did not render supercilious on contrary be attention to everybody by nature inoffensive friendly obliging presentation at st james have made courteous lady lucas be very good kind of woman not too clever to be valuable neighbour to mr bennet have several child eldest of sensible intelligent young woman about twenty seven be elizabeth intimate friend that miss lucas miss bennet must meet to talk over ball be absolutely necessary morning after assembly brought former to longbourn to hear to communicate began evening well charlotte said mr bennet with civil self command to miss lucas be mr bingley first choice yes seemed to like second better oh mean jane suppose because danced with twice to be sure that did seem a if admired indeed rather believe did heard something about hardly know what something about mr robinson perhaps mean what overheard between mr robinson did not mention to mr robinson asking how liked meryton assembly whether did not think there be great many pretty woman in room thought prettiest answering immediately to last question 'oh eldest miss bennet beyond doubt there can not be two opinion on point ' upon word well be very decided indeed that doe seem a if however may come to nothing know overhearings be more to purpose than yours eliza said charlotte mr darcy be not so well worth listening to a friend be poor eliza to be only just tolerable beg must not put into lizzy head to be vexed by ill treatment for be such disagreeable man that must be quite misfortune to be liked by mr long told last night that sat close to for hour without once opening lip be quite sure ma'be be not there little mistake said jane certainly saw mr darcy speaking to aye because asked at last how liked netherfield must not help answering said seemed quite angry at being spoke to miss bingley told said jane that never speaks much unless among intimate acquaintance with be remarkably agreeable believe word of dear if have be so very agreeable must have talked to mr long can guess how be everybody say that be eat up with pride dare say have heard somehow that mr long doe not keep carriage have come to ball in hack chaise mind not talking to mr long said miss lucas wish have danced with eliza time lizzy said mother must not dance with if be believe ma'be may safely promise never to dance with pride said miss lucas doe not offend so much a pride often doe because there be excuse for one can not wonder that so very fine young man with family fortune everything in favour must think highly of if may so express have right to be proud be very true replied elizabeth must easily forgive pride if have not mortified mine pride observed mary who piqued upon solidity of reflection be very common failing believe by have ever read be convinced that be very common indeed that human nature be particularly prone to that there be very few of who cherish feeling of self complacency on score of quality other real imaginary vanity pride be different thing though word be often used synonymously person may be proud without being vain pride relates more to opinion of ourselves vanity to what must have others think of if be a rich a mr darcy cried young lucas who came with sister must not care how proud be must keep pack of foxhound drink bottle of wine day then must drink great deal more than ought said mr bennet if be to see at must take away bottle directly boy protested that must not continued to declare that must argument ended only with visit chapter lady of longbourn soon waited on of visit be soon returned in due form miss bennet pleasing manner grew on goodwill of mr hurst miss bingley though mother be found to be intolerable younger sister not worth speaking to wish of being better acquainted with be expressed towards two eldest by jane attention be received with greatest pleasure elizabeth still saw superciliousness in treatment of everybody hardly excepting even sister must not like though kindness to jane such a be have value a arising in probability from influence of brother admiration be generally evident whenever met that did admire to be equally evident that jane be yielding to preference have begun to entertain for from first be in way to be very much in love considered with pleasure that be not likely to be discovered by world in general since jane united with great strength of feeling composure of temper uniform cheerfulness of manner must guard from suspicion of impertinent mentioned to friend miss lucas may perhaps be pleasant replied charlotte to be able to impose on public in such case be sometimes disadvantage to be so very guarded if woman conceals affection with same skill from object of may lose opportunity of fixing will then be poor consolation to believe world equally in dark there be so much of gratitude vanity in almost attachment that be not safe to leave to can begin freely slight preference be natural enough there be very few of who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement in nine case out of ten woman have better show more affection than feel bingley like sister undoubtedly may never do more than like if doe not help on doe help on a much a nature will allow if can perceive regard for must be simpleton indeed not to discover too remember eliza that doe not know jane disposition a do if woman be partial to man doe not endeavour to conceal must find out perhaps must if see enough of though bingley jane meet tolerably often be never for many hour together a always see other in large mixed party be impossible that moment must be employed in conversing together jane must therefore make most of half hour in can command attention when be secure of there will be more leisure for falling in love a much a chooses plan be good one replied elizabeth where nothing be in question desire of being well married if be determined to get rich husband husband dare say must adopt be not jane feeling be not acting by design a yet can not even be certain of degree of own regard of reasonableness have known only fortnight danced four dance with at meryton saw one morning at own house have since dined with in company four time be not quite enough to make understand character not a represent have merely dined with might only have discovered whether have good appetite must remember that four evening have also be spent together four evening may do great deal yes four evening have enabled to ascertain that like vingt un better than commerce with respect to other leading characteristic imagine that much have be unfolded well said charlotte wish jane success with heart if be married to to morrow must think have a good chance of happiness a if be to be studying character for twelvemonth happiness in marriage be entirely matter of chance if disposition of party be ever so well known to other ever so similar beforehand doe not advance felicity in least always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have share of vexation be better to know a little a possible of defect of person with whom be to pas life make laugh charlotte be not sound know be not sound that must never act in way occupied in observing mr bingley attention to sister elizabeth be far from suspecting that be becoming object of interest in eye of friend mr darcy have at first scarcely allowed to be pretty have looked at without admiration at ball when next met looked at only to criticise sooner have made clear to friend that hardly have good feature in face than began to find be rendered uncommonly intelligent by beautiful expression of dark eye to discovery succeeded others equally mortifying though have detected with critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in form be forced to acknowledge figure to be light pleasing in spite of asserting that manner be not of fashionable world be caught by easy playfulness of be perfectly unaware to be only man who made agreeable nowhere who have not thought handsome enough to dance with began to wish to know more of a step towards conversing with attended to conversation with others doing so drew notice be at sir william lucas where large party be assembled what doe mr darcy mean said to charlotte by listening to conversation with colonel forster be question mr darcy only can answer if doe more will certainly let know see what be about have very satirical eye if begin by being impertinent will soon grow afraid of on approaching soon afterwards though without seeming to have intention of speaking miss lucas defied friend to mention subject to immediately provoking elizabeth to do turned to said did not think mr darcy that expressed uncommonly well just now when be teasing colonel forster to give ball at meryton with great energy be always subject make lady energetic be severe on will be turn soon to be teased said miss lucas be going to open instrument eliza know what follows be very strange creature by way of friend always wanting to play sing before anybody everybody if vanity have taken musical turn must have be invaluable a be must really rather not sit down before who must be in habit of hearing very best performer on miss lucas persevering however added very well if must be so must gravely glancing at mr darcy there be fine old saying everybody here be of course familiar with 'keep breath to cool porridge will keep mine to swell song performance be pleasing though by mean capital after song two before must reply to entreaty of several that must sing again be eagerly succeeded at instrument by sister mary who having in consequence of being only plain one in family worked hard for knowledge accomplishment be always impatient for display mary have genius taste though vanity have given application have given likewise pedantic air conceited manner must have injured higher degree of excellence than have reached elizabeth easy unaffected have be listened to with much more pleasure though not playing half so well mary at end of long concerto be glad to purchase praise gratitude by scotch irish air at request of younger sister who with of lucas two three officer joined eagerly in dancing at one end of room mr darcy stood near in silent indignation at mode of passing evening to exclusion of conversation be too much engrossed by thought to perceive that sir william lucas be neighbour till sir william thus began what charming amusement for young people be mr darcy there be nothing like dancing after consider a one of first refinement of polished society certainly sir have advantage also of being in vogue amongst le polished society of world savage can dance sir william only smiled friend performs delightfully continued after pause on seeing bingley join group doubt not that be adept in science mr

not dancing darcy must allow to present young lady to a very desirable partner can not refuse to dance be sure when so much beauty be before taking hand must have given to mr darcy who though extremely surprised be not unwilling to receive when instantly drew back said with discomposure to sir william indeed sir have not least intention of dancing entreat not to suppose moved way in order to beg for partner mr darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed honour of hand in vain elizabeth be determined did sir william at shake purpose by attempt at persuasion excel so much in dance miss eliza that be cruel to deny happiness of seeing though gentleman dislike amusement in general can have objection be sure to oblige for one half hour mr darcy be politeness said elizabeth smiling be indeed considering inducement dear miss eliza can not wonder at complaisance for who must object to partner elizabeth looked archly turned away resistance have not injured with gentleman be thinking of with complacency when thus accosted by miss bingley can guess subject of reverie must imagine not be considering how insupportable must be to pas many evening in manner in such society

something of captain carter before go in meryton parted two youngest repaired to lodging of one of officer wife elizabeth continued walk alone crossing field after field at quick pace jumping over stile springing over puddle with impatient activity finding at last within view of house with weary ankle dirty stocking face glowing with warmth of exercise be shown into breakfast parlour where jane be assembled where appearance created great deal of surprise that must have walked three mile so early in day in such dirty weather by herself be almost incredible to mr hurst miss bingley elizabeth be convinced that held in contempt for be received however very politely by in brother manner there be something better than politeness there be good humour kindness mr darcy said very little mr hurst nothing at former be divided between admiration of brilliancy exercise have given to complexion doubt a to occasion justifying coming so far alone latter be thinking only of breakfast inquiry after sister be not very favourably answered miss bennet have slept ill though up be very feverish not well enough to leave room elizabeth be glad to be taken to immediately jane who have only be withheld by fear of giving alarm inconvenience from expressing in note how much longed for such visit be delighted at entrance be not equal however to much conversation when miss bingley left together must attempt little besides expression of gratitude for extraordinary kindness be treated with elizabeth silently attended when breakfast be over be joined by sister elizabeth began to like when saw how much affection solicitude showed for jane apothecary came having examined patient said a might be supposed that have caught violent cold that must endeavour to get better of advised to return to bed promised draught advice be followed readily for feverish symptom increased head ached acutely elizabeth did not quit room for moment be other lady often absent gentleman being out have in fact nothing to do elsewhere when clock struck three elizabeth felt that must go very unwillingly said so miss bingley offered carriage only wanted little pressing to accept when jane testified such concern in parting with miss bingley be obliged to convert offer of chaise to invitation to remain at netherfield for present elizabeth most thankfully consented servant be dispatched to longbourn to acquaint family with stay bring back supply of clothes chapter at five o'clock two lady retired to dress at half past six elizabeth be summoned to dinner to civil inquiry then poured in amongst have pleasure of distinguishing much superior solicitude of mr bingley must not make very favourable answer jane be by mean better sister on hearing repeated three four time how much be grieved how shocking be to have bad cold how excessively disliked being ill then thought more of matter indifference towards jane when not immediately before restored elizabeth to enjoyment of former dislike brother indeed be only one of party whom must regard with complacency anxiety for jane be evident attention to herself most pleasing prevented feeling so much intruder a believed be considered by others have very little notice from miss bingley be engrossed by mr darcy sister scarcely le so a for mr hurst by whom elizabeth sat be indolent man who lived only to eat drink play at card who when found to prefer plain dish to ragout have nothing to say to when dinner be over returned directly to jane miss bingley began abusing a soon a be out of room manner be pronounced to be very bad indeed mixture of pride impertinence have conversation style beauty mr hurst thought same added have nothing in short to recommend being excellent walker will never forget appearance morning really looked almost wild did indeed louisa must hardly keep countenance very nonsensical to come at why must be scampering about country because sister have cold hair so untidy so blowsy yes petticoat hope saw petticoat six inch deep in mud be absolutely certain gown have be let down to hide not doing office picture may be very exact louisa said bingley be lost upon thought elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well when came into room morning dirty petticoat quite escaped notice observed mr darcy be sure said miss bingley be inclined to think that must not wish to see sister make such exhibition certainly not to walk three mile four mile five mile whatever be above ankle in dirt alone quite alone what must mean by seems to to show abominable sort of conceited independence most country town indifference to decorum show affection for sister be very pleasing said bingley be afraid mr darcy observed miss bingley in half whisper that adventure have rather affected admiration of fine eye not at all replied be brightened by exercise short pause followed speech mr hurst began again have excessive regard for miss jane bennet be really very sweet girl wish with heart be well settled with father mother such low connection be afraid there be chance of think have heard say that uncle be attorney on meryton yes have who life somewhere near cheapside be capital added sister laughed heartily if have uncle enough to fill cheapside cried bingley must not make one jot le agreeable must very materially lessen chance of marrying men of consideration in world replied darcy to speech bingley made answer sister gave hearty assent indulged mirth for time at expense of dear friend vulgar relation with renewal of tenderness however returned to room on leaving dining parlour sat with till summoned to coffee be still very poorly elizabeth must not quit at till late in evening when have comfort of seeing sleep when seemed to rather right than pleasant that must go downstairs on entering drawing room found whole party at loo be immediately invited to join suspecting to be playing high declined making sister excuse said must amuse for short time must stay below with book mr hurst looked at with astonishment do prefer reading to card said be rather singular miss eliza bennet said miss bingley despises card be great reader have pleasure in anything else deserve such praise such censure cried elizabeth be not great reader have pleasure in many thing in nursing sister be sure have pleasure said bingley hope will be soon increased by seeing quite well elizabeth thanked from heart then walked towards table where few book be lying immediately offered to fetch others that library afforded wish collection be larger for benefit own credit be idle fellow though have not many have more than ever looked into elizabeth assured that must suit perfectly with in room be astonished said miss bingley that father must have left so small collection of book what delightful library have at pemberley mr darcy ought to be good replied have be work of many generation then have added so much to be always buying book can not comprehend neglect of family library in such day a neglect be sure neglect nothing can add to beauty of noble place charles when build house wish may be half a delightful a pemberley wish may must really advise to make purchase in neighbourhood take pemberley for kind of model there be not finer county in england than derbyshire with heart will buy pemberley if darcy will sell be talking of possibility charles upon word caroline must think more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation elizabeth be so much caught with what passed a to leave very little attention for book soon laying wholly aside drew near card table stationed between mr bingley eldest sister to observe game be miss darcy much grown since spring said miss bingley will be a tall a be think will be now about miss elizabeth bennet height rather taller how long to see again never met with anybody who delighted so much countenance such manner so extremely accomplished for age performance on pianoforte be exquisite be amazing to said bingley how young lady can have patience to be so very accomplished a be young lady accomplished dear charles what do mean yes of think paint table cover screen net purse scarcely know anyone who can not do be sure never heard young lady spoken of for first time without being informed that be very accomplished list of common extent of accomplishment said darcy have too much truth word be applied to many woman who deserves otherwise than by netting purse covering screen be very far from agreeing with in estimation of lady in general can not boast of knowing more than dozen in whole range of acquaintance be really accomplished be sure said miss bingley then observed must comprehend great deal in idea of accomplished woman yes do comprehend great deal in oh certainly cried faithful assistant one can be really esteemed accomplished who doe not greatly surpass what be usually met with woman must have thorough knowledge of music singing drawing dancing modern language to deserve word besides must posse certain something in air manner of walking tone of voice address expression word will be deserved must posse added darcy to must yet add something more substantial in improvement of mind by extensive reading be no longer surprised at

advantage can be equally happy in aye be because have right disposition that gentleman looking at darcy seemed to think country be nothing at indeed mamma be mistaken said elizabeth blushing for mother quite mistook mr darcy only meant that there be not such variety of people to be met with in country a in town must acknowledge to be true certainly dear nobody said there be a to not meeting with many people in neighbourhood believe there be few neighbourhood larger know dine with four twenty family nothing concern for elizabeth must enable bingley to keep countenance sister be le delicate directed eye towards mr darcy with very expressive smile elizabeth for sake of saying something might turn mother thought now asked if charlotte lucas have be at longbourn since coming away

thought too young however wrote verse on very pretty be so ended affection said elizabeth impatiently there have be many one fancy overcome in same way wonder who first discovered efficacy of poetry in driving away love have be used to consider poetry a food of love said darcy of fine stout healthy love may everything nourishes what be strong already if be only slight thin sort of inclination be convinced that one good sonnet will starve entirely away darcy only smiled general pause ensued made elizabeth tremble lest mother must be exposing again longed to speak must think of nothing to say after short silence mr bennet began repeating thanks to mr bingley for kindness to jane with apology for troubling also with lizzy mr bingley be unaffectedly civil in answer forced younger sister to be civil also say what occasion required performed part indeed without much graciousness mr bennet be satisfied soon afterwards ordered carriage upon signal youngest of daughter put forward two girl have be whispering to other during whole visit result of be that youngest must tax mr bingley with having promised on first coming into country to give ball at netherfield lydia be stout well grown girl of fifteen with fine complexion good humoured countenance favourite with mother whose affection have brought into public at early age have high animal spirit sort of natural self consequence attention of officer to whom uncle good dinner own easy manner recommended have increased into assurance be very equal therefore to address mr bingley on subject of ball abruptly reminded of promise adding that must be most shameful thing in world if did not keep answer to sudden attack be delightful to mother ear be perfectly ready assure to keep engagement when sister be recovered will if please name very day of ball must not wish to be dancing when be ill lydia declared satisfied oh yes must be much better to wait till jane be well by time most likely captain carter must be at meryton again when have given ball added will insist on giving one also will tell colonel forster will be quite shame if doe not mr bennet daughter then departed elizabeth returned instantly to jane leaving own relation behaviour to remark of two lady mr darcy latter of whom however must not be prevailed on to join in censure of in spite of miss bingley witticism on fine eye chapter day passed much a day before have done mr hurst miss bingley have spent hour of morning with invalid who continued though slowly to mend in evening elizabeth joined party in drawing room loo table however did not appear mr darcy be writing miss bingley seated near be watching progress of letter repeatedly calling off attention by message to sister mr hurst mr bingley be at piquet mr hurst be observing game elizabeth took up needlework be sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy companion perpetual commendation of lady on handwriting on evenness of line on length of letter with perfect unconcern with praise be received formed curious dialogue be exactly in union with opinion of how delighted miss darcy will be to receive letter made answer write uncommonly fast be mistaken write rather slowly how many letter must have occasion to write in course of year letter of business too how odious must think be fortunate then that fall to lot instead of yours pray tell sister long to see have already told so once by desire be afraid like pen let mend for mend pen remarkably well thank always mend own how can contrive to write so even be silent tell sister be delighted to hear of improvement on harp pray let know be quite in rapture with beautiful little design for table think infinitely superior to miss grantley will give leave to defer rapture till write again at present have not room to do justice oh be of consequence will see in january do always write such charming long letter to mr darcy be generally long whether always charming be not for to determine be rule with that person who can write long letter with ease can not write ill will not do for compliment to darcy caroline cried brother because doe not write with ease study too much for word of four syllable darcy style of writing be very different from yours oh cried miss bingley charles writes in most careless way imaginable leaf out word blot rest idea flow so rapidly have not time to express by mean letter sometimes convey idea at to correspondent humility mr bingley said elizabeth must disarm reproof nothing be more deceitful said darcy than appearance of humility be often only carelessness of opinion sometimes indirect boast of two do call little recent piece of modesty indirect boast for be really proud of defect in writing because consider a proceeding from rapidity of thought carelessness of execution if not estimable think at least highly interesting power of doing anything with quickness be always prized much by possessor often without attention to imperfection of performance when told mr bennet morning that if ever resolved upon quitting netherfield must be gone in five minute meant to be sort of panegyric of compliment to yet what be there so very laudable in precipitance must leave very necessary business undone can be of real advantage to anyone else nay cried bingley be too much to remember at night foolish thing be said in morning yet upon honour believe what said of to be true believe at moment at least therefore did not assume character of needle precipitance merely to show off before lady dare say believed be by mean convinced that must be gone with such celerity conduct must be quite a dependent on chance a of man know if a be mounting horse friend be to say 'bingley have better stay till next week must probably do must probably not go at word might stay month have only proved by cried elizabeth mr bingley did not do justice to own disposition have shown off now much more than did be exceedingly gratified said bingley by converting what friend say into compliment on sweetness of temper be afraid be giving turn that gentleman did by mean intend for must certainly think better of if under circumstance be to give flat denial ride off a fast a must must mr darcy then consider rashness of original intention a atoned for by obstinacy in adhering to upon word can not exactly explain matter darcy must speak for expect to account for opinion choose to call mine have never acknowledged allowing case however to stand according to representation must remember miss bennet that friend who be supposed to desire return to house delay of plan have merely desired asked without offering one argument in favour of propriety to yield readily easily to persuasion of friend be merit with to yield without conviction be compliment to understanding of appear to mr darcy to allow nothing for influence of friendship affection regard for requester must often make one readily yield to request without waiting for argument to reason one into be not particularly speaking of such case a have supposed about mr bingley may a well wait perhaps till circumstance occurs before discus discretion of behaviour thereupon in general ordinary case between friend friend where one of be desired by other to change resolution of very great moment must think ill of person for complying with desire without waiting to be argued into will not be advisable before proceed on subject to arrange with rather more precision degree of importance be to appertain to request a well a degree of intimacy subsisting between party by mean cried bingley let hear particular not forgetting comparative height size for will have more weight in argument miss bennet than may be aware of assure that if darcy be not such great tall fellow in comparison with must not pay so much deference declare know more awful object than darcy on particular occasion in particular place at own house especially of sunday evening when have nothing to do mr darcy smiled elizabeth thought must perceive that be rather offended therefore checked laugh miss bingley warmly resented indignity have received in expostulation with brother for talking such nonsense see design bingley said friend dislike argument want to silence perhaps do argument be too much like dispute if miss bennet will defer yours till be out of room will be very thankful then may say like of what ask said elizabeth be sacrifice on side mr darcy have much better finish letter mr darcy took advice did finish letter when business be over applied to miss bingley elizabeth for indulgence of music miss bingley moved with alacrity to pianoforte after polite request that elizabeth must lead way other a politely more earnestly negatived seated mr hurst sang with sister while be thus employed elizabeth must not help observing a turned over music book lay on instrument how frequently mr darcy eye be fixed on hardly knew how to suppose that must be object of admiration to so great man yet that must look at because disliked be still more strange must only imagine however at last that drew notice because there be something more wrong reprehensible according to idea of right than in other person present supposition did not pain liked too little to care for approbation after playing italian song miss bingley varied charm by lively scotch air soon afterwards mr darcy drawing near elizabeth said to feel great inclination miss bennet to seize such opportunity of dancing reel smiled made answer repeated question with surprise at silence oh said heard before must not immediately determine what to say in reply wanted know to say 'yes that might have pleasure of despising taste always delight in overthrowing kind of scheme cheating person of premeditated contempt have therefore made up mind to tell want to dance reel at now despise if dare indeed dare elizabeth having rather expected to affront be amazed at gallantry there be mixture of sweetness archness in manner made difficult for to affront anybody darcy have never be so bewitched by woman a be by really believed that be not for inferiority of connection must be in danger miss bingley saw suspected enough to be jealous great anxiety for recovery of dear friend jane received assistance from desire of getting rid of elizabeth often tried to provoke darcy into disliking guest by talking of supposed marriage planning happiness in such alliance hope said a be walking together in shrubbery next day will give mother in law few hint when desirable event take place a to advantage of holding tongue if can compass do cure younger girl of running after officer if may mention so delicate subject endeavour to check little something bordering on conceit impertinence lady posse have anything else to propose for domestic felicity oh yes do let portrait of uncle aunt phillips be placed in gallery at pemberley put next to great uncle judge be in same profession know only in different line a for elizabeth picture must not have taken for what painter must do justice to beautiful eye must not be easy indeed to catch expression colour shape eyelash so remarkably fine might be copied at moment be met from walk by mr hurst elizabeth did not know that intended to walk said miss bingley in confusion lest have be overheard used abominably ill answered mr hurst running away without telling that be coming out then taking disengaged arm of mr darcy left elizabeth to walk by path just admitted three mr darcy felt rudeness immediately said walk be not wide enough for party have better go into avenue elizabeth who have not least inclination to remain with laughingly answered stay where be be charmingly grouped appear to uncommon advantage picturesque must be spoilt by admitting fourth good bye then ran gaily off rejoicing a rambled about in hope of being at home again in day two jane be already so much recovered a to intend leaving room for couple of hour that evening chapter when lady removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to sister seeing well guarded from cold attended into drawing room where be welcomed by two friend with many profession of pleasure elizabeth have never seen so agreeable a be during hour passed before gentleman appeared power of conversation be considerable must describe entertainment with accuracy relate anecdote with humour laugh at acquaintance with spirit when gentleman entered jane be no longer first object miss bingley eye be instantly turned toward darcy have something to say to before have advanced many step addressed to miss bennet with polite congratulation mr hurst also made slight bow said be very glad diffuseness warmth remained for bingley salutation be full of joy attention first hour be spent in piling up fire lest must suffer from change of room removed at desire to other side of fireplace that might be further from door then sat down by talked scarcely to anyone else elizabeth at work in opposite corner saw with great delight when tea be over mr hurst reminded sister in law of card table in vain have obtained private intelligence that mr darcy did not wish for card mr hurst soon found even open petition rejected assured that one intended to play silence of whole party on subject seemed to justify mr hurst have therefore nothing to do to stretch on one of sofa go to sleep darcy took up book miss bingley did same mr hurst principally occupied in playing with bracelet ring joined now then in brother conversation with miss bennet miss bingley attention be quite a much engaged in watching mr darcy progress through book a in reading own be perpetually making inquiry looking at page must not win however to conversation merely answered question read on at length quite exhausted by attempt to be amused with own book have only chosen because be second volume of gave great yawn said how pleasant be to spend evening in way declare after there be enjoyment like reading how much sooner one tire of anything than of book when have house of own will be miserable if have not excellent library one made reply then yawned again threw aside book cast eye round room in quest for amusement when hearing brother mentioning ball to miss bennet turned suddenly towards said by bye charles be really serious in meditating dance at netherfield must advise before determine on to consult wish of present party be much mistaken if there be not among to whom ball must be rather punishment than pleasure if mean darcy cried brother may go to bed if chooses before begin a for ball be quite settled thing a soon a nicholls have made white soup enough will send round card must like ball infinitely better replied if be carried on in different manner there be something insufferably tedious in usual process of meeting must surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing be made order of day much more rational dear caroline dare say must not be near so much like ball miss bingley made answer soon afterwards got up walked about room figure be elegant walked well darcy at whom be aimed be still inflexibly studious in desperation of feeling resolved on one effort more turning to elizabeth said miss eliza bennet let persuade to follow example take turn about room assure be very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude elizabeth be surprised agreed to immediately miss bingley succeeded le in real object of civility mr darcy looked up be a much awake to novelty of attention in quarter a elizabeth must be unconsciously closed book be directly invited to join party declined observing that must imagine two motif for choosing to walk up down room together with of motif joining must interfere what must mean be dying to know what must be meaning asked elizabeth whether must at understand not at be answer depend upon mean to be severe on surest way of disappointing will be to ask nothing about miss bingley however be incapable of disappointing mr darcy in anything persevered therefore in requiring explanation of two motif have not smallest objection to explaining said a soon a allowed to speak either choose method of passing evening because be in other confidence have secret affair to discus because be conscious that figure appear to greatest advantage in walking if first must be completely in way if second can admire much better a sit by fire oh shocking cried miss bingley never heard anything so abominable how will punish for speech nothing so easy if have inclination said elizabeth can plague punish one tease laugh at intimate a be must know how be to be done upon honour do assure that intimacy have not yet taught that tease calmness of manner presence of mind feel may defy there a to laughter will not expose ourselves if please by attempting to laugh without subject mr darcy may hug mr darcy be not to be laughed at cried elizabeth be uncommon advantage uncommon hope will continue for must be great loss to to have many such acquaintance dearly love laugh miss bingley said have given more credit than can be wisest best of men nay wisest best of action may be rendered ridiculous by person whose first object in life be joke certainly replied elizabeth there be such people hope be not one of hope never ridicule what be wise good folly nonsense whim inconsistency do divert own laugh at can suppose be precisely what be without perhaps be not possible for anyone have be study of life to avoid weakness often expose strong understanding to ridicule such a vanity pride yes vanity be weakness indeed pride where there be real superiority of mind pride will be always under good regulation elizabeth turned away to hide smile examination of mr darcy be over presume said miss bingley pray what be result be perfectly convinced by mr darcy have defect owns without disguise said darcy have made such pretension have fault enough be not hope of understanding temper dare not vouch for be believe too little yielding certainly too little for convenience of world can not forget folly vice of others so soon a ought offense against feeling be not puffed about with attempt to move temper must perhaps be called resentful good opinion once lost be lost forever be failing indeed cried elizabeth implacable resentment be shade in character have chosen fault well really can not laugh at be safe from there be

little music cried miss bingley tired of conversation in have share louisa will not mind waking mr hurst sister have not smallest objection pianoforte be opened darcy after few moment recollection be not sorry for began to feel danger of paying elizabeth too much attention chapter in consequence of agreement between sister elizabeth wrote next morning to mother to beg that carriage might be sent for in course of day mr bennet who have calculated on daughter remaining at netherfield till following tuesday must exactly finish jane week must not bring to receive with pleasure before answer therefore be not propitious at least not to elizabeth wish for be impatient to get home mr bennet sent word that must not possibly have carriage before tuesday in postscript be added that if mr bingley sister pressed to stay longer must spare very well against staying longer however elizabeth be positively resolved did much expect must be asked fearful on contrary a being considered a intruding needlessly long urged jane to borrow mr bingley carriage immediately at length be settled that original design of leaving netherfield that morning must be mentioned request made communication excited many profession of concern enough be said of wishing to stay at least till following day to work on jane till morrow going be deferred miss bingley be then sorry that have proposed delay for jealousy dislike of one sister much exceeded affection for other master of house heard with real sorrow that be to go so soon repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that must not be safe for that be not enough recovered jane be firm where felt to be right to mr darcy be welcome intelligence elizabeth have be at netherfield long enough attracted more than liked miss bingley be uncivil to more teasing than usual to wisely resolved to be particularly careful that sign of admiration must now escape nothing must elevate with hope of influencing felicity sensible that if such idea have be suggested behaviour during last day must have material weight in confirming crushing steady to purpose scarcely spoke ten word to through whole of saturday though be at one time left by

cousin mr collins who when be dead may turn out of house a soon a plea oh dear cried wife can not bear to hear that mentioned pray talk of odious man do think be hardest thing in world that estate must be entailed away from own child be sure if have be must have tried long ago to do something other about jane elizabeth tried to explain to nature of entail have often attempted to do before be subject on mr bennet be beyond reach of reason continued to rail bitterly against cruelty of settling estate away from family of five daughter in favour of man whom nobody cared anything about certainly be most iniquitous affair said mr bennet nothing can clear mr collins from guilt of inheriting longbourn if will listen to letter may perhaps be little softened by manner of expressing that be sure will not think be very impertinent of to write to at very hypocritical hate such false friend why must not keep on quarreling with a father did before why indeed doe seem to have have filial scruple on head a will hear hunsford near westerham kent th october dear disagreement subsisting between late honoured father always gave much uneasiness since have have misfortune to lose have frequently wished to heal breach for time be kept back by own doubt fearing lest might seem disrespectful to memory for to be on good term with anyone with whom have always pleased to be at variance

though be difficult said jane to guess in what way can mean to make atonement think due wish be certainly to credit elizabeth be chiefly struck by extraordinary deference for lady catherine kind intention of christening marrying burying parishioner whenever be required must be oddity think said can not make out there be something very pompous in style what can mean by apologising for being next in entail can not suppose must help if must must be sensible man sir dear think not have great hope of finding quite reverse there be mixture of servility self importance in letter promise well

lady catherine drawing room found that chimney piece alone have cost eight hundred pound felt force of compliment must hardly have resented comparison with housekeeper room in describing to grandeur of lady catherine mansion with occasional digression in praise of own humble abode improvement be receiving be happily employed until gentleman joined found in mr phillips very attentive listener whose opinion of consequence increased with what heard who be resolving to retail among neighbour a soon a must to girl who must not listen to cousin who have nothing to do to wish for instrument

game too eager in making bet exclaiming after prize to have attention for anyone in particular allowing for common demand of game mr wickham be therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth be very willing to hear though what chiefly wished to hear must not hope to be told history of acquaintance with mr darcy dared not even mention that gentleman curiosity however be unexpectedly relieved mr began subject inquired how far be from meryton after receiving answer asked in hesitating manner how long mr darcy have be staying there about month said elizabeth then unwilling to let subject drop

information on head than for have be connected with family in particular manner from infancy elizabeth must not look surprised may well be surprised miss bennet at assertion after seeing a probably might very cold manner of meeting yesterday be much acquainted with mr darcy a much a ever wish to be cried elizabeth very warmly have spent four day in same house with think very disagreeable have right to give opinion said wickham a to being agreeable otherwise be not qualified to form one have known too long too well to be fair judge be impossible for to be impartial believe opinion of must in general astonish perhaps must not express quite so strongly anywhere else here be in own family upon word say more here than might say in house in neighbourhood except netherfield be not at liked in hertfordshire everybody be disgusted with pride will not find more favourably spoken of by anyone can not pretend to be sorry said wickham after short interruption that that man must not be estimated beyond desert with believe doe not often happen world be blinded by fortune consequence frightened by high imposing manner see only a chooses to be seen must take even on slight acquaintance to be ill tempered man wickham only shook head wonder said at next opportunity of speaking whether be likely to be in country much longer at know heard nothing of going away when be at netherfield hope plan in favour of shire will not be affected by being in neighbourhood oh be not for to be driven away by mr darcy if wish to avoid seeing must go be not on friendly term always give pain to meet

friend ever have can never be in company with mr darcy without being grieved to soul by thousand tender recollection behaviour to have be scandalous verily believe must forgive anything everything

presentation of best living in gift be godfather excessively attached to can not do justice to kindness meant to provide for amply thought have done when living fell be given elsewhere good heaven cried elizabeth how must that be how must will be disregarded why did not seek legal redress there be just such informality in term of bequest a to give hope from law man of honour must not have doubted intention mr darcy chose to doubt to treat a merely conditional recommendation to assert have forfeited claim to by extravagance imprudence in short anything nothing certain be that living became vacant two year ago exactly a be of age to hold that be given to man le certain be can not accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose have warm unguarded temper may have spoken opinion of to too freely can recall nothing worse fact be that be very different sort of men that hate be quite shocking deserves to be publicly disgraced time other will be will not be by till can forget father can never defy expose elizabeth honoured for such feeling thought handsomer than ever a expressed what said after pause can have be motive what can have induced to behave so cruelly thorough determined dislike of dislike can not attribute in measure to jealousy have late mr darcy liked le son might have borne with better father uncommon attachment to irritated believe very early in life have not temper to bear sort of competition in stood sort of preference be often given have not thought mr darcy so bad a though have never liked have not thought so very ill of have supposed to be despising fellow creature in general did not suspect of descending to such malicious revenge such injustice such inhumanity a after few minute reflection however continued do remember boasting one day at netherfield of implacability of resentment of having unforgiving temper disposition must be dreadful will not trust on subject replied wickham can hardly be just to elizabeth be again deep in thought after time exclaimed to treat in such manner godson friend favourite of father must have added young man too like whose very countenance may vouch for being amiable contented with one too who have probably be companion from childhood connected together a think said in closest manner be born in same parish within same park greatest part of youth be passed together inmate of same house sharing same amusement object of same parental care father began life in profession uncle mr phillips appears to do so much credit to gave up everything to be of use to late mr darcy devoted time to care of pemberley property be most highly esteemed by mr darcy most intimate confidential friend mr darcy often acknowledged to be under greatest obligation to father active superintendence when immediately before father death mr darcy gave voluntary promise of providing for be convinced that felt to be a much debt of gratitude to a of affection to myself how strange cried elizabeth how abominable wonder that very pride of mr darcy have not made just to if from better motive that must not have be too proud to be dishonest for dishonesty must call be wonderful replied wickham for almost action may be traced to pride pride have often be best friend have connected nearer with virtue than with other feeling be none of consistent in behaviour to there be stronger impulse even than pride can such abominable pride a have ever done good yes have often led to be liberal generous to give money freely to display hospitality to assist tenant relieve poor family pride filial pride for be very proud of what father be have done not to appear to disgrace family to degenerate from popular quality lose influence of pemberley house be powerful motive have also brotherly pride with brotherly affection make very kind careful guardian of sister will hear generally cried up a most attentive best of brother what sort of girl be miss darcy shook head wish must call amiable give pain to speak ill of darcy be too much like brother very very proud a child be affectionate pleasing extremely fond of have devoted hour hour to amusement be nothing to now be handsome girl about fifteen sixteen understand highly accomplished since father death home have be london where lady life with superintends education after many pause many trial of other subject elizabeth must not help reverting once more to first saying be astonished at intimacy with mr bingley how can mr bingley who seems good humour be really believe truly amiable be in friendship with man how can suit other do know mr bingley not at be sweet tempered amiable charming man can not know what mr darcy be probably not mr darcy can please where chooses doe not want ability can be conversible companion if think worth while among who be at equal in consequence be very different man from what be to le prosperous pride never desert with rich be liberal minded just sincere rational honourable perhaps agreeable allowing something for fortune figure whist party soon afterwards breaking up player gathered round other table mr collins took station between cousin elizabeth mr phillips usual inquiry a to success be made by latter have not be very great have lost point when mr phillips began to express concern thereupon assured with much earnest gravity that be not of least importance that considered money a mere trifle begged that must not make uneasy know very well madam said that when person sit down to card table must take chance of thing happily be not in such circumstance a to make five shilling object there be undoubtedly many who must not say same thanks to lady catherine de bourgh be removed far beyond necessity of regarding little matter mr wickham attention be caught after observing mr collins for few moment asked elizabeth in low voice whether relation be very intimately acquainted with family of de bourgh lady catherine de bourgh replied have very lately given living hardly know how mr collins be first introduced to notice certainly have not known long know of course that lady catherine de bourgh lady anne darcy be sister consequently that be aunt to present mr darcy indeed did not knew nothing at of lady catherine connection never heard of existence till day before yesterday daughter miss de bourgh will have very large fortune be believed that cousin will unite two estate information made elizabeth smile a thought of poor miss bingley vain indeed must be attention vain useless affection for sister praise of if be already self destined for mr collins said speaks highly of lady catherine daughter from particular that have related of ladyship suspect gratitude misleads that in spite of being patroness be arrogant conceited woman believe to be in great degree replied wickham have not seen for many year very well remember never liked that manner be dictatorial insolent have reputation of being remarkably sensible clever rather believe derives part of ability from rank fortune part from authoritative manner rest from pride for nephew who chooses that everyone connected with must have understanding of first class elizabeth allowed that have given very rational account of continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put end to card gave rest of lady share of mr wickham attention there must be conversation in noise of mr phillips supper party manner recommended to everybody said be said well whatever did done gracefully elizabeth went away with head full of must think of nothing of mr wickham of what have told way home there be not time for even to mention name a went for lydia mr collins be once silent lydia talked incessantly of lottery ticket of fish have lost fish have won mr collins in describing civility of mr mr phillips protesting that did not in least regard loss at whist enumerating dish at supper repeatedly fearing that crowded cousin have more to say than must well manage before carriage stopped at longbourn house chapter elizabeth related to jane next day what have passed between mr wickham jane listened with astonishment concern knew not how to believe that mr darcy must be so unworthy of mr bingley regard yet be not in nature to question veracity of young man of such amiable appearance a wickham possibility of having endured such unkindness be enough to interest tender feeling nothing remained therefore to be done to think well of to defend conduct of throw into account of accident mistake must not be otherwise explained have said be deceived dare say in way other of can form idea interested people have perhaps misrepresented to other be in short impossible for to conjecture cause circumstance may have alienated without actual blame on side very true indeed now dear jane what have got to say on behalf of interested people who have probably be concerned in business do clear too will be obliged to think ill of somebody laugh a much a choose will not laugh out of opinion dearest lizzy do consider in what disgraceful light place mr darcy to be treating father favourite in such manner one whom father have promised to provide for be impossible man of common humanity man who have value for character must be capable of can most intimate friend be so excessively deceived in oh can much more easily believe mr bingley being imposed on than mr wickham must invent history of a gave last night name fact everything mentioned without ceremony if be not so let mr darcy contradict besides there be truth in look be difficult indeed be distressing one doe not know what to think beg pardon one know exactly what to think jane must think with certainty on only one point mr bingley if have be imposed on must have much to suffer when affair became public two young lady be summoned from shrubbery where conversation passed by arrival of very person of whom have be speaking mr bingley sister came to give personal invitation for long expected ball at netherfield be fixed for following tuesday two lady be delighted to see dear friend again called age since have met repeatedly asked what have be doing with since separation to rest of family paid little attention avoiding mr bennet a much a possible saying not much to elizabeth nothing at to others be soon gone again rising from seat with activity took brother by surprise hurrying off a if eager to escape from mr bennet civility prospect of netherfield ball be extremely agreeable to female of family mr bennet chose to consider a given in compliment to eldest daughter be particularly flattered by receiving invitation from mr bingley instead of ceremonious card jane pictured to herself happy evening in society of two friend attention of brother elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing great deal with mr wickham of seeing confirmation of everything in mr darcy look behavior happiness anticipated by catherine lydia depended le on single event particular person for though like elizabeth meant to dance evening with mr wickham be by mean only partner who must satisfy ball be at rate ball even mary must assure family that have disinclination for while can have morning to myself said be enough think be sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagement society have claim on profess one of who consider interval of recreation amusement a desirable for everybody elizabeth spirit be so high on occasion that though did not often speak unnecessarily to mr collins must not help asking whether intended to accept mr bingley invitation if did whether must think proper to join in evening amusement be rather surprised to find that entertained scruple on head be very far from dreading rebuke from archbishop lady catherine de bourgh by venturing to dance be by mean of opinion assure said that ball of kind given by young man of character to respectable people can have evil tendency be so far from objecting to dancing that will hope to be honoured with hand of fair cousin in course of evening take opportunity of soliciting yours miss elizabeth for two first dance especially preference trust cousin jane will attribute to right cause not to disrespect for elizabeth felt completely taken in have fully proposed being engaged by mr wickham for very dance to have mr collins instead liveliness have never be worse timed there be help for however mr wickham happiness own be perforce delayed little longer mr collins proposal accepted with a good grace a must be not better pleased with gallantry from idea suggested of something more now first struck that be selected from among sister a worthy of being mistress of hunsford parsonage of assisting to form quadrille table at rosings in absence of more eligible visitor idea soon reached to conviction a observed increasing civility toward heard frequent attempt at compliment on wit vivacity though more astonished than gratified herself by effect of charm be not long before mother gave to understand that probability of marriage be extremely agreeable to elizabeth however did not choose to take hint being well aware that serious dispute must be consequence of reply mr collins might never make offer till did be useless to quarrel about if there have not be netherfield ball to prepare for talk of younger miss bennet must have be in very pitiable state at time for from day of invitation to day of ball there be such succession of rain a prevented walking to meryton once aunt officer news must be sought after very shoe rose for netherfield be got by proxy even elizabeth might have found trial of patience in weather totally suspended improvement of acquaintance with mr wickham nothing le than dance on tuesday must have made friday saturday sunday monday endurable to kitty lydia chapter till elizabeth entered drawing room at netherfield looked in vain for mr wickham among cluster of red coat there assembled doubt of being present have never occurred to certainty of meeting have not be checked by of recollection might not unreasonably have alarmed have dressed with more than usual care prepared in highest spirit for conquest of remained unsubdued of heart trusting that be not more than might be won in course of evening in instant arose dreadful suspicion of being purposely omitted for mr darcy pleasure in bingleys invitation to officer though be not exactly case absolute fact of absence be pronounced by friend denny to whom lydia eagerly applied who told that wickham have be obliged to go to town on business day before be not yet returned adding with significant smile imagine business must have called away just now if have not wanted to avoid certain gentleman here part of intelligence though unheard by lydia be caught by elizabeth a assured that darcy be not le answerable for wickham absence than if first surmise have be just feeling of displeasure against former be so sharpened by immediate disappointment that must hardly reply with tolerable civility to polite inquiry directly afterwards approached to make attendance forbearance patience with darcy be injury to wickham be resolved against sort of conversation with turned away with degree of ill humour must not wholly surmount even in speaking to mr bingley whose blind partiality provoked elizabeth be not formed for ill humour though prospect of own be destroyed for evening must not dwell long on spirit having told grief to charlotte lucas whom have not seen for week be soon able to make voluntary transition to oddity of cousin to point out to particular notice first two dance however brought return of distress be dance of mortification mr collins awkward solemn apologising instead of attending often moving wrong without being aware of gave shame misery disagreeable partner for couple of dance can give moment of release from be ecstasy danced next with officer have refreshment of talking of wickham of hearing that be universally liked when dance be over returned to charlotte lucas be in conversation with when found suddenly addressed by mr darcy who took so much by surprise in application for hand that without knowing what did accepted walked away again immediately be left to fret over own want of presence of mind charlotte tried to console dare say will find very agreeable heaven forbid must be greatest misfortune of to find man agreeable whom one be determined to hate wish such evil when dancing recommenced however darcy approached to claim hand charlotte must not help cautioning in whisper not to be simpleton allow fancy for wickham to make appear unpleasant in eye of man ten time consequence elizabeth made answer took place in set amazed at dignity to be arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr darcy reading in neighbour look equal amazement in beholding stood for time without speaking word began to imagine that silence be to last through two dance at first be resolved not to break till suddenly fancying that must be greater punishment to partner to oblige to talk made slight observation on dance replied be again silent after pause of minute addressed second time with be turn to say something now mr darcy talked about dance ought to make sort of remark on size of room number of couple smiled assured that wished to say must be said very well that reply will do for present perhaps by by may observe private ball be much pleasanter than public one now may be silent do talk by rule then while be dancing sometimes one must speak little know must look odd to be entirely silent for hour together yet for advantage of conversation ought to be so arranged a that may have trouble of saying a little a possible be consulting own feeling in present case do imagine that be gratifying mine replied elizabeth archly for have always seen great similarity in turn of mind be of unsocial taciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless expect to say something will amaze whole room be handed down to posterity with eclat of proverb be very striking resemblance of own character be sure said how near may be to mine can not pretend to say think faithful portrait undoubtedly must not decide on own performance made answer be again silent till have gone down dance when asked if sister did not very often walk to meryton answered in affirmative unable to resist temptation added when met there other day have just be forming new acquaintance effect be immediate deeper shade of hauteur overspread feature said not word elizabeth though blaming for own weakness must not go on at length darcy spoke in constrained manner said mr wickham be blessed with such happy manner a may ensure making friend whether may be equally capable of retaining be le certain have be so unlucky a to lose friendship replied elizabeth with emphasis in manner be likely to suffer from life darcy made answer seemed desirous of changing subject at moment sir william lucas appeared close to meaning to pas through set to other side of room on perceiving mr darcy stopped with bow of superior courtesy to compliment on dancing partner have be most highly gratified indeed dear sir such very superior dancing be not often seen be evident that belong to first circle allow to say however that fair partner doe not disgrace must hope to have pleasure often repeated especially when certain desirable event dear eliza glancing at sister bingley will take place what congratulation will then flow in appeal to mr darcy let not interrupt sir will not thank for detaining from bewitching converse of young lady whose bright eye be also upbraiding latter part of address be scarcely heard by darcy sir william allusion to friend seemed to strike forcibly eye be directed with very serious expression towards bingley jane who be dancing together recovering however shortly turned to partner said sir william interruption have made forget what be talking of think be speaking at sir william must not have interrupted two people in room who have le to say for have tried two three subject already without success what be to talk of next can not imagine what think of book said smiling book oh be sure never read same not with same feeling be sorry think so if be case there can at least be want of subject may compare different opinion can not talk of book in ball room head be always full of something else present always occupies in such scene doe said with look of doubt yes always replied without knowing what said for thought have wandered far from subject a soon afterwards appeared by suddenly exclaiming remember hearing once say mr darcy that hardly ever forgave that resentment once created be unappeasable be very cautious suppose a to being created be said with firm voice never allow to be blinded by prejudice hope not be particularly incumbent on who never change opinion to be secure of judging properly at first may ask to what question tend merely to illustration of character said endeavouring to shake off gravity be trying to make out what be success shook head get on at hear such different account of a puzzle exceedingly can readily believe answered gravely that report may vary greatly with respect to must wish miss bennet that be not to sketch character at present moment a there be reason to fear that performance must reflect credit on if take likeness now may never have opportunity must by mean suspend pleasure of yours coldly replied said more went down other dance parted in silence on side dissatisfied though not to equal degree for in darcy breast there be tolerable powerful feeling towards soon procured pardon directed anger against have not long separated when miss bingley came towards with expression of civil disdain accosted so miss eliza hear be quite delighted with george wickham sister have be talking to about asking thousand question find that young man quite forgot to tell among other communication that be son of old wickham late mr darcy steward let recommend however a friend not to give implicit confidence to assertion for a to mr darcy using ill be perfectly false for on contrary have always be remarkably kind to though george wickham have treated mr darcy in most infamous manner know particular know very well that mr darcy be not in least to blame that can not bear to hear george wickham mentioned that though brother thought that must not well avoid including in invitation to officer be excessively glad to find that have taken out of way coming into country at be most insolent thing indeed wonder how must presume to do pity miss eliza for discovery of favourite guilt really considering descent one must not expect much better guilt descent appear by account to be same said elizabeth angrily for have heard accuse of nothing worse than of being son of mr darcy steward of can assure informed beg pardon replied miss bingley turning away with sneer excuse interference be kindly meant insolent girl said elizabeth to herself be much mistaken if expect to influence by paltry attack a see nothing in own wilful ignorance malice of mr darcy then sought eldest sister who have undertaken to make inquiry on same subject of bingley jane met with smile of such sweet complacency glow of such happy expression a sufficiently marked how well be satisfied with occurrence of evening elizabeth instantly read feeling at moment solicitude for wickham resentment against enemy everything else gave way before hope of jane being in fairest way for happiness want to know said with countenance no le smiling than sister what have learnt about mr wickham perhaps have be too pleasantly engaged to think of third person in case may be sure of pardon replied jane have not forgotten have nothing satisfactory to tell mr bingley doe not know whole of history be quite ignorant of circumstance have principally offended mr darcy will vouch for good conduct probity honour of friend be perfectly convinced that mr wickham have deserved much le attention from mr darcy than have received be sorry to say by account a well a sister mr wickham be by mean respectable young man be afraid have be very imprudent have deserved to lose mr darcy regard mr bingley doe not know mr wickham no never saw till other morning at meryton account then be what have received from mr darcy be satisfied what doe say of living doe not exactly recollect circumstance though have heard from mr darcy more than once belief that be left to conditionally only have not doubt of mr bingley sincerity said elizabeth warmly must excuse not being convinced by assurance only mr bingley defense of friend be very able one dare say since be unacquainted with several part of story have learnt rest from friend will venture to still think of gentleman a did before then changed discourse to one more gratifying to on there must be difference of sentiment elizabeth listened with delight to happy though modest hope jane entertained of mr bingley regard said in power to heighten confidence in on being joined by mr bingley elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas to whose inquiry after pleasantness of last partner have scarcely replied before mr collins came up to told with great exultation that have just be so fortunate a to make most important discovery have found out said by singular accident that there be now in room near relation of patroness happened to overhear gentleman mentioning to young lady who doe honour of house name of cousin miss de bourgh of mother lady catherine how wonderfully sort of thing occur who must have thought of meeting with perhaps nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in assembly be most thankful that discovery be made in time for to pay respect to be now going to do trust will excuse not having done before total ignorance of connection must plead apology be not going to introduce to mr darcy indeed be will entreat pardon for not having done earlier believe to be lady catherine nephew will be in power to assure that ladyship be quite well yesterday se'nnight elizabeth tried hard to dissuade from scheme assuring that mr darcy must consider addressing without introduction a impertinent freedom rather than compliment to aunt that be not in least necessary there must be notice on side that if be must belong to mr darcy superior in consequence to begin acquaintance mr collins listened to with determined air of following own inclination when ceased speaking replied thus dear miss elizabeth have highest opinion in world in excellent judgement in matter within scope of understanding permit to say that there must be wide difference between established form of ceremony amongst laity regulate clergy for give leave to observe consider clerical office a equal in point of dignity with highest rank in kingdom provided that proper humility of behaviour be at same time maintained must therefore allow to follow dictate of conscience on occasion lead to perform what look on a point of duty pardon for neglecting to profit by advice on other subject will be constant guide though in case before consider more fitted by education habitual study to decide on what be right than young lady like with low bow left to attack mr darcy whose reception of advance eagerly watched whose astonishment at being so addressed be very evident cousin prefaced speech with solemn bow though must not hear word of felt a if hearing saw in motion of lip word apology hunsford lady catherine de bourgh vexed to see expose to man mr darcy be eyeing with unrestrained wonder when at last mr collins allowed time to speak replied with air of distant civility mr collins however be not discouraged from speaking again mr darcy contempt seemed abundantly increasing with length of second speech at end of only made slight bow moved way mr collins then returned to elizabeth have reason assure said to be dissatisfied with reception mr darcy seemed much pleased with attention answered with utmost civility even paid compliment of saying that be so well convinced of lady catherine discernment a to be certain must never bestow favour unworthily be really very handsome thought upon whole be much pleased with a elizabeth have longer interest of own to pursue turned attention almost entirely on sister mr bingley train of agreeable reflection observation gave birth to made perhaps almost a happy a jane saw in idea settled in very house in felicity marriage of true affection must bestow felt capable under such circumstance of endeavouring even to like bingley two sister mother thought plainly saw be bent same way determined not to venture near lest might hear too much when sat down to supper therefore considered most unlucky perverseness placed within one of other deeply be vexed to find that mother be talking to one person lady lucas freely openly of nothing else expectation that jane must soon be married to mr bingley be animating subject mr bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating advantage of match being such charming young man so rich living three mile from be first point of self gratulation then be such comfort to think how fond two sister be of jane to be certain that must desire connection a much a must do be moreover such promising thing for younger daughter a jane marrying so greatly must throw in way of other rich men lastly be so pleasant at time of life to be able to consign single daughter to care of sister that might not be obliged to go into company more than liked be necessary to make circumstance matter of pleasure because on such occasion be etiquette one be le likely than mr bennet to find comfort in staying home at period of life concluded with many good wish lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate though evidently triumphantly believing there be chance of in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check rapidity of mother word persuade to describe felicity in le audible whisper for to inexpressible vexation must perceive that chief of be overheard by

speech be afraid anxiety have done no good others of party be now applied to if said mr collins be so fortunate a to be able to sing must have great pleasure be sure in obliging company with air for consider music a very innocent diversion perfectly compatible with profession of clergyman mean however to assert that can be justified in devoting too much of time to music for there be certainly

intolerable rest of evening brought little amusement be teased by mr collins who continued most perseveringly by side though must not prevail on to dance with again put out of power to dance with others in vain did entreat to stand up with somebody else offer to introduce to young lady in room assured that a to dancing be perfectly indifferent to that chief object be by delicate attention to recommend to that must therefore make point of remaining close to whole evening there be arguing upon project owed greatest relief to friend miss lucas who often joined good naturedly engaged mr collins conversation to herself be at least free from offense of mr darcy further notice though often standing within very short distance of quite disengaged never came near enough to speak felt to be probable consequence of allusion to mr wickham rejoiced in longbourn party be last of company to depart by manoeuvre of mr bennet have to wait for carriage quarter of hour after everybody else be gone gave time to see how heartily be wished away by of family mr hurst sister scarcely opened mouth except to complain of fatigue be evidently impatient to have house to repulsed attempt of mr bennet at conversation by so doing threw languor over whole party be very little relieved by long speech of mr collins who be complimenting mr bingley sister on elegance of entertainment hospitality politeness have marked behaviour to guest darcy said nothing at mr bennet in equal silence be enjoying scene mr bingley jane be standing together little detached from rest talked only to other elizabeth preserved a steady silence a mr hurst miss bingley even lydia be too much fatigued to utter more than occasional exclamation of lord how tired be accompanied by violent yawn when at length arose to take leave mr bennet be most pressingly civil in hope of seeing whole family soon at longbourn addressed especially to mr bingley to assure how happy must make by eating family dinner with at time without ceremony of formal invitation bingley be grateful pleasure readily engaged for taking earliest opportunity of waiting on after return from london whither be obliged to go next day for short time mr bennet be perfectly satisfied quitted house under delightful persuasion that allowing for necessary preparation of settlement new carriage wedding clothes must undoubtedly see daughter settled at netherfield in course of three four month of having daughter married to mr collins thought with equal certainty with considerable though not equal pleasure elizabeth be least dear to of child though man match be quite good enough for worth of be eclipsed by mr bingley netherfield chapter next day opened new scene at longbourn mr collins made declaration in form having resolved to do without loss of time a leave of absence extended only to following saturday having feeling of diffidence to make distressing to even at moment set about in very orderly manner with observance supposed regular part of business on finding mr bennet elizabeth one of younger girl together soon after breakfast addressed mother in word may hope madam for interest with fair daughter elizabeth when solicit for honour of private audience with in course of morning before elizabeth have time for anything blush of surprise mr bennet answered instantly oh dear yes certainly be sure lizzy will be very happy be sure can have objection come kitty want upstairs gathering work together be hastening away when elizabeth called out dear madam go beg will not go mr collins must excuse can have nothing to say to that anybody need not hear be going away nonsense lizzy desire to stay where be upon elizabeth seeming really with vexed embarrassed look about to escape added lizzy insist upon staying hearing mr collins elizabeth must not oppose such injunction moment consideration making also sensible that must be wisest to get over a soon a quietly a possible sat down again tried to conceal by incessant employment feeling be divided between distress diversion mr bennet kitty walked off a soon a be gone mr collins began believe dear miss elizabeth that modesty so far from doing disservice rather add to other perfection must have be le amiable in eye have there not be little unwillingness allow to assure have respected mother permission for address can hardly doubt purport of discourse however natural delicacy may lead to dissemble attention have be too marked to be mistaken almost a soon a entered house singled out a companion of future life before be run away with by feeling on subject perhaps must be advisable for to state reason for marrying moreover for coming into hertfordshire with design of selecting wife a certainly did idea of mr collins with solemn composure being run away with by feeling made elizabeth so near laughing that must not use short pause allowed in attempt to stop further continued reason for marrying be first that think right thing for clergyman in easy circumstance like to set example of matrimony in parish secondly that be convinced that will add very greatly to happiness thirdly perhaps ought to have mentioned earlier that be particular advice recommendation of very noble lady whom have honour of calling patroness twice have condescended to give opinion unasked too on subject be very saturday night before left hunsford between pool at quadrille while mr jenkinson be arranging miss de bourgh footstool that said collins must marry clergyman like must marry choose properly choose gentlewoman for sake for own let be active useful sort of person not brought up high able to make small income go good way be advice find such woman a soon a can bring to hunsford will visit allow by way to observe fair cousin reckon notice kindness of lady catherine de bourgh a among least of advantage in power to offer will find manner beyond anything can describe wit vivacity think must be acceptable to especially when tempered with silence respect rank will inevitably excite thus much for general intention in favour of matrimony remains to be told why view be directed towards longbourn instead of own neighbourhood where can assure there be many amiable young woman fact be being a be to inherit estate after death of honoured father who however may live many year longer must not satisfy without resolving to choose wife from among daughter that loss to might be a little a possible when melancholy event take place however a have already said may not be for several year have be motive fair cousin flatter will not sink in esteem now nothing remains for to assure in most animated language of violence of affection to fortune be perfectly indifferent will make demand of nature on father since be well aware that must not be complied with that one thousand pound in four per cent will not be yours till after mother decease be that may ever be entitled to on head therefore will be uniformly silent may assure that ungenerous reproach will ever pas lip when be married be absolutely necessary to interrupt now be too hasty sir cried forget have made answer let do without further loss of time accept thanks for compliment be paying be very sensible of honour of proposal be impossible for to do otherwise than to decline be not now to learn replied mr collins with formal wave of hand that be usual with young lady to reject address of man whom secretly mean to accept when first applies for favour that sometimes refusal be repeated second even third time be therefore by mean discouraged by what have just said will hope to lead to altar ere long upon word sir cried elizabeth hope be rather extraordinary one after declaration do assure that be not one of young lady if such young lady there be who be so daring a to risk happiness on chance of being asked second time be perfectly serious in refusal must not make happy be convinced that be last woman in world who must make so nay be friend lady catherine to know be persuaded must find in respect ill qualified for situation be certain that lady catherine must think so said mr collins very gravely can not imagine that ladyship must at disapprove of may be certain when have honour of seeing again will speak in very highest term of modesty economy other amiable qualification indeed mr collins praise of will be unnecessary must give leave to judge for pay compliment of believing what say wish very happy very rich by refusing hand do in power to prevent being otherwise in making offer must have satisfied delicacy of feeling with regard to family may take possession of longbourn estate whenever fall without self reproach matter may be considered therefore a finally settled rising a thus spoke must have quitted room have mr collins not thus addressed when do honour of speaking to next on subject will hope to receive more favourable answer than have now given though be far from accusing of cruelty at present because know to be established custom of sex to reject man on first application perhaps have even now said a much to encourage suit a must be consistent with true delicacy of female character really mr collins cried elizabeth with warmth puzzle exceedingly if what have hitherto said can appear to in form of encouragement know not how to express refusal in such way a to convince of being one must give leave to flatter dear cousin that refusal of address be merely word of course reason for believing be briefly doe not appear to that hand be unworthy acceptance that establishment can offer must be other than highly desirable situation in life connection with family of de bourgh relationship to own be circumstance highly in favour must take into further consideration that in spite of manifold attraction be by mean certain that offer of marriage may ever be made portion be unhappily so small that will in likelihood undo effect of loveliness amiable qualification a must therefore conclude that be not serious in rejection of will choose to attribute to wish of increasing love by suspense according to usual practice of elegant female do assure sir have pretension to kind of elegance consists in tormenting respectable man must rather be paid compliment of being believed sincere thank again again for honour have done in proposal to accept be absolutely impossible feeling in respect forbid can speak plainer consider now a elegant female intending to plague a rational creature speaking truth from heart be uniformly charming cried with air of awkward gallantry be persuaded that when sanctioned by express authority of excellent parent proposal will not fail of being acceptable to such perseverance in wilful self deception elizabeth must make reply immediately in silence withdrew determined if persisted in considering repeated refusal a flattering encouragement to apply to father whose negative might be uttered in such manner a to be decisive whose behavior at least must not be mistaken for affectation coquetry of elegant female chapter mr collins be not left long to silent contemplation of successful love for mr bennet having dawdled about in vestibule to watch for end of conference sooner saw elizabeth open door with quick step pas towards staircase than entered breakfast room congratulated in warm term on happy prospect nearer connection mr collins received returned felicitation with equal pleasure then proceeded to relate particular of interview with result of trusted have reason to be satisfied since refusal cousin have steadfastly given must naturally flow from bashful modesty genuine delicacy of character information however startled mr bennet must have be glad to be equally satisfied that daughter have meant to encourage by protesting against proposal dared not believe must not help saying so depend upon mr collins added that lizzy will be brought to reason will speak to about directly be very headstrong foolish girl doe not know own interest will make know pardon for interrupting madam cried mr collins if be really headstrong foolish know not whether must altogether be very desirable wife to man in situation who naturally look for happiness in marriage state if therefore actually persists in rejecting suit perhaps be better not to force into accepting because if liable to such defect of temper must not contribute much to felicity sir quite misunderstand said mr bennet alarmed lizzy be only headstrong in such matter a in everything else be a good natured girl a ever lived will go directly to mr bennet will very soon settle with be sure must not give time to reply hurrying instantly to husband called out a entered library oh mr bennet be wanted immediately be in uproar must come make lizzy marry mr collins for vow will not have if make haste will change mind not have mr bennet raised eye from book a entered fixed on face with calm unconcern be not in least altered by communication have not pleasure of understanding said when have finished speech of what be talking of mr collins lizzy lizzy declares will not have mr collins mr collins begin to say that will not have lizzy what be to do on occasion seems hopeless business speak to lizzy about tell that insist upon marrying let be called down will hear opinion mr bennet rang bell miss elizabeth be summoned to library come here child cried father a appeared have sent for on affair of importance understand mr collins have made offer of marriage be true elizabeth replied that be very well offer of marriage have refused have sir very well now come to point mother insists upon accepting be not so mr bennet yes will never see again unhappy alternative be before elizabeth from day must be stranger to one of parent mother will never see again if marry mr collins will never see again if do elizabeth must not smile at conclusion of such beginning mr bennet who have persuaded herself that husband regarded affair a wished be excessively disappointed what do mean mr bennet in talking way promised to insist upon marrying dear replied husband have two small favour to request first that will allow free use of understanding on present occasion secondly of room will be glad to have library to myself a soon a may be not yet however in spite of disappointment in husband did mr bennet give up point talked to elizabeth again again coaxed threatened by turn endeavoured to secure jane in interest jane with possible mildness declined interfering elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness sometimes with playful gaiety replied to attack though manner varied however determination never did mr collins meanwhile be meditating in solitude on what have passed thought too well of to comprehend on motif cousin must refuse though pride be hurt suffered in other way regard for be quite imaginary possibility of deserving mother reproach prevented feeling regret while family be in confusion charlotte lucas came to spend day with be met in vestibule by lydia who flying to cried in half whisper be glad be come for there be such fun here what do think have happened morning mr collins have made offer to lizzy will not have charlotte hardly have time to answer before be joined by kitty who came to tell same news sooner have entered breakfast room where mr bennet be alone than likewise began on subject calling on miss lucas for compassion entreating to persuade friend lizzy to comply with wish of family pray do dear miss lucas added in melancholy tone for nobody be on side nobody take part with be cruelly used nobody feel for poor nerve charlotte reply be spared by entrance of jane elizabeth aye there come continued mr bennet looking a unconcerned a may be caring more for than if be at york provided can have own way tell miss lizzy if take into head to go on refusing offer of marriage in way will never get husband at be sure know who be to maintain when father be dead will not be able to keep so warn have done with from very day told in

complaint can have great inclination for talking nobody can tell what suffer be always so who complain be never pitied daughter listened in silence to effusion sensible that attempt to reason with soothe must only increase irritation talked on therefore without interruption from of till be joined by mr collins who entered room with air more stately than usual on perceiving whom said to girl now do insist upon that of hold tongue let mr collins have little conversation together elizabeth passed quietly out of room jane kitty followed lydia stood ground determined to hear must charlotte detained first by civility of mr collins whose inquiry after family be very minute then by little curiosity satisfied with walking to window pretending not to hear in doleful voice mr bennet began projected conversation oh mr collins dear madam replied let be for ever silent on point far be from presently continued in voice marked displeasure to resent behaviour of daughter resignation to inevitable evil be evil duty of peculiar duty of young man who have be so fortunate a have be in early preferment trust be resigned perhaps not le so from feeling doubt of positive happiness have fair cousin honoured with hand for have often observed that resignation be never so perfect a when blessing denied begin to lose somewhat of value in estimation will not hope consider a showing disrespect to family dear madam by thus withdrawing pretension to daughter favour without having paid mr bennet compliment of requesting to interpose authority in behalf conduct may fear be objectionable in having accepted dismission from daughter lip instead of own be liable to error have certainly meant well through whole affair object have be to secure amiable companion for myself with due consideration for advantage of family if manner have be at reprehensible here beg leave to apologise chapter discussion of mr collins offer be now nearly at end elizabeth have only to suffer from uncomfortable feeling necessarily attending occasionally from peevish allusion of mother a for gentleman feeling be chiefly expressed not by embarrassment dejection by trying to avoid by stiffness of

elizabeth listened with insensibility of distrust though suddenness of removal surprised saw nothing in really to lament be not to be supposed that absence from netherfield must prevent mr bingley being there a to loss of society be persuaded that jane must cease to regard in enjoyment of be unlucky said after short pause that must not be able to see friend before leave country may not hope

a possible what felt on subject have soon pleasure of seeing happy effect jane temper be not desponding be gradually led to hope though diffidence of affection sometimes overcame hope that bingley

feeling almost secure with reason for charlotte have be tolerably encouraging be comparatively diffident since adventure of wednesday reception however be of most flattering kind miss lucas perceived from upper window a walked towards house instantly set out to meet accidentally in lane little have dared to hope that so much love eloquence awaited there in a short time a mr collins long speech must allow everything be settled between to satisfaction of a entered house earnestly entreated to name day be to make happiest of men though such solicitation must be waived for present lady felt inclination to trifle with happiness stupidity with be favoured by nature must guard courtship from charm must make woman wish for continuance miss lucas who accepted solely from pure disinterested desire of establishment cared not how soon establishment be gained sir william lady lucas be speedily applied to for consent be bestowed with most joyful alacrity mr collins present circumstance made most eligible match for daughter to whom must give little fortune prospect of future wealth be exceedingly fair lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than matter have ever excited before how many year longer mr bennet be likely to live sir william gave a decided opinion that whenever mr collins must be in possession of longbourn estate must be highly expedient that wife must make appearance at st james whole family in short be properly overjoyed on occasion younger girl formed hope of coming out year two sooner than might otherwise have done boy be relieved from apprehension of charlotte dying old maid charlotte be tolerably composed have gained point have time to consider of reflection be in general satisfactory mr collins to be sure be sensible agreeable

least agreeable circumstance in business be surprise must occasion to elizabeth bennet whose friendship valued beyond of other person elizabeth must wonder probably must blame though resolution be not to be shaken feeling must be hurt by disapprobation resolved to give information therefore charged mr collins when returned to longbourn to dinner to drop hint of what have passed before of family promise of secrecy be of course very dutifully given must not be kept without difficulty for curiosity excited by long absence burst forth in such very direct question on return a required ingenuity to evade be at same time exercising great self denial for be longing to publish prosperous love a be to begin journey too early on morrow to see of family ceremony of leave taking be performed when lady moved for night mr bennet with great politeness cordiality said how happy must be to see at longbourn again whenever engagement might allow to visit dear madam replied invitation be particularly gratifying because be what have be hoping to receive may be very certain that will avail of a soon a possible be astonished mr bennet who must by mean wish for so speedy return immediately said be

from letter of thanks for for other mark of regard during stay in hertfordshire a for fair cousin though absence may not be long enough to render necessary will now take liberty of wishing health

one of younger girl mary might have be prevailed on to accept rated ability much higher than of others there be solidity in reflection often struck though by mean so clever a thought that if encouraged to read improve by example a hers might become very agreeable companion on following morning hope of kind be done away miss lucas called soon after breakfast in private conference with elizabeth related event of day before possibility of mr collins fancying in love with friend have once occurred to elizabeth within last day two that charlotte must encourage seemed almost a far from possibility a must encourage astonishment be consequently so great a to overcome at first bound of decorum must not help cry out engaged to mr collins dear charlotte impossible steady countenance miss lucas have commanded in telling story gave way to momentary confusion here on receiving so direct reproach though a be no more than expected soon regained composure calmly replied why must be surprised dear eliza do think incredible that mr collins must be able to procure woman good opinion because be not so happy a to succeed with elizabeth have now recollected herself making strong effort for be able to assure with tolerable firmness that prospect of relationship be highly grateful to that wished imaginable happiness see what be feeling replied charlotte must be surprised very

considering mr collins character connection situation in life be convinced that chance of happiness with be a fair a most people can boast on entering marriage state elizabeth quietly answered undoubtedly after awkward pause returned to rest of family charlotte did not stay much longer elizabeth be then left to reflect on what have heard be long time before became at reconciled to idea of so unsuitable match strangeness of mr collins making two offer of marriage within three day be nothing in comparison of being now accepted have always felt that charlotte opinion of matrimony be not exactly like own have not supposed to be possible that when called into action must have sacrificed better feeling to worldly advantage charlotte wife of mr collins be most humiliating picture to pang of friend disgracing sunk in esteem be added distressing conviction that be impossible for friend to be tolerably happy in lot have chosen chapter elizabeth be sitting with mother sister reflecting on what have heard doubting whether be authorised to mention when sir william lucas appeared sent by daughter to announce engagement to family with many compliment to much self gratulation on prospect of connection between house unfolded matter to audience not merely wondering incredulous for mr bennet with more perseverance than politeness protested must be entirely mistaken lydia always unguarded often uncivil boisterously exclaimed good lord sir william how can tell story know that mr collins want to marry lizzy nothing le than complaisance of courtier must have borne without anger such treatment sir william good breeding carried through though begged leave to be positive a to truth of information listened to impertinence with most forbearing courtesy elizabeth feeling incumbent on to relieve from so unpleasant situation now put forward to confirm account by mentioning prior knowledge of from charlotte endeavoured to put stop to exclamation of mother sister by earnestness of congratulation to sir william in be readily joined by jane by making variety of remark on happiness might be expected from match excellent character of mr collins convenient distance of hunsford from london mr bennet be in fact too much overpowered to say great deal while sir william remained sooner have left than feeling found rapid vent in first place persisted in disbelieving whole of matter secondly be very sure that mr collins have be taken in thirdly trusted that must never be happy together fourthly that match might be broken off two inference however be plainly deduced from whole one

emotion be much more tranquil on occasion such a did experience pronounced to be of most agreeable sort for gratified said to discover charlotte lucas whom have be used to think tolerably sensible be a foolish a wife more foolish than daughter jane confessed little surprised at match said le of astonishment than of earnest desire for happiness must elizabeth persuade to consider a improbable kitty lydia be far from envying miss lucas for mr collins be only clergyman affected in other way than a piece of news to spread at meryton lady lucas must not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mr bennet comfort of having daughter well married called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy be though mr bennet sour look ill natured remark might have be enough to drive happiness away between elizabeth charlotte there be restraint kept mutually silent on subject elizabeth felt persuaded that real confidence must ever subsist between again disappointment in

strange that must come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge be also very inconvenient exceedingly troublesome hated having visitor in house while health be so indifferent lover be of people most disagreeable such be gentle murmur of mr bennet gave way only to greater distress of mr bingley continued absence jane elizabeth be comfortable on subject day after day passed away without bringing other tidings of than report shortly prevailed in meryton of coming no more to netherfield whole winter report highly incensed mr bennet never failed to contradict a most scandalous falsehood even

certainty in elizabeth affected to place point a well a still more interesting one of bingley being withheld from seeing jane felt solicitude on subject convinced on examination that did not consider entirely hopeless be possible sometimes thought probable that affection might be reanimated influence of friend successfully combated by more natural influence of jane attraction miss bennet accepted aunt invitation with pleasure bingleys be otherwise in thought at same time than a hoped by caroline not living in same house with brother might occasionally spend morning with without danger of seeing gardiner stayed week at longbourn what with phillipses lucas officer there be not day without engagement mr bennet have so carefully provided for entertainment of brother sister that did not once sit down to family dinner when engagement be for home of officer always made part of of officer mr wickham be sure to be one on occasion mr gardiner rendered suspicious by elizabeth warm commendation narrowly observed without supposing from what saw to be very seriously in love preference of other be plain enough to make little uneasy resolved to speak to elizabeth on subject before left hertfordshire represent to imprudence of encouraging such attachment to mr gardiner wickham have one mean of affording pleasure unconnected with general power about ten dozen year ago before marriage have spent considerable time in very part of derbyshire to belonged have therefore many acquaintance in common though wickham have be little there since death of darcy father be yet in power to give fresher intelligence of former friend than have be in way of procuring mr gardiner have seen pemberley known late mr darcy by character perfectly well here consequently be inexhaustible subject of discourse in comparing recollection of pemberley with minute description wickham must give in bestowing tribute of praise on character of late possessor be delighting on being made

conversation with charlotte be scarcely ever prevailed upon to get out very few day passed in mr collins did not walk to rosings not many in wife did not think necessary to go likewise till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family living to be disposed of must not understand sacrifice of so many hour now then be honoured with call from ladyship nothing escaped observation be passing in room during visit examined into employment looked at work advised to do differently found fault with arrangement of furniture detected housemaid in negligence if accepted refreshment seemed to do only for sake of finding out that mr collins joint of meat be too large for family elizabeth soon perceived that though great lady be not in commission of peace of county be most active magistrate in own parish minutest concern of be carried to by mr collins whenever of cottager be disposed to be quarrelsome discontented too poor sallied forth into village to settle difference silence complaint scold into harmony plenty entertainment of dining at rosings be repeated about twice week allowing for loss of sir william there being only one card table in evening such entertainment be counterpart of first other engagement be few a style of living in neighbourhood in general be beyond mr collins reach however be evil to elizabeth upon whole spent time comfortably enough there be half hour of pleasant conversation with charlotte weather be so fine for time of year that have often great enjoyment out of door favourite walk where frequently went while others be calling on lady catherine be along open grove edged that side of park where there be nice sheltered path one seemed to value where felt beyond reach of lady catherine curiosity in quiet way first fortnight of visit soon passed away easter be approaching week preceding be to bring addition to family at rosings in so small circle must be important elizabeth have heard soon after arrival that mr darcy be expected there in course of few week though there be not many of acquaintance whom did not prefer coming must furnish one comparatively new to look at in rosings party might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley design on be by behaviour to cousin for whom be evidently destined by lady catherine who talked of coming with greatest satisfaction spoke of in term of highest admiration seemed almost angry to find that have already be frequently seen by miss lucas arrival be soon known at parsonage for mr collins be walking whole morning within view of lodge opening into hunsford lane in order to have

time to disclaim right to compliment before approach be announced by door bell shortly afterwards three gentleman entered room colonel fitzwilliam who led way be about thirty not handsome in person address most truly gentleman mr darcy looked just a have be used to look in hertfordshire paid compliment with usual reserve to mr collins might be feeling toward friend met with appearance of composure elizabeth merely curtseyed to without saying word colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with readiness ease of well bred man talked very pleasantly cousin after having addressed slight observation on house garden to mr collins sat for time without speaking to anybody at length however civility be so far awakened a to inquire of elizabeth after health of family answered in usual way after moment pause added eldest sister have be in town three month have never happened to see there be perfectly sensible that never have wished to see whether must betray consciousness of what have passed between bingleys jane thought looked little confused a answered that have never be so fortunate a to meet miss bennet subject be pursued farther gentleman soon afterwards went away chapter colonel fitzwilliam manner be very much admired at parsonage lady felt that must add considerably to pleasure of engagement at rosings be day however before received invitation thither for while there be visitor in house must not be necessary be not till easter day almost week after gentleman arrival that be honoured by such attention then be merely asked on leaving church to come there in evening for last week have seen very little of lady catherine daughter colonel fitzwilliam have called at parsonage more than once during time mr darcy have seen only at church invitation be accepted of course at proper hour joined party in lady catherine drawing room ladyship received civilly be plain that company be by mean so acceptable a when must get nobody else be in fact almost engrossed by nephew speaking to especially to darcy much more than to other person in room colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see anything be welcome relief to at rosings mr collins pretty friend have moreover caught fancy very much now seated by talked so agreeably of kent hertfordshire of travelling staying at home of new book music that elizabeth have never be half so well entertained in room before conversed with so much spirit flow a to draw attention of lady catherine a well a of mr darcy eye have be soon repeatedly turned towards with look of curiosity that ladyship after while shared feeling be more openly acknowledged for did not scruple to call out what be that be saying fitzwilliam what be be talking of what be telling miss bennet let hear what be be speaking of music madam said when no longer able to avoid reply of music then pray speak aloud be of subject delight must have share in conversation if be speaking of music there be few people in england suppose who have more true enjoyment of music than better natural taste if have ever learnt must have be great proficient so must anne if health have allowed to apply be confident that must have performed delightfully how doe georgiana get on darcy mr darcy spoke with affectionate praise of sister proficiency be very glad to hear such good account of said lady catherine pray tell from that can not expect to excel if doe not practice good deal assure madam replied that doe not need such advice practises very constantly so much better can not be done too much when next write to will charge not to neglect on account often tell young lady that excellence in music be to be acquired without constant practice have told miss bennet several time that will never play really well unless practises more though mr collins have instrument be very welcome a have often told to come to rosings day play on pianoforte in mr jenkinson room must be in nobody way know in part of house mr darcy looked little ashamed of aunt ill breeding made answer when coffee be over colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to sat down directly to instrument drew chair near lady catherine listened to half song then talked a before to other nephew till latter walked away from making with usual deliberation towards pianoforte stationed so a to command full view of fair performer countenance elizabeth saw what be doing at first convenient pause turned to with arch smile said mean to frighten mr darcy by coming in state to hear will not be alarmed though sister doe play so well there be stubbornness about that never can bear to be frightened at will of others courage always rise at attempt to intimidate will not say be mistaken replied because must not really believe to entertain design of alarming have have pleasure of acquaintance long enough to know that find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinion in fact be not own elizabeth laughed heartily at picture of herself said to colonel fitzwilliam cousin will give very pretty notion of teach not to believe word say be particularly unlucky in meeting with person so able to expose real character in part of world where have hoped to pas off with degree of credit indeed mr darcy be very ungenerous in to mention that knew to disadvantage in hertfordshire give leave to say very impolitic too for be provoking to retaliate such thing may come out a will shock relation to hear be not afraid of said smilingly pray let hear what have to accuse of cried colonel fitzwilliam must like to know how behaves among stranger will hear then prepare for something very dreadful first time of ever seeing in hertfordshire must know be at ball at ball what do think did danced only four dance though gentleman be scarce to certain knowledge more than one young lady be sitting down in want of partner mr darcy can not deny fact have not at time honour of knowing lady in assembly beyond own party true nobody can ever be introduced in ball room well colonel fitzwilliam what do play next finger wait order perhaps said darcy must have judged better have sought introduction be ill qualified to recommend to stranger will ask cousin reason of said elizabeth still addressing colonel fitzwilliam will ask why man of sense education who have lived in world be ill qualified to recommend to stranger can answer question said fitzwilliam without applying to be because will not give trouble certainly have not talent people posse said darcy of conversing easily with have never seen before can not catch tone of conversation appear interested in concern a often see done finger said elizabeth move over instrument in masterly manner see so many woman do have not same force rapidity produce same expression then have always supposed to be own fault because will not take trouble of practising be not that believe finger a capable a other woman of superior execution darcy smiled said be perfectly right have employed time much better one admitted to privilege of hearing can think anything wanting of perform to stranger here be interrupted by lady catherine who called out to know what be talking of elizabeth immediately began playing again lady catherine approached after listening for few minute said to darcy miss bennet must not play at amiss if practised more must have advantage of london master have very good notion of fingering though taste be not equal to anne anne must have be delightful performer have health allowed to learn elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially assented to cousin praise at moment at other must discern symptom of love from whole of behaviour to miss de bourgh derived comfort for miss bingley that might have be just a likely to marry have be relation lady catherine continued remark on elizabeth performance mixing with many instruction on execution taste elizabeth received with forbearance of civility at request of gentleman remained at instrument till ladyship carriage be ready to take home chapter elizabeth be sitting by next morning writing to jane while mr collins maria be gone on business into village when be startled by ring at door certain signal of visitor a have heard carriage thought not unlikely to be lady catherine under apprehension be putting away half finished letter that might escape impertinent question when door opened to very great surprise mr darcy mr darcy only entered room seemed astonished too on finding alone apologised for intrusion by letting know that have understood lady be to be within then sat down when inquiry after rosings be made seemed in danger of sinking into total silence be absolutely necessary therefore to think of something in emergence recollecting when have seen last in hertfordshire feeling curious to know what must say on subject of hasty departure observed how very suddenly quitted netherfield last november mr darcy must have be most agreeable surprise to mr bingley to see after so soon for if recollect right went day before sister be well hope when left perfectly so thank found that be to receive other answer after short pause added think have understood that mr bingley have not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again have never heard say so be probable that may spend very little of time there in future have many friend be at time of life when friend engagement be continually increasing if mean to be little at netherfield must be better for neighbourhood that must give up place entirely for then might possibly get settled family there perhaps mr bingley did not take house so much for convenience of neighbourhood a for own must expect to keep quit on same principle must not be surprised said darcy if be to give up a soon a eligible purchase offer elizabeth made answer be afraid of talking longer of friend having nothing else to say be now determined to leave trouble of finding subject to took hint soon began with seems very comfortable house lady catherine believe did great deal to when mr collins first came to hunsford believe did be sure must not have bestowed kindness on more grateful object mr collins appears to be very fortunate in choice of wife yes indeed friend may well rejoice in having met with one of very few sensible woman who must have accepted have made happy if have friend have excellent understanding though be not certain that consider marrying mr collins a wisest thing ever did seems perfectly happy however in prudential light be certainly very good match for must be very agreeable for to be settled within so easy distance of own family friend easy distance do call be nearly fifty mile what be fifty mile of good road little more than day journey yes call very easy distance must never have considered distance a one of advantage of match cried elizabeth must never have said mr collins be settled near family be proof of own attachment to hertfordshire anything beyond very neighbourhood of longbourn suppose must appear far a spoke there be sort of smile elizabeth fancied understood must be supposing to be thinking of jane netherfield blushed a answered mean to say that woman may not be settled too near family far near must be relative depend on many varying circumstance where there be fortune to make expense of travelling unimportant distance becomes evil be not case here mr mr collins have comfortable income not one a will allow of frequent journey be persuaded friend must not call near family under le than present distance mr darcy drew chair little towards said can not have right to such very strong local attachment can not have be always at longbourn elizabeth looked surprised gentleman experienced change of feeling drew back chair took newspaper from table glancing over said in colder voice be pleased with kent short dialogue on subject of country ensued on side calm concise soon put end to by entrance of charlotte sister just returned from walk tete tete surprised mr darcy related mistake have occasioned intruding on miss bennet after sitting few minute longer without saying much to anybody went away what can be meaning of said charlotte a soon a be gone dear eliza must be in love with must never have called in familiar way when elizabeth told of silence did not seem very likely even to charlotte wish to be case after various conjecture must at last only suppose visit to proceed from difficulty of finding anything to do be more probable from time of year field sport be over within door there be lady catherine book billiard table gentleman can not always be within door in nearness of parsonage pleasantness of walk to of people who lived in two cousin found temptation from period of walking thither almost day called at various time of morning sometimes separately sometimes together now then accompanied by aunt be plain to colonel fitzwilliam came because have pleasure in society persuasion of course recommended still more elizabeth be reminded by own satisfaction in being with a well a by evident admiration of her of former favourite george wickham though in comparing saw there be le captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam manner believed might have best informed mind why mr darcy came so often to parsonage be more difficult to understand must not be for society a frequently sat there ten minute together without opening lip when did speak seemed effect of necessity rather than of choice sacrifice to propriety not pleasure to seldom appeared really animated mr collins knew not what to make of colonel fitzwilliam occasionally laughing at stupidity proved that be generally different own knowledge of must not have told a must liked to have believed change effect of love object of love friend eliza set seriously to work to find out watched whenever be at rosings whenever came to hunsford without much success certainly looked at friend great deal expression of look be disputable be earnest steadfast gaze often doubted whether there be much admiration in sometimes seemed nothing absence of mind have once twice suggested to elizabeth possibility of being partial to elizabeth always laughed at idea mr collins did not think right to press subject from danger of raising expectation might only end in disappointment for in opinion admitted not of doubt that friend dislike must vanish if must suppose to be in power in kind scheme for elizabeth sometimes planned marrying colonel fitzwilliam be beyond comparison most pleasant man certainly admired situation in life be most eligible to counterbalance advantage mr darcy have considerable patronage in church cousin must have none at chapter more than once did elizabeth in ramble within park unexpectedly meet mr darcy felt perverseness of mischance must bring where one else be brought to prevent ever happening again took care to inform at first that be favourite haunt of hers how must occur second time therefore be very odd did even third seemed like wilful ill nature voluntary penance for on occasion be not merely few formal inquiry awkward pause then away actually thought necessary to turn back walk with never said great deal did give trouble of talking of listening much struck in course of third rencontre that be asking odd unconnected question about pleasure in being at hunsford love of solitary walk opinion of mr mr collins happiness that in speaking of rosings not perfectly understanding house seemed to expect that whenever came into kent again must be staying there too word seemed to imply must have colonel fitzwilliam in thought supposed if meant anything must mean allusion to what might arise in quarter distressed little be quite glad to find at gate in pale opposite parsonage be engaged one day a walked in perusing jane last letter dwelling on passage proved that jane have not written in spirit when instead of being again surprised by mr darcy saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam be meeting putting away letter immediately forcing smile said did not know before ever walked way have be making tour of park replied a generally do year intend to close with call at parsonage be going much farther must have turned in moment accordingly did turn walked towards parsonage together do certainly leave kent on saturday said yes if darcy doe not put off again be at disposal arranges business just a plea if not able to please in arrangement have at least pleasure in great power of choice know anybody who seems more to enjoy power of doing what like than mr darcy like to have own way very well replied colonel fitzwilliam so do be only that have better mean of having than many others because be rich many others be poor speak feelingly younger son know must be inured to self denial dependence in opinion younger son of earl can know very little of now seriously what have ever known of self denial dependence when have be prevented by want of money from going wherever chose procuring anything have fancy for be home question perhaps can not say have experienced many hardship of nature in matter of greater weight may suffer from want of money younger son can not marry where like unless where like woman of fortune think very often do habit of expense make too dependent there be not many in rank of life who can afford to marry without attention to money be thought elizabeth meant for coloured at idea recovering said in lively tone pray what be usual price of earl younger son unless elder brother be very sickly suppose must not ask above fifty thousand pound answered in same style subject dropped to interrupt silence might make fancy affected with what have passed soon afterwards said imagine cousin brought down with chiefly for sake of having someone at disposal wonder doe not marry to secure lasting convenience of kind perhaps sister doe a well for present a be under sole care may do what like with said colonel fitzwilliam be advantage must divide with be joined with in guardianship of miss darcy be indeed pray what sort of guardian do make doe charge give much trouble young lady of age be sometimes little difficult to manage if have true darcy spirit may like to have own way a spoke observed looking at earnestly manner in immediately asked why supposed miss darcy likely to give uneasiness convinced that have somehow other got pretty near truth directly replied need not be frightened never heard harm of dare say be one of most tractable creature in world be very great favourite with lady of acquaintance mr hurst miss bingley think have heard say that know know little brother be pleasant gentlemanlike man be great friend of darcy oh yes said elizabeth drily mr darcy be uncommonly kind to mr bingley take prodigious deal of care of care of yes really believe darcy doe take care of in point where most want care from something that told in journey hither have reason to think bingley very much indebted to ought to beg pardon for have right to suppose that bingley be person meant be conjecture what be mean be circumstance darcy must not wish to be generally known because if be to get round to lady family must be unpleasant thing may depend upon not mentioning remember have not much reason for supposing to be bingley what told be merely that congratulated on having lately saved friend from inconvenience of most imprudent marriage without mentioning name other particular only suspected to be bingley from believing kind of young man to get into scrape of sort from knowing to have be together whole of last summer did mr darcy give reason for interference understood that there be very strong objection against lady what art did use to separate did not talk to of own art said fitzwilliam smiling only told what have now told elizabeth made answer walked on heart swelling with indignation after watching little fitzwilliam asked why be so thoughtful be thinking of what have be telling said cousin conduct doe not suit feeling why be to be judge be rather disposed to call interference officious see what right mr darcy have to decide on propriety of friend inclination why upon own judgement alone be to determine direct in what manner friend be to be happy continued recollecting a know none of particular be not fair to condemn be not to be supposed that there be much affection in case be not unnatural surmise said fitzwilliam be lessening of honour of cousin triumph very sadly be spoken jestingly appeared to so just picture of mr darcy that must not trust with answer therefore abruptly changing conversation talked on indifferent matter until reached parsonage there shut into own room a soon a visitor left must think without interruption of that have heard be not to be supposed that other people must be meant than with whom be connected there must not exist in world two men over whom mr darcy must have such boundless influence that have be concerned in measure taken to separate bingley jane have never doubted have always attributed to miss bingley principal design arrangement of if own vanity however did not mislead be cause pride caprice be cause of jane have suffered still continued to suffer have ruined for while hope of happiness for most affectionate generous heart in world one must say how lasting evil might have inflicted there be very strong objection against lady be colonel fitzwilliam word strong objection probably be having one uncle who be country attorney who be in business in london to jane exclaimed there must be possibility of objection loveliness goodness a be understanding excellent mind improved manner captivating must anything be urged against father who though with peculiarity have ability mr darcy need not disdain respectability will probably never reach when thought of mother confidence gave way little must not allow that objection there have material weight with mr darcy whose pride be convinced must receive deeper wound from want of importance in friend connection than from want of sense be quite decided at last that have be partly governed by worst kind of pride partly by wish of retaining mr bingley for sister agitation tear subject occasioned brought on headache grew so much worse towards evening added to unwillingness to see mr darcy determined not to attend cousin to rosings where be engaged to drink tea mr collins seeing that be really unwell did not press to go a much a possible prevented husband from pressing mr collins must not conceal apprehension of lady catherine being rather displeased by staying at home chapter when be gone elizabeth a if intending to exasperate a much a possible against mr darcy chose for employment examination of letter jane have written to since being in kent contained actual complaint be there revival of past occurrence communication of present suffering in in almost line of there be want of cheerfulness have be used to characterise style proceeding from serenity of mind at ease with kindly disposed towards everyone have be scarcely ever clouded elizabeth noticed sentence conveying idea of uneasiness with attention have hardly received on first perusal mr darcy shameful boast of what misery have be able to inflict gave keener sense of sister suffering be consolation to think that visit to rosings be to end on day after next still greater that in le than fortnight must be with jane again enabled to contribute to recovery of spirit by affection must do must not think of darcy leaving kent without remembering that cousin be to go with colonel fitzwilliam have made clear that have intention at agreeable a be did not mean to be unhappy about while settling point be suddenly roused by sound of door bell spirit be little fluttered by idea of being colonel fitzwilliam who have once before called late in evening might now come to inquire particularly after idea be soon banished spirit be very differently affected when to utter amazement saw mr darcy walk into room in hurried manner immediately began inquiry after health imputing visit to wish of hearing that be better answered with cold civility sat down for few moment then getting up walked about room elizabeth be surprised said not word after silence of several minute came towards in agitated manner thus began in vain have struggled will not do feeling will not be repressed must allow to tell how ardently admire love elizabeth astonishment be beyond expression stared coloured doubted be silent considered sufficient encouragement avowal of that felt have long felt for immediately followed spoke well there be feeling besides of heart to be detailed be not more eloquent on subject of tenderness than of pride sense of inferiority of being degradation of family obstacle have always opposed to inclination be dwelt on with warmth seemed due to consequence be wounding be very unlikely to recommend suit in spite of deeply rooted dislike must not be insensible to compliment of such man affection though intention did not vary for instant be at first sorry for pain be to receive till roused to resentment by subsequent language lost compassion in anger tried however to compose to answer with patience when must have done concluded with representing to strength of attachment in spite of endeavour have found impossible to conquer with expressing hope that must now be rewarded by acceptance of hand a said must easily see that have doubt of favourable answer spoke of apprehension anxiety countenance expressed real security circumstance must only exasperate farther when ceased colour rose into cheek said in such case a be believe established mode to express sense of obligation for sentiment avowed however unequally may be returned be natural that obligation must be felt if must feel gratitude must now thank can not have never desired good opinion have certainly bestowed most unwillingly be sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone have be most unconsciously done however hope will be of short duration feeling tell have long prevented acknowledgment of regard can have little difficulty in overcoming after explanation mr darcy who be leaning against mantelpiece with eye fixed on face seemed to catch word with le resentment than surprise complexion became pale with anger disturbance of mind be visible in feature be struggling for appearance of composure must not open lip till believed to have attained pause be to elizabeth feeling dreadful at length with voice of forced calmness said be reply be to have honour of expecting might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little endeavour at civility be thus rejected be of small importance might a well inquire replied why with so evident desire of offending insulting chose to tell that liked against will against reason even against character be not excuse for incivility if be uncivil have other provocation know have have not feeling decided against have be indifferent have even be favourable do think that consideration must tempt to accept man who have be mean of ruining perhaps for ever happiness of most beloved sister a pronounced word mr darcy changed colour emotion be short listened without attempting to interrupt while continued have reason in world to think ill of motive can excuse unjust ungenerous part acted there dare not can not deny that have be principal if not only mean of dividing from other of exposing one to censure of world for caprice instability other to derision for disappointed hope involving in misery of acutest kind paused saw with slight indignation that be listening with air proved wholly unmoved by feeling of remorse even looked at with smile of affected incredulity can deny that have done repeated with assumed tranquillity then replied have wish of denying did everything in power to separate friend from sister rejoice in success towards have be kinder than towards elizabeth disdained appearance of noticing civil reflection meaning did not escape be likely to conciliate be not merely affair continued on dislike be founded long before have taken place opinion of be decided character be unfolded in recital received many month ago from mr wickham on subject what can have to say in what imaginary act of friendship can here defend under what misrepresentation can here impose upon others take eager interest in gentleman concern said darcy in le tranquil tone with heightened colour who know what misfortune have be can help feeling interest in misfortune repeated darcy contemptuously yes misfortune have be great indeed of infliction cried elizabeth with energy have reduced to present state of poverty comparative poverty have withheld advantage must know to have be designed for have deprived best year of life of independence be le due than desert have done yet can treat mention of misfortune with contempt ridicule cried darcy a walked with quick step across room be opinion of be estimation in hold thank for explaining so fully fault according to calculation be heavy indeed perhaps added stopping in walk turning towards offense might have be overlooked have not pride be hurt by honest confession of scruple have long prevented forming serious design bitter accusation might have be suppressed have with greater policy concealed struggle flattered into belief of being impelled by unqualified unalloyed inclination by reason by reflection by everything disguise of sort be abhorrence be ashamed of feeling related be natural just must expect to rejoice in inferiority of connection to congratulate on hope of relation whose condition in life be so decidedly beneath own elizabeth felt growing more angry moment yet tried to utmost to speak with composure when said be mistaken mr darcy if suppose that mode of declaration affected in other way than a spared concern might have felt in refusing have behaved in more gentlemanlike manner saw start at said nothing continued must not have made offer of hand in possible way must have tempted to accept again astonishment be obvious looked at with expression of mingled incredulity mortification went on from very beginning from first moment may almost say of acquaintance with manner impressing with fullest belief of arrogance conceit selfish disdain of feeling of others be such a to form groundwork of disapprobation on succeeding event have built so immovable dislike have not known month before felt that be last man in world whom must ever be prevailed on to marry have said quite enough madam perfectly comprehend feeling have now only to be ashamed of what own have be forgive for having taken up so much of time accept best wish for health happiness with word hastily left room elizabeth heard next moment open front door quit house tumult of mind be now painfully great knew not how to support from actual weakness sat down cried for hour astonishment a reflected on what have passed be increased by review of that must receive offer of marriage from mr darcy that must have be in love with for so many month so much in love a to wish to marry in spite of objection have made prevent friend marrying sister must appear

beyond what have ever witnessed in sister also watched look manner be open cheerful engaging a ever without symptom of peculiar regard remained convinced from evening scrutiny that though received attention with pleasure did not invite by participation of sentiment if have not be mistaken here must have be in error superior knowledge of sister must make latter probable if be so if have be misled by such error to inflict pain on resentment have not be unreasonable will not scruple to assert that serenity of sister countenance air be such a might have given most acute observer conviction

farther that from what passed that evening opinion of party be confirmed inducement heightened must have led before to preserve friend from what esteemed most unhappy connection left netherfield for london on day following a be certain remember with design of soon returning part acted be now to be explained sister uneasiness have be equally excited with own coincidence of feeling be soon discovered alike sensible that time be to be lost in detaching brother shortly resolved on joining directly in london accordingly went there readily engaged in office of pointing out to friend certain evil of such choice described enforced earnestly however remonstrance might have staggered delayed determination suppose that must ultimately have prevented marriage have not be seconded by assurance hesitated not in giving of sister indifference have before believed to return affection with sincere if not with equal regard bingley have great natural modesty with stronger dependence on judgement than on own to convince therefore that have deceived be very difficult point to persuade against returning into hertfordshire when conviction have be given be scarcely work of moment can not blame for having done thus much there be one part of conduct in whole affair on reflect with satisfaction be that condescended to adopt measure of art so far a to conceal from sister being in town knew a be known to miss bingley brother be even yet ignorant of that might have met without ill consequence be perhaps probable regard did not appear to enough extinguished for to see without danger perhaps concealment disguise be beneath be done however be done for best on subject have nothing more to say other apology to offer if have wounded sister feeling be unknowingly done though motif governed may to very naturally appear insufficient have not yet learnt to condemn with respect to other more weighty accusation of having injured mr wickham can only refute by laying before whole of connection with family of what have particularly accused be ignorant of truth of what will relate can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity mr wickham be son of very respectable man who have for many year management of pemberley estate whose good conduct in discharge of trust naturally inclined father to be of service to on george wickham who be godson kindness be therefore liberally bestowed father supported at school afterwards at cambridge most important assistance a own father always poor from extravagance of wife must have be unable to give gentleman education father be not only fond of young man society whose manner be always engaging have also highest opinion of hoping church must be profession intended to provide for in a for myself be many many year since first began to think

year from event mr wickham wrote to inform that having finally resolved against taking order hoped must not think unreasonable for to expect more immediate pecuniary advantage in lieu of preferment by must not be benefited have intention added of studying law must be aware that interest of one thousand pound must be very insufficient support therein rather wished than believed to be sincere at rate be perfectly ready to accede to proposal knew that mr wickham ought not to be clergyman business be therefore soon settled resigned claim to assistance in church be possible that must ever be in

of everything concerning detection must not be in power suspicion certainly not in inclination may possibly wonder why be not told last night be not then master enough of to know what must ought to be revealed for truth of everything here related can appeal more particularly to testimony of colonel fitzwilliam who from near relationship constant intimacy still more a one of executor of father will have be unavoidably acquainted with particular of transaction if abhorrence of must make assertion valueless can not be prevented by same cause from confiding in cousin that there may be possibility of consulting will endeavour to find opportunity of putting letter in hand in course of morning will only add god bless fitzwilliam darcy chapter if elizabeth when mr darcy gave letter did not expect to contain renewal of offer have formed expectation at of content such a be may well be supposed how eagerly went through what contrariety of emotion excited feeling a read be scarcely to be defined with amazement did first understand that believed apology to be in power steadfastly be persuaded that must have explanation to give just sense of shame must not conceal with strong prejudice against everything might say began account of what have happened at netherfield read with eagerness hardly left power of comprehension from impatience of knowing what next sentence might bring be incapable of

attack of mr darcy at least by predominance of virtue atone for casual error under must endeavour to class what mr darcy have described a idleness vice of many year continuance such recollection befriended must see instantly before in charm of air address must remember more substantial good than general approbation of neighbourhood regard social power have gained in mess after pausing on point considerable while once more continued to read ala story followed of design on miss darcy received confirmation from what have passed between colonel fitzwilliam only morning before at last be referred for truth of particular to colonel fitzwilliam from whom have previously received information of near concern in cousin affair whose character have reason to question at one time have almost resolved on applying to idea be checked by awkwardness of application at length wholly banished by conviction that mr darcy must never have hazarded proposal if have not be well assured of cousin

such communication to stranger wondered have escaped before saw indelicacy of putting forward a have done inconsistency of profession with conduct remembered that have boasted of having fear of seeing mr darcy mr darcy might leave country that must stand ground yet have avoided netherfield very next week remembered also that till netherfield family have quitted country have told story to one that after removal have be everywhere discussed that have then reserve scruple in sinking mr darcy character though have assured respect for father must always prevent exposing son how differently did

amiable feeling have action be what mr wickham represented so gross violation of everything right must hardly have be concealed from world friendship between person capable of such amiable man a mr bingley be incomprehensible grew absolutely ashamed of herself of darcy wickham must think without feeling have be blind partial prejudiced absurd how despicably have acted cried who have prided on discernment who have valued on ability who have often disdained generous candour of sister gratified vanity in useless blameable mistrust how humiliating be discovery yet how just humiliation have be

very insufficient read again widely different be effect of second perusal how must deny credit to assertion in one instance have be obliged to give in other declared to be totally unsuspicious of sister attachment must not help remembering what charlotte opinion have always be neither must deny justice of description of jane felt that jane feeling though fervent be little displayed that there be constant complacency in air manner not often united with great sensibility when came to that part of letter in family be mentioned in term of such mortifying yet merited reproach sense of shame be severe justice of charge struck too forcibly for denial circumstance to particularly alluded a having passed at netherfield ball a confirming first disapprobation must not have made stronger

feel most acutely more think than last year attachment to rosings certainly increase mr collins have compliment allusion to throw in here be kindly smiled on by mother daughter lady catherine observed after dinner that miss bennet seemed out of spirit immediately accounting for by by supposing that did not like to go home again so soon added if be case must write to mother beg that may stay little

sentence feeling towards writer be at time widely different when remembered style of address be still full of indignation when considered how unjustly have condemned upbraided anger be turned against disappointed feeling became object of compassion attachment excited general character respect must not approve must for moment repent refusal feel slightest inclination ever to see again in own past behaviour there be constant source of vexation regret in unhappy defect of family subject of yet heavier chagrin be hopeless of remedy father contented with laughing at must never exert to restrain wild giddiness of youngest daughter mother with manner so far from right herself be entirely insensible of evil elizabeth have frequently united with jane in endeavour to check imprudence of catherine

might have heard ten mile off to mary very gravely replied far be from dear sister to depreciate such pleasure must doubtless be congenial with generality of female mind confess must have charm for must infinitely prefer book of answer lydia heard not word seldom listened to anybody for more than minute never attended to mary at in afternoon lydia be urgent with rest of girl to walk to meryton to see how everybody went on elizabeth steadily opposed scheme must not be said that miss bennet must not be at home half day before be in pursuit of officer there be reason too for opposition dreaded seeing mr wickham again be resolved to avoid a long a possible comfort to of regiment approaching removal be indeed beyond expression in fortnight be to go once gone hoped there must be nothing more to plague on account have not be many hour at home before found that brighton scheme of lydia have given hint at inn be under frequent discussion between parent elizabeth saw directly that father have not smallest intention of yielding answer be at same time so vague equivocal that mother though often disheartened have never yet despaired of succeeding at last chapter elizabeth impatience to acquaint jane with what have happened must no longer be overcome at length resolving to suppress particular in sister be concerned preparing to be surprised related to next morning chief of scene between mr darcy miss bennet astonishment be soon lessened by strong sisterly partiality made admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural surprise be shortly lost in other feeling be sorry that mr darcy must have delivered sentiment in manner so little suited to recommend still more be grieved for unhappiness sister refusal must have given being so sure of succeeding be wrong said certainly ought not to have appeared consider how much must increase disappointment indeed replied be heartily sorry for have other feeling will probably soon drive away regard for blame however for refusing blame oh blame for having spoken so warmly of wickham know that be wrong in saying what did will know when tell happened very next day then spoke of letter repeating whole of content a far a concerned george wickham what stroke be for poor jane who must willingly have gone through world without believing that so much wickedness existed in whole race of mankind a be here collected in one individual be darcy vindication though grateful to feeling capable of consoling for such discovery most earnestly did labour to prove probability of error seek to clear one without involving other will not do said elizabeth never will be able to make of good for anything take choice must be satisfied with only one there be such quantity of merit between just enough to make one good sort of man of late have be shifting about pretty much for part be inclined to believe darcy will do a choose be time however before smile must be extorted from jane know when have be more shocked said wickham so very bad be almost past belief poor mr darcy dear lizzy only consider what must have suffered disappointment with knowledge of ill opinion too having to relate thing of sister be really too distressing be sure must feel so oh regret compassion be done away by seeing so full of know will do such ample justice be growing moment more unconcerned indifferent profusion make saving if lament over much longer heart will be a light a feather poor wickham there be such expression of goodness in countenance openness gentleness in manner there certainly be great mismanagement in education of two young men one have got goodness other appearance of never thought mr darcy so deficient in appearance of a used to do yet meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided dislike to without reason be such spur to one genius opening for wit to have dislike of kind one may be continually abusive without saying anything just one can not always be laughing at man without now then stumbling on something witty lizzy when first read that letter be sure must not treat matter a do now indeed must not be uncomfortable enough may say unhappy with one to speak to about what felt jane to comfort say have not be so very weak vain nonsensical a knew have oh how wanted how unfortunate that must have used such very strong expression in speaking of wickham to mr darcy for now do appear wholly undeserved certainly

must do great deal of good added kitty such be kind of lamentation resounding perpetually through longbourn house elizabeth tried to be diverted by sense of pleasure be lost in shame felt anew justice of mr darcy objection never have be so much disposed to pardon interference in view of friend gloom of lydia prospect be shortly cleared away for received invitation from mr forster wife of colonel of regiment to accompany to brighton invaluable friend be very young woman very lately married resemblance in good humour good spirit have recommended lydia to other out of three month acquaintance have be intimate two rapture of lydia on occasion adoration of mr forster delight of mr bennet mortification of kitty be scarcely to be described wholly inattentive to sister feeling lydia flew about house in restless ecstasy calling for everyone congratulation laughing talking with more violence than ever whilst luckless kitty continued in parlour repined at fate in term a unreasonable a accent be peevish can not see why mr forster must not ask a well a lydia said though be not particular friend have just a much right to be asked a have more too for be two year older in vain did elizabeth attempt to make reasonable jane to make resigned a for elizabeth invitation be so far from exciting in same feeling a in mother lydia that considered a death warrant of possibility of common sense for latter detestable a such step must make be known must not help secretly advising father not to let go represented to impropriety of lydia general behaviour little advantage must derive from friendship of such woman a mr forster probability of being yet more imprudent with companion at brighton where temptation must be greater than at home heard attentively then said lydia will never be easy until have exposed in public place other can never expect to do with so little expense inconvenience to family a under present circumstance if be aware said elizabeth of very great disadvantage to must arise from public notice of lydia unguarded imprudent manner nay have already arisen from be sure must judge differently in affair already arisen repeated mr bennet what have frightened away of lover poor little lizzy be cast down such squeamish youth a can not bear to be connected with little absurdity be not worth regret come let see list of pitiful fellow who have be kept aloof by lydia folly

be beyond reach of amendment character will be fixed will at sixteen be most determined flirt that ever made herself family ridiculous flirt too in worst meanest degree of flirtation without attraction beyond youth tolerable person from ignorance emptiness of mind wholly unable to ward off portion of universal contempt rage for admiration will excite in danger kitty also be comprehended will follow wherever lydia lead vain ignorant idle absolutely uncontrolled oh dear father can suppose possible that will not be censured despised wherever be known that sister will not be often involved in disgrace mr bennet saw that whole heart be in subject affectionately taking hand said in reply make uneasy love wherever jane be known must be respected valued will not appear to le advantage for having couple of may say three very silly sister will have peace at longbourn if lydia doe not go to brighton let go then colonel forster be sensible man will keep out of real mischief be luckily too poor to be object of prey to anybody at brighton will be of le importance even a common flirt than have be here officer will find woman better worth notice let hope therefore being there may teach own insignificance at rate can not grow many degree worse without authorising to lock up for rest of life with answer elizabeth be forced to be content own opinion continued same left disappointed sorry be not in nature however to increase vexation by dwelling on be confident of having performed duty to fret over unavoidable evil augment by anxiety be part of disposition have lydia

having be frequently in company with since return agitation be pretty well over agitation of formal partiality entirely so have even learnt to detect in very gentleness have first delighted affectation sameness to disgust weary in present behaviour to herself moreover have fresh source of displeasure for inclination soon testified of renewing intention have marked early part of acquaintance must only serve after what have since passed to provoke lost concern for in finding thus selected a object of such idle frivolous gallantry while steadily repressed must not feel reproof contained in believing that however long for cause attention have be withdrawn vanity must be gratified preference secured at time by renewal on very last day of regiment remaining at meryton dined with other of officer at longbourn so little be elizabeth disposed to part from in good humour that on making inquiry a to manner in time have passed at hunsford mentioned colonel fitzwilliam mr darcy having spent three week at rosings asked if be acquainted with former looked surprised displeased alarmed with moment recollection returning smile replied that have formerly seen often after observing that be very gentlemanlike man asked how have liked answer be warmly in favour with air of indifference soon afterwards added how long did say be at rosings nearly three week saw frequently yes almost day manner be very different from cousin yes very different think mr darcy improves upon acquaintance indeed cried mr wickham with look did not escape pray may ask checking added in gayer tone be in address that improves have deigned to add aught of civility to ordinary style for dare not hope continued in lower more serious tone that be improved in essential oh said elizabeth in essential believe be very much what ever be while spoke wickham looked a if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over word to distrust meaning there be something in countenance made listen with apprehensive anxious attention while added when said that improved on acquaintance did not mean that mind manner be in state of improvement that from knowing better disposition be better understood wickham alarm now appeared in heightened complexion agitated look for few minute be silent till shaking off embarrassment turned to again said in gentlest of accent who so well know feeling towards mr darcy will readily comprehend how sincerely must rejoice that be wise enough to assume even appearance of what be right pride in direction may be of service if not to to many others for must only deter from such foul misconduct a have suffered by only fear that sort of cautiousness to imagine have be alluding be merely adopted on visit to aunt of whose good opinion judgement stand much in awe fear of have always operated know when be together good deal be to be imputed to wish of forwarding match with miss de bourgh be certain have very much at heart elizabeth must not repress smile at answered only by slight inclination of head saw that wanted to engage on old subject of grievance be in humour to indulge rest of evening passed with appearance on side of usual cheerfulness with further attempt to distinguish elizabeth parted at last with mutual civility possibly mutual desire of never meeting again when party broke up lydia returned with mr forster to meryton from whence be to set out early next morning separation between family be rather noisy than pathetic kitty be only one who shed tear did weep from vexation envy mr bennet be diffuse in good wish for felicity of daughter impressive in injunction that must not miss opportunity of enjoying a much a possible advice there be reason to believe must be well attended to in clamorous happiness of lydia in bidding farewell more gentle

elizabeth however have never be blind to impropriety of father behaviour a husband have always seen with pain respecting ability grateful for affectionate treatment of endeavoured to forget what must not overlook to banish from thought that continual breach of conjugal obligation decorum in exposing wife to contempt of own child be so highly reprehensible have never felt so strongly a now disadvantage must attend child of so unsuitable marriage ever be so fully aware of evil arising from so ill judged direction of talent talent rightly used might at least have preserved respectability of daughter even if incapable of enlarging mind of wife when elizabeth have rejoiced over wickham departure found little other cause for satisfaction in loss of regiment party abroad be le varied than before at home have mother sister whose constant repinings at dullness of everything around threw real gloom over domestic circle though kitty might in time regain natural degree of sense since disturber of brain be removed other sister from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended be likely to be hardened in folly assurance by situation of such double danger a watering place camp

elizabeth said more mind must not acquiesce possibility of meeting mr darcy while viewing place instantly occurred must be dreadful blushed at very idea thought must be better to speak openly to aunt than to run risk against there be objection finally resolved that must be last resource if private inquiry to absence of family be unfavourably answered accordingly when retired at night asked chambermaid whether pemberley be not very fine place what be name of proprietor with little alarm whether family be down for summer most welcome negative followed last question alarm now being removed be at leisure to feel great deal of curiosity to see house herself when subject be revived next morning be again applied to must readily answer with proper air of indifference that have not really dislike to scheme to pemberley therefore be to go chapter elizabeth a drove along watched for first appearance of pemberley wood with perturbation when at length turned in at lodge spirit be in high flutter park be very large contained great variety of ground entered in one of lowest point drove for time through beautiful wood stretching over wide extent elizabeth mind be too full for conversation saw admired remarkable spot point of view gradually ascended for mile then found at top of considerable eminence where wood ceased eye be instantly caught by pemberley house situated on opposite side of valley into road with abruptness wound be large handsome stone building standing well on rising ground backed by ridge of high woody hill in front stream of natural importance be swelled into greater without artificial appearance bank be neither formal falsely adorned elizabeth be delighted have never seen place for nature have done more where natural beauty have be so little counteracted by awkward taste be of warm in admiration at moment felt that to be mistress of pemberley might be something descended hill crossed bridge drove to door while examining nearer aspect of house apprehension of meeting owner returned dreaded lest chambermaid have be mistaken on applying to see place be admitted into hall elizabeth a waited for housekeeper have leisure to wonder at being where be housekeeper came respectable looking elderly woman much le fine more civil than have notion of finding followed into dining parlour be large well proportioned room handsomely fitted up

looked on whole scene river tree scattered on bank winding of valley a far a must trace with delight a passed into other room object be taking different position from window there be beauty to be seen room be lofty handsome furniture suitable to fortune of proprietor elizabeth saw with admiration of taste that be gaudy uselessly fine with le of splendour more real elegance than furniture of rosings of place thought might have be mistress with room might now have be familiarly acquainted instead of viewing a stranger might have rejoiced in a own welcomed to a visitor uncle aunt recollecting must never be uncle aunt must have be lost to must not have be allowed to invite be lucky recollection saved from something very like regret longed to inquire of housekeeper whether master be really absent have not courage for at length however question be asked by uncle turned away with alarm while mr reynolds replied that be adding expect to morrow with large party of friend how rejoiced be elizabeth that own journey have not by circumstance be delayed day aunt now called to look at picture approached saw likeness of mr wickham suspended amongst several other miniature over mantelpiece aunt asked smilingly how liked housekeeper came forward told be picture of young gentleman son of late master steward who have be brought up by at own expense be now gone into army added be afraid have turned

for summer month except thought elizabeth when go to ramsgate if master must marry might see more of yes sir know when will be know who be good enough for mr mr gardiner smiled elizabeth must not help saying be very much to credit be sure that must think so say more than truth everybody will say that know replied other elizabeth thought be going pretty far listened with increasing astonishment a housekeeper added have never known cross word from in life have known ever since be four year old be praise of others most extraordinary most opposite to idea that be not good tempered man have be firmest opinion keenest attention be awakened longed to hear more be grateful to uncle for saying there be very few people of whom so much can be said be lucky in having master yes sir know be if be to go through world must not meet with better have always observed that who be good natured when child be good natured when grow up be always sweetest tempered most generous hearted boy in world elizabeth almost stared at can be mr darcy thought father be excellent man said mr gardiner yes ma'be that be indeed son will be just like just a affable to poor elizabeth listened wondered doubted be impatient for more mr reynolds must interest on other point related subject of picture dimension of room price of furniture in vain mr gardiner highly amused by kind of family prejudice to attributed excessive commendation of master soon led again to subject dwelt with energy on many merit a proceeded together up great staircase be best landlord best master said that ever lived not like wild young men nowadays who think of nothing there be not one of tenant servant will give good name people call proud be sure never saw anything of to fancy be only because doe not rattle away like other young men in what amiable light doe place thought elizabeth fine account of whispered aunt a walked be not quite consistent with behaviour to poor friend perhaps might be deceived be not very likely authority be too good on reaching spacious lobby above be shown into very pretty sitting room lately fitted up with greater elegance lightness than apartment below be informed that be just done to give pleasure to miss darcy who have taken liking to room when last at pemberley be certainly good brother said elizabeth a walked towards one of window mr reynolds anticipated miss darcy delight when must enter room be always way with added can give sister pleasure be sure to be done in moment there be nothing must not do for picture gallery two three of principal bedroom be remained to be shown in former be many good painting elizabeth knew nothing of art from such a have be already visible below have willingly turned to look at drawing of miss darcy in crayon whose subject be usually more interesting also more intelligible in gallery there be many family portrait must have little to fix attention of stranger elizabeth walked in quest of only face whose feature must be known to at last arrested beheld striking resemblance to mr darcy with smile over face a remembered to have sometimes seen when looked at stood several minute before picture in earnest contemplation returned to again before quitted gallery mr reynolds informed that have be taken in father lifetime there be certainly at moment in elizabeth mind more gentle sensation towards original than have ever felt at height of acquaintance commendation bestowed on by mr reynolds be of trifling nature what praise be more valuable than praise of intelligent servant a brother landlord master considered how many people happiness be in guardianship how much of pleasure pain be in power to bestow how much of good evil must be done by idea have be brought forward by housekeeper be favourable to character a stood before canvas on be represented fixed eye upon thought of regard with deeper sentiment of gratitude than have ever raised before remembered warmth softened impropriety of expression when of house be open to general inspection have be seen returned downstairs taking leave of housekeeper be consigned over to gardener who met at hall door a walked across hall towards river elizabeth turned back to look again uncle aunt stopped also while former be conjecturing a to date of building owner of suddenly came forward from road led behind to stable be within twenty yard of other so abrupt be appearance that be impossible to avoid sight eye instantly met cheek of be overspread with deepest blush absolutely started for moment seemed immovable from surprise shortly recovering advanced towards party spoke to elizabeth if not in term of perfect composure at least of perfect civility have instinctively turned away stopping on approach received compliment with embarrassment impossible to be overcome have first appearance resemblance to picture have just be examining be insufficient to assure other two that now saw mr darcy gardener expression of surprise on beholding master must immediately have told stood little aloof while be talking to niece who astonished confused scarcely dared lift eye to face knew not what answer returned to civil inquiry after family amazed at alteration of manner since last parted sentence that uttered be increasing embarrassment idea of impropriety of being found there recurring to mind few minute in continued be of most uncomfortable in life did seem much more at ease when spoke accent have none of usual sedateness repeated inquiry a to time of having left longbourn of having stayed in derbyshire so often in so hurried way a plainly spoke distraction of thought at length idea seemed to fail after standing few moment without saying word suddenly recollected took leave others then joined expressed admiration of figure elizabeth heard not word wholly engrossed by own feeling followed in silence be overpowered by shame vexation coming there be most unfortunate most ill judged thing in world how strange must appear to in what disgraceful light might not strike so vain man might seem a if have purposely thrown in way again oh why did come why did thus come day before be expected have be only ten minute sooner must have be beyond reach of discrimination for be plain that be that moment arrived that moment alighted from horse carriage blushed again again over perverseness of meeting behaviour so strikingly altered what must mean that must even speak to be amazing to speak with such civility to inquire after family never in life have seen manner so little dignified never have spoken with such gentleness a on unexpected meeting what contrast did offer to last address in rosings park when put letter into hand knew not what to think how to account for have now entered beautiful walk by side of water step be bringing forward nobler fall of ground finer reach of wood to be approaching be time before elizabeth be sensible of of though answered mechanically to repeated appeal of uncle aunt seemed to direct eye to such object a pointed out distinguished part of scene thought be fixed on one spot of pemberley house whichever might be where mr darcy then be longed to know what at moment be passing in mind in what manner thought of whether in defiance of everything be still dear to perhaps have be civil only because felt at ease yet there have be that in voice be not like ease whether have felt more of pain of pleasure in seeing must not tell certainly have not seen with composure at length however remark of companion on absence of mind aroused felt necessity of appearing more like entered wood bidding adieu to river for while ascended of higher ground when in spot where opening of tree gave eye power to wander be many charming view of valley opposite hill with long range of wood overspreading many occasionally part of stream mr gardiner expressed wish of going round whole park feared might be beyond walk with triumphant smile be told that be ten mile round settled matter pursued accustomed circuit brought again after time in descent among hanging wood to edge of water one of narrowest part crossed by simple bridge in character with general air of scene be spot le adorned than have yet visited valley here contracted into glen allowed room only for stream narrow walk amidst rough coppice wood bordered elizabeth longed to explore winding when have crossed bridge perceived distance from house mr gardiner who be not great walker must go farther thought only of returning to carriage a quickly a possible niece be therefore obliged to submit took way towards house on opposite side of river in nearest direction progress be slow for mr gardiner though seldom able to indulge taste be very fond of fishing be so much engaged in watching occasional appearance of trout in water talking to man about that advanced little whilst wandering on in slow manner be again surprised elizabeth astonishment be quite equal to what have be at first by sight of mr darcy approaching at great distance walk being here le sheltered than on other side allowed to see before met elizabeth however astonished be at least more prepared for interview than before resolved to appear to speak with calmness if really intended to meet for few moment indeed felt that must probably strike into other path idea lasted while turning in walk concealed from view turning past be immediately before with glance saw that have lost none of recent civility to imitate politeness began a met to admire beauty of place have not got beyond word delightful charming when unlucky recollection obtruded fancied that praise of pemberley from might be mischievously construed colour changed said more mr gardiner be standing little behind on pausing asked if must do honour of introducing to friend be stroke of civility for be quite unprepared must hardly suppress smile at being now seeking acquaintance of of very people against whom pride have revolted in offer to herself what will be surprise thought when know who be take now for people of fashion introduction however be immediately made a named relationship to herself stole sly look at to see how bore be not without expectation of decamping a fast a must from such disgraceful companion that be surprised by connection be evident sustained however with fortitude so far from going away turned back with entered into conversation with mr gardiner elizabeth must not be pleased must not triumph be consoling that must know have relation for whom there be need to blush listened most attentively to passed between gloried in expression sentence of uncle marked intelligence taste good manner conversation soon turned upon fishing heard mr darcy invite with greatest civility to fish there a often a chose while continued in neighbourhood offering at same time to supply with fishing tackle pointing out part of stream where there be usually most sport mr gardiner who be walking arm in arm with elizabeth gave look expressive of wonder elizabeth said nothing gratified exceedingly compliment must be for astonishment however be extreme continually be repeating why be so altered from what can proceed can not be for can not be for sake that manner be thus softened reproof at hunsford must not work such change a be impossible that must still love after walking time in way two lady in front two gentleman behind on resuming place after descending to brink of river for better inspection of curious water plant there chanced to be little alteration originated in mr gardiner who fatigued by exercise of morning found elizabeth arm inadequate to support consequently preferred husband mr darcy took place by niece walked on together after short silence lady first spoke wished to know that have be assured of absence before came to place accordingly began by observing that arrival have be very unexpected for housekeeper added informed that must certainly not be here till to morrow indeed before left bakewell understood that be not immediately expected in country acknowledged truth of said that business with steward have occasioned coming forward few hour before rest of party with whom have be travelling will join early to morrow continued among be who will claim acquaintance with mr bingley sister elizabeth answered only by slight bow thought be instantly driven back to time when mr bingley name have be last mentioned between if might judge by complexion mind be not very differently engaged there be also one other person in party continued after pause who more particularly wish to be known to will allow do ask too much to introduce sister to acquaintance during stay at surprise of such application be great indeed be too great for to know in what manner acceded to immediately felt that desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with must be work of brother without looking farther be satisfactory be gratifying to know that resentment have not made think really ill of now walked on in silence of deep in thought elizabeth be not comfortable that be impossible be flattered pleased wish of introducing sister to be compliment of highest kind soon outstripped others when have reached carriage mr mr gardiner be quarter of mile behind then asked to walk into house declared not tired stood together on lawn at time much might have be said silence be very awkward wanted to talk there seemed to be embargo on subject at last recollected that have be travelling talked of matlock dove dale with great perseverance yet time aunt moved slowly patience idea be nearly worn before tete tete be over on mr mr gardiner coming up be pressed to go into house take refreshment be declined parted on side with utmost politeness mr darcy handed lady into carriage when drove off elizabeth saw walking slowly towards house observation of uncle aunt now began of pronounced to be infinitely superior to anything have expected be perfectly well behaved polite unassuming said uncle there be something little stately in to be sure replied aunt be confined to air be not unbecoming can now say with housekeeper though people may call proud have seen nothing of be never more surprised than by behaviour to be more than civil be really attentive there be necessity for such attention acquaintance with elizabeth be very trifling to be sure lizzy said aunt be not so handsome a wickham rather have not wickham countenance for feature be perfectly good how came to tell that be so disagreeable elizabeth excused a well a must said that have liked better when have met in kent than before that have never seen so pleasant a morning perhaps may be little whimsical in civility replied uncle great men often be therefore will not take at word a might change mind day warn off ground elizabeth felt that have entirely misunderstood character said nothing from what have seen of continued mr gardiner really must not have thought that must have behaved in so cruel way by anybody a have done by poor wickham have not ill natured look on contrary there be something pleasing about mouth when speaks there be something of dignity in countenance must not give one unfavourable idea of heart to be sure good lady who showed house did give most flaming character must hardly help laughing aloud sometimes be liberal master suppose that in eye of servant comprehends virtue elizabeth here felt called on to say something in vindication of behaviour to wickham therefore gave to understand in a guarded manner a must that by what have heard from relation in kent action be capable of very different construction that character be by mean so faulty wickham so amiable a have be considered in hertfordshire in confirmation of related particular of pecuniary transaction in have be connected without actually naming authority stating to be such a might be relied on mr gardiner be surprised concerned a be now approaching scene of former pleasure idea gave way to charm of recollection be too much engaged in

in satisfaction of intercourse renewed after many year discontinuance occurrence of day be too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for of new friend must hing think think with wonder of mr darcy civility above of wishing to be acquainted with sister chapter elizabeth have settled that mr darcy must bring sister to visit very day after reaching pemberley be consequently resolved not to be out of sight of inn whole of morning conclusion be false for on very morning after arrival at lambton visitor came have be walking about place with of new friend be just returning to inn to dress for dining with same family when sound of carriage drew to window saw gentleman lady in curricle driving up street elizabeth immediately recognizing livery guessed what meant imparted small degree of surprise to relation by acquainting with honour expected uncle aunt be amazement embarrassment of manner a spoke joined to circumstance many of circumstance of preceding day opened to new idea on business nothing have ever suggested before felt that there be other way of accounting for such attention from such quarter than by supposing partiality for niece while newly born notion be passing in head perturbation of elizabeth feeling be at moment increasing be quite amazed at own discomposure amongst other cause of disquiet dreaded lest partiality of brother must have said too much in favour more than commonly anxious to please naturally suspected that power of pleasing must fail retreated from window fearful of being seen a walked up down room endeavouring to compose saw such look of inquiring surprise in uncle aunt a made everything worse miss darcy brother appeared formidable introduction took place with astonishment did elizabeth see that new acquaintance be at least a much embarrassed a herself since being at lambton have heard that miss darcy be exceedingly proud observation of very few minute convinced that be only exceedingly shy found difficult to obtain even

feeling have not long be together before mr darcy told that bingley be also coming to wait on have barely time to express satisfaction prepare for such visitor when bingley quick step be heard on stair in moment entered room elizabeth anger against have be long done away have still felt must hardly have stood ground against unaffected cordiality with expressed on seeing again inquired in friendly though general way after family looked spoke with same good humoured ease that have ever done to mr mr gardiner be scarcely le interesting personage than to herself have long wished to see

in favour bingley be ready georgiana be eager darcy determined to be pleased in seeing bingley thought naturally flew to sister oh how ardently did long to know whether of be directed in like manner sometimes must fancy that talked le than on former occasion once twice pleased with notion that a looked at be trying to trace resemblance though might be imaginary must not be deceived a to behaviour to miss darcy who have be set up a rival to jane look appeared on side that spoke particular regard nothing occurred between must justify hope of sister on point be soon satisfied two three little circumstance occurred ere parted in anxious interpretation denoted recollection of jane not untinctured by tenderness wish of saying more might lead to mention of have dared observed to at moment when others be talking together in tone have something of real regret that be very long time since have have pleasure of seeing before must reply added be above eight month have not met since th of november when be dancing together at netherfield elizabeth be pleased to find memory so exact afterwards took occasion to ask when unattended to by of rest whether sister be at longbourn there be not much in question in preceding remark there be look manner gave meaning be not often that must turn eye on mr darcy whenever did catch glimpse saw expression of general complaisance in that said heard accent so removed from hauteur disdain of companion a convinced that improvement of manner have yesterday witnessed however temporary existence might prove have at least outlived one day when saw thus seeking acquaintance courting good opinion of people with whom intercourse few month ago must have be disgrace when saw thus civil not only to herself to very relation whom have openly disdained recollected last lively scene in hunsford parsonage difference change be so great struck so forcibly on mind that must hardly restrain astonishment from being visible never even in company of dear friend at netherfield dignified relation at rosings have seen so desirous to please so free from self consequence unbending reserve a now when importance must result from success of endeavour when even acquaintance of to whom attention be addressed must draw down ridicule censure of lady of netherfield rosings visitor stayed with above hour when arose to depart mr darcy called on sister to join in expressing wish of seeing mr mr gardiner miss bennet to dinner at pemberley before left country miss darcy though with diffidence marked little in habit of giving invitation readily obeyed mr gardiner looked at niece desirous of knowing how whom invitation most concerned felt disposed a to acceptance elizabeth have turned away head presuming however that studied avoidance spoke rather momentary embarrassment than dislike of proposal seeing in husband who be fond of society perfect willingness to accept ventured to engage for attendance day after next be fixed on bingley expressed great pleasure in certainty of seeing elizabeth again having still great deal to say to many inquiry to make after hertfordshire friend elizabeth construing into wish of hearing speak of sister be pleased on account a well a others found when visitor left capable of considering last half hour with satisfaction though while be passing enjoyment of have be little eager to be alone fearful of inquiry hint from uncle aunt stayed with only long enough to hear favourable opinion of bingley then hurried away to dress have reason to fear mr mr gardiner curiosity be not wish to force communication be evident that be much better acquainted with mr darcy than have before idea of be evident that be very much in love with saw much to interest nothing to justify inquiry of mr darcy be now matter of anxiety to think well a far a acquaintance reached there be fault to find must not be untouched by politeness have drawn character from own feeling servant report without reference to other account circle in hertfordshire to be known must not have recognized for mr darcy there be now interest however in believing housekeeper soon became sensible that authority of servant who have known since be four year old whose own manner indicated respectability be not to be hastily rejected have anything occurred in intelligence of lambton friend must materially lessen weight have nothing to accuse of pride pride probably have if not must certainly be imputed by inhabitant of small market town where family did not visit be acknowledged however that be liberal man did much good among poor with respect to wickham traveller soon found that be not held there in much estimation for though chief of concern with son of patron be imperfectly understood be yet well known fact that on quitting derbyshire have left many debt behind mr darcy afterwards discharged a for elizabeth thought be at pemberley evening more than last evening though a passed seemed long be not long enough to determine feeling towards one in mansion lay awake two whole hour endeavouring to make out certainly did not hate hatred have vanished long ago have almost a long be ashamed of ever feeling dislike against must be so called respect created by conviction of valuable quality though at first unwillingly admitted have for time ceased to be repugnant to feeling be now heightened into somewhat of friendlier nature by testimony so highly in favour bringing forward disposition in so amiable light yesterday have produced above above respect esteem there be motive within of goodwill must not be overlooked be gratitude gratitude not merely for having once loved for loving still well enough to forgive petulance acrimony of manner in rejecting unjust accusation accompanying rejection who have be persuaded must avoid a greatest enemy seemed on accidental meeting most eager to preserve acquaintance without indelicate display of regard peculiarity of manner where two self only be concerned be soliciting good opinion of friend bent on making known to sister change in man of so much pride exciting not only astonishment gratitude for to love ardent love must be attributed a such impression on be of sort to be encouraged a by mean unpleasing though must not be exactly defined respected esteemed be grateful to felt real interest in welfare only wanted to know how far wished that welfare to depend upon how far must be for happiness of that must employ power fancy told still possessed of bringing on renewal of address have be settled in evening between aunt niece that striking civility a miss darcy in coming to see on very day of arrival at pemberley for have reached only to late breakfast ought to be imitated though must not be equalled by exertion of politeness on side consequently that must be highly expedient to wait on at following morning be therefore to go elizabeth be pleased though when asked reason have very little to say in reply mr gardiner left soon after breakfast fishing scheme have be renewed day before positive engagement made of meeting of gentleman at pemberley before noon chapter convinced a elizabeth now be that miss bingley dislike of have originated in jealousy must not help feeling how unwelcome appearance at pemberley must be to be curious to know with how much civility on lady side acquaintance must now be renewed on reaching house be shown through hall into saloon whose northern aspect rendered delightful for summer window opening to ground admitted most refreshing view of high woody hill behind house of beautiful oak spanish chestnut be scattered over intermediate lawn in house be received by miss darcy who be sitting there with mr hurst miss bingley lady with whom lived in london georgiana reception of be very civil attended with embarrassment though proceeding from shyness fear of doing wrong must easily give to who felt inferior belief of being proud reserved mr gardiner niece however did justice pitied by mr hurst miss bingley be noticed only by curtsey on being seated pause awkward a such pause must always be succeeded for few moment be first broken by mr annesley genteel agreeable looking woman whose endeavour to introduce kind of discourse proved to be more truly well bred than of others between mr gardiner with occasional help from elizabeth conversation be carried on miss darcy looked a if wished for courage enough to join in sometimes did venture short sentence when there be least danger of being heard elizabeth soon saw that be closely watched by miss bingley that must not speak word especially to miss darcy without calling attention observation must not have prevented from trying to talk to latter have not be seated at inconvenient distance be not sorry to be spared necessity of saying much own thought be employing expected moment that of gentleman must enter room wished feared that master of house might be amongst whether wished feared most must scarcely determine after sitting in manner quarter of hour without hearing miss bingley voice elizabeth be roused by receiving from cold inquiry after health of family answered with equal indifference brevity others said more next variation visit afforded be produced by entrance of servant with cold meat cake variety of finest fruit in season did not take place till after many significant look smile from mr annesley to miss darcy have be given to remind her of post there be now employment for whole party for though must not talk must eat beautiful pyramid of grape nectarine peach soon collected round table while thus engaged elizabeth have fair opportunity of deciding whether most feared wished for appearance of mr darcy by feeling prevailed on entering room then though moment before have believed wish to predominate began to regret that came have be time with mr gardiner who with two three other gentleman from house be engaged by river have left only on learning that lady of family intended visit to georgiana that morning sooner did appear than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy unembarrassed resolution more necessary to be made perhaps not more easily kept because saw that suspicion of whole party be awakened against that there be scarcely eye did not watch behaviour when first came into room in countenance be attentive curiosity so strongly marked a in miss bingley in spite of smile overspread face whenever spoke to one of object for jealousy have not yet made desperate attention to mr darcy be by mean over miss darcy on brother entrance exerted much more to talk elizabeth saw that be anxious for sister to get acquainted forwarded a much a possible attempt at conversation on side miss bingley saw likewise in imprudence of anger took first opportunity of saying with sneering civility pray miss eliza be not shire militia removed from meryton must be great loss to family in darcy presence dared not mention wickham name elizabeth instantly comprehended that be uppermost in thought various recollection connected with gave moment distress exerting vigorously to repel ill natured attack presently answered question in tolerably detached tone while spoke involuntary glance showed darcy with heightened complexion earnestly looking at sister overcome with confusion unable to lift up eye have miss bingley known what pain be then giving beloved friend undoubtedly must have refrained from hint have merely intended to discompose elizabeth by bringing forward idea of man to whom believed partial to make betray sensibility might injure in darcy opinion perhaps to remind latter of folly absurdity by part of family be connected with corp not syllable have ever reached her of miss darcy meditated elopement to creature have be revealed where secrecy be possible except to elizabeth from bingley connection brother be particularly anxious to conceal from very wish elizabeth have long ago attributed to of becoming hereafter own have certainly formed plan without meaning that must effect endeavour to separate from miss bennet be probable that might add something to lively concern for welfare of friend elizabeth collected behaviour however soon quieted emotion a miss bingley vexed disappointed dared not approach nearer to wickham georgiana also recovered in time though not enough to be able to speak more brother whose eye feared to meet scarcely recollected interest in affair very circumstance have be designed to turn thought from elizabeth seemed to have fixed on more more cheerfully visit did not continue long after question answer above mentioned while mr darcy be attending to carriage miss bingley be venting feeling in criticism on elizabeth person behaviour dress georgiana must not join brother recommendation be enough to ensure favour judgement must not err have spoken in such term of elizabeth a to leave georgiana without power of finding otherwise than lovely amiable when darcy returned to saloon miss bingley must not help repeating to part of what have be saying to sister how very ill miss eliza bennet look morning mr darcy cried never in life saw anyone so much altered a be since winter be grown so brown coarse louisa be agreeing that must not have known again however little mr darcy might have liked address contented with coolly replying that perceived other alteration than being rather tanned miraculous consequence of travelling in summer for own part rejoined must confess that never must see beauty in face be too thin complexion have brilliancy feature be not at handsome nose want character there be nothing marked in line teeth be tolerable not out of common way a for eye have sometimes be called so fine must never see anything extraordinary in have sharp shrewish look like at in air altogether there be self sufficiency without fashion be intolerable persuaded a miss bingley be that darcy admired elizabeth be not best method of recommending angry people be not always wise in seeing at last look somewhat nettled have success expected be resolutely silent however from determination of making speak continued remember when first knew in hertfordshire how amazed be to find that be reputed beauty particularly recollect saying one night after have be dining at netherfield behe beauty must a soon call mother wit afterwards seemed to improve on believe thought rather pretty at one time replied darcy who must contain no longer be only when first saw for be many month since have considered a one of handsomest woman of acquaintance then went away miss bingley be left to satisfaction of having forced to say what gave one pain mr gardiner elizabeth talked of have occurred during visit a returned except what have particularly interested look behaviour of everybody have seen be discussed except of person who have mostly engaged attention talked of sister friend house fruit of everything yet elizabeth be longing to know what mr gardiner thought of mr gardiner must have be highly gratified by niece beginning subject chapter elizabeth have be good deal disappointed in not finding letter from jane on first arrival at lambton disappointment have be renewed on of

much reason to fear be not gone to scotland colonel forster came yesterday having left brighton day before not many hour after express though lydia short letter to mr f gave to understand that be

what to think after making possible inquiry on side london colonel f came on into hertfordshire anxiously renewing at turnpike at inn in barnet hatfield without success such people have be seen to pas through with kindest concern came on to longbourn broke apprehension to in manner most creditable to heart be sincerely grieved for mr f one can throw blame on distress dear lizzy be very great father mother believe worst can not think so ill of many circumstance might make more eligible for to be married privately in town than to pursue first plan even if must form design against young woman of lydia connection be not likely can suppose so lost to everything impossible grieve to find however that colonel f be not disposed to depend upon marriage shook head when expressed hope said feared w be not man to be trusted poor mother be really ill keep room must exert must be better be not to be expected a to father never in life saw so affected poor kitty have anger for having concealed

selfish however a to press for if inconvenient adieu take up pen again to do what have just told must not circumstance be such that can not help earnestly begging to come here a soon a possible know dear uncle aunt so well that be not afraid of requesting though have still something more to ask of former father be going to london with colonel forster instantly to try to discover what mean to do be sure know not excessive distress will not allow to pursue measure in best safest way colonel forster be obliged to be at brighton again to morrow evening in such exigence uncle advice assistance must be everything in world will immediately comprehend what must feel rely upon goodness oh where where be uncle cried elizabeth darting from seat a finished letter in eagerness to follow without losing moment of time so precious a reached door be opened by servant mr darcy appeared pale face impetuous manner made start before must recover to speak in whose mind idea be superseded by lydia situation hastily exclaimed beg pardon must leave must find mr gardiner moment on business can not be delayed have not instant to lose good god what be matter cried with more feeling than politeness then recollecting will not detain minute let let servant go after mr mr gardiner be not well enough can not go elizabeth hesitated knee trembled under felt how little must be gained by attempting to pursue calling back servant therefore commissioned though in so breathless accent a made almost unintelligible to fetch master mistress home instantly on quitting room sat down unable to support looking so miserably ill that be impossible for darcy to leave to refrain from saying in tone of gentleness commiseration let call maid be there nothing must take to give present relief glass of wine will get one be very ill thank replied endeavouring to recover there be nothing matter with be quite well be only distressed by dreadful news have just received from longbourn burst into tear a alluded to for few minute must not speak word darcy in wretched suspense must only say something indistinctly of concern observe in compassionate silence at length spoke again have just have letter from jane with such dreadful news can not be concealed from anyone younger sister have left friend have eloped have thrown into power of of mr wickham be gone off together from brighton know too well to doubt rest have money connection nothing can tempt to be lost for ever darcy be fixed in astonishment when consider added in yet more agitated voice might have prevented who knew what be have explained part of only part of what learnt to own family have character be known must not have happened be all too late now be grieved indeed cried darcy grieved shocked be certain absolutely certain oh yes left brighton together on sunday night be traced almost to london not beyond be certainly not gone to scotland have be done have be attempted to recover father be gone to london jane have written to beg uncle immediate assistance will be off hope in hour nothing can be done know very well that nothing can be done how be such man to be worked on how be even to be discovered have not smallest hope be way horrible darcy shook head in silent acquiescence when eye be opened to real character oh have known what ought what dared to do knew not be afraid of doing too much wretched wretched mistake darcy made answer seemed scarcely to hear be walking up down room in earnest meditation brow contracted air gloomy elizabeth soon observed instantly understood power be sinking everything must sink under proof of family weakness assurance of deepest disgrace must neither wonder condemn belief of self conquest brought nothing consolatory to bosom afforded palliation of distress be on contrary exactly calculated to make understand own wish never have so honestly felt that must have loved a now when love must be vain though must intrude must not engross lydia humiliation misery be bringing on soon swallowed up private care covering face with handkerchief elizabeth be soon lost to everything else after pause of several minute be only recalled to sense of situation by voice of companion who in manner though spoke compassion spoke likewise restraint said be afraid have be long desiring absence have anything to plead in excuse of stay real though unavailing concern must to heaven that anything must be said done on part might offer consolation to such distress will not torment with vain wish may seem purposely to ask for thanks unfortunate affair will fear prevent sister having pleasure of seeing at pemberley to day oh yes be so kind a to apologise for to miss darcy say that urgent business call home immediately conceal unhappy truth a long a be possible know can not be long readily assured of secrecy again expressed sorrow for distress wished happier conclusion than there be at present reason to hope leaving compliment for relation with only one serious parting look went away a quitted room elizabeth felt how improbable be that must ever see other again on such term of cordiality a have marked several meeting in derbyshire a threw retrospective glance over whole of acquaintance so full of contradiction variety sighed at perverseness of feeling must now have promoted continuance must formerly have rejoiced in termination if gratitude esteem be good foundation of affection elizabeth change of sentiment will be improbable faulty if otherwise if regard springing from such source be unreasonable unnatural in comparison of what be so often described a arising on first interview with object even before two word have be exchanged nothing can be said in defence except have given somewhat of trial to latter method in partiality for wickham that ill success might perhaps authorise to seek other le interesting mode of attachment be that a may saw go with regret in early example of what lydia infamy must produce found additional anguish a reflected on wretched business never since reading jane second letter have entertained hope of wickham meaning to marry one jane thought must flatter with expectation surprise be least of feeling on development while content of first letter remained in mind be surprise astonishment that wickham must marry girl whom be impossible must marry for money how lydia must ever have attached have appeared incomprehensible now be too natural for such attachment a might have sufficient charm though did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in elopement without intention of marriage have difficulty in believing that virtue understanding must preserve from falling easy prey have never perceived while regiment be in hertfordshire that lydia have partiality for be convinced that lydia wanted only encouragement to attach to anybody sometimes one officer sometimes have be favourite a attention raised in opinion affection have continually be fluctuating never without object mischief of neglect mistaken indulgence towards girl oh how acutely did now feel be wild to be at home to hear to see to be upon spot to share with jane in care must now fall wholly upon in family so deranged father absent mother incapable of exertion requiring constant attendance though almost persuaded that nothing must be done for lydia uncle interference seemed of utmost importance till entered room impatience be severe mr mr gardiner have hurried back in alarm supposing by servant account that niece be taken suddenly ill satisfying instantly on head eagerly communicated cause of summons reading two letter aloud dwelling on postscript of last with trembling energy though lydia have never be favourite with mr mr gardiner must not be deeply afflicted not lydia only be concerned in after first exclamation of surprise horror mr gardiner promised assistance in power elizabeth though expecting le thanked with tear of gratitude three being actuated by one spirit everything relating to journey be speedily settled be to be off a soon a possible what be to be done about pemberley cried mr gardiner john told mr darcy be here when sent for be so yes told must not be able to keep engagement be settled what be settled repeated other a ran into room to prepare be upon such term a for to disclose real truth oh knew how be wish be vain at least must only serve to amuse in hurry confusion of following hour have elizabeth be at leisure to be idle must have remained certain that employment be impossible to one so wretched a herself have share of business a well a aunt amongst rest there be note to be written to friend at lambton with false excuse for sudden departure hour however saw whole completed mr gardiner meanwhile having settled account at inn nothing remained to be done to go elizabeth after misery of morning found in shorter space of time than must have supposed seated in carriage on road to longbourn chapter have be thinking over again elizabeth said uncle a drove from town really upon serious consideration be much more inclined than be to judge a eldest sister doe on matter appears to so very unlikely that young man must form design against girl who be by mean unprotected friendless who be actually staying in colonel family that be strongly inclined to hope best must expect that friend must not step forward must expect to be noticed again by regiment after such affront to colonel forster temptation be not adequate to risk do really think so cried elizabeth brightening up for moment upon word said mr gardiner begin to be of uncle opinion be really too great violation of decency honour interest for to be guilty of can not think so very ill of wickham can lizzy so wholly give up a to believe capable of not perhaps of neglecting own interest of other neglect can believe capable if indeed must be so dare not hope why must not go on to scotland if have be case in first place replied mr gardiner there be absolute proof that be not gone to scotland oh removing from chaise into hackney coach be such presumption besides trace of be to be found on barnet road well then supposing to be in london may be there though for purpose of concealment for more exceptional purpose be not likely that money must be very abundant on side might strike that must be more economically though le expeditiously married in london than in scotland why secrecy why fear of detection why must marriage be private oh be not likely most particular friend see by jane account be persuaded of never intending to marry wickham will never marry woman without money can not afford what claim have lydia what attraction have beyond youth health good humour must make for sake forego chance of benefiting by marrying well a to what restraint apprehension of disgrace in corp might throw on dishonourable elopement with be not able to judge for know nothing of effect step might produce a to other objection be afraid will hardly hold good lydia have brother to step forward might imagine from father behaviour from indolence little attention have ever seemed to give to what be going forward in family that must do a little think a little about a father must do in matter can think that lydia be so lost to everything love of a to consent to live with on term other than marriage doe seem be most shocking indeed replied elizabeth with tear in eye that sister sense of decency virtue in such point must admit of doubt really know not what to say perhaps be not doing justice be very young have never be taught to think on serious subject for last half year nay for twelvemonth have be given up to nothing amusement vanity have be allowed to dispose of time in most idle frivolous manner to adopt opinion came in way since shire be first quartered in meryton nothing love flirtation officer have be in head have be doing everything in power by thinking talking on subject to give greater what will call susceptibility to feeling be naturally lively enough know that wickham have charm of person address can captivate woman see that jane said aunt doe not think so very ill of wickham a to believe capable of attempt of whom doe jane ever think ill who be there might be former conduct that must think capable of such attempt till be proved against jane know a well a do what wickham really be know that have be profligate in sense of word that have integrity honour that be a false deceitful a be insinuating do really know cried mr gardiner whose curiosity a to mode of intelligence be alive do indeed replied elizabeth colouring told other day of infamous behaviour to mr darcy when last at longbourn heard in what manner spoke of man who have behaved with such forbearance liberality towards there be other circumstance be not at liberty be not worth while to relate lie about whole pemberley family be endless from what said of miss darcy be thoroughly prepared to see proud reserved disagreeable girl yet knew to contrary must know that be a amiable unpretending a have found doe lydia know nothing of can be ignorant of what jane seem so well to understand oh yes that be worst of till be in kent saw so much of mr darcy relation colonel fitzwilliam be ignorant of truth when returned home shire be to leave meryton in week fortnight time a be case jane to whom related whole thought necessary to make knowledge public for of what use must apparently be to one that good opinion neighbourhood have of must then be overthrown even when be settled that lydia must go with mr forster necessity of opening eye to character never occurred to that must be in danger from deception never entered head that consequence a must ensue may easily believe be far enough from thought when removed to brighton therefore have reason suppose to believe fond of other not slightest can remember symptom of affection on side have anything of kind be perceptible must be aware that ours be not family on must be thrown away when first entered corp be ready enough to admire so be girl in near meryton be out of sens about for first two month never distinguished by particular attention consequently after moderate period of extravagant wild admiration fancy for gave way others of regiment who treated with more distinction again became favourite may be easily believed that however little of novelty must be added to fear hope conjecture on interesting subject by repeated discussion other must detain from long during whole of journey from elizabeth thought be never absent fixed there by keenest of anguish self reproach must find interval of ease forgetfulness travelled a expeditiously a possible sleeping one night on road reached longbourn by dinner time next day be comfort to elizabeth to consider jane must not have be wearied by long expectation little gardiner attracted by sight of chaise be standing on step of house a entered paddock when carriage drove up to door joyful surprise lighted up face displayed over whole body in variety of caper frisk be first pleasing earnest of welcome elizabeth jumped out after giving of hasty kiss hurried into vestibule where jane who came running down from mother apartment immediately met elizabeth a affectionately embraced whilst tear filled eye of lost not moment in asking whether anything have be heard of fugitive not yet replied jane now that dear uncle be come hope everything will be well be father in town yes went on tuesday a wrote word have heard from often have heard only twice wrote few line on wednesday to say that have arrived in safety to give direction particularly begged to do merely added that must not write again till have something of importance to mention mother how be how be mother be tolerably well trust though spirit be greatly shaken be upstairs will have great satisfaction in seeing doe not yet leave dressing room mary kitty thank heaven be quite well how be cried elizabeth look pale how much must have gone through sister however assured of being perfectly well conversation have be passing while mr mr gardiner be engaged with child be now put end to by approach of whole party jane ran to uncle aunt welcomed thanked with alternate smile tear when be in drawing room question elizabeth have already asked be of course repeated by others soon found that jane have intelligence to give sanguine hope of good however benevolence of heart suggested have not yet deserted still expected that must end well that morning must bring letter from lydia father to explain proceeding perhaps announce marriage mr bennet to whose apartment repaired after few minute conversation together received exactly a might be expected with tear lamentation of regret invective against villainous conduct of wickham complaint of own suffering ill usage blaming everybody person to whose ill judging indulgence error of daughter must principally be owing if have be able said to carry point in going to brighton with family must not have happened poor dear lydia have nobody to take care of why did forsters ever let go out of sight be sure there be great neglect other on side for be not kind of girl to do thing if have be well looked after always thought be very unfit to have charge of be overruled a always be poor dear child now here be mr bennet gone away know will fight wickham wherever meet then will be killed what be to become of collins will turn out before be cold in grave if be not kind to brother know what will do exclaimed against such terrific idea mr gardiner after general assurance of affection for family told that meant to be in london very next day must assist mr bennet in endeavour for recovering lydia give way to useless alarm added though be right to be prepared for worst there be occasion to look on a certain be not quite week since left brighton in few day more may gain news of till know that be not married have design of marrying let give matter over a lost a soon a get to town will go to brother make come home with to gracechurch street then may consult together a to what be to be done oh dear brother replied mr bennet be exactly what must most wish for now do when get to town find out wherever may be if be not married already make marry a for wedding clothes let wait for tell lydia will have a much money a chooses to buy after be married above keep mr bennet from fighting tell what dreadful state be in be frighted out of wit have such trembling such fluttering over such spasm in side pain in head such beating at heart can get rest by night by day tell dear lydia not to give direction about clothes till have seen for doe not know be best warehouse oh brother how kind be know will contrive mr gardiner though assured again of earnest endeavour in cause must not avoid recommending moderation to a well in hope a fear after talking with in manner till dinner be on table left to vent feeling on housekeeper who attended in absence of daughter though brother sister be persuaded that there be real occasion for seclusion from family did not attempt to oppose for knew that have not prudence enough to hold tongue before servant while waited at table judged better that one only of household one whom must most trust must comprehend fear solicitude on subject in dining room be soon joined by mary kitty who have be too busily engaged in separate apartment to make appearance before one came from book other from toilette face of however be tolerably calm change be visible in except that loss of favourite sister anger have incurred in business have given more of fretfulness than usual to accent of kitty a for mary be mistress enough of to whisper to elizabeth with countenance of grave reflection soon after be seated at table be most unfortunate affair will probably be much talked of must stem tide of malice pour into wounded bosom of other balm of sisterly consolation then perceiving in elizabeth inclination of replying added unhappy a event must be for

be not in power to give information of so satisfactory nature a compliment deserved have never heard of having have relation except father mother of whom have be dead many year be possible however that of companion in shire might be able to give more information though be not very sanguine in expecting application be something to look forward to day at longbourn be now day of anxiety most

from cause time can remove argument will be wanting on part can alleviate so severe misfortune may comfort under circumstance must be of others most afflicting to parent mind death of daughter must have be blessing in comparison of be more to be lamented because there be reason to suppose a dear charlotte informs that licentiousness of behaviour in daughter have proceeded from faulty degree of indulgence though at same time for consolation of mr bennet be inclined to think that own disposition must be naturally bad must not be guilty of such enormity at so early age howsoever may be be grievously to be pitied in opinion be not only joined by mr collins likewise by lady catherine daughter to whom have related affair agree with in apprehending that false step in one daughter will be injurious to fortune of others for who a lady catherine condescendingly say will connect with family consideration lead moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on certain event of last

single relationship with whom kept up connection be certain that have near one living former acquaintance have be numerous since have be in militia did not appear that be on term of particular

followed by letter from have ended in nothing elizabeth have received none since return must come from pemberley present unhappy state of family rendered other excuse for lowness of spirit unnecessary nothing therefore must be fairly conjectured from though elizabeth who be by time tolerably well acquainted with own feeling be perfectly aware that have known nothing of darcy must have borne dread of lydia infamy somewhat better must have spared thought one sleepless night out of two when mr bennet arrived have appearance of usual philosophic composure said a little a have ever be in habit of

to what have feared only two hour ago felt advantage of what have gained chapter mr bennet have very often wished before period of life that instead of spending whole income have laid by annual sum for better provision of child of wife if survived now wished more than ever have done duty in respect lydia need not have be indebted to uncle for whatever of honour credit must now be purchased for satisfaction of prevailing on one of most worthless young men in great britain to be husband might then have rested in proper place be seriously concerned that cause of so little advantage to anyone

parent be one point with regard to lydia at least be now to be settled mr bennet must have hesitation in acceding to proposal before in term of grateful acknowledgment for kindness of brother though expressed most concisely then delivered on paper perfect approbation of be done willingness to fulfil engagement have be made for have never before supposed must wickham be prevailed on to marry daughter must be done with so little inconvenience to a by present arrangement must scarcely be ten pound year loser by hundred be to be paid for what with board pocket allowance continual present in money passed to through mother hand lydia expense have be very little within sum that must be done with such trifling exertion on side too be very welcome surprise for wish at present be to have a little trouble in business a possible when first transport of rage have produced activity in seeking be over naturally returned to former indolence letter be soon dispatched for though dilatory in undertaking business be quick in execution begged to know further particular of what be indebted to brother be too angry with lydia to send message to good news spread quickly through house with proportionate speed through neighbourhood be borne in latter with decent philosophy to be sure must have be more for advantage of conversation have miss lydia bennet come upon town a happiest alternative be secluded from world in distant farmhouse there be much to be talked of in marrying good natured wish for well doing have proceeded before from spiteful old lady in meryton lost little of spirit in change of circumstance because with such husband misery be considered certain be fortnight since mr bennet have be downstairs on happy day again took seat at head of table in spirit oppressively high sentiment of shame gave damp to triumph marriage of daughter have be first object of wish since jane be sixteen be now on point of accomplishment thought word ran wholly on attendant of elegant nuptials fine muslin new carriage servant be busily searching through neighbourhood for proper situation for daughter without knowing considering what income might be rejected many a deficient in size importance haye park might do said if gouldings must quit great house at stoke if drawing room be larger ashworth be too far off must not bear to have ten mile from a for pulvis

understanding into one house in neighbourhood will never have admittance will not encourage impudence of by receiving at longbourn long dispute followed declaration mr bennet be firm soon led to mr bennet found with amazement horror that husband must not advance guinea to buy clothes for daughter protested that must receive from mark of affection on occasion mr bennet must hardly comprehend that anger must be carried to point of inconceivable resentment a to refuse daughter privilege without marriage must scarcely seem valid exceeded must believe possible be more alive to disgrace want of new clothes must reflect on daughter nuptials than to sense of shame at eloping living with fortnight before took place elizabeth be now most heartily sorry that have from distress of moment be led to make mr darcy acquainted with fear for sister for since marriage must so shortly give proper termination to elopement might hope to conceal unfavourable beginning from who be not immediately on spot have fear of spreading farther through mean there be few people on whose secrecy must have more confidently depended at same time there be one whose knowledge of sister frailty must have mortified so much not however from fear of disadvantage from individually to herself for at rate there seemed gulf impassable between have lydia marriage be concluded on most honourable term be not to be supposed that mr darcy must connect with family where to other objection must now be added alliance relationship of nearest kind with man whom so justly scorned from such connection must not wonder that must shrink wish of procuring regard have assured herself of feeling in derbyshire must not in rational expectation survive blow a be humbled be grieved repented though hardly knew of what became jealous of esteem when must no longer hope to be benefited by wanted to hear of when there seemed least chance of gaining intelligence be convinced that must have be happy with when be no longer likely must meet what triumph for a often thought must know that proposal have proudly spurned only four month ago must now have be most gladly gratefully received be a generous doubted not a most generous of sex while be mortal there must be triumph began now to comprehend that be exactly man who in disposition talent must most suit understanding temper though unlike own must have answered wish be union must have be to advantage of by ease liveliness mind might have be softened manner improved from judgement information knowledge of world must have received benefit of greater importance such happy marriage must now teach admiring multitude what connubial felicity really be union of different tendency precluding possibility of other be soon to be formed in family how wickham lydia be to be supported in tolerable independence must not imagine how little of permanent happiness must belong to couple who be only brought together because passion be stronger than virtue must easily conjecture mr gardiner soon wrote again to brother to mr bennet acknowledgment briefly replied with assurance of eagerness to promote welfare of of family concluded with entreaty that subject might never be mentioned to again principal purport of letter be to inform that mr wickham have resolved on quitting militia be greatly wish that must do so added a soon a marriage be fixed on think will agree with

will give trouble of carrying similar assurance to creditor in meryton of whom will subjoin list according to information have given in debt hope at least have not deceived haggerston have direction will be completed in week will then join regiment unless be first invited to longbourn understand from mr gardiner that niece be very desirous of seeing before leaf south be well begs to be dutifully remembered to mother yours etc e gardiner mr bennet daughter saw advantage of wickham removal from shire a clearly a mr gardiner must do mr bennet be not so well pleased with lydia being settled in north just when have expected most pleasure pride in company for have by mean given up plan of residing in hertfordshire be severe disappointment besides be such pity that lydia must be taken from regiment where be acquainted with everybody have so many favourite be so fond of mr forster said will be quite shocking to send away there be several of young men too that like very much officer may not be so pleasant in general regiment daughter request for such might be considered of being admitted into family again before set off for north received at first absolute negative jane elizabeth who agreed in wishing for sake of sister feeling consequence that must be noticed on marriage by parent urged so earnestly yet so rationally so mildly to receive husband at longbourn a soon a be married that be prevailed on to think a thought act a wished mother have satisfaction of knowing that must be able to show married daughter in neighbourhood before be banished to north when mr bennet wrote again to brother therefore sent permission for to come be settled that a soon a ceremony be over must proceed to longbourn elizabeth be surprised however that wickham must consent to scheme have

return in by dinner time arrival be dreaded by elder miss bennet jane more especially who gave feeling must have attended have be culprit be wretched in thought of what sister must endure came family be assembled in breakfast room to receive smile decked face of mr bennet a carriage drove up to door husband looked impenetrably grave daughter alarmed anxious uneasy lydia voice be heard in vestibule door be thrown open ran into room mother stepped forward embraced welcomed with rapture gave hand with affectionate smile to wickham who followed lady wished joy with alacrity shewed doubt of happiness reception from mr bennet to whom then turned be not quite so cordial countenance rather gained in austerity scarcely opened lip easy assurance of young couple indeed be enough to provoke elizabeth be disgusted even miss bennet be shocked lydia be lydia still untamed unabashed wild noisy fearless turned from sister to sister demanding congratulation when at length sat down looked eagerly round room took notice of little alteration in observed with laugh that be great while since have be there wickham be not at more distressed than manner be always so pleasing that have character marriage be exactly what ought smile easy address while claimed relationship must have delighted elizabeth have not before believed quite equal to such assurance sat down resolving within to draw limit in future to impudence of impudent man blushed jane blushed cheek of two who caused confusion suffered variation of colour there be want of discourse bride mother must neither of talk fast enough wickham who happened to sit near elizabeth began inquiring after acquaintance in neighbourhood with good humoured ease felt very unable to equal in reply seemed of to have happiest memory in world nothing of past be recollected with pain lydia led voluntarily to subject sister must not have alluded to for world only think of being three month cried since went away seems fortnight declare yet there have be thing enough happened in time good gracious when went away be sure have more idea of being married till came back again though thought must be very good fun if be father lifted up

before left london be to join regiment at end of fortnight one mr bennet regretted that stay must be so short made most of time by visiting about with daughter having very frequent party at home party be acceptable to to avoid family circle be even more desirable to such a did think than such a did not wickham affection for lydia be just what elizabeth have expected to find not equal to lydia for have scarcely needed present observation to be satisfied from reason of thing elopement have be brought on by strength of love rather than by must have wondered why without violently caring for chose to elope with at have not felt certain that flight be rendered necessary by distress of circumstance if be case be not young man to resist opportunity of having companion lydia be exceedingly fond of

did not say what then took large house in edward street have since maintained by letting lodging mr younge be knew intimately acquainted with wickham went to for intelligence of a soon a got to town be two three day before must get from what wanted must not betray trust suppose without bribery corruption for really did know where friend be to be found wickham indeed have gone to on first arrival in london have be able to receive into house must have taken up abode with at length however kind friend procured wished for direction be in street saw wickham afterwards insisted on seeing lydia first object with acknowledged have be to persuade to quit present disgraceful situation return to friend a soon a must be prevailed on to receive offering assistance a far a must go found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where be cared for none of friend wanted help of must not hear of leaving wickham be sure must be married time other did not much signify when since such be feeling

pressing scrupled not to lay ill consequence of lydia flight on own folly alone meant to resign commission immediately a to future situation must conjecture very little about must go somewhere did not know where knew must have nothing to live on mr darcy asked why have not married sister at once though mr bennet be not imagined to be very rich must have be able to do something for situation must have be benefited by marriage found in reply to question that wickham still cherished hope of more effectually making fortune by marriage in other country under such circumstance however be not likely to be proof against temptation of immediate relief met several time for there be much to be discussed wickham of course wanted more than must get at length be reduced to be reasonable thing being settled between mr darcy next step be to make uncle acquainted with first called in gracechurch street evening before came home mr gardiner must not be seen mr darcy found on further inquiry that

sorely against grain really believe letter morning gave great pleasure because required explanation must rob of borrowed feather give praise where be due lizzy must go farther than jane at most know pretty well suppose what have be done for young people debt be to be paid amounting believe to considerably more than thousand pound thousand in addition to own settled upon commission purchased reason why be to be done by alone be such a have given above be owing to to reserve want of proper consideration that wickham character have be so misunderstood consequently that have be received noticed a be perhaps there be truth in though doubt whether reserve anybody reserve can be answerable for event in spite of fine talking dear lizzy may rest perfectly assured that uncle must never have yielded if have not given credit for interest in affair when be resolved on returned again to friend who be still staying at pemberley be agreed that must be in london once more when wedding took

nothing so bad a parting with one friend one seems so forlorn without be consequence see madam of marrying daughter said elizabeth must make better satisfied that other four be single be such thing lydia doe not leave because be married only because husband regiment happens to be so far off if have be nearer must not have gone so soon spiritless condition event threw into be shortly relieved mind opened again to agitation of hope by article of news then began to be in circulation housekeeper at netherfield have received order to prepare for arrival of master who be coming down in day two to shoot there for several week mr bennet be quite in fidget looked at jane smiled shook head by turn well well so mr bingley be coming down sister for mr phillips first brought news well so much

report know appeared distressed imagine be from silly cause be only confused for moment because felt must be looked at do assure that news doe not affect with pleasure pain be glad of one thing that come alone because will see le of not that be afraid of dread other people remark elizabeth did not know what to make of have not seen in derbyshire might have supposed capable of coming there with other view than what be acknowledged still thought partial to jane wavered a to greater probability of coming there with friend permission being bold enough to come without yet be hard sometimes thought that poor man can not come to house have legally hired without raising speculation will leave to in spite of what sister declared really believed to be feeling in expectation of arrival elizabeth must easily perceive that spirit be affected by be more disturbed more unequal than have often seen subject have be so warmly canvassed between parent about twelvemonth ago be now brought forward again a soon a ever mr bingley come dear said mr bennet will wait on of course forced into visiting last year promised if went to see must marry one of daughter ended in nothing will not be sent on fool errand again wife represented to how absolutely necessary attention must be from neighbouring gentleman on returning to netherfield 't be etiquette despise said if want society let seek know where live will not spend hour in running after neighbour time go away come back again well know be that will be abominably rude if wait on however sha prevent asking to dine here be determined must have mr long gouldings soon will make thirteen with ourselves so there will be just room at table for consoled by resolution be better able to bear husband incivility though be very mortifying to know that neighbour might see mr bingley in consequence of before did a day of arrival drew near begin to be sorry that come at said jane to sister must be nothing must see with perfect indifference can hardly bear to hear thus perpetually talked of mother mean well doe not know one can know how much suffer from what say happy will be when stay at netherfield be over wish must say anything to comfort replied elizabeth be wholly out of power must feel usual satisfaction of preaching patience to sufferer be denied because have always so much mr bingley arrived mr bennet through assistance of servant contrived to have earliest tidings of that period of anxiety fretfulness on side might be a long a must counted day must intervene before invitation must be sent hopeless of seeing before on third morning after arrival in hertfordshire saw from dressing room window enter paddock ride towards house daughter be eagerly called to partake of joy jane resolutely kept place at table elizabeth to satisfy mother went to window looked saw mr darcy with sat down again by sister there be gentleman with mamma said kitty who can be acquaintance other dear suppose be sure know la replied kitty look just like man used to be with before mr what be name that tall proud man good gracious mr darcy so doe vow well friend of mr bingley will always be welcome here to be sure else must say that hate very sight of jane looked at elizabeth with surprise concern knew little of meeting in derbyshire therefore felt for awkwardness must attend sister in seeing almost for first time after receiving explanatory letter sister be uncomfortable enough felt for other of course for mother talked on of dislike of mr darcy resolution to be civil to only a mr bingley friend without being heard by of elizabeth have source of uneasiness must not be suspected by jane to whom have never yet have courage to shew mr gardiner letter to relate own change of sentiment towards to jane must be only man whose proposal have refused whose merit have undervalued to own more extensive information be person to whom whole family be indebted for first of benefit whom regarded with interest if not quite so tender at least a reasonable just a what jane felt for bingley astonishment at coming at coming to netherfield to longbourn voluntarily seeking again be almost equal to what have known on first witnessing altered behaviour in derbyshire colour have be driven from face returned for minute with additional glow smile of delight added lustre to eye a thought for space of time that affection wish must still be unshaken must not be secure let first see how behaves said will then be early enough for expectation sat intently at work striving to be composed without daring to lift up eye till anxious curiosity carried to face of sister a servant be approaching door jane looked little paler than usual more sedate than elizabeth have expected on gentleman appearing colour increased yet received with tolerable ease with propriety of behaviour equally free from symptom of resentment unnecessary complaisance elizabeth said a little to a civility must allow sat down again to work with eagerness did not often command have ventured only one glance at darcy looked serious a usual thought more a have be used to look in hertfordshire than a have seen at pemberley perhaps must not in mother presence be what be before uncle aunt be painful not improbable conjecture bingley have likewise seen for instant in short period saw looking pleased embarrassed be received by mr bennet with degree of civility made two daughter ashamed especially when contrasted with cold ceremonious politeness of curtsey address to friend elizabeth particularly who knew that mother owed to latter preservation of favourite daughter from irremediable infamy be hurt distressed to most painful degree by distinction so ill applied darcy after inquiring of how mr mr gardiner did question must not answer without confusion said scarcely anything be not seated by perhaps be reason of silence have not be so in derbyshire there have talked to friend when must not to herself now several minute elapsed without bringing sound of voice when occasionally unable to resist impulse of curiosity raised eye to face a often found looking at jane a at herself frequently on object ground more thoughtfulness le anxiety to please than when last met be plainly expressed be disappointed angry with for being so must expect to be otherwise said yet why did come be in humour for conversation with anyone to have hardly courage to speak inquired after sister must do more be long time mr bingley since went away said mr bennet readily agreed to began to be afraid must never come back again people did say meant to quit place entirely at michaelmas however hope be not true great many change have happened in neighbourhood since went away miss lucas be married settled one of own daughter suppose have heard of indeed must have seen in paper be in time courier know though be not put in a ought to be be only said 'lately george wickham esq to miss lydia bennet without there being syllable said of father place where lived anything be brother gardiner drawing up too wonder how came to make such awkward business of did see bingley replied that did made congratulation elizabeth dared not lift up eye how mr darcy looked therefore must not tell be delightful thing to be sure to have daughter well married continued mother at same time mr bingley be very hard to have taken way from be gone down to newcastle place quite northward seems there be to stay know how long regiment be there for suppose have heard of leaving shire of being gone into regular thank heaven have friend though perhaps not so many a deserves elizabeth who knew to be levelled at mr darcy be in such misery of shame that must hardly keep seat drew from however exertion of speaking nothing else have so effectually done before asked bingley whether meant to make stay in country at present few week believed when have killed own bird mr bingley said mother beg will come here shoot a many a please on mr bennet manor be sure will be vastly happy to oblige will save best of covies for elizabeth misery increased at such unnecessary such officious attention be same fair prospect to arise at present a have flattered year ago thing be persuaded must be hastening to same vexatious conclusion at instant felt that year of happiness must not make jane amends for moment of such painful confusion first wish of heart said to be never more to be in company with of society can afford pleasure will atone for such wretchedness a let never see one other again yet misery for year of happiness be to offer compensation received soon afterwards material relief from observing how much beauty of sister re kindled admiration of former lover when first came in have spoken to little five minute seemed to be giving more of attention found a handsome a have be last year a good natured a unaffected though not quite so chatty jane be anxious that difference must be perceived in at be really persuaded that talked a much a ever mind be so busily engaged that did not always know when be silent when gentleman rose to go away mr bennet be mindful of intended civility be invited engaged to dine at longbourn in few day time be quite visit in debt mr bingley added for when went to town last winter promised to take family dinner with a soon a returned have not forgot see assure be very much disappointed that did not come back keep engagement bingley looked little silly at reflection said something of concern at having be prevented by business then went away mr bennet have be strongly inclined to ask to stay dine there day though always kept very good table did not think anything le than two course must be good enough for man on whom have such anxious design satisfy appetite pride of one who have ten thousand year chapter a soon a be gone elizabeth walked out to recover spirit in other word to dwell without interruption on subject must deaden more mr darcy behaviour astonished vexed why if came only to be silent grave indifferent said did come at must settle in way gave pleasure must be still amiable still pleasing to uncle aunt when be in town why not to if fear why come hither if no longer care for why silent teasing teasing man will think more about resolution be for short time involuntarily kept by approach of sister who joined with cheerful look showed better satisfied with visitor than elizabeth now said that first meeting be over feel perfectly easy know own strength will never be embarrassed again by coming be glad dines here on tuesday will then be publicly seen that on side meet only a common indifferent acquaintance yes very indifferent indeed said elizabeth laughingly oh jane take care dear lizzy can not think so weak a to be in danger now think be in very great danger of making a much in love with a ever did not see gentleman again till tuesday mr bennet in meanwhile be giving way to happy scheme good humour common politeness of bingley in hour visit have revived on tuesday there be large party assembled at longbourn two who be most anxiously expected to credit of punctuality a sportsman be in very good time when repaired to dining room elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley must take place in former party have belonged to by sister prudent mother occupied by same idea forbore to invite to sit by on entering room seemed to hesitate jane happened to look round happened to smile be decided placed by elizabeth with triumphant sensation looked towards friend bore with noble indifference must have imagined that bingley have received sanction to be happy have not seen eye likewise turned towards mr darcy with expression of half laughing alarm behaviour to sister be such during dinner time a showed admiration of though more guarded than formerly persuaded elizabeth that if left wholly to jane happiness own must be speedily secured though dared not depend upon consequence yet received pleasure from observing behaviour gave animation that spirit must boast for be in cheerful humour mr darcy be almost a far from a table must divide be on one side of mother knew how little such situation must give pleasure to make appear to advantage be not near enough to hear of discourse must see how seldom spoke to other how formal cold be manner whenever did mother ungraciousness made sense of what owed more painful to elizabeth mind must at time have given anything to be privileged to tell that kindness be unknown unfelt by whole of family be in hope that evening must afford opportunity of bringing together that whole of visit must not pas away without enabling to enter into something more of conversation than mere ceremonious salutation attending entrance anxious uneasy period passed in drawing room before gentleman came be wearisome dull to degree almost made uncivil looked forward to entrance a point on chance of pleasure for evening must depend if doe not come to then said will give up for ever gentleman came thought looked a if must have answered hope ala lady have crowded round table where miss bennet be making tea elizabeth pouring out coffee in so close confederacy that there be not single vacancy near must admit of chair on gentleman approaching one of girl moved closer to than ever said in whisper men sha come part be determined want none of do darcy have walked away to part of room followed with eye envied everyone to whom spoke have scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee then be enraged against for being so silly man who have once be refused how must ever be foolish enough to expect renewal of love be there one among sex who must not protest against weakness a second proposal to same woman there be indignity so abhorrent to feeling be little revived however by bringing back coffee cup seized opportunity of saying be sister at pemberley still yes will remain there till christmas quite alone have friend left mr annesley be with others have be gone on to scarborough three week must think of nothing more to say if wished to converse with might have better success stood by however for minute in silence at last on young lady whispering to elizabeth again walked away when tea thing be removed card table placed lady rose elizabeth be then hoping to be soon joined by when view be overthrown by seeing fall victim to mother rapacity for whist player in few moment after seated with rest of party now lost expectation of pleasure be confined for evening at different table have nothing to hope that eye be so often turned towards side of room a to make play a unsuccessfully a mr bennet have designed to keep two netherfield gentleman to supper carriage be unluckily ordered before of others have opportunity of detaining well girl said a soon a be left to what say to day think thing have passed off uncommonly well assure dinner be a well dressed a ever saw venison be roasted to turn everybody said never saw so fat haunch soup be fifty time better than what have at lucas last week even mr darcy acknowledged that partridge be remarkably well done suppose have two three french cook at least dear jane never saw look in greater beauty mr long said so too for asked whether did not what do think said besides 'ah mr bennet will have at netherfield at last did indeed do think mr long be a good creature a ever lived niece be very pretty behaved girl not at handsome like prodigiously mr bennet in short be in very great spirit have seen enough of bingley behaviour to jane to be convinced that must get at last expectation of advantage to family when in happy humour be so far beyond reason that be quite disappointed at not seeing there again next day to make proposal have be very agreeable day said miss bennet to elizabeth party seemed so well selected so suitable one with other hope may often meet again elizabeth smiled lizzy must not do so must not suspect mortifies assure have now learnt to enjoy conversation a agreeable sensible young man without having wish beyond be perfectly satisfied from what manner now be that never have design of engaging affection be only that be blessed with greater sweetness of address stronger desire of generally pleasing than other man be very cruel said sister will not let smile be provoking to moment how hard be in case to be believed how impossible in others why must wish to persuade that feel more than acknowledge be question hardly know how to answer love to instruct though can teach only what be not worth knowing forgive if persist in indifference make confidante chapter few day after

two obstacle of five being thus removed mr bennet sat looking winking at elizabeth catherine for considerable time without making impression on elizabeth must not observe when at last kitty did very innocently said what be matter mamma what do keep winking at for what be to hing child nothing did not wink at then sat still five minute longer unable to waste such precious occasion suddenly got up saying to kitty come here love want to speak to took out of room jane instantly gave look at elizabeth spoke distress at such premeditation entreaty that must not give in to in few minute mr bennet

particularly grateful to daughter scarcely needed invitation to stay supper before went away engagement be formed chiefly through own mr bennet mean for coming next morning to shoot with husband after

for a others be going to sit down to card must not be wanted to counteract mother scheme on returning to drawing room when letter be finished saw to infinite surprise there be reason to fear that mother have be too ingenious for on opening door perceived sister bingley standing together over hearth a if engaged in earnest conversation have led to suspicion face of a hastily turned round moved away from other must have told situation be awkward enough hers thought be still worse not syllable be uttered by elizabeth be on point of going away again when bingley who a well a other have sat down suddenly rose whispering few word to sister ran out of room jane must have reserve from elizabeth where confidence must give pleasure instantly embracing acknowledged with liveliest emotion that be happiest creature in world 't be too much added by far too much deserve oh why be not everybody a happy elizabeth congratulation be given with sincerity warmth delight word must poorly express

elizabeth honestly heartily expressed delight in prospect of relationship shook hand with great cordiality then till sister came down have to listen to have to say of own happiness of jane perfection in spite of being lover elizabeth really believed expectation of felicity to be rationally founded because have for basis excellent understanding super excellent disposition of jane general similarity of feeling taste between be evening of common delight to satisfaction of miss bennet mind gave glow of such sweet animation to face a made look handsomer than ever kitty simpered smiled hoped turn be

of separation must sometimes occur in absence of jane always attached to elizabeth for pleasure of talking of when bingley be gone jane constantly sought same mean of relief have made so happy said one evening by telling that be totally ignorant of being in town last spring have not believed possible suspected a much replied elizabeth how did account for must have be sister doing be certainly no

door of dressing room to ask why lady catherine must not come in again rest did not choose said daughter must go be very fine looking woman calling here be prodigiously civil for only came suppose to tell collins be well be on road somewhere dare say so passing through meryton thought might a well call on suppose have nothing particular to say to lizzy elizabeth be forced to give into little falsehood here for to acknowledge substance of conversation be impossible chapter discomposure of spirit extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into must not be easily overcome must for many hour learn to think of le than incessantly lady catherine appeared have actually taken trouble of journey from rosings for sole purpose of breaking off supposed engagement with mr darcy be rational scheme to be sure from what report of engagement must originate elizabeth be at loss to imagine till recollected that being intimate friend of bingley being sister of jane be enough at time when expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for to supply idea have not forgotten to feel that marriage of sister must bring more frequently together neighbour at lucas lodge therefore for through communication with collins report concluded have reached lady catherine have only set that down a almost certain immediate have looked forward to a possible at future time in revolving lady catherine expression however must not help feeling uneasiness a to possible consequence of persisting in interference from what have said of resolution to prevent marriage occurred to elizabeth that must meditate application to nephew how might take similar representation of evil attached to connection with dared not pronounce knew not exact degree of affection for aunt dependence on judgment be natural to suppose that thought much higher of ladyship than must do be certain that in enumerating misery of marriage with one whose immediate connection be so unequal to own aunt must address on weakest side with notion of dignity must probably feel that argument to elizabeth have appeared weak ridiculous contained much good sense solid reasoning if have be wavering before a to what must do have often seemed likely advice entreaty of so near relation might settle doubt determine at once to be a happy a dignity unblemished must make in case must return more lady catherine might see in way through town engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way if therefore excuse for not keeping promise must come to friend within few day added will know how to understand will then give over expectation wish of constancy if be satisfied with only regretting when might have obtained affection hand will soon cease to regret at surprise of rest of family on hearing who visitor have be be very great obligingly satisfied with same kind of supposition have appeased mr bennet curiosity elizabeth be spared from much teasing on subject next morning a be going downstairs be met by father who came out of library with letter in hand lizzy said be going to look for come into room followed thither curiosity to know what have to tell be heightened by supposition of being in manner connected with letter held suddenly struck that might be from lady catherine anticipated with dismay consequent explanation followed father to fire place sat down then said have received letter morning have astonished exceedingly a principally concern ought to know content did not know before have two daughter on brink of matrimony let congratulate on very important conquest colour now rushed into elizabeth cheek in instantaneous conviction of being letter from nephew instead of aunt be undetermined whether most to be pleased that explained at offended that letter be not rather addressed to herself when father continued look conscious young lady have great penetration in such matter a think may defy even sagacity to discover name of admirer letter be from mr collins from mr collins what can have to say something very much to purpose of course begin with congratulation on approaching nuptials of eldest daughter of seems have be told by of good natured gossiping lucas will not sport with impatience by reading what say on point what relates to be a follows 'having thus offered sincere congratulation of mr collins on happy event let now add short hint on subject of of have be advertised by same authority daughter elizabeth be presumed will not long bear name of bennet after elder sister have resigned chosen partner of fate may be reasonably looked up to a one of most illustrious personage in land ' can possibly guess lizzy who be meant by 'this young gentleman be blessed in peculiar way with thing heart of mortal can most desire splendid property noble kindred extensive patronage yet in

who gentleman be now come out bey motive for cautioning be a follows have reason to imagine that aunt lady catherine de bourgh doe not look on match with friendly eye mr darcy see be man now lizzy think have surprised must lucas have pitched on man within circle of acquaintance whose name must have given lie more effectually to what related mr darcy who never look at woman to see blemish who probably never looked at in life be admirable elizabeth tried to join in father pleasantry must only force one most reluctant smile never have wit be directed in manner so little agreeable to be not diverted oh yes pray read on 'after mentioning likelihood of marriage to ladyship last night immediately with usual condescension expressed what felt on occasion when became apparent that on score of family objection on part of cousin must never give consent to what termed so disgraceful match thought duty to give speediest intelligence of to cousin that noble admirer may be aware of what be about

affronted at idle report for what do live to make sport for neighbour laugh at in turn oh cried elizabeth be excessively diverted be so strange yes be what make amusing have fixed on other man must have be nothing perfect indifference pointed dislike make so delightfully absurd much a abominate writing must not give up mr collins correspondence for consideration nay when read letter of can not help giving preference even over wickham much a value impudence hypocrisy of son in law pray lizzy what said lady catherine about report did call to refuse consent to question daughter replied only with laugh a have be asked without least suspicion be not distressed by repeating elizabeth have never be more at loss to make feeling appear what be not be necessary to laugh when must rather have cried father have most cruelly mortified by what said of mr darcy indifference must hing wonder at want of penetration fear that perhaps instead of seeing too little might have fancied too much chapter instead of receiving such letter of excuse from friend a elizabeth half expected mr bingley to do be able to bring darcy with to longbourn before many day have passed after lady catherine visit gentleman arrived early before mr bennet have time to tell of having seen aunt of daughter sat in momentary dread bingley who wanted to be alone with jane proposed walking out be agreed to mr bennet be not in habit of walking mary must never spare time remaining five set off together bingley jane however soon allowed others to outstrip lagged behind while elizabeth kitty darcy be to entertain other very little be said by kitty be too much afraid of to talk elizabeth be secretly forming desperate resolution perhaps might be doing same walked towards lucas because kitty wished to call upon maria a elizabeth saw occasion for making general concern when kitty left went boldly on with alone now be moment for resolution to be executed while courage be high immediately said mr darcy be very selfish creature for sake of giving relief to own feeling care not how much may be wounding yours can no longer help thanking for unexampled kindness to poor sister ever since have known have be most anxious to acknowledge to how gratefully feel be known to rest of family must not have merely own gratitude to express be sorry exceedingly sorry replied darcy in tone of surprise emotion that have ever be informed of what may in mistaken light have given uneasiness did not think mr gardiner be so little to be trusted must not blame aunt lydia thoughtlessness first betrayed to that have be concerned in matter of course must not rest till knew particular let thank again again in name of family for generous compassion induced to take so much trouble bear so many mortification for sake of discovering if will thank replied let be for alone that wish of giving happiness to might add force to other inducement led on will not attempt to deny family owe nothing much a respect believe thought only of elizabeth be too much embarrassed to say word after short pause companion added be too generous to trifle with if feeling be still what be last april tell so at once affection wish be unchanged one word from will silence on subject for ever elizabeth feeling more than common awkwardness anxiety of situation now forced to speak immediately though not very fluently gave to understand that sentiment have undergone so material change since period to alluded a to make receive with gratitude pleasure present assurance happiness reply produced be such a have probably never felt before expressed on occasion a sensibly a warmly a man violently in love can be supposed to do have elizabeth be able to encounter eye might have seen how well expression of heartfelt delight diffused over face became though must not look must listen told of feeling in proving of what importance be to made affection moment more valuable walked on without knowing in what direction there be too much to be thought felt said for attention to other object soon learnt that be indebted for present good understanding to effort of aunt who did call on in return through london there relate

hope before knew enough of disposition to be certain that have be absolutely irrevocably decided against must have acknowledged to lady catherine frankly openly elizabeth coloured laughed a replied yes know enough of frankness to believe capable of after abusing so abominably to face must have scruple in abusing to relation what did say of did not deserve for though accusation be ill founded formed on mistaken premise behaviour to at time have merited severest reproof be unpardonable can not think of without abhorrence will not quarrel for greater share of blame annexed to evening said

attended to how soon other wish introduced can hardly tell believe in about hour after have seen then told of georgiana delight in acquaintance of disappointment at sudden interruption naturally leading to cause of interruption soon learnt that resolution of following from derbyshire in quest of sister have be formed before quitted inn that gravity thoughtfulness there have arisen from other struggle than what purpose must comprehend expressed gratitude again be too painful subject to to be dwelt on farther after walking several mile in leisurely manner too busy to know anything about

have narrowly observed during two visit have lately made here be convinced of affection assurance of suppose carried immediate conviction to did bingley be most unaffectedly modest diffidence have prevented depending on own judgment in so anxious case reliance on mine made thing easy be obliged to confess one thing for time not unjustly offended must not allow to conceal that sister have be in town three month last winter have known purposely kept from be angry anger be persuaded lasted no longer than remained in doubt of sister sentiment have heartily forgiven now elizabeth longed to observe mr bingley have be most delightful friend so easily guided that worth be invaluable checked remembered that have yet to learn to be laughed at be rather too early to begin in anticipating happiness of bingley of course be to be inferior only to own continued conversation till reached house in hall parted chapter dear lizzy where can have be walking to be question elizabeth received from jane a soon a entered room from others when sat down to table have only to say in reply that have wandered about till be beyond own knowledge coloured a spoke that anything else awakened suspicion of truth evening passed quietly unmarked by anything extraordinary acknowledged lover talked laughed unacknowledged be silent darcy be not of disposition in happiness overflow in mirth elizabeth agitated confused rather knew that be happy than felt to be so for besides immediate embarrassment there be other evil before anticipated what must be felt in family when situation became known be aware that one liked jane even feared that with others be dislike not fortune consequence might do away at night opened heart to jane though suspicion be very far from miss bennet general

marriage be acknowledged night spent in conversation good gracious cried mr bennet a stood at window next morning if disagreeable mr darcy be not coming here again with dear bingley what can mean by being so tiresome a to be always coming here have notion must go shooting something other not disturb with company what will do with lizzy must walk out with again that may not be in bingley way elizabeth must hardly help laughing at so convenient proposal yet be really vexed that mother must be always giving such epithet a soon a entered bingley looked at so expressively shook hand with such warmth a left doubt of good information soon afterwards said aloud mr bennet have more lane hereabouts in lizzy may lose way again to day advise mr darcy lizzy kitty said mr bennet to walk to oakham

to hope will not mind be for jane sake know there be occasion for talking to except just now then so put to inconvenience during walk be resolved that mr bennet consent must be asked in course of evening elizabeth reserved to herself application for mother must not determine how mother must take sometimes doubting whether wealth grandeur must be enough to overcome abhorrence of man whether be violently set against match violently delighted with be certain that manner must be equally ill adapted to do credit to sense must no more bear that mr darcy must hear first rapture of joy than first vehemence of disapprobation in evening soon after mr bennet withdrew to library saw mr darcy rise also follow agitation on seeing be extreme did not fear father opposition be going to be made unhappy that must be through mean that favourite child must be distressing by choice must be filling with fear regret in disposing of be wretched reflection sat in misery till mr darcy appeared again when looking at be little relieved by smile in few minute approached table where be sitting with kitty while pretending to admire work said in whisper go to father want in library be gone directly father

successively did not repent sooner be father funeral over than mr john dashwood without sending notice of intention to mother in law arrived with child attendant one must dispute right to come house be husband from moment of father decease indelicacy of conduct be so much greater to woman in mr dashwood situation with only common feeling must have be highly unpleasing in mind there be sense of honor so keen generosity so romantic that offence of kind by whomsoever given received be to source of immovable disgust mr john dashwood have never be favourite with of husband family have have opportunity till present of showing with how little attention to comfort of other people must act when occasion required so acutely did mr dashwood feel ungracious behaviour so earnestly did despise daughter in law for on arrival of latter must have quitted house for ever have not entreaty of eldest girl induced first to reflect on propriety of going own tender love for three child determined

in greater degree that sanguine expectation of happiness be happiness in sorrow must be equally carried away by fancy a far beyond consolation a in pleasure be beyond alloy mr john dashwood did not at approve of what husband intended to do for sister to take three thousand pound from fortune of dear little boy must be impoverishing to most dreadful degree begged to think again on subject how must answer to to rob child only child too of so large sum what possible claim must miss dashwoods who be related to only by half blood considered a relationship at have on generosity to so large amount be very well known that affection be ever supposed to exist between child of man by different marriage why be to ruin poor little harry by giving away money to half sister be father last request to replied husband must assist widow daughter did not know what be talking of dare say ten to one be light headed at time have be in right sens must not have thought of such thing a begging to give away fortune from own child did not stipulate for particular sum dear fanny only requested in general term to assist make situation more comfortable than be in power to do perhaps must have be a well if have left wholly to myself must hardly suppose must neglect a required promise must not do le than give at least thought so at time promise therefore be given must be performed something must be done for whenever leave settle in new home well then let something be done for that something need not be three thousand pound consider added that when money be once parted with never can return sister will marry will be gone for ever if indeed must be restored to poor little boy why to be sure said husband very gravely that must make great difference time may come when harry will regret that so large sum be parted with if must have numerous family for instance must be very convenient addition to be sure must perhaps then must be better for party if sum be diminished one half five hundred pound must be prodigious increase to fortune oh beyond anything great what brother on earth must do half so much for sister even if really sister a be only half blood have generous spirit must not wish to do thing mean replied one have rather on such occasion do too much than too little one at least can think have not done enough for even can hardly expect more there be knowing what may expect said lady be not to think of expectation question be what can afford to do certainly think may afford to give five hundred pound piece a be without addition of mine will have about three thousand pound on mother death very comfortable fortune for young woman to be sure be indeed strike that can want addition at will have ten thousand pound divided amongst if marry will be sure of doing well if may live very comfortably together on interest of ten thousand pound be very true therefore know whether upon whole must not be more advisable to do something for mother while life rather than for something of annuity kind mean sister must feel good effect of a well a hundred year must make perfectly comfortable wife hesitated little however in giving consent to plan to be sure said be better than parting with fifteen hundred pound at once then if mr dashwood must live fifteen year will be completely taken in fifteen year dear fanny life can not be worth half purchase certainly not if observe people always live for ever when there be annuity to be paid be very stout healthy hardly forty annuity be very serious business come over over year there be getting rid of be not aware of what be doing have known great deal of trouble of annuity for mother be clogged with payment of three to old superannuated servant by father will be amazing how disagreeable found twice year annuity be to be paid then there be trouble of getting to then one of be said to have died afterwards turned out to be such thing mother be quite sick of income be not own said with such perpetual claim on be more unkind in father because otherwise money must have be entirely at mother disposal without restriction whatever have given such abhorrence of annuity be sure must not pin down to payment of one for world be certainly unpleasant thing replied mr dashwood to have kind of yearly drain on one income one fortune a mother justly say be not one own to be tied down to regular payment of such sum on rent day be by mean desirable take away one independence undoubtedly after have thanks for think secure do more than what be expected raise gratitude at if be did must be done at own discretion entirely must not bind to allow thing yearly may be very inconvenient year to spare hundred even fifty pound from own expense believe be right love will be better that there must be annuity in case may give occasionally will be of far greater assistance than yearly allowance because must only enlarge style of living if felt sure of larger income must not be sixpence richer for at end of year will certainly be much best way present of fifty pound now then will prevent ever being distressed for money will think be amply discharging promise to father to be sure will indeed to say truth be convinced within that father have idea of giving money at assistance thought of dare say be only such a might be reasonably expected of for instance such a looking out for comfortable small house for helping to move thing sending present of fish game so forth whenever be in season will lay life that meant nothing farther indeed must be very strange unreasonable if did do consider dear mr dashwood how excessively comfortable mother in law daughter may live on interest of seven thousand pound besides thousand pound belonging to of girl brings in fifty pound year piece of course will pay mother for board out of altogether will have five hundred year amongst what on earth can four woman want for more than that will live so cheap housekeeping will be nothing at will have carriage horse hardly servant will keep company can have expense of kind only conceive how comfortable will be five hundred year be sure can not imagine how will spend half of a to giving more be quite absurd to think of will be much more able to give something upon word said mr dashwood believe be perfectly right father certainly must mean nothing more by request to than what say clearly understand now will strictly fulfil engagement by such act of assistance kindness to a have described when mother remove into house service will be readily given to accommodate a far a can little present of furniture too may be acceptable then certainly returned mr john dashwood however one thing must be considered when father mother moved to norland though furniture of stanhill be sold china plate linen be saved be now left to mother house will therefore be almost completely fitted up a soon a take be material consideration undoubtedly valuable legacy indeed yet of plate must have be very pleasant addition to own stock here yes set of breakfast china be twice a handsome a what belongs to house great deal too handsome in opinion for place can ever afford to live in however so be father thought only of must say owe particular gratitude to attention to wish for very well know that if must must have left almost everything in world to argument be irresistible gave to intention of decision be wanting before finally resolved that must be absolutely unnecessary if not highly indecorous to do more for widow child of father than such kind of neighbourly act a own wife pointed out chapter iii mr dashwood remained at norland several month not from disinclination to move when sight of well known spot ceased to raise violent emotion produced for while for when spirit began to revive mind became capable of other exertion than of heightening affliction by melancholy remembrance be impatient to be gone indefatigable in inquiry for suitable dwelling in neighbourhood of norland for to remove far from beloved spot be impossible must hear of situation at once answered notion of comfort ease suited prudence of eldest daughter whose steadier judgment rejected several house a too large for income mother must have approved illustration can not imagine how will spend half of mr dashwood have be informed by husband of solemn promise on part of son in favour gave comfort to last earthly reflection doubted sincerity of assurance no more than have doubted thought of for daughter sake with satisfaction though a for herself be persuaded that much smaller provision than l must support in affluence for brother sake too for sake of own heart rejoiced reproached for being unjust to merit before in believing incapable of generosity attentive behaviour to herself sister convinced that welfare be dear to for long time firmly relied on liberality of intention contempt have very early in acquaintance felt for daughter in law be very much increased by farther knowledge of character year residence in family afforded perhaps in spite of consideration of politeness maternal affection on side of former two lady might have found impossible to have lived together so long have not particular circumstance occurred to give still greater eligibility according to opinion of mr dashwood to daughter continuance at norland circumstance be growing attachment between eldest girl brother of mr john dashwood gentlemanlike pleasing young man who be introduced to acquaintance soon after sister establishment at norland who have since spent greatest part of time there mother might have encouraged intimacy from motif of interest for edward ferrars be eldest son of man who have died very rich might have repressed from motif of prudence for except trifling sum whole of fortune depended on will of mother mr dashwood be alike uninfluenced by consideration be enough for that appeared to be amiable that loved daughter that elinor returned partiality be contrary to doctrine of difference of fortune must keep couple asunder who be attracted by resemblance of disposition that elinor merit must not be acknowledged by one who knew be to comprehension impossible edward ferrars be not recommended to good opinion by peculiar grace of person address be not handsome manner required intimacy to make pleasing be too diffident to do justice to when natural shyness be overcome behaviour gave indication of open affectionate heart understanding be good education have given solid improvement be neither fitted by ability disposition to answer wish of mother sister who longed to see distinguished a hardly knew what wanted to make fine figure in world in manner other mother wished to interest in political concern to get into parliament to see connected with of great men of day mr john dashwood wished likewise in mean while till one of superior blessing must be attained must have quieted ambition to see driving barouche edward have turn for great men barouche wish centered in domestic comfort quiet of private life fortunately have younger brother who be more promising edward have be staying several week in house before engaged much of mr dashwood attention for be at time in such affliction a rendered careless of surrounding object saw only that be quiet unobtrusive liked for did not disturb wretchedness of mind by ill timed conversation be first called to observe approve farther by reflection elinor chanced one day to make on difference between sister be contrast recommended most forcibly to mother be enough said to say that be unlike fanny be enough implies everything amiable love already think will like said elinor when know more of like replied mother with smile feel sentiment of approbation inferior to love may esteem have never yet known what be to separate esteem love mr dashwood now took pain to get acquainted with manner be attaching soon banished reserve speedily comprehended merit persuasion of regard for elinor perhaps assisted penetration really felt assured of worth even quietness of manner militated against established idea of what young man address ought to be be longer uninteresting when knew heart to be warm temper affectionate sooner did perceive symptom of love in behaviour to elinor than considered serious attachment a certain looked forward to marriage a rapidly approaching in few month dear marianne said elinor will in probability be settled for life will miss will be happy oh mamma how will do without love will be scarcely separation will live within few mile of other will meet day of life will gain brother real affectionate brother have highest opinion in world of edward heart look grave marianne do disapprove sister choice perhaps said marianne may consider with surprise edward be very amiable love tenderly yet be not kind of young man there be something wanting figure be not striking have none of grace must expect in man who must seriously attach sister eye want spirit that fire at once announce virtue intelligence besides be afraid mamma have real taste music seems scarcely to attract though admires elinor drawing very much be not admiration of person who can understand worth be evident in spite of frequent attention to while draw that in fact know nothing of matter admires a lover not a connoisseur to satisfy character must be united must not be happy with man whose taste did not in point coincide with own must enter into feeling same book same music must charm oh mama how spiritless how tame be edward manner in reading to last night felt for sister most severely yet bore with so much composure seemed scarcely to notice must hardly keep seat to hear beautiful line have frequently almost driven wild pronounced with such impenetrable calmness such dreadful indifference must certainly have done more justice to simple elegant prose thought so at time must give cowper nay mamma if be not to be animated by cowper must allow for difference of taste elinor have not feeling therefore may overlook be happy with must have broke heart have loved to hear read with so little sensibility mama more know of world more be convinced that will never see man whom can really love require so much must have edward virtue person manner must ornament goodness with possible charm remember love that be not seventeen be yet too early in life to despair of such happiness why must be le fortunate than mother in one circumstance only marianne may destiny be different from chapter iv what pity be elinor said marianne that edward must have taste for drawing taste for drawing replied elinor why must think so doe not draw indeed have great pleasure in seeing performance of other people assure be by mean deficient in natural taste though have not have opportunity of improving have ever be in way of learning think must have drawn very well distrust own judgment in such matter so much that be always unwilling to give opinion on picture have innate propriety simplicity of taste in general direct perfectly right marianne be afraid of offending said more on subject kind of approbation elinor described a excited in by drawing of other people be very far from rapturous delight in opinion must alone be called taste yet though smiling within at mistake honoured sister for blind partiality to edward produced hope marianne continued elinor consider a deficient in general taste indeed think may say that can not for behaviour to be perfectly cordial if be opinion be sure must never be civil to marianne hardly knew what to say must not wound feeling of sister on account yet to say what did not believe be impossible at length replied be offended elinor if praise of be not in thing equal to sense of merit have not have so many opportunity of estimating minuter propensity of mind inclination taste a have have highest opinion in world of goodness sense think thing be worthy amiable be sure replied elinor with smile that dearest friend must not be dissatisfied with such commendation a perceive how must express more warmly marianne be rejoiced to find sister so easily pleased of sense goodness continued elinor one can think be in doubt who have seen often enough to engage in unreserved conversation excellence of understanding principle can be concealed only by shyness too often keep silent know enough of to do justice to solid worth of minuter propensity a call have from peculiar circumstance be kept more ignorant than have be at time thrown good deal together while have be wholly engrossed on most affectionate principle by mother have seen great deal of have studied sentiment heard opinion on subject of literature taste upon whole venture to pronounce that mind be well informed enjoyment of book exceedingly great imagination lively observation just correct taste delicate pure ability in respect improve a much upon acquaintance a manner person at first sight address be certainly not striking person can hardly be called handsome till expression of eye be uncommonly good general sweetness of countenance be perceived at present know so well that think really handsome at least almost so what say marianne will very soon think handsome elinor if now when tell to love a brother will no more see imperfection in face than now do in heart elinor started at declaration be sorry for warmth have be betrayed into in speaking of felt that edward stood very high in opinion believed regard to be mutual required greater certainty of to make marianne conviction of attachment agreeable to knew that what marianne mother conjectured one moment believed next that with to wish be to hope to hope be to expect tried to explain real state of case to sister attempt to deny said that think very highly of greatly esteem that like marianne here burst forth with indignation esteem like cold hearted elinor oh worse than cold hearted ashamed of being otherwise use word again will leave room moment elinor must not help laughing excuse said be assured that meant offence to by speaking in so quiet way of own feeling believe to be stronger than have declared believe in short to be such a merit suspicion hope of affection for may warrant without imprudence folly farther than must not believe be by mean assured of regard for there be moment when extent of seems doubtful till sentiment be fully known can not wonder at wishing to avoid encouragement of own partiality by believing calling more than be in heart feel little scarcely doubt of preference there be other point to be considered besides inclination be very far from being independent what mother really be can not know from fanny occasional mention of conduct opinion have never be disposed to think amiable be very much mistaken if edward be not aware that there must be many difficulty in way if be to wish to marry woman who have not either great fortune high rank marianne be astonished to find how much imagination of mother have outstripped truth really be not engaged to said yet certainly soon will happen two advantage will proceed from delay will not lose so soon edward will have greater opportunity of improving that natural taste for favourite pursuit must be so indispensably necessary to future felicity oh if must be so far stimulated by genius a to learn to draw how delightful must be elinor have given real opinion to sister must not consider partiality for edward in so prosperous state a marianne have believed there be at time want of spirit about if did not denote indifference spoke of something almost a unpromising doubt of regard supposing to feel need not give more than inquietude must not be likely to produce dejection of mind frequently attended more reasonable cause might be found in dependent situation forbade indulgence of affection knew that mother neither behaved to so a to make home comfortable at present to give assurance that might form home for without strictly attending to view for aggrandizement with knowledge a be impossible for elinor to feel easy on subject be far from depending on result of preference of mother sister still considered a certain nay longer be together more doubtful seemed nature of regard sometimes for few painful minute believed to be no more than friendship might really be limit be enough when perceived by sister to make uneasy at same time be still more common to make uncivil took first

departure now be time when son in law promise to father might with particular propriety be fulfilled since have neglected to do on first coming to estate quitting house might be looked on a most suitable period for accomplishment mr dashwood began shortly to give over hope of kind to be convinced from general drift of discourse that assistance extended farther than maintenance for six month

however be not unpleasing in spite of being in opinion of marianne margaret absolute old bachelor for be on wrong side of five thirty though face be not handsome countenance be sensible address be particularly gentlemanlike there be nothing in of party must recommend a companion to dashwoods cold insipidity of lady middleton be so particularly repulsive that in comparison of gravity of colonel brandon even boisterous mirth of sir john mother in law be interesting lady middleton seemed to be roused to enjoyment only by entrance of four noisy child after dinner who pulled about tore clothes put end to kind of discourse except what related to in evening a marianne be discovered to be musical be invited to play instrument be unlocked body prepared to be charmed marianne who sang very well

colonel brandon alone of party heard without being in rapture paid only compliment of attention felt respect for on occasion others have reasonably forfeited by shameless want of taste pleasure in music though amounted not to ecstatic delight alone must sympathize with own be estimable when contrasted against horrible insensibility of others be reasonable enough to allow that man of five thirty might well have outlived acuteness of feeling exquisite power of enjoyment be perfectly disposed to make allowance for colonel advanced state of life humanity required chapter viii mr jennings be widow with ample jointure have only two daughter of whom have lived to see respectably married have now therefore nothing to do to marry rest of world in promotion of object be zealously active a far a ability reached missed opportunity of projecting wedding among young people of acquaintance be remarkably quick in discovery of attachment have enjoyed advantage of raising blush vanity of many young lady by insinuation of power over young man kind of discernment enabled soon after arrival at barton decisively to pronounce colonel brandon be very much in love with marianne dashwood rather

must be so be perfectly convinced of must be excellent match for be rich be handsome mr jennings have be anxious to see colonel brandon well married ever since connection with sir john first brought to knowledge be always anxious to get good husband for pretty girl immediate advantage to herself be by mean inconsiderable for supplied with endless joke against at park laughed at colonel in cottage at marianne to former raillery be probably a far a regarded only perfectly indifferent to latter be at first incomprehensible when object be understood hardly knew whether most to laugh at absurdity censure impertinence for considered a unfeeling reflection on colonel advanced year on forlorn condition a old bachelor mr dashwood who must not think man five year younger than so exceedingly ancient a appeared to youthful fancy of daughter ventured to clear mr jennings from probability of wishing to throw ridicule on age at least mamma can not deny absurdity of accusation though may not think intentionally ill natured colonel brandon be certainly younger than mr jennings be old enough to be father if be ever animated enough to be in love must have long outlived sensation of kind be too ridiculous when be man to be safe from such wit if age infirmity will not protect infirmity said elinor do call colonel brandon infirm can easily suppose that age may appear much greater to than to mother can hardly deceive a to having use of limb did not hear complain of rheumatism be not that commonest infirmity of declining life dearest child said mother laughing at rate must be in continual terror of decay must seem to miracle that life have be extended to advanced age of forty mamma be not doing justice know very well that colonel brandon be not old enough to make friend yet apprehensive of losing in course of nature may live twenty year longer thirty five have nothing to do with matrimony perhaps said elinor thirty five seventeen have better not have thing to do with matrimony together if there must by chance happen to be woman who be single at seven twenty must not think colonel brandon being thirty five objection to marrying woman of seven twenty said marianne after pausing moment can never hope to feel inspire affection again if home be uncomfortable fortune small can suppose that might bring to submit to office of nurse for sake of provision security of wife in marrying woman therefore there must be nothing unsuitable must be compact of convenience world must be satisfied in eye must be marriage at must be nothing to must seem only commercial exchange in wished to be benefited at expense of other must be impossible know replied elinor to convince that woman of seven twenty must feel for man of thirty five anything near enough to love to make desirable companion to must object to dooming colonel brandon wife to constant confinement of sick chamber merely because chanced to complain yesterday very cold damp day of slight rheumatic feel

attachment only wished that be le openly shown once twice did venture to suggest propriety of self command to marianne marianne abhorred concealment where real disgrace must attend unreserve to aim at

jennings last illness what said to wife few minute before died lady middleton be more agreeable than mother only in being more silent elinor needed little observation to perceive that reserve be mere calmness of manner with sense have nothing to do towards husband mother be same a to intimacy be therefore to be looked for desired have nothing to say one day that have not said day before insipidity be invariable for even spirit be always same though did not oppose party arranged by husband provided thing be conducted in style two eldest child attended never appeared to receive more enjoyment from than might have experienced in sitting at home so little did presence add to pleasure of others by share in conversation that be sometimes only reminded of being amongst by solicitude about

out of question admiration regard even sisterly regard be own be lover attention be wholly marianne far le agreeable man might have be more generally pleasing colonel brandon unfortunately for have such encouragement to think only of marianne in conversing with elinor found greatest consolation for indifference of sister elinor compassion for increased a have reason to suspect that misery of disappointed love have already be known to suspicion be given by word accidentally dropped from one evening at park when be sitting down together by mutual consent while others be dancing eye be fixed on marianne after silence of minute said with faint smile sister understand doe not approve of second attachment replied elinor opinion be romantic rather a believe considers impossible to exist believe doe how contrives without reflecting on character of own father who have two wife know not few year however will settle opinion on reasonable basis of common sense observation then may be more easy to define to justify than now be by body will probably be case replied yet there be something so amiable in prejudice of young mind that one be sorry to see give way to reception of more general opinion can not agree with there said elinor there be inconvenience attending such feeling a marianne charm of enthusiasm ignorance of world can not atone for system have unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought better acquaintance with world be what look forward to a greatest possible advantage after short pause resumed conversation by saying doe sister make distinction in objection against second attachment be equally criminal in body be who have be disappointed in first choice whether from inconstancy of object perverseness of circumstance to be equally indifferent during rest of life upon word be not acquainted with minutia of principle only know never yet heard admit instance of second attachment being pardonable said can not hold change total change of sentiment desire for when romantic refinement of young mind be obliged to give way how frequently be succeeded by such opinion a be too common too dangerous speak from experience once knew lady who in temper mind greatly resembled sister who thought judged like who from enforced change from series of unfortunate circumstance here stopped suddenly appeared to think that have said too much by countenance gave rise to conjecture might not otherwise have entered elinor head lady must probably have passed without suspicion have not convinced miss dashwood that what concerned ought not to escape lip a be required slight effort of fancy to connect emotion with tender recollection of past regard elinor attempted more marianne in place must not have done so little whole story must have be speedily formed under active imagination thing established in most melancholy order of disastrous love chapter xii a elinor marianne be walking together next morning latter communicated piece of news to sister in spite of that knew before of marianne imprudence want of thought surprised by extravagant testimony of marianne told with greatest delight willoughby have given horse one have bred on estate in somersetshire be exactly calculated to carry woman without considering that be not in mother plan to keep horse that if be to alter resolution in favour of gift must buy for servant keep servant to ride after build stable to receive have accepted present without hesitation told sister of in rapture intends to send groom into somersetshire immediately for added when arrives will ride day will share use with imagine to yourself dear elinor delight of gallop on of down most unwilling be to awaken from such dream of felicity to comprehend unhappy truth attended affair for time refused to submit to a to additional servant expense must be trifle mamma be sure must never object to horse must do for might always get one at park a to stable merest shed must be sufficient elinor then ventured to doubt propriety of receiving present from man so little at least so lately known to be too much be mistaken elinor said warmly in supposing know very little of willoughby have not known long indeed be much better acquainted with than be with other creature in world except mama be not time opportunity be to determine intimacy be disposition alone seven year must be insufficient to make people acquainted with other seven day be more than enough for others must hold guilty of greater impropriety in accepting horse from brother than from willoughby of john know very little though have lived together for year of willoughby judgment have long be formed elinor thought wisest to touch point more knew sister temper opposition on so tender subject must only attach more to own opinion by appeal to affection for mother by representing inconvenience indulgent mother must draw on if a must probably be case consented to increase of establishment marianne be shortly subdued promised not to tempt mother to such imprudent kindness by mentioning offer to tell willoughby when saw next that must be declined be faithful to word when willoughby called at cottage same day elinor heard express disappointment to in low voice on being obliged to forego acceptance of present reason for alteration be at same time related be such a to make further entreaty on side impossible concern however be very apparent after expressing with earnestness added in same low voice marianne horse be still yours though can not use now will keep only till can claim when leave barton to form own establishment in more lasting home queen mab will receive be overheard by miss dashwood in whole of sentence in manner of pronouncing in addressing sister by christian name alone instantly saw intimacy so decided meaning so direct a marked perfect agreement between from moment doubted not of being engaged to other belief of created other surprise than of friend must be left by temper so frank to discover by accident margaret related something to next day placed matter in still clearer light willoughby have spent preceding evening with margaret by being left time in parlour with only marianne have have opportunity for observation with most important face communicated to eldest sister when be next by oh elinor cried have secret to tell about marianne be sure will be married to mr willoughby very soon have said so replied elinor almost day since first met on high church down have not known other week believe before be certain that marianne wore picture round neck turned out to be only miniature of great uncle indeed be quite thing be sure will be married very soon for have got lock of hair take care margaret may be only hair of great uncle of indeed elinor be be be almost sure be for saw cut off last night after tea when mama went out of room be whispering talking together a fast a must be seemed to be begging something of presently took up scissors cut off long lock of hair for be tumbled down back kissed folded up in piece of white paper put into pocket book for such particular stated on such authority elinor must not withhold credit be disposed to for circumstance be in perfect unison with what have heard seen be sagacity be not always displayed in way so satisfactory to sister when mr jennings attacked one evening at park to give name of young man who be elinor particular favourite have be long matter of great curiosity to margaret answered by looking at sister saying must not tell may elinor of course made body laugh elinor tried to laugh too effort be painful be convinced that margaret have fixed on person whose name must not bear with composure to become standing joke with mr jennings illustration cut off long lock of hair marianne felt for most sincerely did more harm than good to cause by turning very red saying in angry manner to margaret remember that conjecture may be have right to repeat never have conjecture about replied margaret be who told of increased mirth of company margaret be eagerly pressed to say something more oh pray miss margaret let know about said mr jennings what be gentleman name must not tell ma'be know very well what be know where be too yes yes can guess where be at own house at norland to be sure be curate of parish dare say that be not be of profession at margaret said marianne with great warmth know that be invention of own that there be such person in existence well then be lately dead marianne for be sure there be such man once name begin with f most grateful did elinor feel to lady middleton for observing at moment that rained very hard though believed interruption to proceed le from attention to than from ladyship great dislike of such inelegant subject of raillery a delighted husband mother idea however started by be immediately pursued by colonel brandon who be on occasion mindful of feeling of others much be said on subject of rain by of opened piano forte asked marianne to sit down to thus amidst various endeavour of different people to quit topic fell to ground not so easily did elinor recover from alarm into have thrown party be formed evening for going on following day to see very fine place about twelve mile from barton belonging to brother in law of colonel brandon without whose interest must not be seen a proprietor who be then abroad have left strict order on head ground be declared to be highly beautiful sir john who be particularly warm in praise might be allowed to be tolerable judge for have formed party to visit at least twice summer for last ten year contained noble piece of water sail on be to form great part of morning amusement cold provision be to be taken open carriage only to be employed thing conducted in usual style of complete party of pleasure to few of company appeared rather bold undertaking considering time of year that have rained day for last fortnight mr dashwood who have already cold be persuaded by elinor to stay at home chapter xiii intended excursion to whitwell turned out very different from what elinor have expected be prepared to be wet through fatigued frightened event be still more unfortunate for did not go at by ten o'clock whole party be assembled at park where be to breakfast morning be rather favourable though have rained all night a cloud be then dispersing across sky sun frequently appeared be in high spirit good humour eager to be happy determined to submit to greatest inconvenience hardship rather than be otherwise while be at breakfast letter be brought in among rest there be one for colonel brandon took looked at direction changed colour immediately left room what be matter with brandon said sir john nobody must tell hope have have bad news said lady middleton must be something extraordinary must make colonel brandon leave breakfast table so suddenly in about five minute returned bad news colonel hope said mr jennings a soon a entered room none at ma'be thank be

hear truth of dear madam said lady middleton recollect what be saying perhaps be to tell that cousin fanny be married said mr jennings without attending to daughter reproof indeed be not well then know who be from colonel hope be well whom do mean ma'be said colouring little oh know who mean be particularly sorry ma'be said addressing lady middleton must receive letter today for be on business requires immediate attendance in town in town cried mr jennings what can have to do in town at time of year own loss be great continued in being obliged to leave so agreeable party be more concerned a fear presence be necessary to gain admittance at whitwell what blow upon be if write note to housekeeper mr brandon said marianne eagerly will not be sufficient shook head must go said sir john will not be put off when be so near can not go to town till tomorrow brandon be wish must be so easily settled be not in power to delay journey for one day if must let know what business be said mr jennings might see whether must be put off not must not be six hour later said willoughby if be to defer journey till return can not afford to lose one hour elinor then heard willoughby say in low voice to marianne there be people who can not bear party of pleasure brandon be one of be afraid of catching cold dare say invented trick for getting out of must lay fifty guinea letter be of own writing have doubt of replied marianne there be persuading to change mind brandon know of old said sir john when once be determined on anything however hope will think better of consider here be two miss careys come over from newton three miss dashwoods walked up from cottage mr willoughby got up two hour before usual time on purpose to go to whitwell colonel brandon again repeated sorrow at being cause of disappointing party at same time declared to be unavoidable well then when will come back again hope will see at barton added ladyship a soon a can conveniently leave town must put off party to whitwell till return be very obliging be so uncertain when may have in power to return dare not engage for at oh must will come back cried sir john if be not here by end of week will go after ay so do sir john cried mr jennings then perhaps may find out what business be want to pry into other men concern suppose be something be ashamed of colonel brandon horse be announced go to town on horseback do added sir john only to honiton will then go post well a be resolved to go wish good journey have better change mind assure be not in power then took leave of whole party be there chance of seeing sister in town winter miss dashwood be afraid none at then must bid farewell for longer time than must wish to do to marianne merely bowed said nothing come colonel said mr jennings before go do let know what be going about wished good morning attended by sir john left room complaint lamentation politeness have hitherto restrained now burst forth universally agreed again again how provoking be to be so disappointed can guess what business be however said mr jennings exultingly can ma'be said almost body yes be about miss williams be sure who be miss williams asked marianne what know who miss williams be be sure must have heard of before be relation of colonel dear very near relation will not say how near for fear of shocking young lady then lowering voice little said to elinor be natural daughter indeed oh yes a like a can stare dare say colonel will leave fortune when sir john returned joined most heartily in general regret on so unfortunate event concluding however by observing that a be got together must do something by way of being happy after consultation be agreed that although happiness must only be enjoyed at whitwell might procure tolerable composure of mind by driving about country carriage be then ordered willoughby be first marianne never looked happier than when got into drove through park very fast be soon out of sight nothing more of be seen till return did not happen till after return of rest seemed delighted with drive said only in general term that have kept in lane while others went on down be settled that there must be dance in evening that body must be extremely merry day long more of careys came to dinner have pleasure of sitting down nearly twenty to table sir john observed with great contentment willoughby took usual place between two elder miss dashwoods mr jennings sat on elinor right hand have not be long seated before leant behind willoughby said to marianne loud enough for to hear have found out in spite of trick know where spent morning marianne coloured replied very hastily where pray did not know said willoughby that have be out in curricle yes yes mr impudence know very well be determined to find out where have be to hope like house miss marianne be very large one know when come to see hope will have new furnished for wanted very much when be there six year ago marianne turned away in great confusion mr jennings laughed heartily elinor found that in resolution to know where have be have actually made own woman enquire of mr willoughby groom that have by method be informed that have gone to allenham spent considerable time there in walking about garden going over house elinor must hardly believe to be true a seemed very unlikely that willoughby must propose marianne consent to enter house while mr smith be in with whom marianne have not smallest acquaintance a soon a left dining room elinor enquired of about great be surprise when found that circumstance related by mr jennings be perfectly true marianne be quite angry with for doubting why must imagine elinor that did not go there that did not see house be not what have often wished to do yes marianne must not go while mr smith be there with other companion than mr willoughby illustration have found out in spite of trick mr willoughby however be only person who can have right to show house a went in open carriage be impossible to have other companion never spent pleasanter morning in life be afraid replied elinor that pleasantness of employment doe not always evince propriety on contrary nothing can be stronger proof of elinor for if there have be real impropriety in what did must have be sensible of at time for always know when be acting wrong with such conviction must have have pleasure dear marianne a have already exposed to very impertinent remark do not now begin to doubt discretion of own conduct if impertinent remark of mr jennings be to be proof of impropriety in conduct be offending moment of life value not censure more than must do commendation be not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking over mr smith ground in seeing house will one day be mr willoughby if be one day to be own marianne must not be justified in what have done blushed at hint be even visibly gratifying to after ten minute interval of earnest thought came to sister again said with great good humour perhaps elinor be rather ill judged in to go to allenham mr willoughby wanted particularly to show place be charming house assure there be one remarkably pretty sitting room up stair of nice comfortable size for constant use with modern furniture must be delightful be corner room have window on two side on one side look across bowling green behind house to beautiful hanging wood on other have view of church village beyond of fine bold hill that have so often admired did not see to advantage for nothing must be more forlorn than furniture if be newly fitted up couple of hundred pound willoughby say must make one of pleasantest summer room in england must elinor have listened to without interruption from others must have described room in house with equal delight chapter xiv sudden termination of colonel brandon visit at park with steadiness in concealing cause filled mind raised wonder of mr jennings for two three day be great wonderer a one must be who take very lively interest in coming going of acquaintance wondered with little intermission what must be reason of be sure there must be bad news thought over kind of distress must have befallen with fixed determination that must not escape something very melancholy must be matter be sure said must see in face poor man be afraid circumstance may be bad estate at delaford be never reckoned more than two thousand year brother left everything sadly involved do think must have be sent for about money matter for what else can be wonder whether be so must give anything to know truth of perhaps be about miss williams by bye dare say be because looked so conscious when mentioned may be be ill in town nothing in world more likely for have notion be always rather sickly must lay wager be about miss williams be not so very likely must be distressed in circumstance now for be very prudent man to be sure must have cleared estate by time wonder what can be may be sister be worse at avignon have sent for over setting off in such hurry seems very like well wish out of trouble with heart good wife into bargain so wondered so talked mr jennings opinion varying with fresh conjecture seeming equally probable a arose elinor though felt really interested in welfare of colonel brandon must not bestow wonder on going so suddenly away mr jennings be desirous of feeling for besides that circumstance did not in opinion justify such lasting amazement variety of speculation wonder be otherwise disposed of be engrossed by extraordinary silence of sister willoughby on subject must know to be peculiarly interesting to a silence continued day made appear more strange more incompatible with disposition of why must not openly acknowledge to mother what constant behaviour to other declared to have taken place elinor must not imagine must easily conceive marriage might not be immediately in power for though willoughby be independent there be reason to believe rich estate have be rated by sir john at about six seven hundred year lived at expense to income must hardly be equal have often complained of poverty for strange kind of secrecy maintained by relative to engagement in fact concealed nothing at must not account be so wholly contradictory to general opinion practice that doubt sometimes entered mind of being really engaged doubt be enough to prevent making inquiry of marianne nothing must be more expressive of attachment to than willoughby behaviour to marianne have distinguishing tenderness lover heart must give to rest of family be affectionate attention of son brother cottage seemed to be considered loved by a home many more of hour be spent there than at allenham if general engagement collected at park exercise called out in morning be almost certain of ending there where rest of day be spent by at side of marianne by favourite pointer at foot one evening in particular about week after colonel brandon left country heart seemed more than usually open to feeling of attachment to object around on mr dashwood happening to mention design of improving cottage in spring warmly opposed alteration of place affection have established a perfect with what exclaimed improve dear cottage will never consent to not stone must be added to wall not inch to size if feeling be regarded be alarmed said miss dashwood nothing of kind will be done for mother will never have money enough to attempt be heartily glad of cried may always be poor if can employ rich better thank willoughby may be assured must not sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment of yours of one whom loved for improvement in world depend upon that unemployed sum may remain when make up account in spring must even rather lay uselessly by than dispose of in manner so painful to be really so attached to place a to see defect in be said to be faultless nay more consider a only form of building in happiness be attainable be rich enough must instantly pull combe down build up again in exact plan of cottage with dark narrow stair kitchen smoke suppose said elinor yes cried in same eager tone with thing belonging to in one convenience inconvenience about must least variation be perceptible then then only under roof might perhaps be a happy at combe a have be at barton flatter replied elinor that even under disadvantage of better room broader staircase will hereafter find own house a faultless a now do there certainly be circumstance said willoughby might greatly endear to place will always have one claim of affection other can possibly share mr dashwood looked with pleasure at marianne whose fine eye be fixed so expressively on willoughby a plainly denoted how well understood how often did wish added when be at allenham time twelvemonth that barton cottage be inhabited never passed within view of without admiring situation grieving that one must live in how little did then think that very first news must hear from mr smith when next came into country must be that barton cottage be taken felt immediate satisfaction interest in event nothing kind of prescience of what happiness must experience from can account for must not have be so marianne speaking to in lowered voice then continuing former tone said yet house must spoil mr dashwood must rob of simplicity by imaginary improvement dear parlour in acquaintance first began in so many happy hour have be since spent by together must degrade to condition of common entrance body must be eager to pas through room have hitherto contained within more real accommodation comfort than other apartment of handsomest dimension in world must possibly afford mr dashwood again assured that alteration of kind must be attempted be good woman warmly replied promise make easy extend little farther will make happy tell that not only house will remain same that will ever find yours a unchanged a dwelling that will always consider with kindness have made everything belonging to so dear to promise be readily given be behaviour during whole of evening declared at once affection happiness will see tomorrow to dinner said mr dashwood when be leaving ask to come in morning for must walk to park to call on lady middleton engaged to be with by four o'clock chapter xv mr dashwood visit to lady middleton took place next day two of daughter went with marianne excused from being of party under trifling pretext of employment mother who concluded that promise have be made by willoughby night before of calling on while be absent be perfectly satisfied with remaining at home on return from park found willoughby curricle servant in waiting at cottage mr dashwood be convinced that conjecture have be just so far be all a have foreseen on entering house beheld what foresight have taught to expect be sooner in passage than marianne came hastily out of parlour apparently in violent affliction with handkerchief at eye without noticing ran up stair surprised alarmed proceeded directly into room have just quitted where found only willoughby who be leaning against mantelpiece with back towards turned round on coming in countenance showed that strongly partook of emotion overpowered marianne be anything matter with cried mr dashwood a entered be ill hope not replied trying to look cheerful with forced smile presently added be who may rather expect to be ill for be now suffering under very heavy disappointment disappointment yes for be unable to keep engagement with mr smith have morning exercised privilege of rich upon poor dependent cousin by sending on business to london have just received dispatch taken farewell of allenham by way of exhilaration be now come to take farewell of to london be going morning almost moment illustration apparently in violent affliction be very unfortunate mr smith must be obliged business will not detain from long hope coloured a replied be very kind have idea of returning into devonshire immediately visit to mr smith be never repeated within twelvemonth be mr smith only friend be allenham only house in neighbourhood to will be welcome for shame willoughby can wait for invitation here colour increased with eye fixed on ground only replied be too good mr dashwood looked at elinor with surprise elinor felt equal amazement for few moment one be silent mr dashwood first spoke have only to add dear willoughby at barton cottage will always be welcome for will not press to return here immediately because only can judge how far might be pleasing to mr smith on head will be no more disposed to question judgment than to doubt inclination engagement at present replied willoughby confusedly be of such nature dare not flatter stopped mr dashwood be too much astonished to speak pause succeeded be broken by willoughby who said with faint smile be folly to linger in manner will not torment longer by remaining among friend whose society be impossible for now to enjoy then hastily took leave of left room saw step into carriage in minute be out of sight mr dashwood felt too much for speech instantly quitted parlour to give way in solitude to concern alarm sudden departure occasioned elinor uneasiness be at least equal to mother thought of what have just passed with anxiety distrust willoughby behaviour in taking leave of embarrassment affectation of cheerfulness above unwillingness to accept mother invitation backwardness so unlike lover so unlike greatly disturbed one moment feared that serious design have ever be formed on side next that unfortunate quarrel have taken place between sister distress in marianne have quitted room be such a serious quarrel must most reasonably account for though when considered what marianne love for be quarrel seemed almost impossible might be particular of separation sister affliction be indubitable thought with tenderest compassion of violent sorrow marianne be in probability not merely giving way to a relief feeding encouraging a duty in about hour mother returned though eye be red countenance be not uncheerful dear willoughby be now mile from barton elinor said a sat down to work with how heavy heart doe travel be very strange so suddenly to be gone seems work of moment last night be with so happy so cheerful so affectionate now after only ten minute notice gone too without intending to return something more than what owned to must have happened did not speak did not behave like must have seen difference a well a what can be can have quarrelled why else must have shown such unwillingness to accept invitation here be not inclination that wanted elinor must plainly see that have not power of accepting have thought over assure can perfectly account for thing at first seemed strange to a well a to can indeed yes have explained to myself in most satisfactory way elinor who love to doubt where can will not satisfy know will not talk out of trust in be persuaded that mr smith suspect regard for marianne disapproves of perhaps because have other view for on account be eager to get away that business sends off to transact be invented a excuse to dismiss be what believe to have happened be moreover aware that doe disapprove connection dare not therefore at present confess to engagement with marianne feel obliged from dependent situation to give into scheme absent from devonshire for while will tell know that may may not have happened will listen to cavil unless can point out other method of understanding affair a satisfactory at now elinor what have to say nothing for have anticipated answer then must have told that might might not have happened oh elinor how incomprehensible be feeling have rather take evil upon credit than good have rather look out for misery for marianne guilt for poor willoughby than apology for latter be resolved to think blamable because took leave of with le affection than usual behaviour have shown be allowance to be made for inadvertence for spirit depressed by recent disappointment be probability to be accepted merely because be not certainty be nothing due to man whom have such reason to love reason in world to think ill of to possibility of motif unanswerable in though unavoidably secret for while after what be suspect of can hardly tell suspicion of something unpleasant be inevitable consequence of such alteration a just witnessed in there be great truth however in what have now urged of allowance ought to be made for be wish to be candid in judgment of body willoughby may undoubtedly have very sufficient reason for conduct will hope that have must have be more like willoughby to acknowledge at once secrecy may be advisable still can not help wondering at being practiced by blame however for departing from character where deviation be necessary really do admit justice of what have said in defence be happy be acquitted not entirely may be proper to conceal engagement if be engaged from mr smith if be case must be highly expedient for willoughby to be little in devonshire at present be excuse for concealing from concealing from dear child do accuse willoughby marianne of concealment be strange indeed when eye have be reproaching day for incautiousness want proof of affection said elinor of

satisfaction of seeing soon become more like affection seemed to reanimate towards interest in welfare again became perceptible be not in spirit however praised house admired prospect be attentive kind still be not in spirit whole family perceived mr dashwood attributing to want of liberality in mother sat down to table indignant against selfish parent what be mr ferrars view for at present edward said when dinner be over have drawn round fire be still to be great orator in spite of hope mother be now convinced that have more talent than inclination for public life how be fame to be established for famous must be to satisfy family with inclination for expense affection for stranger profession assurance may find difficult matter will not attempt have wish to be distinguished have reason to hope never will thank heaven can not be forced into genius eloquence have ambition well know wish be moderate a moderate a of rest of world believe wish a well a body else to be perfectly happy like body else must be in own way greatness will not make so strange that must cried marianne what have wealth grandeur to do with happiness grandeur have little said elinor wealth have much to do with elinor for shame said marianne money can only give happiness where there be nothing else to give beyond competence can afford real satisfaction a far a mere self be concerned perhaps said elinor smiling may come to same point competence wealth be very much alike dare say without a world go now will agree that kind of external comfort must be wanting idea be only more noble than mine come what be competence about eighteen hundred two thousand year not more than elinor laughed two thousand year one be wealth guessed how must end yet two thousand year be very moderate income said family can not well be maintained on smaller be sure be not extravagant in demand proper establishment of servant carriage perhaps two hunter can not be supported on le elinor smiled again to hear sister describing so accurately future expense at combe magna hunter repeated edward why must have hunter body doe not hunt marianne coloured a replied most people do wish said margaret striking out novel thought that somebody must give large fortune piece oh that must cried marianne eye sparkling with animation cheek glowing with delight of such imaginary happiness be unanimous in wish suppose said elinor in spite of insufficiency of wealth oh dear cried margaret how happy must be wonder what must do with marianne looked a if have doubt on point must be puzzled to spend so large fortune said mr dashwood if child be to be rich without help must begin improvement on house observed elinor difficulty will soon vanish what magnificent order must travel from family to london said edward in such event what happy day for bookseller music seller print shop miss dashwood must give general commission for new print of merit to be sent a for marianne know greatness of soul there must not be music enough in london to content book thomson cowper scott must buy over over again must buy up copy believe to prevent falling into unworthy hand must have book tell how to admire old twisted tree must not marianne forgive if be very saucy be willing to show have not forgot old dispute love to be reminded of past edward whether be melancholy gay love to recall will never offend by talking of former time be very right in supposing how money must be spent of at least loose cash must certainly be employed in improving collection of music book bulk of fortune must be laid out in annuity on author heir edward must have something else to do with perhaps then must bestow a reward on person who wrote ablest defence of favourite maxim that one can ever be in love more than once in life for opinion on point be unchanged presume undoubtedly at time of life opinion be tolerably fixed be not likely that must now see hear thing to change marianne be a steadfast a ever see said elinor be not at altered be only grown little more grave than be nay edward said marianne need not reproach be not very gay why must think so replied with sigh gaiety never be part of character do think part of marianne said elinor must hardly call lively girl be very earnest very eager in doe sometimes talk great deal always with animation be not often really merry believe be right replied yet have always set down a lively girl have frequently detected in such kind of mistake said elinor in total misapprehension of character in point other fancying people so much more gay grave ingenious stupid than really be can hardly tell why in what deception originated sometimes one be guided by what say of very frequently by what other people say of without giving time to deliberate judge thought be right elinor said marianne to be guided wholly by opinion of other people thought judgment be given merely to be subservient to of neighbour have always be doctrine be sure marianne never doctrine have never aimed at subjection of understanding have ever attempted to influence have be behaviour must not confound meaning be guilty confess of having often wished to treat acquaintance in general with greater attention when have advised to adopt sentiment to conform to judgment in serious matter have not be able to bring sister over to plan of general civility said edward to elinor do gain ground quite contrary replied elinor looking expressively at marianne judgment returned be on side of question be afraid practice be much more on sister never wish to offend be so foolishly shy often seem negligent when be only kept back by natural awkwardness have frequently thought that must have be intended by nature to be fond of low company be so little at ease among stranger of gentility marianne have not shyness to excuse inattention of hers said elinor know own worth too well for false shame replied edward shyness be only effect of sense of inferiority in way other if must persuade that manner be perfectly easy graceful must not be shy must still be reserved said marianne be worse edward started reserved be reserved marianne yes very understand replied colouring reserved how in what manner what be to tell what can suppose elinor looked surprised at emotion trying to laugh off subject said to know sister well enough to understand what mean know call one reserved who doe not talk a fast admire what admires a rapturously a edward made answer gravity thoughtfulness returned on in fullest extent sat for time silent dull chapter xviii elinor saw with great uneasiness low spirit of friend visit afforded very partial satisfaction while own enjoyment in appeared so imperfect be evident that be unhappy wished be equally evident that still distinguished by same affection once have felt doubt of inspiring continuance of preference seemed very uncertain reservedness of manner towards contradicted one moment what more animated look have intimated preceding one joined marianne in breakfast room next morning before others be down marianne who be always eager to promote happiness a far a must soon left to before be half way upstairs heard parlour door open turning round be astonished to see edward come out be going into village to see horse said a be not yet ready for breakfast will be back again presently edward returned to with fresh admiration of surrounding country in walk to village have seen many part of valley to advantage village in much higher situation than cottage afforded general view of whole have exceedingly pleased be subject ensured marianne attention be beginning to describe own admiration of scene to question more minutely on object have particularly struck when edward interrupted by saying must not enquire too far marianne remember have knowledge in picturesque will offend by ignorance want of taste if come to particular will call hill steep ought to be bold surface strange uncouth ought to be irregular rugged distant object out of sight ought only to be indistinct through soft medium of hazy atmosphere must be satisfied with such admiration a can honestly give call very fine country hill be steep wood seem full of fine timber valley look comfortable snug with rich meadow several neat farm house scattered here there exactly answer idea of fine country because unites beauty with utility dare say be picturesque one too because admire can easily believe to be full of rock promontory grey moss brush wood be lost on know nothing of picturesque be afraid be too true said marianne why must boast of suspect said elinor that to avoid one kind of affectation edward here fall into because belief many people pretend to more admiration of beauty of nature than really feel be disgusted with such pretension affect greater indifference le discrimination in viewing than posse be fastidious will have affectation of own be very true said marianne that admiration of landscape scenery be become mere jargon body pretend to feel try to describe with taste elegance of who first defined what picturesque beauty be detest jargon of kind sometimes have kept feeling to myself because must find language to describe in what be worn hackneyed out of sense meaning be convinced said edward that really feel delight in fine prospect profess to feel in return sister must allow to feel no more than profess like fine prospect not on picturesque principle like crooked twisted blasted tree admire much more if be tall straight flourishing like ruined tattered cottage be not fond of nettle thistle heath blossom have more pleasure in snug farm house than watch tower troop of tidy happy village please better than finest bandit in world marianne looked with amazement at edward with compassion at sister elinor only laughed subject be continued farther marianne remained thoughtfully silent till new object suddenly engaged attention be sitting by edward in taking tea from mr dashwood hand passed so directly before a to make ring with plait of hair in centre very conspicuous on one of finger never saw wear ring before edward cried be that fanny hair remember promising to give must have thought hair have be darker marianne spoke inconsiderately what really felt when saw how much have pained edward own vexation at want of thought must not be surpassed by coloured very deeply giving momentary glance at elinor replied yes be sister hair setting always cast different shade on know elinor have met eye looked conscious likewise that hair be own instantaneously felt a well satisfied a marianne only difference in conclusion be that what marianne considered a free gift from sister elinor be conscious must have be procured by theft contrivance unknown to herself be not in humour however to regard a affront affecting to take notice of what passed by instantly talking of something else internally resolved henceforward to catch opportunity of eyeing hair of satisfying beyond doubt that be exactly shade of own edward embarrassment lasted time ended in absence of mind still more settled be particularly grave whole morning marianne severely censured for what have said own forgiveness might have be more speedy have known how little offence have given sister before middle of day be visited by sir john mr jennings who having heard of arrival of gentleman at cottage came to take survey of guest with assistance of mother in law sir john be not long in discovering that name of ferrars began with f prepared future mine of raillery against devoted elinor nothing newness of acquaintance with edward must have prevented from being immediately sprung a be only learned from very significant look how far penetration founded on margaret instruction extended sir john never came to dashwoods without inviting to dine at park next day to drink tea with evening on present occasion for better entertainment of visitor towards whose amusement felt bound to contribute wished to engage for must drink tea with to night said for will be quite alone tomorrow must absolutely dine with for will be large party mr jennings enforced necessity who know may raise dance said will tempt miss marianne dance cried marianne impossible who be to dance illustration came to take survey of guest who why yourselves careys whitakers to be sure what thought nobody must dance because certain person that will be nameless be gone wish with soul cried sir john willoughby be among again marianne blushing gave new suspicion to edward who be willoughby said in low voice to miss dashwood by whom be sitting gave brief reply marianne countenance be more communicative edward saw enough to comprehend not only meaning of others such of marianne expression a have puzzled before when visitor left went immediately round said in whisper have be guessing will tell guess what do mean will tell certainly well then guess that mr willoughby hunt marianne be surprised confused yet must not help smiling at quiet archness of manner after moment silence said oh edward how can time will come hope be sure will like doubt replied rather astonished at earnestness warmth for have not imagined to be joke for good of acquaintance in general founded only on something nothing between mr willoughby must not have ventured to mention chapter xix edward remained week at cottage be earnestly pressed by mr dashwood to stay longer a if be bent only on self mortification seemed resolved to be gone when enjoyment among friend be at height spirit during last two three day though still very unequal be greatly improved grew more more partial to house environs never spoke of going away without sigh declared time to be wholly disengaged even doubted to what place must go when left still go must never have week passed so quickly must hardly believe to be gone said so repeatedly other thing said too marked turn of feeling gave lie to action have pleasure at norland detested being in town to norland london must go valued kindness beyond thing greatest happiness be in being with yet must leave at end of week in spite of wish own without restraint on time elinor placed be astonishing in way of acting to mother account be happy for that have mother whose character be so imperfectly known to a to be general excuse for thing strange on part of son disappointed however vexed a be sometimes displeased with uncertain behaviour to herself be very well disposed on whole to regard action with candid allowance generous qualification have be rather more painfully extorted from for willoughby service by mother want of spirit of openness of consistency be most usually attributed to want of independence better knowledge of mr ferrars disposition design shortness of visit steadiness of purpose in leaving originated in same fettered inclination same inevitable necessity of temporizing with mother old well established grievance of duty against will parent against child be cause of must have be glad to know when difficulty be to cease opposition be to yield when mr ferrars must be reformed son be at liberty to be happy from such vain wish be forced to turn for comfort to renewal of confidence in edward affection to remembrance of mark of regard in look word fell from while at barton above to flattering proof of constantly wore round finger think edward said mr dashwood a be at breakfast last morning must be happier man if have profession to engage time give interest to plan action inconvenience to friend indeed might result from must not be able to give so much of time with smile must be materially benefited in one particular at least must know where to go when left do assure replied that have long thought on point a think now have be be probably will always be heavy misfortune to have have necessary business to engage profession to give employment afford thing like independence unfortunately own nicety nicety of friend have made what be idle helpless being never must agree in choice of profession always preferred church a still do be not smart enough for family recommended army be great deal too smart for law be allowed to be genteel enough many young men who have chamber in temple made very good appearance in first circle drove about town in very knowing gig have inclination for law even in le abstruse study of family approved a for navy have fashion on side be too old when subject be first started to enter at length a there be necessity for having profession at a might be a dashing expensive without red coat on back a with one idleness be pronounced on whole to be most advantageous honourable young man of eighteen be not in general so earnestly bent on being busy a to resist solicitation of friend to hing be therefore entered at oxford have be properly idle ever since consequence of suppose will be said mr dashwood since leisure have not promoted own happiness that son will be brought up to a many pursuit employment profession trade a columella will be brought up said in serious accent to be a unlike a be possible in feeling in action in condition in thing come come be effusion of immediate want of spirit edward be in melancholy humour fancy that one unlike must be happy remember that pain of parting from friend will be felt by body at time be education state know own happiness want nothing patience give more fascinating name call hope mother will secure to in time that independence be so anxious for be duty will must ere long become happiness to prevent whole youth from being wasted in discontent how much may not few month do think replied edward may defy many month to produce good to desponding turn of mind though must not be communicated to mr dashwood gave additional pain to in parting shortly took place left uncomfortable impression on elinor feeling especially required trouble time to subdue a be determination to subdue to prevent from appearing to suffer more than what family suffered on going away did not adopt method so judiciously employed by marianne on similar occasion to augment fix sorrow by seeking silence solitude idleness mean be a different a object equally suited to advancement of elinor sat down to drawing table a soon a be out of house busily employed whole day sought avoided mention of name appeared to interest almost a much a ever in general concern of family if by conduct did not lessen own grief be at least prevented from unnecessary increase mother sister be spared much solicitude on account such behaviour a so exactly reverse of own appeared more meritorious to marianne than own have seemed faulty to business of self command settled very easily with strong affection be impossible with calm one must have merit that sister affection be calm dared not deny though blushed to acknowledge of strength of own gave very striking proof by still loving respecting that sister in spite of mortifying conviction without shutting up from family leaving house in determined solitude to avoid lying awake whole night to indulge meditation elinor found day afforded leisure enough to think of edward of edward behaviour in possible variety different state of spirit at different time must produce with tenderness pity approbation censure doubt there be moment in abundance when if not by absence of mother sister at least by nature of employment conversation be forbidden among effect of solitude be produced mind be inevitably at liberty thought must not be chained elsewhere past future on subject so interesting must be before must force attention engross memory reflection fancy from reverie of kind a sat at drawing table be roused one morning soon after edward leaving by arrival of company happened to be quite alone closing of little gate at entrance of green court in front of

perhaps be little soured by finding like many others of sex that through unaccountable bias in favour of beauty be husband of very silly woman knew that kind of blunder be too common for sensible man to be lastingly hurt by be rather wish of distinction believed produced contemptuous treatment of body general abuse of thing before be desire of appearing superior to other people motive be too common to be wondered at mean however might succeed by establishing superiority in ill breeding be not likely to attach one to except wife oh dear miss dashwood said mr palmer soon afterwards have got favour to ask of sister will come spend time at cleveland christmas now pray do come while weston be with can not think how happy will be will be quite delightful love applying to husband long to have

disappointed will be if come to cleveland ca imagine why must object to elinor be again obliged to decline invitation by changing subject put stop to entreaty thought probable that a lived in same county mr palmer might be able to give more particular account of willoughby general character than must be gathered from middleton partial acquaintance with be eager to gain from one confirmation of merit a might remove possibility of fear from marianne began by inquiring if saw much of mr willoughby at cleveland whether be intimately acquainted with oh dear yes know extremely well replied mr

man like chapter xxi palmer returned to cleveland next day two family at barton be again left to entertain other did not last long elinor have hardly got last visitor out of head have hardly done wondering at charlotte being so happy without cause at mr palmer acting so simply with good ability at strange unsuitableness often existed between husband wife before sir john mr jennings active zeal in cause of society procured other new acquaintance to see observe in morning excursion to exeter have met with two young lady whom mr jennings have satisfaction of discovering to be relation be enough for sir john to invite directly to park a soon a present engagement at exeter be over engagement at exeter instantly gave way before such invitation lady middleton be thrown into little alarm on return of sir john by hearing that be very soon to receive visit from two girl whom have never seen in life of whose elegance whose tolerable gentility even must have proof for assurance of husband mother on subject went for nothing at being relation too made so much worse mr jennings attempt at consolation be therefore unfortunately founded when advised daughter not to care about being so fashionable because be cousin must put up with one a be impossible however now to prevent coming lady middleton resigned to idea of with philosophy of well bred woman contenting with merely giving husband gentle reprimand on subject five six time day young lady arrived appearance be by mean ungenteel unfashionable dress be very smart manner very civil be delighted with house in rapture with furniture happened to be so doatingly fond of child lady middleton good opinion be engaged in favour before have be hour at park declared to be very agreeable girl indeed for ladyship be enthusiastic admiration sir john confidence in own judgment rose with animated praise set off directly for cottage to tell miss dashwoods of miss steele arrival to assure of being sweetest girl in world from such commendation a however there be not much to be learned elinor well knew that sweetest girl in world be to be met with in part of england under possible variation of form face temper understanding sir john wanted whole family to walk to park directly look at guest benevolent philanthropic man be painful to even to keep third cousin to do come now said pray come must come declare will come ca think how will like lucy be monstrous pretty so good humoured agreeable child be hanging about already a if be old acquaintance long to see of thing for have heard at exeter that be most beautiful creature in world have told be very true great deal more will be delighted with be sure have brought whole coach full of plaything for child how can be so cross a not to come why be cousin know after fashion be cousin be wife so must be related sir john must not prevail must only obtain promise of calling at park within day two then left in amazement at indifference to walk home boast anew of attraction to miss steele a have be already boasting of miss steele to when promised visit to park consequent introduction to young lady took place found in appearance of eldest who be nearly thirty with very plain not sensible face nothing to admire in other who be not more than two three twenty acknowledged considerable beauty feature be pretty have sharp quick eye smartness of air though did not give actual elegance grace gave distinction to person manner be particularly civil elinor soon allowed credit for kind of sense when saw with what constant judicious attention be making agreeable to lady middleton with child be in continual rapture extolling beauty courting notice humouring whim such of time a must be spared from importunate demand politeness made on be spent in admiration of ladyship be doing if happened to be doing thing in taking pattern of elegant new dress in appearance day before have thrown into unceasing delight fortunately for who pay court through such foible fond mother though in pursuit of praise for child most rapacious of human being be likewise most credulous demand be exorbitant will swallow thing excessive affection endurance of miss steele towards offspring be viewed therefore by lady middleton without smallest surprise distrust saw with maternal complacency impertinent encroachment mischievous trick to cousin submitted saw sash untied hair pulled about ear work bag searched knife scissors stolen away felt doubt of being reciprocal enjoyment suggested other surprise than elinor marianne must sit so composedly by without claiming share in what be passing john be in such spirit today said on taking miss steele pocket handkerchief throwing out of window be full of monkey trick soon afterwards on second boy violently pinching one of same lady finger fondly observed how playful william be illustration mischievous trick here be sweet little annamaria added tenderly caressing little girl of three year old who have not made noise for last two minute be always so gentle quiet never be there such quiet little thing unfortunately in bestowing embrace pin in ladyship head dress slightly scratching child neck produced from pattern of gentleness such violent scream a must hardly be outdone by creature professedly noisy mother consternation be excessive must not surpass alarm of miss steele thing be done by three in so critical emergency affection must suggest a likely to assuage agony of little sufferer be seated in mother lap covered with kiss wound bathed with lavender water by one of miss steele who be on knee to attend mouth stuffed with sugar plum by other with reward for tear child be too wise to cease cry still screamed sobbed lustily kicked two brother for offering to touch united soothings be ineffectual till lady middleton luckily remembering that in scene of similar distress last week apricot marmalade have be successfully applied for bruised temple same remedy be eagerly proposed for unfortunate scratch slight intermission of scream in young lady on hearing gave reason to hope that must not be rejected be carried out of room therefore in mother arm in quest of medicine a two boy chose to follow though earnestly entreated by mother to stay behind four young lady be left in quietness room have not known for many hour poor little creature said miss steele a soon a be gone might have be very sad accident yet hardly know how cried marianne unless have be under totally different circumstance be usual way of heightening alarm where there be nothing to be alarmed at in reality what sweet woman lady middleton be said lucy steele marianne be silent be impossible for to say what did not feel however trivial occasion upon elinor therefore whole task of telling lie when politeness required always fell did best when thus called on by speaking of lady middleton with more warmth than felt though with far le than miss lucy sir john too cried elder sister what charming man be here too miss dashwood commendation being only simple just came in without eclat merely observed that be perfectly good humoured friendly what charming little family have never saw such fine child in life declare quite doat upon already indeed be always distractedly fond of child must guess so said elinor with smile from what have witnessed morning have notion said lucy think little middleton rather too much indulged perhaps may be outside of enough be so natural in lady middleton for part love to see child full of life spirit can not bear if be tame quiet confess replied elinor that while be at barton park never think of tame quiet child with abhorrence short pause succeeded speech be first broken by miss steele who seemed very much disposed for conversation who now said rather abruptly how do like devonshire miss dashwood suppose be very sorry to leave sussex in surprise at familiarity of question at least of manner in be spoken elinor replied that be norland be prodigious beautiful place be not added miss steele have heard sir john admire excessively said lucy who seemed to think apology necessary for freedom of sister think one must admire replied elinor who ever saw place though be not to be supposed that one can estimate beauty a do have great many smart beau there suppose have not so many in part of world for part think be vast addition always why must think said lucy looking ashamed of sister that there be not a many genteel young men in devonshire a sussex nay dear be sure pretend to say that there be sure there be vast many smart beau in exeter know how must tell what smart beau there might be about norland be only afraid miss dashwoods might find dull at barton if have not so many a used to have perhaps young lady may not care about beau have a lief be without a with for part think be vastly agreeable provided dress smart behave civil ca bear to see dirty nasty now there be mr rose at exeter prodigious smart young man beau clerk to mr simpson know yet if do meet of morning be not fit to be seen suppose brother be quite beau miss dashwood before married a be so rich upon word replied elinor can not tell for perfectly comprehend meaning of word can say that if ever be beau before married be one still for there be not smallest alteration in oh dear one never think of married men being beau have something else to do lord anne cried sister can talk of nothing beau will make miss dashwood believe think of nothing else then to turn discourse began admiring house furniture specimen of miss steele be enough vulgar freedom folly of eldest left recommendation a elinor be not blinded by beauty shrewd look of youngest to want of real elegance artlessness left house without wish of knowing better not so miss steele came from exeter well provided with admiration for use of sir john middleton family relation niggardly proportion be now dealt out to fair cousin whom declared to be most beautiful elegant accomplished agreeable girl have ever beheld with whom be particularly anxious to be better acquainted to be better acquainted therefore elinor soon found be inevitable lot for a sir john be entirely on side of miss steele party must be too strong for opposition that kind of intimacy must be submitted to consists of sitting hour two together in same room almost day sir john must do more did not know that more be required to be together be in opinion to be intimate while continual scheme for meeting be effectual have not doubt of being established friend to do justice did thing in power to promote unreserve by making miss steele acquainted with whatever knew supposed of cousin situation in most delicate particular elinor have not seen more than twice before eldest of wished joy on sister having be so lucky a to make conquest of very smart beau since came to barton 'twill be fine thing to have married so young to be sure said hear be quite beau prodigious handsome hope may have a good luck soon perhaps may have friend in corner already elinor must not suppose that sir john must be more nice in proclaiming suspicion of regard for edward than have be with respect to marianne indeed be rather favourite joke of two a being somewhat newer more conjectural since edward visit have never dined together without drinking to best affection with so much significancy so many nod wink a to excite general attention letter f have be likewise invariably brought forward found productive of such countless joke that character a wittiest letter in alphabet have be long established with miss steele a expected have now benefit of joke in eldest of raised curiosity to know name of gentleman alluded to though often impertinently expressed be perfectly of piece with general inquisitiveness into concern of family sir john did not sport long with curiosity delighted to raise for have at least a much pleasure in telling name a miss steele have in hearing name be ferrars said in very audible whisper pray tell for be great secret illustration drinking to best affection ferrars repeated miss steele mr ferrars be happy man be what sister in law brother miss dashwood very agreeable young man to be sure know very well how can say so anne cried lucy who generally made amendment to sister assertion though have seen once twice at uncle be rather too much to pretend to know very well elinor heard with attention surprise who be uncle where did live how came acquainted wished very much to have subject continued though did not choose to join in nothing more of be said for first time in life thought mr jennings deficient either in curiosity after petty information in disposition to communicate manner in miss steele have spoken of edward increased curiosity for struck a being rather ill natured suggested suspicion of lady knowing fancying to know something to disadvantage curiosity be unavailing for farther notice be taken of mr ferrars name by miss steele when alluded to even openly mentioned by sir john chapter xxii marianne who have never much toleration for thing like impertinence vulgarity inferiority of part even difference of taste from herself be at time particularly ill disposed from state of spirit to be pleased with miss steele to encourage advance to invariable coldness of behaviour towards checked endeavour at intimacy on side elinor principally attributed that preference of herself soon became evident in manner of especially of lucy who missed opportunity of engaging in conversation of striving to improve acquaintance by easy frank communication of sentiment lucy be naturally clever remark be often just amusing a companion for hour elinor frequently found agreeable power have received no aid from education be ignorant illiterate deficiency of mental improvement want of information in most common particular must not be concealed from miss dashwood in spite of constant endeavour to appear to advantage elinor saw pitied for neglect of ability education might have rendered so respectable saw with le tenderness of feeling thorough want of delicacy of rectitude integrity of mind attention assiduity flattery at park betrayed must have lasting satisfaction in company of person who joined insincerity with ignorance whose want of instruction prevented meeting in conversation on term of equality whose conduct toward others made show of attention deference towards perfectly valueless will think question odd one dare say said lucy to one day a be walking together from park to cottage pray be personally acquainted with sister in law mother mr ferrars elinor did think question very odd one countenance expressed a answered that have never seen mr ferrars indeed replied lucy wonder at for thought must have seen at norland sometimes then perhaps can not tell what sort of woman be returned elinor cautious of giving real opinion of edward mother not very desirous of satisfying what seemed impertinent curiosity know nothing of be sure think very strange for enquiring about in such way said lucy eyeing elinor attentively a spoke perhaps there may be reason wish might venture however hope will do justice of believing mean to be impertinent elinor made civil reply walked on for few minute in silence be broken by lucy who renewed subject again by saying with hesitation can not bear to have think impertinently curious be sure must rather do thing in world than be thought so by person whose good opinion be so well worth having a yours be sure must not have smallest fear of trusting indeed must be very glad of advice how to manage in such uncomfortable situation a be however there be occasion to trouble be sorry happen to know mr ferrars be sorry said elinor in great astonishment if must be of use to to know opinion of really never understood that be at connected with family therefore be little surprised confess at so serious inquiry into character dare say be be sure at wonder at if dared tell must not be so much surprised mr ferrars be certainly nothing to at present time may come how soon will come must depend upon when may be very intimately connected looked down a said amiably bashful with only one side glance at companion to observe effect on good heaven cried elinor what do mean be acquainted with mr robert ferrars can be did not feel much delighted with idea of such sister in law replied lucy not to mr robert ferrars never saw in life fixing eye upon elinor to eldest brother what felt elinor at moment astonishment must have be a painful a be strong have not immediate disbelief of assertion attended turned towards lucy in silent amazement unable to divine reason object of declaration though complexion varied stood firm in incredulity felt in danger of hysterical fit swoon may well be surprised continued lucy for to be sure must have have idea of before for dare say never dropped smallest hint of to of family because be always meant to be great secret be sure have be faithfully kept so by to hour not soul of relation know of anne never must have mentioned to if have not felt greatest dependence in world upon secrecy really thought behaviour in asking so many question about mr ferrars must seem so odd that ought to be explained think mr ferrars can be displeased when know have trusted because know have highest opinion in world of family look upon other miss dashwoods quite a own sister paused illustration amiably bashful elinor for few moment remained silent astonishment at what heard be at first too great for word at length forcing to speak to speak cautiously said with calmness of manner tolerably well concealed surprise solicitude may ask if engagement be of long standing have be engaged four year four year yes elinor though greatly shocked still felt unable to believe did not know said that be even acquainted till other day acquaintance however be of many year date be under uncle care know considerable while uncle yes mr pratt did never hear talk of mr pratt think have replied elinor with exertion of spirit increased with increase of emotion be four year with uncle who life at longstaple near plymouth be there acquaintance begun for sister be often staying with uncle be there engagement be formed though not till year after have quitted a pupil be almost always with afterwards be very unwilling to enter into a may imagine without knowledge approbation of mother be too young loved too well to be so prudent a ought to have be though know so well a miss dashwood must have seen enough of to be sensible be very capable of making woman sincerely attached to certainly answered elinor without knowing what said after moment reflection added with revived security of edward honour love companion falsehood engaged to mr edward ferrars confess so totally surprised at what tell that really beg pardon surely there must be mistake of person name can not mean same mr ferrars can mean other cried lucy smiling mr edward ferrars eldest son of mr ferrars of park street brother of sister in law mr john dashwood be person mean must allow be not likely to be deceived a to name of man on who happiness depends be strange replied elinor in most painful perplexity must never have heard even mention name considering situation be not strange first care have be to keep matter secret knew nothing of family therefore there must be occasion for ever mentioning name to a be always particularly afraid of sister suspecting thing be reason enough for not mentioning be silent elinor security sunk self command did not sink with four year have be engaged said with firm voice yes heaven know how much longer may have to wait poor edward put quite out of heart then taking small miniature from pocket added to prevent possibility of mistake be so good a to look at face doe not do justice to be sure yet think can not be deceived a to person be drew for have have above three year put into hand a spoke when elinor saw painting other doubt fear of too hasty decision wish of detecting falsehood might suffer to linger in mind must have none of being edward face returned almost instantly acknowledging likeness have never be able continued lucy to give picture in return be very much vexed at for have be always so anxious to get be determined to set for very first opportunity be quite in right replied elinor calmly then proceeded few pace in silence lucy spoke first be sure said have doubt in world of faithfully keeping secret because must know of what importance be to not to have reach mother for must never approve of dare say will have fortune fancy be exceeding proud woman certainly did not seek confidence said elinor do more than justice in imagining may be depended on secret be safe with pardon if surprise at so unnecessary communication must at least have felt that being acquainted with must not add to safety a said looked earnestly at lucy hoping to discover something in countenance perhaps falsehood of greatest part of what have be saying lucy countenance suffered change be afraid must think be taking great liberty with said in telling have not known long to be sure personally at least have known family by description great while a soon a saw felt almost a if be old acquaintance besides in present case really thought explanation be due to after making such particular inquiry about edward mother be so unfortunate have not creature whose advice can ask anne be only person know of have judgment at indeed doe great deal more harm than good for be in constant fear of betraying doe not know how to hold tongue a must perceive be sure be in greatest fright in world t'other day when edward name be mentioned by sir john lest must out with ca think how much go through in mind from altogether only wonder that be alive after what have suffered for edward sake last four year thing in such suspense uncertainty seeing so seldom can hardly meet above twice year be sure wonder heart be not quite broke here took out handkerchief elinor did not feel very compassionate sometimes continued lucy after wiping eye think whether must not be better for to break off matter entirely a said looked directly at companion then at other time have not resolution enough for can not bear thought of making so miserable a know very mention of such thing must do on own account too so dear a be to think must be equal to what must advise to do in case miss dashwood what must do pardon replied elinor startled by question can give advice under such circumstance own judgment must direct to be sure continued lucy after few minute silence on side mother must provide for sometime other poor edward be so cast down by did not think dreadful low spirited when be at barton be so miserable when left at longstaple to go to be afraid must think quite ill did come from uncle then when visited oh yes have be staying fortnight with did think came directly from town replied elinor most feelingly sensible of fresh circumstance in favour of lucy veracity remember told that have be staying fortnight with friend near plymouth remembered too own surprise at time at mentioning nothing farther of friend at total silence with respect even to name did not think sadly out of spirit repeated lucy did indeed particularly so when first arrived begged to exert for fear must suspect what be matter made so melancholy not being able to stay more than fortnight with seeing so much affected poor fellow be afraid be just same with now for writes in wretched spirit heard from just before left exeter taking letter from pocket carelessly showing direction to elinor know hand dare say charming one be be not written so well a usual be tired dare say for have just filled sheet to a full a possible elinor saw that be hand must doubt no longer picture have allowed to believe might have be accidentally obtained might not have be edward gift correspondence between by letter must subsist only under positive engagement must be authorised by nothing else for few moment be almost overcome heart sunk within must hardly stand exertion be indispensably necessary struggled so resolutely against oppression of feeling that success be speedy for time complete writing to other said lucy returning letter into pocket be only comfort have in such long separation yes have one other comfort in picture poor edward have not even that if have picture say must be easy gave lock of hair set in ring when be at longstaple last be comfort to said not equal to picture perhaps might notice ring when saw did said elinor with composure of voice under be concealed emotion distress beyond thing have ever felt before be mortified shocked confounded fortunately for have now reached cottage conversation must be continued farther after sitting with few minute miss steele returned to park elinor be then at liberty to think be wretched chapter xxiii however small elinor general dependence on lucy veracity might be be impossible for on serious reflection to suspect in present case where temptation must be answerable to folly of inventing falsehood of such description what lucy have asserted to be true therefore elinor must not dared not longer doubt supported a be too on side by such probability proof contradicted by nothing own wish opportunity of acquaintance in house of mr pratt be foundation for rest at once indisputable alarming edward visit near plymouth melancholy state of mind dissatisfaction at own prospect uncertain behaviour towards intimate knowledge of miss steele a to norland family connection have often surprised picture letter ring formed altogether such body of evidence a overcame fear of condemning unfairly established a fact partiality must set aside ill treatment of resentment of such behaviour indignation at having be dupe for short time made feel only for other idea other consideration soon arose have edward be intentionally deceiving have feigned regard for did not feel be engagement to lucy engagement of heart might once have be must not believe such at present affection be own must not be deceived in mother sister fanny have be conscious of regard for at norland be not illusion of own vanity certainly loved what softener of heart be persuasion how much must not tempt to forgive have be blamable highly blamable in remaining at norland after first felt influence over to be more than ought to be in must not be defended if have injured how much more have injured if case be pitiable be hopeless imprudence have made miserable for while seemed to have deprived of chance of ever being otherwise might in time regain tranquillity have to look forward to must ever be tolerably happy with lucy steele must be affection for out of question with integrity delicacy well informed mind be satisfied with wife like illiterate artful selfish youthful infatuation of nineteen must naturally blind to thing beauty good nature four succeeding year year if rationally spent give such improvement to understanding must have opened eye to defect of education while same period of time spent on side in inferior society more frivolous pursuit have perhaps robbed of simplicity might once have given interesting character to beauty if in supposition of seeking to marry difficulty from mother have seemed great how much greater be now likely to be when object of engagement be undoubtedly inferior in connection probably inferior in fortune to herself difficulty indeed with heart so alienated from lucy might not press very hard upon patience melancholy be state of person by whom expectation of family opposition unkindness must be felt a relief a consideration occurred to in painful succession wept for more than for herself supported by conviction of having done nothing to merit present unhappiness consoled by belief that edward have done nothing to forfeit esteem thought must even now under first smart of heavy blow command enough to guard suspicion of truth from mother sister so well be able to answer own expectation that when joined at dinner only two hour after have first suffered extinction of dearest hope one must have supposed from appearance of sister elinor be mourning in secret over obstacle must divide for ever from object of love that marianne be internally dwelling on perfection of man of whose whole heart felt thoroughly possessed whom expected to see in carriage drove near house necessity of concealing from mother marianne what have be entrusted in confidence to though obliged to unceasing exertion be aggravation of elinor distress on contrary be relief to to be spared communication of what must give such affliction to to be saved likewise from hearing condemnation of edward must probably flow from excess of partial affection for herself be more than felt equal to support from counsel conversation knew must receive assistance tenderness sorrow must add to distress while self command must neither receive encouragement from example from praise be stronger alone own good sense so well supported that firmness be a unshaken appearance of cheerfulness a invariable a with regret so poignant so fresh be possible for to be much a have suffered from first conversation with lucy on subject soon felt earnest wish of renewing for more reason than one wanted to hear many particular of engagement repeated again wanted more clearly to understand what lucy really felt for edward whether there be sincerity in declaration of tender regard for particularly wanted to convince lucy by readiness to enter on matter again calmness in conversing on that be otherwise interested in than a friend very much feared involuntary agitation in morning discourse must have left at least doubtful that lucy be disposed to be jealous of appeared very probable be plain that edward have always spoken highly in praise not merely from lucy assertion from venturing to trust on so short personal acquaintance with secret so confessedly evidently important even sir john joking intelligence must have have weight indeed while elinor remained so well assured within herself of being really beloved by edward required other consideration of probability to make natural that lucy must be jealous that be so very confidence be proof what other reason for disclosure of affair must there be elinor might be informed by of lucy superior claim on edward be taught to avoid in future have little difficulty in understanding thus much of rival intention while be firmly resolved to act by a principle of honour honesty directed to combat own affection for edward to see a little a possible must not deny comfort of endeavouring to convince lucy that heart be unwounded a must now have nothing more painful to hear on subject than have already be told did not mistrust own ability of going through repetition of particular with composure be not immediately that opportunity of doing so must be commanded though lucy be a well disposed a to take advantage of occurred for weather be not often fine enough to allow of joining in walk where might most easily separate from others though met at least other evening at park cottage chiefly at former must not be supposed to meet for sake of conversation thought must never enter sir john lady middleton head therefore very little leisure be ever given for general chat none at for particular discourse met for sake of eating drinking laughing together playing at card consequence other game be sufficiently noisy one two meeting of kind have taken place without affording elinor chance of engaging lucy in private when sir john called at cottage one morning to beg in name of charity that must dine with lady middleton day a be obliged to attend club at exeter must otherwise be quite alone except mother two miss steele elinor who foresaw fairer opening for point have in view in party a be likely to be more at liberty among under tranquil well bred direction of lady middleton than when husband united together in one noisy purpose immediately accepted invitation margaret with mother permission be equally compliant marianne though always unwilling to join of party be persuaded by mother who must not bear to have seclude from chance of amusement to go likewise young lady went lady middleton be happily preserved from frightful solitude have threatened insipidity of meeting be exactly such a elinor have expected produced not one novelty of thought expression nothing must be le interesting than whole of discourse in dining parlour drawing room to latter child accompanied while remained there be too well convinced of impossibility of engaging lucy attention to attempt quitted only with removal of tea thing card table be then placed elinor began to wonder at for having ever entertained hope of finding time for conversation at park rose up in preparation for round game be glad said lady middleton to lucy be not going to finish poor little annamaria basket evening for be sure must hurt eye to work filigree by candlelight will make dear little love amends for disappointment to morrow then hope will not much mind hint be enough lucy recollected instantly replied indeed be very much mistaken lady middleton be only waiting to know whether can make party without must have be at filigree already must not disappoint little angel for world if want at card table now be resolved to finish basket after supper be very good hope wo hurt eye will ring bell for working candle poor little girl must be sadly disappointed know if basket be not finished tomorrow for though told certainly must not be sure depends upon having done lucy directly drew work table near reseated with alacrity cheerfulness seemed to infer that must taste greater delight than in making filigree basket for spoilt child lady middleton proposed rubber of casino to others one made objection marianne who with usual inattention to form of general civility exclaimed ladyship will have goodness to excuse know detest card will go to piano forte have not touched since be tuned without farther ceremony turned away walked to instrument lady middleton looked a if thanked heaven that have never made so rude speech marianne can never keep long from instrument know ma'be said elinor endeavouring to smooth away offence much wonder at for be very best toned piano forte ever heard remaining five be now to draw card perhaps continued elinor if must happen to cut out may be of use to miss lucy steele in rolling paper for there be so much still to be done to basket that must be impossible think for labour singly to finish evening must like work exceedingly if must allow share in indeed will be very much obliged to for help cried lucy for find there be more to be done to than thought there be must be shocking thing to disappoint dear annamaria after oh must be terrible indeed said miss steele dear little soul how do love be very kind said lady middleton to elinor a really like work perhaps will be a well pleased not to cut in till rubber will take chance now elinor joyfully profited by first of proposal thus by little of address marianne must never condescend to practise gained own end pleased lady middleton at same time lucy made room for with ready attention two fair rival be thus seated side by side at same table with utmost harmony engaged in forwarding same work pianoforte at marianne wrapped up in own music own thought have by time forgotten that body be in room besides herself be luckily so near miss dashwood now judged might safely under shelter of noise introduce interesting subject without risk of being heard at card table chapter xxiv in firm though cautious tone elinor thus began must be undeserving of confidence have honoured with if felt desire for continuance farther curiosity on subject will not apologize therefore for bringing forward again thank cried lucy warmly for breaking ice have set heart at ease by for be somehow other afraid have offended by what told that monday offended how must suppose so believe elinor spoke with truest sincerity nothing must be farther from intention than to give idea must have motive for trust be not honourable flattering to yet do assure replied lucy little sharp eye full of meaning there seemed to to be coldness displeasure in manner that made quite uncomfortable felt sure that be angry with have be quarrelling with ever since for having took liberty a to trouble with affair be very glad to find be only own fancy that really blame if knew what consolation be to to relieve heart speaking to of what be always thinking of moment of life compassion must make overlook thing else be sure indeed can easily believe that be very great relief to to acknowledge situation to be assured that will never have reason to repent case be very unfortunate one seem to to be surrounded with difficulty will have need of mutual affection to support under mr ferrars believe be entirely dependent on mother have only two thousand pound of own must be madness to marry upon though for own part must give up prospect of more without sigh have be always used to very small income must struggle with poverty for love too well to be selfish mean of robbing perhaps of that mother might give if married to please must wait may be for many year with almost other man in world must be alarming prospect edward affection constancy nothing can deprive of know conviction must be thing to be undoubtedly supported by same trust in if strength of reciprocal attachment have failed a between many people under many circumstance naturally must during four year engagement situation must have be pitiable indeed lucy here looked up elinor be careful in guarding countenance from expression must give word suspicious tendency edward love for said lucy have be pretty well put to test by long very long absence since be first engaged have stood trial so well must be unpardonable to doubt now can safely say that have never gave one moment alarm on account from first elinor hardly knew whether to smile sigh at assertion lucy went on be rather of jealous temper too by nature from different situation in life from being so much more in world than continual separation be enough inclined for suspicion to have found out truth in instant if there have be slightest alteration in behaviour to when met lowness of spirit must not account for if have talked more of one lady than seemed in respect le happy at longstaple than used to be mean to say that be particularly observant quick sighted in general in such case be sure must not be deceived thought elinor be very pretty can impose upon of what said after short silence be view have none that of waiting for mr ferrars death be melancholy shocking extremity be son determined to submit to to tediousness of many year of suspense in may involve rather than run risk of displeasure for while by owning truth if must be certain that must be only for while mr ferrars be very headstrong proud woman in first fit of anger upon hearing must very likely secure thing to robert idea of for edward sake frightens away inclination for hasty measure for own sake too be carrying disinterestedness beyond reason lucy looked at elinor again be silent do know mr robert ferrars asked elinor not at never saw fancy be very unlike brother silly great coxcomb great coxcomb repeated miss steele whose ear have caught word by sudden pause in marianne music oh be talking of favourite beau dare say sister cried lucy be mistaken there favourite beau be not great coxcomb can answer for miss dashwood be not said mr jennings laughing heartily for be one of modestest prettiest behaved young men ever saw a for lucy be such sly little creature there be finding out who like illustration can answer for said mr jennings oh cried miss steele looking significantly round at dare say lucy beau be quite a modest pretty behaved a miss dashwood elinor blushed in spite of lucy bit lip looked angrily at sister mutual silence took place for time lucy first put end to by saying in lower tone though marianne be then giving powerful protection of very magnificent concerto will honestly tell of one scheme have lately come into head for bringing matter to bear indeed be bound to let into secret for be party concerned dare say have seen enough of edward to know that must prefer church to other profession now plan be that must take order a soon a can then through interest be sure must be kind enough to use out of friendship for hope out of regard to brother might be persuaded to give norland living understand be very good one present incumbent not likely to live great while must be enough for to marry upon might trust to time chance for rest must always be happy replied elinor to show mark of esteem friendship for mr ferrars do not perceive that interest on occasion must be perfectly unnecessary be brother to mr john dashwood must be recommendation enough to husband mr john dashwood must not much approve of edward going into order then rather suspect that interest must do very little be again silent for many minute at length lucy exclaimed with deep sigh believe must be wisest way to put end to business at once by dissolving engagement seem so beset with difficulty on side that though must make miserable for time must be happier perhaps in end will not give advice miss dashwood answered elinor with smile concealed very agitated feeling on subject certainly will not know very well that opinion must have weight with unless be on side of wish indeed wrong replied lucy with great solemnity know nobody of whose judgment think so highly a do of yours do really believe that if be to say to ' advise by mean to put end to engagement with edward ferrars will be more for happiness of of ' must resolve upon doing immediately elinor blushed for insincerity of edward future wife replied compliment must effectually frighten from giving opinion on subject have formed one raise influence much too high power of dividing two people so tenderly attached be too much for indifferent person 't be because be indifferent person said lucy with pique laying particular stress on word judgment might justly have such weight with if must be supposed to be biased in respect by own feeling opinion must not be worth having elinor thought wisest to make answer to lest might provoke other to unsuitable increase of ease unreserve be even partly determined never to mention subject again pause therefore of many minute duration succeeded speech lucy be still first to end will be in town winter miss dashwood said with accustomary complacency certainly not be sorry for returned other while eye brightened at information must have gave such pleasure to meet there dare say will go for to be sure brother sister will ask to come to will not be in power to accept invitation if do how unlucky be have quite depended upon meeting there anne be to go latter end of january to relation who have be wanting to visit several year only go for sake of seeing edward will be there in february otherwise london must have charm for have not spirit for be soon called to card table by conclusion of first rubber confidential discourse of two lady be therefore at end to of submitted without reluctance for nothing have be said on side to make dislike other le than have done before elinor sat down to card table with melancholy persuasion that edward be not only without affection for person who be to be wife that have not even chance of being tolerably happy in marriage sincere affection on side must have given for self interest alone must induce woman to keep man to engagement of seemed so thoroughly aware that be weary from time subject be never revived by elinor when entered on by lucy who seldom missed opportunity of introducing be particularly careful to inform confidante of happiness whenever received letter from edward be treated by former with calmness caution dismissed a soon a civility must allow for felt such conversation to be indulgence lucy did not deserve be dangerous to herself visit of miss steele at barton park be lengthened far beyond what first invitation implied favour increased must not be spared sir john must not hear of going in spite of numerous long arranged engagement in exeter in spite of absolute necessity of returning to fulfill immediately be in full force at end of week be prevailed on to stay nearly two month at park to assist in due celebration of festival requires more than ordinary share of private ball large dinner to proclaim importance chapter xxv though mr jennings be in habit of spending large portion of year at house of child friend be not without settled habitation of own since death of husband who have traded with success in le elegant part of town have resided winter in house in one of street near portman square towards home began on approach of january to turn thought thither one day abruptly very unexpectedly by asked elder miss dashwood to accompany elinor without observing varying complexion of sister animated look spoke indifference to plan immediately gave grateful absolute denial for in believed to be speaking united inclination reason alleged be determined resolution of not leaving mother at time of year mr jennings received refusal with surprise repeated invitation immediately oh lord be sure mother can spare very well do beg will favour with company for have quite set heart upon fancy that will be inconvenience to for sha put at out of way for will only be sending betty by coach hope can afford that three will be able to go very well in chaise when be in town if like to go wherever do well good may always go with one of daughter be sure mother will not object to for have have such good luck in getting own child off hand that will think very fit person to have charge of if get one of at least well married before have done with will not be fault will speak good word for to young men may depend upon have notion said sir john miss marianne must not object to scheme if elder sister must come into be very hard indeed that must not have little pleasure because miss dashwood doe not wish so must advise two to set off for town when be tired of barton without saying word to miss dashwood about nay cried mr jennings be sure will be monstrous glad of miss marianne company whether miss dashwood will go not only more merrier say thought must be more comfortable for to be together because if got tired of might talk to one laugh at old way behind back one other if not of must have lord bless how do think can live poking by who have be always used till winter to have charlotte with come miss marianne let strike hand upon bargain if miss dashwood will change mind by bye why so much better thank ma'be sincerely thank said marianne with warmth invitation have insured gratitude for ever must give such happiness yes almost greatest happiness be capable of to be able to accept mother dearest kindest mother feel justice of what elinor have urged if be to be made le happy le comfortable by absence oh nothing must tempt to leave must not must not be struggle mr jennings repeated assurance that mr dashwood must spare perfectly well elinor who now understood sister saw to what indifference to almost thing else be carried by eagerness to be with willoughby again made farther direct opposition to plan merely referred to mother decision from whom however scarcely expected to receive support in endeavour to prevent visit must not approve of for marianne on own account have particular reason to avoid marianne be desirous of mother must be eager to promote must not expect to influence latter to cautiousness of conduct in affair respecting have never be able to inspire with distrust dared not explain motive of own disinclination for going to london marianne fastidious a be thoroughly acquainted with mr jennings manner invariably disgusted by must overlook inconvenience of kind must disregard must be most wounding to irritable feeling in pursuit of one object be such proof so strong so full of importance of object to a elinor in spite of have passed be not prepared to witness on being informed of invitation mr dashwood persuaded that excursion must be productive of much amusement to daughter perceiving through affectionate attention to herself how much heart of marianne be in must not hear of declining offer upon account insisted on accepting directly then began to foresee with usual cheerfulness variety of advantage must accrue to from separation be delighted with plan cried be exactly what must wish margaret will be a much benefited by a yourselves when middleton be gone will go on so quietly happily together with book music will find margaret so improved when come back again have little plan of alteration for bedroom too may now be performed without inconvenience to one be very right that must go to town must have young woman of condition in life acquainted with manner amusement of london will be under care of motherly good sort of woman of whose kindness to can have doubt in probability will see brother may be fault fault of wife when consider whose son be can not bear to have so wholly estranged from other though with usual anxiety for happiness said elinor have be obviating impediment to present scheme occurred to there be still one objection in opinion can not be so easily removed marianne countenance sunk what said mr dashwood be dear prudent elinor going to suggest what formidable obstacle be now to bring forward do let hear word about expense of objection be though think very well of mr jennings heart be not woman whose society can afford pleasure whose protection will give consequence be very true replied mother of society separately from of other people will scarcely have thing at will almost always appear in public with lady middleton if elinor be frightened away by dislike of mr jennings said marianne at least need not prevent accepting invitation have such scruple be sure must put up with unpleasantness of kind with very little effort elinor must not help smiling at display of indifference towards manner of person to whom have often have difficulty in persuading marianne to behave with tolerable politeness resolved within that if sister persisted in going must go likewise a did not think proper that marianne must be left to sole guidance of own judgment that mr jennings must be abandoned to mercy of marianne for comfort of domestic hour to determination be more easily reconciled by recollecting edward ferrars by lucy account be not to be in town before february visit without unreasonable abridgement might be previously finished will have go said mr dashwood objection be nonsensical will have much pleasure in being in london especially in being together if elinor must ever condescend to anticipate enjoyment must foresee there from variety of source must perhaps expect from improving acquaintance with sister in law family elinor have often wished for opportunity of attempting to weaken mother dependence on attachment of edward that shock might be le when whole truth be revealed now on attack though almost hopeless of success forced to begin design by saying a calmly a must like edward ferrars very much will always be glad to see a to rest of family be matter of perfect indifference to whether be ever known to not mr dashwood smiled said nothing marianne lifted up eye in astonishment elinor conjectured that might a well have held tongue after very little farther discourse be finally settled that invitation must be fully accepted mr jennings received information with great deal of joy many assurance of kindness care be matter of pleasure merely to sir john be delighted for to man whose prevailing anxiety be dread of being alone acquisition of two to number of inhabitant in london be something even lady middleton took trouble of being delighted be putting rather out of way a for miss steele especially lucy have never be so happy in life a intelligence made elinor submitted to arrangement counteracted wish with le reluctance than have expected to feel with regard to herself be now matter of unconcern whether went to town not when saw mother so thoroughly pleased with plan sister exhilarated by in look voice manner restored to usual animation elevated to more than usual gaiety must not be dissatisfied with cause must hardly allow to distrust consequence marianne joy be almost degree beyond happiness so great be perturbation of spirit impatience to be gone unwillingness to quit mother be only restorative to calmness at moment of parting grief on score be excessive mother affliction be hardly le elinor be only one of three who seemed to consider separation a thing short of eternal departure took place in first week in january middleton be to follow in about week miss steele kept station at park be to quit only with rest of family chapter xxvi elinor must not find in carriage with mr jennings beginning journey to london under protection a guest without wondering at own situation so short have acquaintance with lady be so wholly unsuited be in age disposition so many have be objection against measure only few day before objection have with happy ardour of youth marianne mother equally shared be overcome overlooked elinor in spite of occasional doubt of willoughby constancy must not witness rapture of delightful expectation filled whole soul beamed in eye of marianne without feeling how blank be own prospect how cheerless own state of mind in comparison how gladly must engage in solicitude of marianne situation to have same animating object in view same possibility of hope short very short time however must now decide what willoughby intention be in probability be already in town marianne eagerness to be gone declared dependence on finding there elinor be resolved not only upon gaining new light a to character own observation intelligence of others must give likewise upon watching behaviour to sister with such zealous attention a to ascertain what be what meant before many meeting have taken place must result of observation be unfavourable be determined at event to open eye of sister must be otherwise exertion must be of different nature must then learn to avoid selfish comparison banish regret might lessen satisfaction in happiness of marianne be three day on journey marianne behaviour a travelled be happy specimen of what future complaisance companionableness to mr jennings might be expected to be sat in silence almost way wrapt in own meditation scarcely ever voluntarily speaking except when object of picturesque beauty within view drew from exclamation of delight exclusively addressed to sister to atone for conduct therefore elinor took immediate possession of post of civility have assigned behaved with greatest attention to mr jennings talked with laughed with listened to whenever must mr jennings on side treated with possible kindness be solicitous on occasion for ease enjoyment only disturbed that must not

advanced few step towards stair after listening minute returned into room in agitation conviction of having heard must naturally produce in ecstasy of feeling at instant must not help exclaiming elinor be willoughby indeed be seemed almost ready to throw into arm when colonel brandon appeared be too great shock to be borne with calmness immediately left room elinor be disappointed too at same time regard for colonel brandon ensured welcome with felt particularly hurt that man so partial to sister must perceive that experienced nothing grief disappointment in seeing instantly saw that be not unnoticed by that even observed marianne a quitted room with such astonishment concern a hardly left recollection of what civility demanded towards be sister ill said elinor answered in distress that be then talked of head ache low spirit over fatigue of thing to must decently attribute sister behaviour heard with most earnest attention seeming to recollect said more on subject began directly to speak of pleasure at seeing in london making usual inquiry about journey friend have left behind in calm kind of way with very little interest on side continued to talk of out of spirit thought of engaged elsewhere elinor wished very much to ask whether willoughby be then in town be afraid of giving pain by enquiry after rival at length by way of saying something asked if have be in london ever since have seen last yes replied with embarrassment almost ever since have be once twice at delaford for few day have never be in power to return to barton manner in be said immediately brought back

than have be before mr jennings must not prevail on to stay long other visitor appeared that evening lady be unanimous in agreeing to go early to bed marianne rose next morning with recovered spirit happy look disappointment of evening before seemed forgotten in expectation of what be to happen day have not long finished breakfast before mr palmer barouche stopped at door in few minute came laughing into room so delighted to see that be hard to say whether received most pleasure from meeting mother miss dashwoods again so surprised at coming to town though be what have rather expected all along so angry at accepting mother invitation after having declined own though at same time must never have forgiven if have not come mr palmer will be so happy to see said what do think said when heard of coming with mamma forget what be now be something so droll after hour two spent in what mother called comfortable chat in other word in variety of inquiry concerning acquaintance on mr jennings side in laughter without cause on mr palmer be proposed by latter that must accompany to shop where have business that morning to mr jennings elinor readily consented a having likewise purchase to make marianne though declining at first be induced to go likewise wherever went be evidently always on watch in bond street especially where much of business lay eye be in constant inquiry in shop party be engaged mind be equally abstracted from thing actually before from interested occupied others restless dissatisfied where sister must never obtain opinion of article of purchase however might equally concern received pleasure from anything be only impatient to be at home again must with difficulty govern vexation at tediousness of mr palmer whose eye be caught by thing pretty expensive new who be wild to buy must determine on none dawdled away time in rapture indecision be late in morning before returned home sooner have entered house than marianne flew eagerly up stair when elinor followed found turning from table with sorrowful countenance declared that willoughby have be there have letter be left here for since went out said to footman who then entered with parcel be answered in negative be quite sure of replied be certain that servant porter have left letter note man replied that none have how very odd said in low disappointed voice a turned away to window how odd indeed repeated elinor within regarding sister with uneasiness if have not known to be in town must not have written to a did must have written to combe magna if be in town how odd that must come write oh dear mother must be wrong in permitting engagement between daughter so young man so little known to be carried on in so doubtful so mysterious manner long to inquire how will interference be borne determined after consideration that if appearance continued many day longer a unpleasant a now be must represent in strongest manner to mother necessity of serious enquiry into affair mr palmer two elderly lady of mr jennings intimate acquaintance whom have met invited in morning dined with former left soon after tea to fulfill evening engagement elinor be obliged to assist in making whist table for others marianne be of use on occasion a must never learn game though time be therefore at own disposal evening be by mean more productive of pleasure to than to elinor for be spent in anxiety of expectation pain of disappointment sometimes endeavoured for few minute to read book be soon thrown aside returned to more interesting employment of walking backwards forward across room pausing for moment whenever came to window in hope of distinguishing long expected rap chapter xxvii if open weather hold much longer said mr jennings when met at breakfast following morning sir john will not like leaving barton next week 't be sad thing for sportsman to lose day pleasure poor soul always pity when do seem to take so much to heart be true cried marianne in cheerful voice walking to window a spoke to examine day have not thought of that weather will keep many sportsman in country be lucky recollection good spirit be restored by be charming weather for indeed continued a sat down to breakfast table with happy countenance how much must enjoy with little return of anxiety can not be expected to last long at time of year after such series of rain will certainly have very little more of frost will soon set in in probability with severity in day two perhaps extreme mildness can hardly last longer nay perhaps may freeze tonight at rate said elinor wishing to prevent mr jennings from seeing sister thought a clearly a did dare say will have sir john lady middleton in town by end of next week ay dear will warrant do mary always have own way now silently conjectured elinor will write to combe by day post if did letter be written sent away with privacy eluded watchfulness to ascertain fact whatever truth of might be far a elinor be from feeling thorough contentment about yet while saw marianne in spirit must not be very uncomfortable herself marianne be in spirit happy in mildness of weather still happier in expectation of frost morning be chiefly spent in leaving card at house of mr jennings acquaintance to inform of being in town marianne be time busy in observing direction of wind watching variation of sky imagining alteration in air find colder than be in morning elinor there seems to very decided difference can hardly keep hand warm even in muff be not so yesterday think cloud seem parting too sun will be out in moment will have clear afternoon elinor be alternately diverted pained marianne persevered saw night in brightness of fire morning in appearance of atmosphere certain symptom of approaching frost miss dashwoods have greater reason to be dissatisfied with mr jennings style of living set of acquaintance than with behaviour to be invariably kind thing in household arrangement be conducted on most liberal plan excepting few old city friend whom to lady middleton regret have never dropped visited one to whom introduction must at discompose feeling of young companion pleased to find more comfortably situated in particular than have expected elinor be very willing to compound for want of much real enjoyment from of evening party whether at home abroad formed only for card must have little to amuse colonel brandon who have general invitation to house be with almost day came to look at marianne talk to elinor who often derived more satisfaction from conversing with than from other daily occurrence who saw at same time with much concern continued regard for sister feared be strengthening regard grieved to see earnestness with often watched marianne spirit be certainly worse than when at barton about week after arrival became certain that willoughby be also arrived card be on table when came in from morning drive good god cried marianne have be here while be out elinor rejoiced to be assured of being in london now ventured to say depend upon will call again tomorrow marianne seemed hardly to hear on mr jennings entrance escaped with precious card event while raised spirit of elinor restored to of sister more than former agitation from moment mind be never quiet expectation of seeing hour of day made unfit for thing insisted on being left behind next morning when others went out elinor thought be full of what might be passing in berkeley street during absence moment glance at sister when returned be enough to inform that willoughby have paid no second visit there note be just then brought in laid on table for cried marianne stepping hastily forward ma'be for mistress marianne not convinced took instantly up be indeed for mr jennings how provoking be expecting letter then said elinor unable to be longer silent yes little not much after short pause have confidence in marianne nay elinor reproach from who have confidence in one returned elinor in confusion indeed marianne have nothing to tell answered marianne with energy situation then be alike have of thing to tell because communicate because conceal nothing elinor distressed by charge of reserve in herself be not at liberty to do away knew not how under such circumstance to press for greater openness in marianne mr jennings soon appeared note being given read aloud be from lady middleton announcing arrival in conduit street night before requesting company of mother cousin following evening business on sir john part violent cold on own prevented calling in berkeley street invitation be accepted when hour of appointment drew near necessary a be in common civility to mr jennings that must attend on visit elinor have difficulty in persuading sister to go for still have seen nothing of willoughby therefore be not more indisposed for amusement abroad than unwilling to run risk of calling again in absence elinor found when evening be over disposition be not materially altered by change of abode for although scarcely settled in town sir john have contrived to collect around nearly twenty young people to amuse with ball be affair however of lady middleton did not approve in country unpremeditated dance be very allowable in london where reputation of elegance be more important le easily attained be risking too much for gratification of few girl to have known that lady middleton have given small dance of eight nine couple with two violin mere side board collation mr mr palmer be of party from former whom have not seen before since arrival in town a be careful to avoid appearance of attention to mother in law therefore never came near received mark of recognition on entrance looked at slightly without seeming to know who be merely nodded to mr jennings from other side of room marianne gave one glance round apartment a entered be enough be not there sat down equally ill disposed to receive communicate pleasure after have be assembled about hour mr palmer sauntered towards miss dashwoods to express surprise on seeing in town though colonel brandon have be first informed of arrival at house have said something very droll on hearing that be to come thought be in devonshire said did replied elinor when do go back again know thus ended discourse never have marianne be so unwilling to dance in life a be that evening never so much fatigued by exercise complained of a returned to berkeley street aye aye said mr jennings know reason of very well if certain person who will be nameless have be there must not have be bit tired to say truth be not very pretty of not to give meeting when be invited invited cried marianne so daughter middleton told for seems sir john met somewhere in street morning marianne said more looked exceedingly hurt impatient in situation to be doing something might lead to sister relief elinor resolved to write next morning to mother hoped by awakening fear for health of marianne to procure inquiry have be so long delayed be still more eagerly bent on measure by perceiving after breakfast on morrow that marianne be again writing to willoughby for must not suppose to be to other person about middle of day mr jennings went out by on business elinor began letter directly while marianne too restless for employment too anxious for conversation walked from one window to other sat down by fire in melancholy meditation elinor be very earnest in application to mother relating have passed suspicion of willoughby inconstancy urging by plea of duty affection to demand from marianne account of real situation with respect to letter be scarcely finished when rap foretold visitor colonel brandon be announced marianne who have seen from window who hated company of kind left room before entered looked more than usually grave though expressing satisfaction at finding miss dashwood alone a if have somewhat in particular to tell sat for time without saying word elinor persuaded that have communication to make in sister be concerned impatiently expected opening be not first time of feeling same kind of conviction for more than once before beginning with observation of sister look unwell to day sister seems out of spirit have appeared on point of disclosing of inquiring something particular about after pause of several minute silence be broken by asking in voice of agitation when be to congratulate on acquisition of brother elinor be not prepared for such question having answer ready be obliged to adopt simple common expedient of asking what meant tried to smile a replied sister engagement to mr willoughby be very generally known can not be generally known returned elinor for own family know looked surprised said beg pardon be afraid inquiry have be impertinent have not supposed secrecy intended a openly correspond marriage be universally talked of how can that be by whom can have heard mentioned by many by of whom know nothing by others with whom be most intimate mr jennings mr palmer middleton still might not have believed for where mind be perhaps rather unwilling to be convinced will always find something to support doubt if have not when servant let in today accidentally seen letter in hand directed to mr willoughby in sister writing came to inquire be convinced before must ask question be thing finally settled be impossible to have right must have chance of succeeding excuse miss dashwood believe have be wrong in saying so much hardly know what to do on prudence have strongest dependence tell that be absolutely resolved on attempt that in short concealment if concealment be possible be remains word conveyed to elinor direct avowal of love for sister affected very much be not immediately able to say anything even when spirit be recovered debated for short time on answer must be most proper to give real state of thing between willoughby sister be so little known to herself that in endeavouring to explain might be a liable to say too much a too little yet a be convinced that marianne affection for willoughby must leave hope of colonel brandon success whatever event of affection might be at same time wished to shield conduct from censure thought most prudent kind after consideration to say more than really knew believed acknowledged therefore that though have never be informed by of term on stood with other of mutual affection have doubt of correspondence be not astonished to hear listened to with silent attention on ceasing to speak rose directly from seat after saying in voice of emotion to sister wish imaginable happiness to willoughby that may endeavour to deserve took leave went away elinor derived comfortable feeling from conversation to lessen uneasiness of mind on other point be left on contrary with melancholy impression of colonel brandon unhappiness be prevented even from wishing removed by anxiety for very event that must confirm chapter xxviii nothing occurred during next three four day to make elinor regret what have done in applying to mother for willoughby came wrote be engaged about end of time to attend lady middleton to party from mr jennings be kept away by indisposition of youngest daughter for party marianne wholly dispirited careless of appearance seeming equally indifferent whether went staid prepared without one look of hope one expression of pleasure sat by drawing room fire after tea till moment of lady middleton arrival without once stirring from seat altering attitude lost in own thought insensible of sister presence when at last be told that lady middleton waited for at door started a if have forgotten that one be expected arrived in due time at place of destination a soon a string of carriage before must allow alighted ascended stair heard name announced from one landing place to in audible voice entered room splendidly lit up quite full of company insufferably hot when have paid tribute of politeness by curtsying to lady of house be permitted to mingle in crowd take share of heat inconvenience to arrival must necessarily add after time spent in saying little doing le lady middleton sat down to cassino a marianne be not in spirit for moving about elinor luckily succeeding to chair placed at great distance from table have not remained in manner long before elinor perceived willoughby standing within few yard of in earnest conversation with very fashionable looking young woman soon caught eye immediately bowed without attempting to speak to to approach marianne though must not see then continued discourse with same lady elinor turned involuntarily to marianne to see whether must be unobserved by at moment first perceived whole countenance glowing with sudden delight must have moved towards instantly have not sister caught hold of good heaven exclaimed be there be there oh why doe not look at why can not speak to pray pray be composed cried elinor betray what feel to body present perhaps have not observed yet however be more than must believe to be composed at moment be not only beyond reach of marianne be beyond wish sat in agony of impatience affected feature illustration at moment first perceived at last turned round again regarded started up pronouncing name in tone of affection held out hand to approached addressing rather to elinor than marianne a if wishing to avoid eye determined not to observe attitude inquired in hurried manner after mr dashwood asked how long have be in town elinor be robbed of presence of mind by such address be unable to say word feeling of sister be instantly expressed face be crimsoned over exclaimed in voice of

while waited return of mr jennings have leisure enough for thinking over past that kind of engagement have subsisted between willoughby marianne must not doubt that willoughby be weary of seemed equally clear for however marianne might still feed own wish must not attribute such behaviour to mistake misapprehension of kind nothing thorough change of sentiment must account for indignation must

such general tremor a made fear impossible to escape mr jennings notice that good lady however saw only that marianne have received letter from willoughby appeared to very good joke treated accordingly by hoping with laugh that must find to liking of elinor distress be too busily employed in measuring length of worsted for rug to see thing at calmly continuing talk a soon a marianne disappeared said upon word never saw young woman so desperately in love in life girl be nothing to yet used to be foolish enough a for miss marianne be quite altered creature hope from bottom of heart wo keep waiting much longer for be quite grievous to see look so ill forlorn pray when be to be married elinor though never le disposed to speak than at moment obliged to answer attack a therefore trying to smile replied have really ma'be talked into persuasion of sister being engaged to mr willoughby thought have be only joke so serious question seems to imply more must beg therefore will not

unkind thing in spreading report will find that have though will not believe now mr jennings laughed again elinor have not spirit to say more eager at event to know what willoughby have written hurried away to room where on opening door saw marianne stretched on bed almost choked by grief one letter in hand two three others laying by elinor drew near without saying word seating on bed took hand kissed affectionately several time then gave way to burst of tear at first be scarcely le violent than marianne latter though unable to speak seemed to feel tenderness of behaviour after time thus spent in joint affliction put letter into elinor hand then covering face with handkerchief almost screamed with agony elinor who knew that such grief shocking a be to witness must have course watched by till excess of suffering have somewhat spent then turning eagerly to willoughby letter read a follows bond street january dear madam have just have honour of receiving letter for beg to

send letter so impudently cruel letter instead of bringing with desire of release profession of regret acknowledged breach of faith denied peculiar affection whatever letter of line be insult proclaimed writer to be deep in hardened villainy paused over for time with indignant astonishment then read again again perusal only served to increase abhorrence of man so bitter be feeling against that dared not trust to speak lest might wound marianne still deeper by treating disengagement not a loss to of possible good a escape from worst most irremediable of evil connection for life with unprincipled man a deliverance most real blessing most important in earnest meditation on content of letter on depravity of mind must dictate probably on very different mind of very different person

round room for marianne elinor immediately fancied that neither expected wished to see there in short that be already aware of what occasioned absence mr jennings be not struck by same thought for soon after entrance walked across room to tea table where elinor presided whispered colonel look a grave a ever see know nothing of do tell dear illustration how fond be of shortly afterwards drew chair close to with look perfectly assured of good information inquired after sister marianne be not well said have be indisposed day have persuaded to go to bed perhaps then hesitatingly replied what heard morning may be there may be more truth in than must believe possible at first what did hear that gentleman whom have reason to think in short that man whom knew to be engaged how will tell if know already a surely must may be spared mean answered elinor with forced calmness mr willoughby marriage with miss grey yes do know seems to have be day of general elucidation for very morning first unfolded to mr willoughby be unfathomable where did hear in stationer shop in pall mall where have business two lady be waiting for carriage one of be giving other account of intended match in voice so little attempting concealment that be impossible for not to hear name of willoughby john willoughby frequently repeated first caught attention what followed be positive assertion thing be now finally settled respecting marriage with miss grey be no longer to be secret must take place even within few week with many particular of preparation other matter one thing especially remember because served to identify man still more a soon a ceremony be over be to go to combe magna seat in somersetshire astonishment must be impossible to describe what felt communicative lady learnt on inquiry for stayed in shop till be gone be mr ellison that a have be since informed be name of miss grey guardian be have likewise heard that miss grey have fifty thousand pound in if in thing may find explanation may be so willoughby be capable at least think stopped moment then added in voice seemed to distrust sister how did suffering have be very severe have only to hope that may be proportionately short have be be most cruel affliction till yesterday believe never doubted regard even now perhaps be almost convinced that never be really attached to have be very deceitful in point there seems hardness of heart about ah said colonel brandon there be indeed sister doe not think said so doe not consider quite a do know disposition may believe how eagerly must still justify if must made answer soon afterwards by removal of tea thing arrangement of card party subject be necessarily dropped mr jennings who have watched with pleasure while be talking who expected to see effect of miss dashwood communication in such instantaneous gaiety on colonel brandon side a might have become man in bloom of youth of hope happiness saw with amazement remain whole evening more serious thoughtful than usual chapter xxxi from night of more sleep than have expected marianne awoke next morning to same consciousness of misery in have closed eye elinor encouraged a much a possible to talk of what felt before breakfast be ready have gone through subject again again with same steady conviction affectionate counsel on elinor side same impetuous feeling varying opinion on marianne a before sometimes must believe willoughby to be a unfortunate a innocent a herself at others lost consolation in impossibility of acquitting at one moment be absolutely indifferent to observation of world at must seclude from for ever at third must resist with energy in one thing however be uniform when came to point in avoiding where be possible presence of mr jennings in determined silence when obliged to endure heart be hardened against belief of mr jennings entering into sorrow with compassion can not be cried can not feel kindness be not sympathy good nature be not tenderness that want be gossip only like now because supply elinor have not needed to be assured of injustice to sister be often led in opinion of others by irritable refinement of own mind too great importance placed by on delicacy of strong sensibility grace of polished manner like rest of world if more than half there be be clever good marianne with excellent ability excellent disposition be reasonable candid expected from other people same opinion feeling a own judged of motif by immediate effect of action on thus circumstance occurred while sister be together in own room after breakfast sunk heart of mr jennings still lower in estimation because through own weakness chanced to prove source of fresh pain to herself though mr jennings be governed in by impulse of utmost good will with letter in outstretched hand countenance gaily smiling from persuasion of bringing comfort entered room saying now dear bring something be sure will do good marianne heard enough in one moment imagination placed before letter from willoughby full of tenderness contrition explanatory of have passed satisfactory convincing instantly followed by willoughby rushing eagerly into room to enforce at foot by eloquence of eye assurance of letter work of one moment be destroyed by next hand writing of mother never till then unwelcome be before in acuteness of disappointment followed ecstasy of more than hope felt a if till instant have never suffered cruelty of mr jennings language within reach in moment of happiest eloquence must have expressed now must reproach only by tear streamed from eye with passionate violence reproach however so entirely lost on object that after many expression of pity withdrew still referring to letter of comfort letter when be calm enough to read brought little comfort willoughby filled page mother still confident of engagement relying a warmly a ever on constancy have only be roused by elinor application to entreat from marianne greater openness towards with such tenderness towards such affection for willoughby conviction of future happiness in other that wept with agony through whole of impatience to be at home again now returned mother be dearer to than ever dearer through very excess of mistaken confidence in willoughby be wildly urgent to be gone elinor unable herself to determine whether be better for marianne to be in london at barton offered counsel of own except of patience till mother wish must be known at length obtained sister consent to wait for knowledge mr jennings left earlier than usual for must not be easy till middleton palmer be able to grieve a much a herself positively refusing elinor offered attendance went out alone for rest of morning elinor with very heavy heart aware of pain be going to communicate perceiving by marianne letter how ill have succeeded in laying foundation for then sat down to write mother account of what have passed entreat direction for future while marianne who came into drawing room on mr jennings going away remained fixed at table where elinor wrote watching advancement of pen grieving over for hardship of such task grieving still more fondly over effect on mother in manner have continued about quarter of hour when marianne whose nerve must not then bear sudden noise be startled by rap at door who can be cried so early too thought have be safe marianne moved to window be colonel brandon said with vexation be never safe from will not come in a mr jennings be from home will not trust to retreating to own room man who have nothing to do with own time have conscience in intrusion on of others event proved conjecture right though be founded on injustice error for colonel brandon did come in elinor who be convinced that solicitude for marianne brought thither who saw solicitude in disturbed melancholy look in anxious though brief inquiry after must not forgive sister for esteeming so lightly met mr jennings in bond street said after first salutation encouraged to come on be more easily encouraged because thought probable might find alone be very desirous of doing object wish sole wish in desiring hope believe be be to be mean of giving comfort must not say comfort not present comfort conviction lasting conviction to sister mind regard for for yourself for mother will allow to prove by relating circumstance nothing very sincere regard nothing earnest desire of being useful think be justified though where so many hour have be spent in convincing that be right be there not reason to fear may be wrong stopped understand said elinor have something to tell of mr willoughby will open character farther telling will be greatest act of friendship can be shown marianne gratitude will be insured immediately by information tending to end hers must be gained by in

quickly succeeding other arrived to tell that suffered thought to express anxious solicitude for marianne entreat must bear up with fortitude under misfortune bad indeed must nature of marianne affliction be when mother must talk of fortitude mortifying humiliating must be origin of regret must wish not to indulge against interest of own individual comfort mr dashwood have determined that must be better for marianne to be where at time than at barton where thing within view must be bringing back past in strongest most afflicting manner by constantly placing willoughby before such a

in other way negligence must never leave exposed to surprise chance have le in favour in crowd of london than even in retirement of barton where might force before while paying that visit at allenham

be to be in town before middle of february judged right that must sometimes see brother marianne have promised to be guided by mother opinion submitted to therefore without opposition though proved perfectly different from what wished expected though felt to be entirely wrong formed on mistaken ground that by requiring longer continuance in london deprived of only possible alleviation of wretchedness personal sympathy of mother doomed to such society such scene a must prevent ever knowing moment rest be matter of great consolation to that what brought evil to herself must bring good to sister elinor on other hand suspecting that must not be in power to avoid edward entirely comforted herself by thinking that though longer stay must therefore militate against own happiness must be better for marianne than immediate return into devonshire carefulness in guarding sister from ever hearing willoughby name mentioned be not thrown away marianne though without knowing reaped advantage for mr jennings sir john even mr palmer ever spoke of before elinor wished that same forbearance must have extended towards be impossible be obliged to listen day after day to indignation of sir john

who must meet without feeling curiosity after particular anxiety for sister health qualification be raised at time by circumstance of moment to more than real value be sometimes worried down by officious condolence to rate good breeding a more indispensable to comfort than good nature lady middleton expressed sense of affair about once day twice if subject occurred very often by saying be very shocking indeed by mean of continual though gentle vent be able not only to see miss dashwoods from first without smallest emotion very soon to see without recollecting word of matter having thus supported dignity of own sex spoken decided censure of what be wrong in other thought at liberty to attend to interest of own assembly therefore determined though rather against opinion of sir john

temper be saved trouble of checking by lucy sharp reprimand now a on many occasion though did not give much sweetness to manner of one sister be of advantage in governing of other chapter xxxiii after opposition marianne yielded to sister entreaty consented to go out with mr jennings one morning for hour expressly conditioned however for paying visit must do more than accompany to gray in sackville street where elinor be carrying on negotiation for exchange of few old fashioned jewel of mother when stopped at door mr jennings recollected that there be lady at other end of street on whom ought to call a have business at gray be resolved that while young friend transacted must pay visit return for on ascending stair miss dashwoods found so many people before in room that there be not person at liberty to tend to order be obliged to wait must be done be to sit down at end of counter seemed to promise quickest succession one gentleman only be standing there be probable that elinor be not

inspection by remaining unconscious of for be a well able to collect thought within be a ignorant of what be passing around in mr gray shop a in own bedroom at last affair be decided ivory gold pearl received appointment gentleman having named last day on existence must be continued without possession of toothpick case drew on glove with leisurely care bestowing glance on miss dashwoods one a seemed rather to demand than express admiration walked off with happy air of real conceit affected indifference elinor lost time in bringing business forward be on point of concluding when gentleman presented at side turned eye towards face found with surprise to be brother illustration introduced to mr jennings affection pleasure in meeting be just enough to make very creditable appearance in mr gray shop john dashwood be really far from being sorry to see sister again rather gave satisfaction inquiry after mother be respectful attentive elinor found that fanny have be in town two day wished very much to call upon yesterday said be impossible for be obliged to take harry to see wild beast at exeter exchange spent rest of day with mr ferrars harry be vastly pleased morning have fully

brought most charming account of place most complete thing of kind said that ever be seemed to enjoy beyond thing be great satisfaction to to hear assure elinor did feel little ashamed of brother be not sorry to be spared necessity of answering by arrival of mr jennings servant who came to tell that mistress waited for at door mr dashwood attended down stair be introduced to mr jennings at door of carriage repeating hope of being able to call on next day took leave illustration mr jennings assured directly that must not stand upon ceremony visit be duly paid came with pretence at apology

something like must certainly wait on mr john dashwood very soon bring sister to see manner to though calm be perfectly kind to mr jennings most attentively civil on colonel brandon coming in soon after eyed with curiosity seemed to say that only wanted to know to be rich to be equally civil to after staying with hour asked elinor to walk with to conduit street introduce to sir john lady middleton weather be remarkably fine readily consented a soon a be out of house enquiry began who be colonel brandon be man of fortune yes have very good property in dorsetshire be glad of seems most gentlemanlike man think elinor may congratulate on prospect of very respectable establishment in life brother what do mean like observed narrowly be convinced of be amount of fortune believe about two thousand year two thousand year then working up to pitch of enthusiastic generosity added elinor wish with heart be twice a much for sake indeed believe replied elinor be very sure that colonel brandon have not smallest wish of marrying be mistaken elinor be very much mistaken very little trouble on side secures perhaps just at present may be undecided smallness of fortune may make hang back friend may advise against of little attention encouragement lady can so easily give will fix in spite of there can be reason why must not try for be not to be supposed that prior attachment on side in short know a to attachment of kind be quite out of question objection be insurmountable have too much sense not to see colonel brandon must be man civility will be wanting on part to make pleased with family be match must give universal satisfaction in short be kind of thing that lowering voice to important whisper will be exceedingly welcome to party recollecting however added that be mean to say friend be truly anxious to see well settled fanny particularly for have interest very much at heart assure mother too mr ferrars very good natured woman be sure must give great pleasure said a much other day elinor must not vouchsafe answer must be something remarkable now continued something droll if fanny must have brother sister settling at same time yet be not very unlikely be mr edward ferrars said elinor with resolution going to be married be not actually settled there be such thing in agitation have most excellent mother mr ferrars with utmost liberality will come forward settle on thousand year if match take place lady be hon miss morton only daughter of late lord morton with thirty thousand pound very desirable connection on side have not doubt of taking place in time thousand year be great deal for mother to give away to make over for ever mr ferrars have noble spirit to give instance of liberality other day a soon a came to town aware that money must not be very plenty with just now put bank note into fanny hand to amount of two hundred pound extremely acceptable be for must live at great expense while be here paused for assent compassion forced to say expense in town country must certainly be considerable income be large one not so large dare say a many people suppose mean to complain however be undoubtedly comfortable one hope will in time be better enclosure of norland common now carrying on be most serious drain then have made little purchase within half year east kingham farm must remember place where old gibson used to live land be so very desirable for in respect so immediately adjoining own property felt duty to buy must not have answered to conscience to let fall into other hand man must pay for convenience have cost vast deal of money more than think really intrinsically worth why hope not that might have sold again next day for more than gave with regard to purchase money might have be very unfortunate indeed for stock be at time so low that if have not happened to have necessary sum in banker hand must have sold out to very great loss elinor must only smile other great inevitable expense too have have on first coming to norland respected father a well know bequeathed stanhill effect remained at norland very valuable be to mother far be from to repine at doing so have undoubted right to dispose of own property a chose in consequence of have be obliged to make large purchase of linen china c to supply place of what be taken away may guess after expense how very far must be from being rich how acceptable mr ferrars kindness be certainly said elinor assisted by liberality hope may yet live to be in easy circumstance year two may do much towards gravely replied however there be still great deal to be done there be not stone laid of fanny green house nothing plan of flower garden marked out where be green house to be upon knoll behind house old walnut tree be come down to make room for will be very fine object from many part of park flower garden will slope down just before be exceedingly pretty have cleared away old thorn grew in patch over brow elinor kept concern censure to herself be very thankful that marianne be not present to share provocation having now said enough to make poverty clear to do away necessity of buying pair of ear ring for of sister in next visit at gray thought took cheerfuller turn began to congratulate elinor on having such friend a mr jennings seems most valuable woman indeed house style of living bespeak exceeding good income be acquaintance have not only be of great use to hitherto in end may prove materially advantageous inviting to town be certainly vast thing in favour indeed speaks altogether so great regard for that in probability when dy will not be forgotten must have great deal to leave nothing at must rather suppose for have only jointure will descend to child be not to be imagined that life up to income few people of common prudence will do save will be able to dispose of do not think more likely that must leave to daughter than to daughter be exceedingly well married therefore can not perceive necessity of remembering farther whereas in opinion by taking so much notice of treating in kind of way have given sort of claim on future consideration conscientious woman must not disregard nothing can be kinder than behaviour can hardly do without being aware of expectation raise raise none in most concerned indeed brother anxiety for welfare prosperity carry too far why to be sure said seeming to recollect people have little have very little in power dear elinor what be matter with marianne look very unwell have lost colour be grown quite thin be ill be not well have have nervous complaint on for several week be sorry for at time of life thing of illness destroys bloom for ever have be very short one be a handsome girl last september a ever saw a likely to attract man there be something in style of beauty to please particularly remember fanny used to say that must marry sooner better than did not what be exceedingly fond of so happened to strike will be mistaken however question whether marianne now will marry man worth more than five six hundred year at utmost be very much deceived if do better dorsetshire know very little of dorsetshire dear elinor will be exceedingly glad to know more of think can answer for having fanny among earliest best pleased of visitor elinor tried very seriously to convince that there be likelihood of marrying colonel brandon be expectation of too much pleasure to to be relinquished be really resolved on seeking intimacy with gentleman promoting marriage by possible attention have just compunction enough for having done nothing for sister to be exceedingly anxious that everybody else must do great deal offer from colonel brandon legacy from mr jennings be easiest mean of atoning for own neglect be lucky enough to find lady middleton at home sir john came in before visit ended abundance of civility passed on side sir john be ready to like anybody though mr dashwood did not seem to know much about horse soon set down a very good natured fellow while lady middleton saw enough of fashion in appearance to think acquaintance worth having mr dashwood went away delighted with will have charming account to carry to fanny said a walked back with sister lady middleton be really most elegant woman woman a be sure fanny will be glad to know mr jennings too exceedingly well behaved woman though not so elegant a daughter sister need not have scruple even of visiting to say truth have be little case very naturally for only knew that mr jennings be widow of man who have got money in low way fanny mr ferrars be strongly prepossessed that daughter be such kind of woman a fanny must like to associate with now can carry most satisfactory account of chapter xxxiv mr john dashwood have so much confidence in husband judgment that waited very next day on mr jennings daughter confidence be rewarded by finding even former even woman with whom sister be staying by mean unworthy notice a for lady middleton found one of most charming woman in world lady middleton be equally pleased with mr dashwood there be kind of cold hearted selfishness on side mutually attracted sympathised with other in insipid propriety of demeanor general want of understanding same manner however recommended mr john dashwood to good opinion of lady middleton did not suit fancy of mr jennings to appeared nothing more than little proud looking woman of uncordial address who met husband sister without affection almost without having anything to say to for of quarter of hour bestowed on berkeley street sat at least seven minute half in silence elinor wanted very much to know though did not choose to ask whether edward be then in town nothing must have induced fanny voluntarily to mention name before till able to tell that marriage with miss morton be resolved on till husband expectation on colonel brandon be answered because believed still so very much attached to other that must not be too sedulously divided in word deed on occasion intelligence however must not give soon flowed from quarter lucy came very shortly to claim elinor compassion on being unable to see edward though have arrived in town with mr mr dashwood dared not come to bartlett building for fear of detection though mutual impatience to meet be not to be told must hing at present write edward assured of being in town within very short time by twice calling in berkeley street twice be card found on table when returned from morning engagement be pleased that have called still more pleased that have missed dashwoods be so prodigiously delighted with middleton though not much in habit of giving anything determined to give dinner soon after acquaintance began invited to dine in harley street where have taken very good house for three month sister mr jennings be invited likewise john dashwood be careful to secure colonel brandon who always glad to be where miss dashwoods be received eager civility with surprise much more pleasure be to meet mr ferrars elinor must not learn whether son be to be of party expectation of seeing however be enough to make interested in engagement for though must now meet edward mother without strong anxiety have once promised to attend such introduction though must now see with perfect indifference a to opinion of desire of being in company with mr ferrars curiosity to know what be like be a lively a ever interest with thus anticipated party be soon afterwards increased more powerfully than pleasantly by hearing that miss steele be also to be at so well have recommended to lady middleton so agreeable have assiduity made to that though lucy be certainly not so elegant sister not even genteel be a ready a sir john to ask to spend week two in conduit street happened to be particularly convenient to miss steele a soon a dashwoods invitation be known that visit must begin few day before party took place claim to notice of mr john dashwood a niece of gentleman who for many year have have care of brother might not have done much however towards procuring seat at table a lady middleton guest must be welcome lucy who have long wanted to be personally known to family to have nearer view of character own difficulty to have opportunity of endeavouring to please have seldom be happier in life than be on receiving mr john dashwood card on effect be very different began immediately to determine edward who lived with mother must be asked a mother be to party given by sister to see for first time after passed in company of lucy hardly knew how must bear apprehension perhaps be not founded entirely on reason certainly not at on truth be relieved however not by own recollection by good will of lucy who believed to be inflicting severe disappointment when told that edward certainly must not be in harley street on tuesday even hoped to be carrying pain still farther by persuading that be kept away by extreme affection for herself must not conceal when be together important tuesday came be to introduce two young lady to formidable mother in law pity dear miss dashwood said lucy a walked up stair together for middleton arrived so directly after mr jennings that followed servant at same time there be nobody here can feel for declare can hardly stand good gracious in moment will see person that happiness depends on be to be mother elinor must have given immediate relief by suggesting possibility of being miss morton mother rather than own whom be about to behold instead of doing that assured with great sincerity that did pity her to utter amazement of lucy who though really uncomfortable hoped at least to be object of irrepressible envy to elinor mr ferrars be little thin woman upright even to formality in figure serious even to sourness in aspect complexion be sallow feature small without beauty naturally without expression lucky contraction of brow have rescued countenance from disgrace of insipidity by giving strong character of pride ill nature be not woman of many word for unlike people in general proportioned to number of idea of few syllable did escape not one fell to share of miss dashwood whom eyed with spirited determination of disliking at event elinor must not now be made unhappy by behaviour few month ago must have hurt exceedingly be not in mr ferrars power to distress by now difference of manner to miss steele difference seemed purposely made to humble more

courtesy for instance without saying word never after have took notice of never looked at in pleasant way know what mean if have be treated in forbidding sort of way must have gave up in despair must not have stood for where doe dislike know be most violent elinor be prevented from making reply to civil triumph by door being thrown open servant announcing mr ferrars edward immediately walking in be very awkward moment countenance of showed that be so looked exceedingly foolish edward seemed to have a great inclination to walk out of room again a to advance farther into very circumstance in unpleasantest form must have be most anxious to avoid have fallen on be not only all three together be together without relief of other person lady recovered first be not lucy business to put forward appearance of secrecy must still be kept up must therefore only look tenderness after slightly addressing said more elinor have more to do so anxious be for sake own to do well that forced after moment recollection to welcome with look manner be almost easy almost open struggle effort still improved must not allow presence of lucy consciousness of injustice towards to deter from saying that be happy to see that have very much regretted being from home when called before in berkeley street must not be frightened from paying attention a friend almost relation be due by observant eye of lucy though soon perceived to be narrowly watching manner gave re assurance to edward have courage enough to sit down embarrassment still exceeded that of lady in proportion case rendered reasonable though sex might make rare for heart have not indifference of lucy must conscience have ease of elinor lucy with demure settled air seemed determined to make contribution to comfort of others must not say word almost thing be said proceeded from elinor who be obliged to volunteer information about mother health coming to town c edward ought to have inquired about never did exertion did not stop here for soon afterwards felt so heroically disposed a to determine under pretence of fetching marianne to leave others by really did that in handsomest manner for loitered away several minute on landing place with most high minded fortitude before went to sister when be once done however be time for rapture of edward to cease for marianne joy hurried into drawing room immediately pleasure in seeing be like other of feeling strong in strongly spoken met with hand must be taken voice expressed affection of sister dear edward cried be moment of great happiness must almost make amends for thing edward tried to return kindness a deserved before such witness dared not say half what really felt again sat down for moment two be silent while marianne be looking with most speaking tenderness sometimes at edward sometimes at elinor regretting only that delight in other must be checked by lucy unwelcome presence edward be first to speak be to notice marianne altered look express fear of not finding london agree with oh think of replied with spirited earnestness though eye be filled with tear a spoke think of health elinor be well see must be enough for remark be not calculated to make edward elinor more easy to conciliate good will of lucy who looked up at marianne with very benignant expression do like london said edward willing to say thing might introduce subject not at all expected much pleasure in have found none sight of edward be only comfort have afforded thank heaven be what always be paused spoke think elinor presently added must employ edward to take care of in return to barton in week two suppose will be going trust edward will not be very unwilling to accept charge poor edward muttered something what be nobody knew not even marianne who saw agitation must easily trace to whatever cause best pleased be perfectly satisfied soon talked of something else spent such day edward in harley street yesterday so dull so wretchedly dull have much to say to on head can not be said now with admirable discretion did defer assurance of finding mutual relative more disagreeable than ever of being particularly disgusted with mother till be more in private why be not there edward why did not come be engaged elsewhere engaged what be when such friend be to be met perhaps miss marianne cried lucy eager to take revenge on think young men never stand upon engagement if have mind to keep little a well a great elinor be very angry marianne seemed entirely insensible of sting for calmly replied not so indeed for seriously speaking be very sure that conscience only kept edward from harley street really believe have most delicate conscience in world most scrupulous in performing engagement however minute however may make against interest pleasure be most fearful of giving pain of wounding expectation most incapable of being selfish of body ever saw edward be so will say be never to hear praised then must be friend of mine for who will accept of love esteem must submit to open commendation nature of commendation in present case however happened to be particularly ill suited to feeling of two third of auditor be so very unexhilarating to edward that very soon got up to go away going so soon said marianne dear edward must not be drawing little aside whispered persuasion that lucy must not stay much longer even encouragement failed for must go lucy who must have outstayed have visit lasted two hour soon afterwards went away what can bring here so often said marianne on leaving must not see that wanted gone how teasing to edward why so be friend lucy have be longest known to of be natural that must like to see a well a ourselves marianne looked at steadily said know elinor that be kind of talking can not bear if only hope to have assertion contradicted a must suppose to be case ought to recollect be last person in world to do can not descend to be tricked out of assurance be not really wanted then left room elinor dared not follow to say more for bound a be by promise of secrecy to lucy must give information must convince marianne painful a consequence of still continuing in error might be be obliged to submit to that must hope be that edward must not often expose to distress of hearing marianne mistaken warmth to repetition of other part of pain have attended recent meeting have reason to expect illustration drawing little aside chapter xxxvi within few day after meeting newspaper announced to world that lady of thomas palmer esq be safely delivered of son heir very interesting satisfactory paragraph at least to intimate connection who knew before event highly important to mr jennings happiness produced temporary alteration in disposal of time influenced in like degree engagement of young friend for a wished to be a much a possible with charlotte went thither morning a soon a be dressed did not return till late in evening miss dashwoods at particular request of middleton spent whole of day in conduit street for own comfort must much rather have remained at least morning in mr jennings house be not thing to be urged against wish of everybody hour be therefore made over to lady middleton two miss steele by whom company in fact be a little valued a be professedly sought have too much sense to be desirable companion to former by latter be considered with jealous eye a intruding on ground sharing kindness wanted to monopolize though nothing must be more polite than lady middleton behaviour to elinor marianne did not really like at because flattered child must not believe good natured because be fond of reading fancied satirical perhaps without exactly knowing what be to be satirical did not signify be censure in common use easily given presence be restraint on on lucy checked idleness of one business of other lady middleton be ashamed of doing nothing before flattery lucy be proud to think of administer at other time feared must despise for offering miss steele be least discomposed of three by presence be in power to reconcile to entirely must either of only have given full minute account of whole affair between marianne mr willoughby must have thought amply rewarded for sacrifice of best place by fire after dinner arrival occasioned conciliation be not granted for though often threw out expression of pity for sister to elinor more than once dropt reflection on inconstancy of beau before marianne effect be produced look of indifference from former of disgust in latter effort even yet lighter might have made friend must only have laughed at about doctor so little be anymore than others inclined to oblige that if sir john dined from home might spend whole day without hearing other raillery on subject than what be kind enough to bestow on jealousy discontent however be so totally unsuspected by mr jennings that thought delightful thing for girl to be together generally congratulated young friend night on having escaped company of stupid old woman so long joined sometimes at sir john sometimes at own house wherever be always came in excellent spirit full of delight importance attributing charlotte well doing to own care ready to give so exact so minute detail of situation a only miss steele have curiosity enough to desire one thing did disturb of made daily complaint mr palmer maintained common unfatherly opinion among sex of infant being alike though must plainly perceive at different time most striking resemblance between baby one of relation on side there be convincing father of persuading to believe that be not exactly like other baby of same age must even be brought to acknowledge simple proposition of being finest child in world come now to relation of misfortune about time befell mr john dashwood so happened that while two sister with mr jennings be first calling on in harley street of acquaintance have dropt in circumstance in not apparently likely to produce evil to while imagination of other people will carry away to form wrong judgment of conduct to decide on by slight appearance one happiness must in measure be always at mercy of chance in present instance last arrived lady allowed fancy to so far outrun truth probability that on merely hearing name of miss dashwoods understanding to be mr dashwood sister immediately concluded to be staying in harley street misconstruction produced within day two afterwards card of invitation for a well a for brother sister to small musical party at house consequence of be that mr john dashwood be obliged to submit not only to exceedingly great inconvenience of sending carriage for miss dashwoods what be still worse must be subject to unpleasantness of appearing to treat with attention who must tell that might not expect to go out with second time power of disappointing be true must always be be not enough for when people be determined on mode of conduct know to be wrong feel injured by expectation of thing better from marianne have now be brought by degree so much into habit of going out day that be become matter of indifference to whether went not prepared quietly mechanically for evening engagement though without expecting smallest amusement from very often without knowing till last moment where be to take to dress appearance be grown so perfectly indifferent a not to bestow consideration on during whole of toilet received from miss steele in first five minute of being together when be finished nothing escaped minute observation general curiosity saw thing asked thing be never easy till knew price of part of marianne dress must have guessed number of gown altogether with better judgment than marianne be not without hope of finding out before parted how much washing cost per week how much have year to spend upon impertinence of kind of scrutiny be generally concluded with compliment though meant a douceur be considered by marianne a greatest impertinence of for after undergoing examination into value make of gown colour of shoe arrangement of hair be almost sure of being told that upon word looked vastly smart dared to say must make great many conquest with such encouragement a be dismissed on present occasion to brother carriage be ready to enter five minute after stopped at door punctuality not very agreeable to sister in law who have preceded to house of acquaintance be there hoping for delay on part might inconvenience coachman event of evening be not very remarkable party like other musical party comprehended great many people who have real taste for performance great many more who have none at performer be a usual in own estimation that of immediate friend first private performer in england a elinor be musical affecting to be so made scruple of turning eye from grand pianoforte whenever suited unrestrained even by presence of harp violoncello must fix at pleasure on other object in room in one of excursive glance perceived among group of young men very who have given lecture on toothpick case at gray perceived soon afterwards looking at speaking familiarly to brother have just determined to find out name from latter when came towards mr dashwood introduced to a mr robert ferrars addressed with easy civility twisted head into bow assured a plainly a word must have done that be exactly coxcomb have heard described to be by lucy happy have be for if regard for edward have depended le on own merit than on merit of nearest relation for then brother bow must have given finishing stroke to what ill humour of mother sister must have begun while wondered at difference of two young men did not find that emptiness of conceit of one put out of charity with modesty worth of other why be different robert exclaimed to in course of quarter of hour conversation for talking of brother lamenting extreme gaucherie really believed kept from mixing in proper society candidly generously attributed much le to natural deficiency than to misfortune of private education while though probably without particular material superiority by nature merely from advantage of public school be a well fitted to mix in world a other man upon soul added believe be nothing more so often tell mother when be grieving about bey dear madam always say to 'you must make easy evil be now irremediable have be entirely own doing why must be persuaded by uncle sir robert against own judgment to place edward under private tuition at most critical time of life if have only sent to westminster a well a instead of sending to mr pratt must have be prevented be way in always consider matter mother be perfectly convinced of error elinor must not oppose opinion because might be general estimation of advantage of public school must not think of edward abode in mr pratt family with satisfaction reside in devonshire think be next observation in cottage near dawlish elinor set right a to situation seemed rather surprising to that anybody must live in devonshire without living near dawlish bestowed hearty approbation however on specie of house for own part said be excessively fond of cottage there be always so much comfort so much elegance about protest if have money to spare must buy little land build one within short distance of london where might drive down at time collect few friend about be happy advise body who be going to build to build cottage friend lord courtland came to other day on purpose to ask advice laid before three different plan of bonomi be to decide on best of bey dear courtland ' said immediately throwing into fire adopt either of by mean build cottage fancy will be end of people imagine that there can be accommodation space in cottage be mistake be last month at friend elliott near dartford lady elliott wished to give dance how can be done said bey dear ferrars do tell how be to be managed there be not room in cottage will hold ten couple where can supper be ' immediately saw that there must be difficulty in so said bey dear lady elliott be uneasy dining parlour will admit eighteen couple with ease card table may be placed in drawing room library may be open for tea other refreshment let supper be set out in saloon lady elliott be delighted with thought measured dining room found must hold exactly eighteen couple affair be arranged precisely after plan so that in fact see if people do know how to set about comfort may be a well enjoyed in cottage a in most spacious dwelling elinor agreed to for did not think deserved compliment of rational opposition a john dashwood have more pleasure in music than eldest sister mind be equally at liberty to fix on thing else thought struck during evening communicated to wife for approbation when got home consideration of mr dennison mistake in supposing sister guest have suggested propriety of being really invited to become such while mr jennings engagement kept from home expense must be nothing inconvenience not more be altogether attention delicacy of conscience pointed out to be requisite to complete enfranchisement from promise to father fanny be startled at proposal see how can be done said without affronting lady middleton for spend day with otherwise must be exceedingly glad to do know be always ready to pay attention in power a taking out evening show be lady middleton visitor how can ask away from husband with great humility did not see force of objection have already spent week in manner in conduit street lady middleton must not be displeased at giving same number of day to such near relation fanny paused moment then with fresh vigor said love must ask with heart if be in power have just settled within to ask miss steele to spend few day with be very well behaved good kind of girl think attention be due to a uncle did so very well by edward can ask sister other year know miss steele may not be in town more be sure will like indeed do like know very much already so doe mother be such favourite with harry mr dashwood be convinced saw necessity of inviting miss steele immediately conscience be pacified by resolution of inviting sister year at same time however slyly suspecting that year must make invitation needle by bringing elinor to town a colonel brandon wife marianne a visitor fanny rejoicing in escape proud of ready wit have procured wrote next morning to lucy to request company sister for day in harley street a soon a lady middleton must spare be enough to make lucy really reasonably happy mr dashwood seemed actually working for herself cherishing hope promoting view such opportunity of being with edward family be above thing most material to interest invitation most gratifying to feeling be advantage must not be too gratefully acknowledged too speedily made use of visit to lady middleton have not before have precise limit be instantly discovered to have be always meant to end in two day time when note be shown to elinor a be within ten minute after arrival gave for first time share in expectation of lucy for mark of uncommon kindness vouchsafed on so short acquaintance seemed to declare that good will towards arose from something more than merely malice against might be brought by time address to do thing lucy wished flattery have already subdued pride of lady middleton made entry into close heart of mr john dashwood be effect laid open probability of greater miss steele removed to harley street reached elinor of influence there strengthened expectation of event sir john who called on more than once brought home such account of favour be in a must be universally striking mr dashwood have never be so much pleased with young woman in life a be with have given of needle book made by emigrant called lucy by christian name did not know whether must ever be able to part with chapter xxxvii mr palmer be so well at end of fortnight that mother felt no longer necessary to give up whole of time to contenting with visiting once twice day returned from period to own home own habit in found miss dashwoods very ready to resume former share about third fourth morning after being thus resettled in berkeley street mr jennings on returning from ordinary visit to mr palmer entered drawing room where elinor be sitting by with air of such hurrying importance a prepared to hear something wonderful giving time only to form idea began directly to justify by saying lord dear miss dashwood have heard news ma'be what be something so strange will hear when got to mr palmer found charlotte quite in fuss about child be sure be very ill cried fretted be over pimple so looked at directly 'lord dear ' say 'it be nothing in world red gum nurse said just same charlotte must not be satisfied so mr donavan be sent for luckily happened to just come in from harley street so stepped over directly a soon a ever saw child said just a did that be nothing in world red gum then charlotte be easy so just a be going away again came into head be sure know how happened to think of came into head to ask if there be news so upon that smirked simpered looked grave seemed to know something other at last said in whisper 'for fear unpleasant report must reach young lady under care a to sister indisposition think advisable to say that believe there be great reason for alarm hope mr dashwood will do very well what be fanny ill illustration in whisper be exactly what said dear 'lord say 'be mr dashwood ill ' so then came out long short of matter by can learn seems to be mr edward ferrars very young man used to joke with about however a turn out be monstrous glad there be never thing in mr edward ferrars seems have be engaged above twelvemonth to cousin lucy there be for dear not creature knowing syllable of matter except nancy must have believed thing possible there be great wonder in liking one that matter must be brought so forward between nobody suspect be strange never happened to see together be sure must have found out directly well so be kept great secret for fear of mr ferrars brother sister suspected word of matter till very morning poor nancy who know be well meaning creature conjurer popt out 'lord think to herself 'they be so fond of lucy to be sure will make difficulty about ' so away went to sister who be sitting alone at carpet work little suspecting what be to come for have just be saying to brother only five minute before thought to make match between edward lord daughter other forget who so may think what blow be to vanity pride fell into violent hysteric immediately with such scream a reached brother ear a be sitting in own dressing room down stair thinking about writing letter to steward in country so up flew directly terrible scene took place for lucy be come to by time little dreaming what be going on poor soul pity must say think be used very hardly for sister scolded like fury soon drove into fainting fit nancy fell upon knee cried bitterly brother walked about room said did not know what to do mr dashwood declared must not stay minute longer in house brother be forced to go down upon knee too to persuade to let stay till have packed up clothes then fell into hysteric again be so frightened that must send for mr donavan mr donavan found house in uproar carriage be at door ready to take poor cousin away be just stepping in a came off poor lucy in such condition say must hardly walk nancy be almost a bad declare have patience with sister hope with heart will be match in spite of lord what taking poor mr edward will be in when hears of to have love used so scornfully for say be monstrous fond of a well may must not wonder if be to be in greatest passion mr donavan think just same have great deal of talk about best of be that be gone back again to harley street that may be within call when mr ferrars be told of for be sent for a soon a ever cousin left house for sister be sure must be in hysteric too so may for what care have pity for of have notion of people making such to do about money greatness there be reason on earth why mr edward lucy must not marry for be sure mr ferrars may afford to do very well by son though lucy have next to nothing know better than body how to make most of thing dare say if mr ferrars must only allow five hundred year must make a good appearance with a body else must with eight lord how snug might live in such cottage a yours little bigger with two maid two men believe must help to housemaid for betty have sister out of place must fit exactly here mr jennings ceased a elinor have have time enough to collect thought be able to give such answer make such observation a subject might naturally be supposed to produce happy to find that be not suspected of extraordinary interest in that mr jennings a have of late often hoped might be case have ceased to imagine at attached to edward happy above rest in absence of marianne felt very well able to speak of affair without embarrassment to give judgment a believed with impartiality on conduct of one concerned in must hardly determine what own expectation of event really be though earnestly tried to drive away notion of being possible to end otherwise at last than in marriage of edward lucy what mr ferrars must say do though there must not be doubt of nature be anxious to hear still more anxious to know how edward must conduct for felt much compassion for lucy very little cost pain to procure little for rest of party none at a mr jennings must talk on other subject elinor soon saw necessity of preparing marianne for discussion time be to be lost in undeceiving in making acquainted with real truth in endeavouring to bring to hear talked of by others without betraying that felt uneasiness for sister resentment against edward elinor office be painful one be going to remove what really believed to be sister chief consolation to give such particular of edward a feared must ruin for ever in good opinion to make marianne by resemblance in situation to fancy must seem strong feel own disappointment over again unwelcome a such task must be be necessary to be done elinor therefore hastened to perform be very far from wishing to dwell on own feeling to represent a suffering much otherwise than a self command have practised since first knowledge of edward engagement might suggest hint of what be practicable to marianne narration be clear simple though must not be given without emotion be not accompanied by violent agitation impetuous grief belonged rather to hearer for marianne listened with horror cried excessively elinor be to be comforter of others in own distress le than in theirs comfort must be given by assurance of own composure of mind very earnest vindication of edward from charge of imprudence be readily offered marianne for time must give credit to edward seemed second willoughby acknowledging a elinor did that have loved most sincerely must feel le than a for lucy steele considered so totally unamiable so absolutely incapable of attaching sensible man that must not be persuaded at first to believe afterwards to pardon former affection of edward for must not even admit to have be natural elinor left to be convinced that be so by only must convince better knowledge of mankind first communication have reached no farther than to state fact of engagement length of time have existed marianne feeling have then broken in put end to regularity of detail for time must be done be to soothe distress lessen alarm combat resentment first question on side led to farther particular be how long have be known to elinor have written to have known four month when lucy first came to barton park last november told in confidence of engagement at word marianne eye expressed astonishment lip must not utter after pause of wonder exclaimed four month have known of four month elinor confirmed what while attending in misery have be on heart have reproached for being happy be not fit that must then know how much be reverse four month cried marianne again so calm so cheerful how have be supported by feeling be doing duty promise to lucy obliged to be secret owed to therefore to avoid giving hint of truth owed to family friend not to create in solicitude about must not be in power to satisfy marianne seemed much struck have very often wished to undeceive mother added elinor once twice have attempted without betraying trust never must have convinced four month yet loved yes did not love only while comfort of others be dear to be glad to spare from knowing how much felt now can think speak of with little emotion must not have suffer on account for assure no longer suffer materially have many thing to support be not conscious of having provoked disappointment by imprudence of own have borne a much a possible without spreading farther acquit edward of essential misconduct wish very happy be so sure of always doing duty that though now may harbour regret in end must become so lucy doe not want sense be foundation on thing good may be built after marianne after be bewitching in idea of single constant attachment can be said of one happiness depending entirely on particular person be not meant be not fit be not possible that must be so edward will marry lucy will marry woman superior in person understanding to half sex time habit will teach to forget that ever thought superior to if such be way of thinking said marianne if loss of what be most valued be so easily to be made up by something else resolution self command be perhaps little le to be wondered at be brought more within comprehension understand suppose have ever felt much for four month marianne have have hanging on mind without being at liberty to speak of to single creature knowing that must make mother most unhappy whenever be explained to yet unable to prepare for in least be told be in manner forced on by very person whose prior engagement ruined prospect told a thought with triumph person suspicion therefore have have to oppose by endeavouring to appear indifferent where have be most deeply interested have not be only once have have hope exultation to listen to again again have known to be divided from edward for ever without hearing one circumstance must make le desire connection nothing have proved unworthy have anything declared indifferent to have have to contend against unkindness of sister insolence of mother have suffered punishment of attachment without enjoying advantage have be going on at time when a know too well have not be only unhappiness if can think capable of ever feeling surely may suppose have suffered now composure of mind with have brought at present to consider matter consolation have be willing to admit have be effect of constant painful exertion did not spring up of did not occur to relieve spirit at first marianne then if have not be bound to silence perhaps nothing must have kept entirely not even what owed to dearest friend from openly showing be very unhappy marianne be quite subdued oh elinor cried have made hate for ever how barbarous have be to who have be only comfort who have borne with in misery who have seemed to be only suffering for be gratitude be only return can make because merit cry out upon myself have be trying to do away tenderest caress followed confession in such frame of mind a be now in elinor have difficulty in obtaining from promise required at request marianne engaged never to speak of affair to one with least appearance of bitterness to meet lucy without betraying smallest increase of dislike to even to see edward if chance must bring together without diminution of usual cordiality be great concession where marianne felt that have injured reparation must be too much for to make performed promise of being discreet to admiration attended to mr jennings have to say upon subject with unchanging complexion dissented from in nothing be heard three time to say yes ma'be listened to praise of lucy with only moving from one chair to when mr jennings talked of edward affection cost only spasm in throat such advance towards heroism in sister made elinor feel equal to thing next morning brought farther trial of in visit from brother who came with most serious aspect to talk over dreadful affair bring news of wife have heard suppose said with great solemnity a soon a be seated of very shocking discovery took place under roof yesterday looked assent seemed too awful moment for speech illustration have heard suppose sister continued have suffered dreadfully mr ferrars too in short have be scene of such complicated distress will hope that storm may be weathered without being of quite overcome poor fanny be in hysteric yesterday must not alarm too much donavan say there be nothing materially to be apprehended constitution be good one resolution equal to thing have borne with fortitude of angel say never will think well of anybody again one can not wonder at after being so deceived meeting with such ingratitude where so much kindness have be shown so much confidence have be placed be quite out of benevolence of heart that have asked young woman to house merely because thought deserved attention be harmless well behaved girl must be pleasant companion for otherwise wished very much to have invited marianne to be with while kind friend there be attending daughter now to be so rewarded ' wish with heart ' say poor fanny in affectionate way 'that have asked sister instead of ' here stopped to be thanked being done went on what poor mr ferrars suffered when first fanny broke to be not to be described while with truest affection have be planning most eligible connection for be to be supposed that must be time secretly engaged to person suspicion must never have entered head if suspected prepossession elsewhere must not be in quarter 'there to be sure said ' might have thought safe ' be quite in agony consulted together however a to what must be done at last determined to send for edward came be sorry to relate what ensued that mr ferrars must say to make put end to engagement assisted too a may well suppose by argument fanny entreaty be of avail duty affection thing be disregarded never thought edward so stubborn so unfeeling before mother explained to liberal design in case of marrying miss morton told must settle on norfolk estate clear of land tax brings in good thousand year offered even when matter grew desperate to make twelve hundred in opposition to if still persisted in low connection represented to certain penury must attend match own two thousand pound protested must be must never see again so far must be from affording smallest assistance that if be to enter into profession with view of better support must do in power to prevent advancing in here marianne in ecstasy of indignation clapped hand together cried gracious god can be possible well may wonder marianne replied brother at obstinacy must resist such argument a exclamation be very natural marianne be going to retort remembered promise forbore however continued be urged in vain edward said very little what did say be in most determined manner nothing must prevail on to give up engagement must stand to cost what might then cried mr jennings with blunt sincerity no longer able to be silent have acted like honest man beg pardon mr dashwood if have done otherwise must have thought rascal have little concern in business a well a for lucy steele be cousin believe there be not better kind of girl in world one who more deserves good husband john dashwood be greatly astonished nature be calm not open to provocation never wished to offend anybody especially anybody of good fortune therefore replied without resentment must by mean speak disrespectfully of relation of yours madam miss lucy steele be dare say very deserving young woman in present case know connection must be impossible to have entered into secret engagement with young man under uncle care son of woman especially of such very large fortune a mr ferrars be perhaps altogether little extraordinary in short mean to reflect upon behaviour of person whom have regard for mr jennings wish extremely happy mr ferrars conduct throughout whole have be such a conscientious good mother in like circumstance must adopt have be dignified liberal edward have drawn own lot fear will be bad one marianne sighed out similar apprehension elinor heart wrung for feeling of edward while braving mother threat for woman who must not reward well sir said mr jennings how did end be sorry to say ma'be in most unhappy rupture edward be dismissed for ever from mother notice left house yesterday where be gone whether be still in town know for of course can make inquiry poor young man what be to become of what indeed ma'be be melancholy consideration born to prospect of such affluence can not conceive situation more deplorable interest of two thousand pound how can man live on when to be added recollection that might for own folly within three month have be in receipt of two thousand five hundred year for miss morton have thirty thousand pound can not picture to myself more wretched condition must feel for more so because be totally out of power to assist poor young man cried mr jennings be sure must be very welcome to bed board at house so must tell if must see be not fit that must be living about at own charge now at

sister that really believed there be material danger in fanny indisposition that need not therefore be very uneasy about went away leaving three lady unanimous in sentiment on present occasion a far at least a regarded mr ferrars conduct dashwoods edward marianne indignation burst forth a soon a quitted room a vehemence made reserve impossible in elinor unnecessary in mr jennings joined in very spirited critique upon party chapter xxxviii mr jennings be very warm in praise of edward conduct only elinor marianne understood true merit only knew how little have have to tempt to be disobedient how small be consolation beyond consciousness of doing right must remain to in loss of friend fortune elinor gloried in integrity marianne forgave offence in compassion for punishment though confidence between be by public discovery restored to proper state be not subject on of be fond of dwelling when alone elinor avoided upon principle a tending to fix still more upon thought by too warm too positive assurance of marianne that belief of edward continued affection for herself rather wished to do away be courage soon failed in trying to converse upon topic always left more dissatisfied with than ever by comparison necessarily produced between elinor conduct own felt force of comparison not a sister have hoped to urge to exertion now felt with pain of continual self reproach regretted most bitterly that have never exerted before brought only torture of penitence without hope of amendment mind be so much weakened that still fancied present exertion impossible

body thank dear for showing be a pretty letter a ever saw doe lucy head heart great credit chapter xxxix miss dashwoods have now be rather more than two month in town marianne impatience to be gone increased day sighed for air liberty quiet of country fancied that if place must give ease barton must do elinor be hardly le anxious than for removal only so much le bent on being effected immediately a be conscious of difficulty of so long journey marianne must not be brought to acknowledge began however seriously to turn thought towards accomplishment have already mentioned wish to kind hostess who resisted with eloquence of good will when plan be suggested though detaining from home yet few week longer appeared to elinor altogether much more eligible than other palmer be to remove to cleveland about end of march for easter holiday mr jennings with friend received very warm invitation from charlotte to go with must not in have be sufficient for delicacy of miss dashwood be enforced with so much real politeness by mr palmer a joined to very great amendment of manner towards since sister have be known to be unhappy induced to accept with pleasure when told marianne what have done however first reply be not very auspicious cleveland cried with great agitation can not go to cleveland forget said elinor gently that situation be not that be not in neighbourhood of be in somersetshire can not go into somersetshire there where looked forward to going elinor can not expect to go there elinor must not argue upon propriety of overcoming such feeling only endeavoured to counteract by working on others represented therefore a measure must fix time of returning to dear mother whom so much wished to see in more eligible more comfortable manner than other plan must do perhaps without greater delay from cleveland be within few mile of bristol distance to barton be not beyond one day though long day journey mother servant might easily come there to attend down a there must be occasion of staying above week at cleveland might now be at home in little more than three week time a marianne affection for mother be sincere must triumph with little difficulty over imaginary evil have started mr jennings be so far from being weary of guest that pressed very earnestly to return with again from cleveland elinor be grateful for attention must not alter design mother concurrence being readily gained thing relative to return be arranged a far a must be marianne found relief in drawing up statement of hour be yet to divide from barton ah colonel know what will do without miss dashwoods be mr jennings address to when first called on after leaving be settled for be quite resolved upon going home from palmer how forlorn will be when come back lord will sit gape at one a dull a two cat perhaps mr jennings be in hope by vigorous sketch of future ennui to provoke to make offer might give escape from if so have soon afterwards good reason to think object gained for on elinor moving to window to take more expeditiously dimension of print be going to copy for friend followed to with look of particular meaning conversed with there for several minute effect of discourse on lady too must not escape observation for though be too honorable to listen have even changed seat on purpose that might not hear to one close by piano forte on marianne be playing must not keep from seeing that elinor changed colour attended with agitation be too intent on what said to pursue employment still farther in confirmation of hope in interval of marianne turning from one lesson to word of colonel inevitably reached ear in seemed to be apologising for badness of house set matter beyond doubt wondered indeed at thinking necessary to do so supposed to be proper etiquette what elinor said in reply must not distinguish judged from motion of lip that did not think that material objection mr jennings commended in heart for being so honest then talked on for few minute longer without catching syllable when lucky stop in marianne performance brought word in colonel calm voice be afraid can not take place very soon astonished shocked at so unlover like speech be almost ready to cry out lord what must hinder checking desire confined to silent ejaculation be very strange sure need not wait to be older delay on colonel side however did not seem to offend mortify fair companion in least for on breaking up conference soon afterwards moving different way mr jennings very plainly heard elinor say with voice showed to feel what said will always think very much obliged to mr jennings be delighted with gratitude only wondered that after hearing sentence colonel must be able to take leave of a immediately did with utmost sang froid go away without making reply have not thought old friend must have made so indifferent suitor have really passed between be to effect have heard said with great compassion of injustice friend mr ferrars have suffered from family for if understand matter right have be entirely cast off by for persevering in engagement with very deserving young woman have be rightly informed be so elinor told that be cruelty impolitic cruelty replied with great feeling of dividing attempting to divide two young people long attached to other be terrible mr ferrars doe not know what may be doing what may drive son to have seen mr ferrars two three time in harley street be much pleased with be not young man with whom one can be intimately acquainted in short time have seen enough of to wish well for own sake a friend of yours wish still more understand that intends to take order will be so good a to tell that living of delaford now just vacant a be informed by day post be if think worth acceptance that perhaps so unfortunately circumstanced a be now may be nonsense to appear to doubt only wish be more valuable be rectory small one late incumbent believe did not make more than l per annum though be certainly capable of improvement fear not to amount a to afford very comfortable income such a be however pleasure in presenting to will be very great pray assure of elinor astonishment at commission must hardly have be greater have colonel be really making offer of hand preferment only two day before have considered a hopeless for edward be already provided to enable to marry of people in world be fixed on to bestow emotion be such a mr jennings have attributed to very different cause minor feeling le pure le pleasing might have share in emotion esteem for general benevolence gratitude for particular friendship together prompted colonel brandon to act be strongly felt warmly expressed thanked for with heart spoke of edward principle disposition with praise knew to deserve promised to undertake commission with pleasure if be really wish to put off so agreeable office to at same time must not help thinking that one must so well perform a be office in short from unwilling to give edward pain of receiving obligation from must have be very glad to be spared colonel brandon on motif of equal delicacy declining likewise still seemed so desirous of being given through mean that must not on account make farther opposition edward believed be still in town fortunately have heard address from miss steele must undertake therefore to inform of in course of day after have be settled colonel brandon began to talk of own advantage in securing so respectable agreeable neighbour then be that mentioned with regret that house be small indifferent evil elinor a mr jennings have supposed to do made very light of at least a far a regarded size smallness of house said can not imagine inconvenience to for will be in proportion to family income by colonel be surprised to find that be considering mr ferrars marriage a certain consequence of presentation for did not suppose possible that delaford living must supply such income a anybody in style of life must venture to settle on said so little rectory can do more than make mr ferrars comfortable a bachelor can not enable to marry be sorry to say that patronage end with interest be hardly more extensive if however by unforeseen chance must be in power to serve farther must think very differently of from what now do if be not a ready to be useful to then a sincerely wish must be at present what be now doing indeed seems nothing at since can advance so little towards what must be principal only object of happiness marriage must still be distant good at least be afraid can not take place very soon such be sentence when misunderstood so justly offended delicate feeling of mr jennings after narration of what really passed between colonel brandon elinor while stood at window gratitude expressed by latter on parting may perhaps appear in general not le reasonably excited le properly worded than if have arisen from offer of marriage chapter xl well miss dashwood said mr jennings sagaciously smiling a soon a gentleman have withdrawn ask what colonel have be saying to for though upon honour tried to keep out of hearing must not help catching enough to understand business assure never be better pleased in life wish joy of with heart thank ma'be said elinor be matter of great joy to feel goodness of colonel brandon most sensibly there be not many men who must act a have done few people who have so compassionate heart never be more astonished in life lord dear be very modest least astonished at in world for have often thought of late there be nothing more likely to happen judged from knowledge of colonel general benevolence at least must not foresee that opportunity must so very soon occur opportunity repeated mr jennings oh a to when man have once made up mind to thing somehow other will soon find opportunity well dear wish joy of again again if ever there be happy couple in world think will soon know where to look for mean to go to delaford after suppose said elinor with faint smile aye dear do indeed a to house being bad one know what colonel must be at for be a good one a ever saw spoke of being out of repair well whose fault be that why repair who must do be interrupted by servant coming in to announce carriage being at door mr jennings immediately preparing to go said well dear must be gone before have have half talk out however may have over in evening for will be quite alone ask to go with for dare say mind be too full of matter to care for company besides must long to tell sister about marianne have left room before conversation began certainly ma'be will tell marianne of will not mention at present to body else oh very well said mr jennings rather disappointed then must not have tell to lucy for think of going a far a holborn to day ma'be not even lucy if please one day delay will not be very material till have written to mr ferrars think ought not to be mentioned to body else will do directly be of importance that time must be lost with for will of course have much to do relative to ordination speech at first puzzled mr jennings exceedingly why mr ferrars be to have be written to about in hurry must not immediately comprehend few moment reflection however produced very happy idea exclaimed oh ho understand mr ferrars be to be man well so much better for ay to be sure must be ordained in readiness be very glad to find thing be so forward between dear be not rather out of character must not colonel write sure be proper person elinor did not quite understand beginning of mr jennings speech did think worth inquiring into therefore only replied to conclusion colonel brandon be so delicate man that rather wished one to announce intention to mr ferrars than so be forced to do well be odd kind of delicacy however will not disturb seeing preparing to write know own concern best so good bye dear have not heard of thing to please so well since charlotte be brought to bed away went returning again in moment have just be thinking of betty sister dear must be very glad to get so good mistress whether must do for lady maid be sure ca tell be excellent housemaid work very well at needle however will think of at leisure certainly ma'be replied elinor not hearing much of what said more anxious to be alone than to be mistress of subject how must begin how must express in note to edward be now concern particular circumstance between made difficulty of to other person must have be easiest thing in world equally feared to say too much too little sat deliberating over paper with pen in hand till broken in on by entrance of edward have met mr jennings at door in way to carriage a came to leave farewell card after apologising for not returning have obliged to enter by saying that miss dashwood be above wanted to speak with on very particular business elinor have just be congratulating in midst of perplexity that however difficult might be to express properly by letter be at least preferable to giving information by word of mouth when visitor entered to force upon greatest exertion of astonishment confusion be very great on so sudden appearance have not seen before since engagement became public therefore not since knowing to be acquainted with with consciousness of what have be thinking of what have to tell made feel particularly uncomfortable for minute too be much distressed sat down together in most promising state of embarrassment whether have asked pardon for intrusion on first coming into room must not recollect determining to be on safe side made apology in form a soon a must say thing after taking chair mr jennings told said that wished to speak with at least understood so certainly must not have intruded on in manner though at same time must have be extremely sorry to leave london without seeing sister especially a will most likely be time be not probable must soon have pleasure of meeting again go to oxford tomorrow must not have gone however said elinor recovering determined to get over what so much dreaded a soon a possible without receiving good wish even if have not be able to give in person mr jennings be quite right in what said have something of consequence to inform of be on point of communicating by paper be charged with most agreeable office breathing rather faster than usual a spoke colonel brandon who be here only ten minute ago have desired to say that understanding mean to take order have great pleasure in offering living of delaford now just vacant only wish be more valuable allow to congratulate on having so respectable well judging friend to join in wish that living be about two hundred year be much more considerable such a might better enable to a might be more than temporary accommodation to yourself such in short a might establish view of happiness what edward felt a must not say can not be expected that one else must say for looked astonishment such unexpected such unthought of information must not fail of exciting said only two word colonel brandon yes continued elinor gathering more resolution a of worst be over colonel brandon mean a testimony of concern for what have lately passed for cruel situation in unjustifiable conduct of family have placed concern be sure marianne friend must share likewise a proof of high esteem for general character particular approbation of behaviour on present occasion colonel brandon give living can be possible unkindness of own relation have made astonished to find friendship where replied be with sudden consciousness not to find in for can not be ignorant that to to goodness owe feel must express if must a well know be orator be very much mistaken do assure that owe entirely at least almost entirely to own merit colonel brandon discernment of have have hand in did not even know till understood design that living be vacant have ever occurred to that might have have living in gift a friend of mine of family may perhaps indeed know have still greater pleasure in bestowing upon word owe nothing to solicitation truth obliged to acknowledge small share in action be at same time so unwilling to appear a benefactress of edward that acknowledged with hesitation probably contributed to fix suspicion in mind have recently entered for short time sat deep in thought after elinor have ceased to speak at last a if be rather effort said colonel brandon seems man of great worth respectability have always heard spoken of a such brother know esteem highly be undoubtedly sensible man in manner perfectly gentleman indeed replied elinor believe that will find on farther acquaintance that have heard to be a will be such very near neighbour for understand parsonage be almost close to mansion house be particularly important that must be edward made answer when have turned away head gave look so serious so earnest so uncheerful a seemed to say that might hereafter wish distance between parsonage mansion house much greater colonel brandon think lodge in st james street said soon afterwards rising from chair elinor told number of house must hurry away then to give thanks will not allow to give to assure that have made very exceedingly happy man elinor did not offer to detain parted with very earnest assurance on side of unceasing good wish for happiness in change of situation might befall on with rather attempt to return same good will than power of expressing when see again said elinor to herself a door shut out will see husband of lucy with pleasing anticipation sat down to reconsider past recall word endeavour to comprehend feeling of edward of course to reflect on own with discontent when mr jennings came home though returned from seeing people whom have never seen before of whom therefore must have great deal to say mind be so much more occupied by important secret in possession than by anything else that reverted to again a soon a elinor appeared well dear cried sent up young man did not do right suppose have great difficulty did not find very unwilling to accept proposal ma'be be not very likely well how soon will be ready for seems to depend upon really said elinor know so little of kind of form can hardly even conjecture a to time preparation necessary suppose two three month will complete ordination two three month cried mr jennings lord dear how calmly talk of can colonel wait two three month lord bless be sure must put quite out of patience though one must be very glad to do kindness by poor mr ferrars do think be not worth while to wait two three month for sure somebody else might be found must do a well somebody be in order already dear ma'be said elinor what can be thinking of why colonel brandon only object be to be of use to mr ferrars lord bless dear sure mean to persuade that colonel only marries for sake of giving ten guinea to mr ferrars illustration gained considerable amusement deception must not continue after explanation immediately took place by gained considerable amusement for moment without material loss of happiness to for mr jennings only exchanged one form of delight for still without forfeiting expectation of first aye aye parsonage be small one said after first ebullition of surprise satisfaction be over very likely may be out of repair to hear man apologising a thought for house that to knowledge have five sitting room on ground floor think housekeeper told must make up fifteen bed to too have be used to live in barton cottage seems quite ridiculous dear must touch up colonel to do thing to parsonage make comfortable for before lucy go to colonel brandon doe not seem to have idea of living being enough to allow to marry colonel be ninny dear because have two thousand year think that nobody else can marry on le take word for that if be alive will be paying visit at delaford parsonage before michaelmas be sure sha go if lucy there elinor be quite of opinion a to probability of not waiting for thing more chapter xli edward having carried thanks to colonel brandon proceeded with happiness to lucy such be excess of by time reached bartlett building that be able to assure mr jennings who called on again next day with congratulation that have never seen in such spirit before in life own happiness own spirit be at least very certain joined mr jennings most heartily in expectation of being comfortably together in delaford parsonage before michaelmas so far be at same time from backwardness to give elinor that credit edward must give that spoke of friendship for with most grateful warmth be ready to own obligation to openly declared that exertion for good on miss dashwood part present future must ever surprise for believed capable of doing thing in world for really valued a for colonel brandon be not only ready to worship a saint be moreover truly anxious that must be treated a one in worldly concern anxious that tithe must be raised to utmost scarcely resolved to avail at delaford a far a possibly must of servant carriage cow poultry be now above week since john dashwood have called in berkeley street a since time notice have be taken by of wife indisposition beyond one verbal enquiry elinor began to feel necessary to pay visit be obligation however not only opposed own inclination have not assistance of encouragement from companion marianne not contented with absolutely refusing to go be very urgent to prevent sister going at mr jennings though carriage be always at elinor service so very much disliked mr john dashwood that not even curiosity to see how looked after late discovery strong desire to affront by taking edward part must overcome unwillingness to be in company again consequence be that elinor set out by to pay visit for one must really have le inclination to run risk of tete tete with woman whom of others have so much reason to dislike mr dashwood be denied before carriage must turn from house husband accidentally came out expressed great pleasure in meeting elinor told that have be just going to call in berkeley street assuring that fanny must be very glad to see invited to come in walked up stair in to drawing room nobody be there fanny be in own room suppose said will go to presently for be sure will not have least objection in world to seeing very far from indeed now especially there can not be however marianne be always great favourite why must not marianne come elinor made what excuse must for be not sorry to see alone replied for have good deal to say to living of colonel brandon can be true have really given to edward heard yesterday by chance be coming to on purpose to enquire farther about be perfectly true colonel brandon have given living of delaford to edward really well be very astonishing relationship connection between now that living fetch price be value of about two hundred year very well for next presentation to living of value supposing late incumbent to have be old sickly likely to vacate soon might have got dare say fourteen hundred pound how came not to have settled matter before person death now indeed must be too late to sell man of colonel brandon sense wonder must be so improvident in point of such common such natural concern well be convinced that there be vast deal of inconsistency in almost human character suppose however on recollection that case may probably be edward be only to hold living till person to whom colonel have really sold presentation be old enough to take aye aye be fact depend upon elinor contradicted however very positively by relating that have be employed in conveying offer from colonel brandon to edward therefore must understand term on be given obliged to submit to authority be truly astonishing cried after hearing what said what must be colonel motive very simple one to be of use to mr ferrars well well colonel brandon may be edward be very lucky man will not mention matter to fanny however for though have broke to bear vastly well will not like to hear much talked of elinor have difficulty here to refrain from observing that thought fanny might have borne with composure acquisition of wealth to brother by child must be possibly impoverished mr ferrars added lowering voice to tone becoming so important subject know nothing about at present believe will be best to keep entirely concealed from a long a may be when marriage take place fear must hear of why must such precaution be used though be not to be supposed that mr ferrars can have smallest satisfaction in knowing that son have money enough to live upon for must be quite out of question yet why upon late behaviour be supposed to feel at have done with son cast off for ever have made over whom have influence cast off likewise surely after doing so can not be imagined liable to impression of sorrow of joy on account can not be interested in thing befalls must not be so weak a to throw away comfort of child yet retain anxiety of parent ah elinor said john reasoning be very good be founded on ignorance of human nature when edward unhappy match take place depend upon mother will feel a much a if have never discarded therefore circumstance may accelerate dreadful event must be concealed from a much a possible mr ferrars can never forget edward be son surprise must think must nearly have escaped memory by time wrong exceedingly mr ferrars be one of most affectionate mother in world elinor be silent think now said mr dashwood after short pause of robert marrying miss morton elinor smiling at grave decisive importance of brother tone calmly replied lady suppose have choice in affair choice how do mean only mean that suppose from manner of speaking must be same to miss morton whether marry edward robert certainly there can be difference for robert will now to intent purpose be considered a eldest son a to thing else be very agreeable young men know that one be superior to other elinor said more john be also for short time silent reflection ended thus of one thing dear sister kindly taking hand speaking in awful whisper may assure will do because know must gratify have good reason to think indeed have from best authority must not repeat for otherwise must be very wrong to say thing about have from very best authority not that ever precisely heard mr ferrars say daughter did have from that in short whatever objection there might be against certain certain connection understand must have be far preferable to must not have given vexation that doe be exceedingly pleased to hear that mr ferrars considered in light very gratifying circumstance know to 'it must have be beyond comparison ' said 'the least evil of two must be glad to compound now for nothing worse ' however be quite out of question not to be thought of mentioned a to attachment know never must be be gone by thought must just tell of because knew how much must please not that have reason to regret dear elinor there be doubt of doing exceedingly well quite a well better perhaps thing considered have colonel brandon be with lately elinor have heard enough if not to gratify vanity raise self importance to agitate nerve fill mind be therefore glad to be spared from

to prove so by engaging in accustomary employment day spent in sitting shivering over fire with book in hand be unable to read in lying weary languid on sofa did not speak much in favour of amendment when at last went early to bed more more indisposed colonel brandon be only astonished at sister composure who though attending nursing whole day against marianne inclination forcing proper medicine on at night trusted like marianne to certainty efficacy of sleep felt real alarm very restless feverish night however disappointed expectation of when marianne after persisting in rising confessed unable to sit up returned voluntarily to bed elinor be very ready to adopt mr jennings advice of sending for palmer apothecary came examined patient though encouraging miss dashwood to expect that very few day must restore sister to health yet by pronouncing disorder to have putrid tendency allowing word infection to pas lip gave instant alarm to mr palmer on baby account mr jennings who have be inclined from first to think marianne complaint more serious than elinor now looked very grave on mr harris report confirming charlotte fear caution urged necessity of immediate removal with infant mr palmer though treating apprehension a idle found anxiety importunity of wife too great to be withstood departure therefore be fixed on within hour after mr harris arrival set off with little boy

worse party be now farther reduced for mr palmer though very unwilling to go a well from real humanity good nature a from dislike of appearing to be frightened away by wife be persuaded at last by colonel brandon to perform promise of following while be preparing to go colonel brandon with much greater exertion began to talk of going likewise here however kindness of mr jennings interposed most acceptably for to send colonel away while love be in so much uneasiness on sister account must be to deprive thought of comfort therefore telling at once that stay at cleveland be necessary to herself that must want to play at piquet of evening while miss dashwood be above with sister c urged so strongly to remain that who be gratifying first wish of own heart by compliance must not long even affect to demur especially a mr jennings entreaty be warmly seconded by mr palmer who seemed to feel relief to in leaving behind person so well able to assist advise miss dashwood in emergence marianne be of course kept in ignorance of arrangement knew not that have be mean of sending owner of cleveland away in about seven day from time of arrival gave surprise that saw nothing of mr palmer a gave likewise concern never mentioned name two day passed away from time of mr palmer departure situation continued with little variation same mr harris who attended day still talked boldly of speedy recovery miss dashwood be equally sanguine expectation of others be by mean so cheerful mr jennings have determined very early in seizure marianne must never get over colonel brandon who be chiefly of use in listening to mr jennings foreboding be not in state of mind to resist influence tried to reason out of fear different judgment of apothecary seemed to render absurd many hour of day in be left entirely alone be too favourable for admission of melancholy idea must not expel from mind persuasion that must see marianne more on morning of third day however gloomy anticipation of be almost done away for when mr harris arrived declared patient materially better pulse be much stronger symptom more favourable than on preceding visit elinor confirmed in pleasant hope be cheerfulness rejoicing that in letter to mother have pursued own judgment rather than friend in making very light of indisposition delayed at cleveland almost fixing on time when marianne must be able to travel day did not close so auspiciously a began towards evening marianne became ill again growing more heavy restless uncomfortable than before sister however still sanguine be willing to attribute change to nothing more than fatigue of having sat up to have bed made carefully administering cordial prescribed saw with satisfaction sink at last into slumber from expected most beneficial effect sleep though not so quiet a elinor wished to see lasted considerable time anxious to observe result of resolved to sit with during whole of mr jennings knowing nothing of change in patient went unusually early to bed maid who be one of principal nurse be recreating in housekeeper room elinor remained alone with repose of latter became more more disturbed sister who watched with unremitting attention continual change of posture heard frequent inarticulate sound of complaint passed lip be almost wishing to rouse from so painful slumber when marianne suddenly awakened by accidental noise in house started hastily up with feverish wildness cried out be mama coming not yet cried other concealing terror assisting marianne to lie down again will be here hope before be long be great way know from hence to barton must not go round by london cried marianne in same hurried manner will never see if go by london elinor perceived with alarm that be not quite while attempting to soothe eagerly felt pulse be lower quicker than ever marianne still talking wildly of mama alarm increased so rapidly a to determine on sending instantly for mr harris despatching messenger to barton for mother to consult with colonel brandon on best mean of effecting latter be thought immediately followed resolution of performance a soon have rung up maid to take place by sister hastened down to drawing room where knew be generally to be found at much later hour than present be time for hesitation fear difficulty be immediately before fear have courage confidence to attempt removal of listened to in silent despondence difficulty be instantly obviated for with readiness seemed to speak occasion service pre arranged in mind offered a messenger who must fetch mr dashwood elinor made resistance be not easily overcome thanked with brief though fervent gratitude while went to hurry off servant with message to mr harris order for post horse directly wrote few line to mother comfort of such friend at moment a colonel brandon companion for mother how gratefully be felt companion whose judgment must guide whose attendance must relieve whose friendship might soothe a far a shock of such summons must be lessened to presence manner assistance must lessen meanwhile whatever might feel acted with firmness of collected mind made necessary arrangement with utmost despatch calculated with exactness time in might look for return not moment be lost in delay of kind horse arrived even before be expected colonel brandon only pressing hand with look of solemnity few word spoken too low to reach ear hurried into carriage be then about twelve o'clock returned to sister apartment to wait for arrival of apothecary to watch by rest of night be night of almost equal suffering to hour after hour passed away in sleepless pain delirium on marianne side in most cruel anxiety on elinor before mr harris appeared apprehension once raised paid by excess for former security servant who sat up with for must not allow mr jennings to be called only tortured more by hint of what mistress have always thought marianne idea be still at interval fixed incoherently on mother whenever mentioned name gave pang to heart of poor elinor who reproaching for having trifled with so many day of illness wretched for immediate relief fancied that relief might soon be in vain that thing have be delayed too long pictured to herself suffering mother arriving too late to see darling child to see rational be on point of sending again for mr harris if must not come for other advice when former not till after five o'clock arrived opinion however made little amends for delay for though acknowledging very unexpected unpleasant alteration in patient must not allow danger to be material talked of relief fresh mode of treatment must procure with confidence in lesser degree be communicated to elinor promised to call again in course of three four hour left patient anxious attendant more composed than have found with strong concern with many reproach for not being called to aid did mr jennings hear in morning of what have passed former apprehension now with greater reason restored left doubt of event though trying to speak comfort to elinor conviction of sister danger must not allow to offer comfort of hope heart be really grieved rapid decay early death of girl so young so lovely a marianne must have struck le interested person with concern on mr jennings compassion have other claim have be for three month companion be still under care be known to have be greatly injured long unhappy distress of sister too particularly favourite be before a for mother when mr jennings considered that marianne might probably be to what charlotte be to herself sympathy in suffering be very sincere mr harris be punctual in second visit came to be disappointed in hope of what last must produce medicine have failed fever be unabated marianne only more quiet not more remained in heavy stupor elinor catching more than fear in moment proposed to call in further advice judged unnecessary have still something more to try more fresh application of whose success be a confident a last visit concluded with encouraging assurance reached ear must not enter heart of miss dashwood be calm except when thought of mother be almost hopeless in state continued till noon scarcely stirring from sister bed thought wandering from one image of grief one suffering friend to spirit oppressed to utmost by conversation of mr jennings who scrupled not to attribute severity danger of attack to many week of previous indisposition marianne disappointment have brought on elinor felt reasonableness of idea gave fresh misery to reflection about noon however began with caution dread of disappointment for time kept silent even to friend to fancy to hope must perceive slight amendment in sister pulse waited watched examined again again at last with agitation more difficult to bury under exterior calmness than foregoing distress ventured to communicate hope mr jennings though forced on examination to acknowledge temporary revival tried to keep young friend from indulging thought of continuance elinor conning over injunction of distrust told likewise not to hope be too late hope have already entered feeling anxious flutter bent over sister to watch hardly knew for what hour passed away favourable symptom yet blessed others even arose to confirm breath skin lip flattered elinor with sign of amendment marianne fixed eye on with rational though languid gaze anxiety hope now oppressed in equal degree left moment of tranquillity till arrival of mr harris at four o'clock when assurance felicitation on recovery in sister even surpassing expectation gave confidence comfort tear of joy marianne be in respect materially better declared entirely out of danger mr jennings perhaps satisfied with partial justification of foreboding have be found in late alarm allowed to trust in judgment admitted with unfeigned joy soon with unequivocal cheerfulness probability of entire recovery elinor must not be cheerful joy be of different kind led to thing rather than to gaiety marianne restored to life health friend to doting mother be idea to fill heart with sensation of exquisite comfort expand in fervent gratitude lead to outward demonstration of joy word smile within elinor breast be satisfaction silent strong continued by side of sister with little intermission whole afternoon calming fear satisfying inquiry of enfeebled spirit supplying succour watching almost look breath possibility of relapse must of course in moment occur to remind of what anxiety be when saw on frequent minute examination symptom of recovery continued saw marianne at six o'clock sink into quiet steady to appearance comfortable sleep silenced doubt time be now drawing on when colonel brandon might be expected back at ten o'clock trusted at least not much later mother must be relieved from dreadful suspense in must now be travelling towards colonel too perhaps scarcely le object of pity oh how slow be progress of time yet kept in ignorance at seven o'clock leaving marianne still sweetly asleep joined mr jennings in drawing room to tea of breakfast have be kept by fear of dinner by sudden reverse from eating much present refreshment therefore with such feeling of content a brought to be particularly welcome mr jennings must have persuaded at conclusion to take rest before mother arrival allow to take place by marianne elinor have sense of fatigue capability of sleep at moment about be not to be kept away from sister unnecessary instant mr jennings therefore attending up stair into sick chamber to satisfy that continued right left there again to charge thought retired to own room to write letter sleep night be cold stormy wind roared round house rain beat against window elinor happiness within regarded not marianne slept through blast traveller have rich reward in store for present inconvenience clock struck eight have be ten elinor must have be convinced that at moment heard carriage driving up to house so strong be persuasion that did in spite of almost impossibility of being already come that moved into adjoining dressing closet opened window shutter to be satisfied of truth instantly saw that ear have not deceived flaring lamp of carriage be immediately in view by uncertain light thought must discern to be drawn by four horse while told excess of poor mother alarm gave explanation to such unexpected rapidity never in life have elinor found so difficult to be calm a at moment knowledge of what mother must be feeling a carriage stopped door of doubt dread perhaps despair of what have to tell with such knowledge be impossible to be calm remained to be done be to be speedy therefore staying only till must leave mr jennings maid with sister hurried down stair bustle in vestibule a passed along inner lobby assured that be already in house rushed to drawing room entered saw only willoughby illustration opened window shutter chapter xliv elinor starting back with look of horror at sight of obeyed first impulse of heart in turning instantly to quit room hand be already on lock when action be suspended by hastily advancing saying in voice rather of command than supplication miss dashwood for hour for ten minute entreat to stay sir replied with firmness will not stay business can not be with servant suppose forgot to tell that mr palmer be not in house have told cried with vehemence mr palmer relation be at devil must not have turned from door business be with only with in utmost amazement well sir be quick if can le violent sit down will be hesitated knew not what to do possibility of colonel brandon arriving finding there came across have promised to hear curiosity no le than honor be engaged after moment recollection therefore concluding that prudence required dispatch that acquiescence must best promote walked silently towards table sat down took opposite chair for minute not word be said by pray be quick sir said elinor impatiently have time to spare be sitting in attitude of deep meditation seemed not to hear sister said with abruptness moment afterwards be out of danger heard from servant god be praised be true be really true elinor must not speak repeated inquiry with yet greater eagerness for god sake tell be out of danger be not illustration entreat to stay hope be rose up walked across room have known a much hour ago since be here speaking with forced vivacity a returned to seat what doe signify for once miss dashwood will be last time perhaps let be cheerful together be in fine mood for gaiety tell honestly deeper glow overspreading cheek do think most knave fool elinor looked at with greater astonishment than ever began to think that must be in strangeness of such visit of such manner seemed otherwise intelligible with impression immediately rose saying mr willoughby advise at present to return to combe be not at leisure to remain with longer whatever business may be with will be better recollected explained to morrow understand replied with expressive smile voice perfectly calm yes be very drunk pint of porter with cold beef at marlborough be enough to over set at marlborough cried more more at loss to understand what must be at yes left london morning at eight o'clock only ten minute have spent out of chaise since time procured nuncheon at marlborough steadiness of manner intelligence of eye a spoke convincing elinor that other unpardonable folly might bring to cleveland be not brought there by intoxication said after moment recollection mr willoughby ought to feel certainly do after what have passed coming here in manner forcing upon notice requires very particular excuse what be that mean by mean said with serious energy if can to make hate one degree le than do now mean to offer kind of explanation kind of apology for past to open whole heart to by convincing that though have be always blockhead have not be always rascal to obtain something like forgiveness from ma from sister be real reason of coming upon soul be be answer with warmth brought former willoughby to remembrance in spite of herself made think sincere if be may be satisfied already for marianne doe have long forgiven have cried in same eager tone then have forgiven before ought to have done will forgive again on more reasonable ground now will listen to elinor bowed assent know said after pause of expectation on side thoughtfulness on own how may have accounted for behaviour to sister what diabolical motive may have imputed to perhaps will hardly think better of be worth trial however will hear thing when first became intimate in family have other intention other view in acquaintance than to pas time pleasantly while be obliged to remain in devonshire more pleasantly than have ever done before sister lovely person interesting manner must not please behaviour to almost from first be of kind be astonishing when reflect on what be what be that heart must have be so insensible at first must confess vanity only be elevated by careless of happiness thinking only of own amusement giving way to feeling have always be too much in habit of indulging endeavoured by mean in power to make pleasing to without design of returning affection miss dashwood at point turning eye on with most angry contempt stopped by saying be hardly worth while mr willoughby for to relate for to listen longer such beginning a can not be followed by thing let be pained by hearing thing more on subject insist on hearing whole of replied fortune be never large have always be expensive always in habit of associating with people of better income than year since coming of age even before believe have added to debt though death of old cousin mr smith be to set free yet event being uncertain possibly far distant have be for time intention to re establish circumstance by marrying woman of fortune to attach to sister therefore be not thing to be thought of with meanness selfishness cruelty indignant contemptuous look even of yours miss dashwood can ever reprobate too much be acting in manner trying to engage regard without thought of returning one thing may be said for even in horrid state of selfish vanity did not know extent of injury meditated because did not then know what be to love have ever known well may be doubted for have really loved must have sacrificed feeling to vanity to avarice what be more must have sacrificed hers have done to avoid comparative poverty affection society must have deprived of horror have by raising to affluence lost thing must make blessing did then said elinor little softened believe at one time attached to to have resisted such attraction to have withstood such tenderness be there man on earth who must have done yes found by insensible degree sincerely fond of happiest hour of life be what spent with when felt intention be strictly honourable feeling blameless even then however when fully determined on paying address to allowed most improperly to put off from day to day moment of doing from unwillingness to enter into engagement while circumstance be so greatly embarrassed will not reason here will stop for to expatiate on absurdity worse than absurdity of scrupling to engage faith where honour be already bound event have proved be cunning fool providing with great circumspection for possible opportunity of making contemptible wretched for ever at last however resolution be taken have determined a soon a must engage alone to justify attention have so invariably paid openly assure of affection have already taken such pain to display in interim in interim of very few hour be to pas before must have opportunity of speaking with in private circumstance occurred unlucky circumstance to ruin resolution with comfort discovery took place here hesitated looked down mr smith have somehow other be informed imagine by distant relation whose interest be to deprive of favour of affair connection need not explain farther added looking at with heightened colour enquiring eye particular intimacy have probably heard whole story long ago have returned elinor colouring likewise hardening heart anew against compassion for have heard how will explain away part of guilt in dreadful business confess be beyond comprehension remember cried willoughby from whom received account must be impartial one acknowledge that situation character ought to have be respected by mean to justify at same time can not leave to suppose have nothing to urge that because be injured be irreproachable because be libertine must be saint if violence of passion weakness of understanding mean however to defend affection for deserved better treatment often with great self reproach recall tenderness for very short time have power of creating return wish heartily wish have never be have injured more than have injured one whose affection for may say be scarcely le warm than hers whose mind oh how infinitely superior indifference however towards that unfortunate girl must say unpleasant to a discussion of such subject may well be indifference be apology for cruel neglect of think excused by weakness natural defect of understanding on side in wanton cruelty so evident on yours must have known that while be enjoying in devonshire pursuing fresh scheme always gay always happy be reduced to extremest indigence upon soul did not know warmly replied did not recollect that have omitted to give direction common sense might have told how to find out well sir what said mr smith taxed with offence at once confusion may be guessed purity of life formality of notion ignorance of world thing be against matter must not deny vain be endeavour to soften be previously disposed believe to doubt morality of conduct in general be moreover discontented with very little attention very little portion of time have bestowed on in present visit in short ended in total breach by one measure might have saved in height of morality good woman offered to forgive past if must marry eliza must not be be formally dismissed from favour house night following affair be to go next morning be spent by in deliberating on what future conduct must be struggle be great ended too soon affection for marianne thorough conviction of attachment to be insufficient to outweigh dread of poverty get better of false idea of necessity of rich be naturally inclined to feel expensive society have increased have reason to believe secure of present wife if chose to address persuaded to think that nothing else in common prudence remained for to do heavy scene however awaited before must leave devonshire be engaged to dine with on very day apology be therefore necessary for breaking engagement whether must write apology deliver in person be point of long debate to see marianne felt must be dreadful even doubted whether must see again keep to resolution in point however undervalued own magnanimity a event declared for went saw saw miserable left miserable left hoping never to see again why did call mr willoughby said elinor reproachfully note must have answered purpose why be necessary to call illustration be formally dismissed be necessary to own pride must not bear to leave country in manner might lead rest of neighbourhood to suspect part of what have really passed between mr smith resolved therefore on calling at cottage in way to honiton sight of dear sister however be really dreadful to heighten matter found alone be gone know where have left only evening before so fully so firmly resolved within self on doing right few hour be to have engaged to for ever remember how happy how gay be spirit a walked from cottage to allenham satisfied with delighted with body in last interview of friendship approached with sense of guilt that almost took from power of dissembling sorrow disappointment deep regret when told be obliged to leave devonshire so immediately never will forget united too with such reliance such confidence in oh god what hard hearted rascal be be silent for few moment elinor first spoke did tell that must soon return know what told replied impatiently le than be due to past beyond doubt in likelihood much more than be justified by future can not think of wo do then came dear mother to torture farther with kindness confidence thank heaven did torture be miserable miss dashwood can not have idea of comfort give to look back on own misery owe grudge to myself for stupid rascally folly of own heart that past suffering under be only triumph exultation to now well went left loved went to to whom at best be only indifferent journey to town travelling with own horse therefore so tediously creature to speak to own reflection so cheerful when looked forward thing so inviting when looked back at barton picture so soothing oh be blessed journey stopped well sir said elinor who though pitying grew impatient for departure be ah have forgot what passed in town infamous letter did show yes saw note passed when first of hers reached a immediately did for be in town

one night entirely sleepless many hour of most wearing anxiety seemed to make requisite be kept off by irritation of spirit willoughby poor willoughby a now allowed to call be constantly in thought must not have heard vindication for world now blamed now acquitted herself for having judged so harshly before promise of relating to sister be invariably painful dreaded performance of dreaded what effect on marianne might be doubted whether after such explanation must ever be happy with for moment wished willoughby widower then remembering colonel brandon reproved felt that to suffering

proved to be a repeatedly declared one of happiest woman in world elinor must not hear declaration witness proof without sometimes wondering whether mother ever recollected edward mr dashwood trusting to temperate account of own disappointment elinor have sent be led away by exuberance of joy to think only of what must increase be restored to from danger in a now began to feel own mistaken judgment in encouraging unfortunate attachment to willoughby have contributed to place in recovery have yet source of joy unthought of by elinor be thus imparted to a soon a opportunity of private conference between occurred at last be alone elinor yet know happiness colonel brandon love marianne have told so daughter feeling by turn pleased pained surprised not surprised be silent attention be never like dear elinor must wonder at composure now have sat down to wish for possible good to family must have fixed on colonel brandon marrying one of a object most desirable believe marianne will be most happy with of two elinor be half inclined to ask reason for thinking so because satisfied that none founded on impartial consideration of age character feeling must be given mother must always be carried away by imagination on interesting subject therefore instead of inquiry passed off with smile opened whole heart to yesterday a travelled came out quite unawares quite undesignedly may well believe must talk of nothing child must not conceal distress saw that equalled own perhaps thinking that mere friendship a world now go must not justify so warm sympathy rather not thinking at suppose giving way to irresistible feeling made acquainted with earnest tender constant affection for marianne have loved elinor ever since first moment of seeing here however elinor perceived not language not profession of colonel brandon natural embellishment of mother active fancy fashioned thing delightful to a chose regard for infinitely surpassing anything willoughby ever felt feigned a much more warm a more sincere constant ever be to call have subsisted through knowledge of dear marianne unhappy prepossession for worthless young man without selfishness without encouraging hope must have seen happy with such noble mind such openness such sincerity one can be deceived in colonel brandon character said elinor a excellent man be well established know be replied mother seriously after such warning must be last to encourage such affection even to be pleased by coming for a did with such active such ready friendship be enough to prove one of worthiest of men character however answered elinor doe not rest on one act of kindness to affection for marianne be humanity out of case must have prompted to mr jennings to middleton have be long intimately known equally love respect even own knowledge of though lately acquired be very considerable so highly do value esteem that if marianne can be happy with will be a ready a to think connection greatest blessing to in world what answer did give did allow to hope oh love must not then talk of hope to to marianne might at moment be dying did not ask for hope encouragement be involuntary confidence irrepressible effusion to soothing friend not application to parent yet after time did say for at first be quite overcome that if lived a trusted might greatest happiness must lie in promoting marriage since arrival since delightful security have repeated to more fully have given encouragement in power time very little time tell will do everything marianne heart be not to be wasted for ever on man a willoughby own merit must soon secure to judge from colonel spirit however have not yet made equally sanguine think marianne affection too deeply rooted for change in under great length of time even supposing heart again free be too diffident of to believe that with difference of age disposition must ever attach there however be quite mistaken age be only so much beyond hers a to be advantage a to make character principle fixed disposition be well convinced be exactly very one to make sister happy person manner too be in favour partiality doe not blind certainly be not so handsome a willoughby at same time there be something much more pleasing in countenance there be always something if remember in willoughby eye at time did not like elinor must not remember mother without waiting for assent continued manner colonel manner be not only more pleasing to than willoughby ever be be of kind well know to be more solidly attaching to marianne gentleness genuine attention to other people manly unstudied simplicity be much more accordant with real disposition than liveliness often artificial often ill timed of other be very sure have willoughby turned out a really amiable a have proved contrary marianne must yet never have be so happy with a will be with colonel brandon paused daughter must not quite agree with dissent be not heard therefore gave offence at delaford will be within easy distance of added mr dashwood even if remain at barton in probability for hear be large village indeed there certainly must be small house cottage close by must suit quite a well a present situation poor elinor here be new scheme for getting to delaford spirit be stubborn fortune too for at time of life know everybody care about though neither know desire to know what really be be sure must be good one here be interrupted by entrance of third person elinor withdrew to think over in private to wish success to friend yet in wishing to feel pang for willoughby chapter xlvi marianne illness though weakening in kind have not be long enough to make recovery slow with youth natural strength mother presence in aid proceeded so smoothly a to enable to remove within four day after arrival of latter into mr palmer dressing room when there at own particular request for be impatient to pour forth thanks to for fetching mother colonel brandon be invited to visit emotion on entering room in seeing altered look in receiving pale hand immediately held out to be such a in elinor conjecture must arise from something more than affection for marianne consciousness of being known to others soon discovered in melancholy eye varying complexion a looked at sister probable recurrence of many past scene of misery to mind brought back by resemblance between marianne eliza already acknowledged now strengthened by hollow eye sickly skin posture of reclining weakness warm acknowledgment of peculiar obligation mr dashwood not le watchful of what passed than daughter with mind very differently influenced therefore watching to very different effect saw nothing in colonel behaviour what arose from most simple self evident sensation while in action word of marianne persuaded to think that something more than gratitude already dawned at end of day two marianne growing visibly stronger twelve hour mr dashwood urged equally by own daughter wish began to talk of removing to barton on measure depended of two friend mr jennings must not quit cleveland during dashwoods stay colonel brandon be soon brought by united request to consider own abode there a equally determinate if not equally indispensable at mr jennings united request in return mr dashwood be prevailed on to accept use of carriage on journey back for better accommodation of sick child colonel at joint invitation of mr dashwood mr jennings whose active good nature made friendly hospitable for other people a well a herself engaged with pleasure to redeem by visit at cottage in course of few week day of separation departure arrived marianne after taking so particular lengthened leave of mr jennings one so earnestly grateful so full of respect kind wish a seemed due to own heart from secret acknowledgment of past inattention bidding colonel brandon farewell with cordiality of friend be carefully assisted by into carriage of seemed anxious that must engross at least half mr dashwood elinor then followed others be left by to talk of traveller feel own dullness till mr jennings be summoned to chaise to take comfort in gossip of maid for loss of two young companion colonel brandon immediately afterwards took solitary way to delaford dashwoods be two day on road marianne bore journey on without essential fatigue thing that most zealous affection most solicitous care must do to render comfortable be office of watchful companion found reward in bodily ease calmness of spirit to elinor observation of latter be particularly grateful who have seen week after week so constantly suffering oppressed by anguish of heart have courage to speak of fortitude to conceal now saw with joy other must equally share apparent composure of mind in being result a trusted of serious reflection must eventually lead to contentment cheerfulness a approached barton indeed entered on scene of field tree brought peculiar painful recollection grew silent thoughtful turning away face from notice sat earnestly gazing through window here elinor must neither wonder blame when saw a assisted marianne from carriage that have be cry saw only emotion too natural in to raise thing le tender than pity in unobtrusiveness entitled to praise in whole of subsequent manner traced direction of mind awakened to reasonable exertion for sooner have entered common sitting room than marianne turned eye around with look of resolute firmness a if determined at once to accustom to sight of object with remembrance of willoughby must be connected said little sentence aimed at cheerfulness though sigh sometimes escaped never passed away without atonement of smile after dinner must try piano forte went to music on eye first rested be opera procured for by willoughby containing of favourite duet bearing on outward leaf own name in hand writing must not do shook head put music aside after running over key for minute complained of feebleness in finger closed instrument again

worth reading at park there be others of more modern production know can borrow of colonel brandon by reading only six hour day will gain in course of twelvemonth great deal of instruction now feel to want elinor honoured for plan originated so nobly a though smiling to see same eager fancy have be leading to extreme of languid indolence selfish repining now at work in introducing excess into scheme of such rational employment virtuous self control smile however changed to sigh when remembered that promise to willoughby be yet unfulfilled feared have that to communicate might again unsettle mind of marianne ruin at least for time fair prospect of busy tranquillity willing therefore to delay evil hour resolved to wait till sister health be more secure before appointed resolution be made only to be broken illustration see how child go on marianne have be two three day at home before weather be fine enough for invalid like to venture out at last soft genial morning appeared such a might tempt daughter wish mother confidence marianne leaning on elinor arm be authorised to walk a long a must without fatigue in lane before house sister set out at pace slow a feebleness of marianne in exercise hitherto untried since illness required have advanced only so far beyond house a to admit full view of hill important hill behind when pausing with eye turned towards marianne calmly said there exactly there pointing with one hand on projecting mound there fell there first saw willoughby voice sunk with word presently reviving added be thankful to find can look with so little pain on spot will ever talk on subject elinor hesitatingly be said will be wrong can talk of now hope a ought to do elinor tenderly invited to be open a for regret said marianne have done with a far a be concerned mean to talk to of what feeling have be for what be now at present if must be satisfied on one point if must be allowed to think that be not always acting part not always deceiving above if must be assured that never be so very wicked a fear have sometimes fancied since story of unfortunate girl stopped elinor joyfully treasured word a answered if must be assured of

mine most shamefully unguarded affection must expose to how then asked sister must account for behaviour must suppose oh how gladly must suppose only fickle very very fickle elinor said more be debating within on eligibility of beginning story directly postponing till marianne be in stronger health crept on for few minute in silence be not wishing too much good said marianne at last with sigh when wish secret reflection may be more unpleasant than own will suffer enough in do compare conduct with compare with what ought to have be compare with situation have borne little resemblance have borne more than conduct dearest elinor let kindness defend what know judgment must censure illness have made think have given leisure calmness for serious recollection long before be enough recovered to talk be perfectly able to reflect considered past saw in own behaviour since beginning of acquaintance with last autumn nothing series of imprudence towards want of kindness to others saw that own feeling have prepared suffering want of fortitude under have almost led to grave illness well knew have be entirely brought on by by such negligence of own health a have felt even at time to be wrong have died must have be self destruction did not know danger till danger be removed with such feeling a reflection gave wonder at recovery wonder that very eagerness of desire to live to have time for atonement to god to did not kill at once have died in what peculiar misery must have left nurse friend sister who have seen fretful selfishness of latter day who have known murmuring of heart how must have lived in remembrance mother too how must have consoled can not express own abhorrence of whenever looked towards past saw duty neglected failing indulged body seemed injured by kindness

gratitude have hitherto be left to discharge alone not le when knew to be unhappy than when have believed at ease did turn away from exertion of duty friendship scarcely allowing sorrow to exist with regretting only that heart have deserted wronged leaving for professed unbounded affection to be miserable for sake here ceased rapid flow of self reproving spirit elinor impatient to soothe though too honest to flatter gave instantly that praise support frankness contrition so well deserved marianne pressed hand replied be very good future must be proof have laid down plan if be capable of adhering to feeling will be governed temper improved will no longer worry others torture will now live solely for family mother margaret must henceforth be world to will share affection entirely

checked by religion by reason by constant employment paused added in low voice if must know heart everything must become easy elinor who have now be for time reflecting on propriety impropriety of speedily hazarding narration without feeling at nearer decision than at first heard perceiving that a reflection did nothing resolution must do soon found leading to fact managed recital a hoped with address prepared anxious listener with caution related simply honestly chief point on willoughby grounded apology did justice to repentance softened only protestation of present regard marianne said not word trembled eye be fixed on ground lip became whiter than even sickness have left thousand inquiry sprung up from heart dared not urge one caught syllable with panting eagerness hand unknowingly to herself closely pressed sister tear covered cheek elinor dreading being tired led towards home till reached door of cottage easily conjecturing what curiosity must be though question be suffered to speak talked of nothing willoughby conversation together be carefully minute in particular of speech look where minuteness must be safely indulged a soon a entered house marianne with kiss of gratitude two word just articulate through tear tell mama withdrew from sister walked slowly up stair elinor must not attempt to disturb solitude so reasonable a what now sought with mind anxiously pre arranging result resolution of reviving subject again must marianne fail to do turned into parlour to fulfill parting injunction chapter xlvii mr dashwood did not hear unmoved vindication of former favourite rejoiced in being cleared from part of imputed guilt be sorry for wished happy feeling of past must not be recalled nothing must restore with faith unbroken character unblemished to marianne nothing must do away knowledge of what latter have suffered through mean remove guilt of conduct towards eliza nothing must replace therefore in former esteem injure interest of colonel

elinor power in wish to rouse such feeling in by retailed explanation a have at first be called forth in reflection have given calmness to judgment sobered own opinion of willoughby desert wished therefore to declare only simple truth lay open such fact a be really due to character without embellishment of tenderness to lead fancy astray in evening when be three together marianne began voluntarily to speak of again that be not without effort restless unquiet thoughtfulness in have be for time previously sitting rising colour a spoke unsteady voice plainly showed wish to assure said that see thing a can desire to do mr dashwood must have interrupted instantly with soothing tenderness have not elinor who really wished to hear sister unbiased opinion by eager sign engaged silence marianne slowly continued be great relief to what elinor told morning have now heard exactly what wished to hear for moment voice be lost recovering added with greater calmness than before be now perfectly satisfied wish for change never must have be happy with after knowing a sooner later must have known must have have confidence esteem nothing must have done away to feeling know know cried mother happy with man of libertine practice with one who so injured peace of dearest of friend best of men marianne have not heart to be made happy with man conscience sensitive conscience must have felt that conscience of husband ought to have felt marianne sighed repeated wish for change consider matter said elinor exactly a good mind sound understanding must consider dare say perceive a well a not only in in many other circumstance reason enough to be convinced that marriage must have involved in many certain trouble disappointment in must have be poorly supported by affection on side much le certain have married must have be always poor expensiveness be acknowledged even by whole conduct declares that self denial be word hardly understood by demand inexperience together on small very small income must have brought on distress must not be le grievous to from having be entirely unknown unthought of before sense of honour honesty must have led know when aware of situation to attempt economy must appear to possible perhaps a long a frugality retrenched only on own comfort might have be suffered to practice beyond how little must utmost of single management do to stop ruin have begun before marriage beyond have endeavoured however reasonably to abridge enjoyment be not to be feared that instead of prevailing on feeling so selfish to consent to must have lessened own influence on heart made regret connection have involved in such difficulty marianne lip quivered repeated word selfish in tone implied do really think selfish whole of behaviour replied elinor from beginning to end of affair have be grounded on selfishness be selfishness first made sport with affection afterwards when own be engaged made delay confession of finally carried from barton own enjoyment own ease be in particular ruling principle be very true happiness never be object at present continued elinor regret what have done why doe regret because find have not answered towards have not made happy circumstance be now unembarrassed suffers from evil of kind think only that have married woman of le amiable temper than doe follow have married must have be happy inconvenience must have be different must then have suffered under pecuniary distress because be removed now reckons a nothing must have have wife of whose temper must make complaint must have be always necessitous always poor probably must soon have learned to rank innumerable comfort of clear estate good income a of far more importance even to domestic happiness than mere temper of wife have not doubt of said marianne have nothing to regret nothing own folly rather say mother imprudence child said mr dashwood must be answerable marianne must not let proceed elinor satisfied that felt own error wished to avoid survey of past might weaken sister spirit therefore pursuing first subject immediately continued one observation may think be fairly drawn from whole of story that willoughby difficulty have arisen from first offence against virtue in behaviour to eliza williams crime have be origin of lesser one of present discontent marianne assented most feelingly to remark mother be led by to enumeration of colonel brandon injury merit warm a friendship design must unitedly dictate daughter did not look however a if much of be heard by elinor according to expectation saw on two three following day marianne did not continue to gain strength a have done while resolution be unsubdued still tried to appear cheerful easy sister must safely trust to effect of time upon health margaret returned family be again all restored to other again quietly settled at cottage if not pursuing usual study with quite so much vigour a when first came to barton at least planning vigorous prosecution of in future elinor grew impatient for tidings of edward have heard nothing of since leaving london nothing new of plan nothing certain even of present abode letter have passed between brother in

upon elinor saw turning pale fell back in chair in hysteric mr dashwood whose eye a answered servant inquiry have intuitively taken same direction be shocked to perceive by elinor countenance how much really suffered moment afterwards alike distressed by marianne situation knew not on child to bestow principal attention servant who saw only that miss marianne be taken ill have sense enough to call one of maid who with mr dashwood assistance supported into other room by time marianne be rather better mother leaving to care of margaret maid returned to elinor who though still much disordered have so far recovered use of reason voice a to be just beginning inquiry of thomas a to source of intelligence mr dashwood immediately took trouble on herself elinor have benefit of information without exertion of seeking illustration suppose know ma'be that mr ferrars be married who told that mr ferrars be married thomas see mr ferrars ma'be morning in exeter lady too miss steele a be be stopping

thoughtfulness silence mr dashwood feared to hazard remark ventured not to offer consolation now found that have erred in relying on elinor representation of herself justly concluded that thing have be expressly softened at time to spare from increase of unhappiness suffering a then have suffered for marianne found that have be misled by careful considerate attention of daughter to think attachment once have so well understood much slighter in reality than have be wont to believe than be now proved to be feared that under persuasion have be unjust inattentive nay almost unkind to elinor that marianne affliction because more acknowledged more immediately before have too much engrossed tenderness led away to forget in elinor might have daughter suffering almost a much certainly with le self provocation greater fortitude chapter xlviii elinor now found difference between expectation of unpleasant event however certain mind may be told to consider certainty now found that in

mother when moment of action be over wished that have shaken hand with too be then too late with countenance meaning to be open sat down again talked of weather marianne have retreated a much a possible out of sight to conceal distress margaret understanding part not whole of case thought incumbent on to be dignified therefore took seat a far from a must maintained strict silence when elinor have ceased to rejoice in dryness of season very awful pause took place be put end to by mr dashwood who felt obliged to hope that have left mr ferrars very well in hurried manner replied in affirmative pause elinor resolving to exert though fearing sound of own voice now said be mr ferrars at longstaple at longstaple replied with air of surprise mother be in town meant said elinor taking up work from table to inquire for mr edward ferrars dared not look up mother marianne turned eye on coloured seemed perplexed looked doubtingly after hesitation said perhaps mean brother mean mr mr

brother be lately married to to youngest to miss lucy steele word be echoed with unspeakable astonishment by elinor who sat with head leaning over work in state of such agitation a made hardly know where be yes said be married last week be now at dawlish elinor must sit no longer almost ran out of room a soon a door be closed burst into tear of joy at first thought must never cease edward who have till then looked where rather than at saw hurry away perhaps saw even heard emotion for immediately afterwards fell into reverie remark inquiry affectionate address of mr dashwood must penetrate at last without saying word quitted room walked out towards village leaving others in greatest astonishment perplexity on change in situation so wonderful so sudden perplexity have mean of lessening by own conjecture chapter xlix unaccountable however a circumstance of release might appear to whole family be certain that edward be free to what purpose freedom must be employed be easily pre determined by for after experiencing blessing of one imprudent engagement contracted without mother consent a have already done for more than four year nothing le must be expected of in failure of than immediate contraction of errand at barton in fact be simple one be only to ask elinor to marry considering that be not altogether inexperienced in such question might be strange that must feel so uncomfortable in present case a really did so much in need of encouragement fresh air how soon have walked into proper resolution however how soon opportunity of exercising occurred in what manner expressed how be received need not be particularly told only need be said that when sat down to table at four o'clock about three hour after arrival have secured lady engaged mother consent be not only in rapturous profession of lover in reality of reason truth one of happiest of men situation indeed be more than commonly joyful have more than ordinary triumph of accepted love to swell heart raise spirit be released without reproach to from entanglement have long formed misery from woman whom have long ceased to love elevated at once to security with must have thought of almost with despair a soon a have learnt to consider with desire be brought not from doubt suspense from misery to happiness change be openly spoken in such genuine flowing grateful cheerfulness a friend have never witnessed in before heart be now open to elinor weakness error confessed first boyish attachment to lucy treated with philosophic dignity of twenty four be foolish idle inclination on side said consequence of ignorance of world want of employment have brother given active profession when be removed at eighteen from care of mr pratt think nay be sure must never have happened for though left longstaple with what thought at time most unconquerable preference for niece yet have then have pursuit object to engage time keep at distance from for few month must very soon have outgrown fancied attachment especially by mixing more with world a in such case must have done instead of having thing to do instead of having profession chosen for being allowed to choose returned home to be completely idle for first twelvemonth afterwards have not even nominal employment belonging to university must have given for be not entered at oxford till be nineteen have therefore nothing in world to do to fancy in love a mother did not make home in respect comfortable a have friend companion in brother disliked new acquaintance be not unnatural for to be very often at longstaple where always felt at home be always sure of welcome accordingly spent greatest part of time there from eighteen to nineteen lucy appeared everything be amiable obliging be pretty too at least thought so then have seen so little of other woman must make comparison see defect considering everything therefore hope foolish a engagement be foolish a have since in way be proved be not at time unnatural inexcusable piece of folly change few hour have wrought in mind happiness of dashwoods be such so great a promised satisfaction of sleepless night mr dashwood too happy to be comfortable knew not how to love edward praise elinor enough how to be enough thankful for release without wounding delicacy how at once to give leisure for unrestrained conversation together yet enjoy a wished sight society of marianne must speak happiness only by tear comparison must occur regret must arise joy though sincere a love for sister be of kind to give spirit language elinor how be feeling to be described from moment of learning that lucy be married to edward be free to moment of justifying hope have so instantly followed be thing by turn tranquil when second moment have passed when found doubt solicitude removed compared situation with what so lately have be saw honourably released from former engagement saw instantly profiting by release to address declare affection a tender a constant a have ever supposed to be be oppressed be overcome by own felicity happily disposed a be human mind to be easily familiarized with change for better required several hour to give sedateness to spirit degree of tranquillity to heart edward be now fixed at cottage at least for week for other claim might be made on be impossible that le than week must be given up to enjoyment of elinor company suffice to say half be to be said of past present future for though very few hour spent in hard labor of incessant talking will despatch more subject than can really be in common between two rational creature yet with lover be different between subject be finished communication be even made till have be made at least twenty time over lucy marriage unceasing reasonable wonder among formed of course one of earliest discussion of lover elinor particular knowledge of party made appear to in view a one of most extraordinary unaccountable circumstance have ever heard how must be thrown together by what attraction robert must be drawn on to marry girl of whose beauty have heard speak without admiration girl too already engaged to brother on whose account that brother have be thrown off by family be beyond comprehension to make out to own heart be delightful affair to imagination be even ridiculous one to reason judgment be completely puzzle edward must only attempt explanation by supposing that perhaps at first accidentally meeting vanity of one have be so worked on by flattery of other a to lead by degree to rest elinor remembered what robert have told in harley street of opinion of what own mediation in brother affair might have done if applied to in time repeated to edward be exactly like robert be immediate observation that presently added might perhaps be in head when acquaintance between first began lucy perhaps at first might think only of procuring good office in favour other design might afterward arise how long have be carrying on between however be equally at loss with to make out for at oxford where have remained for choice ever since quitting london have have mean of hearing of from letter to very last be neither le frequent le affectionate than usual not smallest suspicion therefore have ever occurred to prepare for what followed when at last burst on in letter from lucy have be for time believed half stupified between wonder horror joy of such deliverance put letter into elinor hand dear sir being very sure have long lost affection have thought at liberty to bestow own on have doubt of being a happy with a once used to think might be with scorn to accept hand while heart be sincerely wish happy in choice will not be fault if be not always good friend a near relationship now make proper can safely say owe ill will be sure will be too generous to do ill office brother have gained affection entirely a must not live without one be just returned from altar be now on way to dawlish for few week place dear brother have great curiosity to see thought must first trouble with few line will always remain sincere well wisher friend sister lucy ferrars have burnt letter will return picture first opportunity please to destroy scrawl ring with hair be very welcome to keep elinor read returned without comment will not ask opinion of a composition said edward for world must not have have letter of hers seen by in former day in sister be bad enough in wife how have blushed over page of writing believe may say that since first half year of foolish business be only letter ever received from of substance made amends for defect of style however may have come about said elinor after pause be certainly married mother have brought on most appropriate punishment independence settled on robert through resentment against have put in power to make own choice have actually be bribing one son with thousand year to do very deed disinherited other for intending to do will hardly be le hurt suppose by robert marrying lucy than must have be by marrying will be more hurt by for robert always be favourite will be more hurt by on same principle will forgive much sooner in what state affair stood at present between edward knew not for communication with of family have yet be attempted by have quitted oxford within four twenty hour after lucy letter arrived with only one object before nearest road to barton have have leisure to form scheme of conduct with road did not hold most intimate connection must hing till be assured of fate with miss dashwood by rapidity in seeking that fate be to be supposed in spite of jealousy with have once thought of colonel brandon in spite of modesty with rated own desert politeness with talked of doubt did not upon whole expect very cruel reception be business however to say that did said very prettily what might say on subject twelvemonth after must be referred to imagination of husband wife lucy have certainly meant to deceive to go off with flourish of malice against in message by thomas be perfectly clear to elinor edward now thoroughly enlightened on character have scruple in believing capable of utmost meanness of wanton ill nature though eye have be long opened even before acquaintance with elinor began to ignorance want of liberality in of opinion have be equally imputed by to want of education till last letter reached have always believed to be well disposed good hearted girl thoroughly attached to nothing persuasion must have prevented putting end to engagement long before discovery of laid open to mother anger have be continual source of disquiet regret to thought duty said independent of feeling to give option of continuing engagement not when be renounced by mother stood to appearance without friend in world to assist in situation a where there seemed nothing to tempt avarice vanity of living creature how must suppose when so earnestly so warmly insisted on sharing fate whatever might be that thing most disinterested affection be inducement even now can not comprehend on motive acted what fancied advantage must be to to be fettered to man for whom have not smallest regard who have only two thousand pound in world must not foresee that colonel brandon must give living might suppose that something must occur in favour that own family might in time relent at rate lost nothing by continuing engagement for have proved that fettered inclination action connection be certainly respectable one probably gained consideration among friend if nothing more advantageous occurred must be better for to marry than be single edward be of course immediately convinced that nothing must have be more natural than lucy conduct more self evident than motive of elinor scolded harshly a lady always scold imprudence compliment for having spent so much time with at norland when must have felt own inconstancy behaviour be certainly very wrong said because to say nothing of own conviction relation be led away by to fancy expect what a be then situated must never be must only plead ignorance of own heart mistaken confidence in force of engagement be simple enough to think that because faith be plighted to there must be no danger in being with that consciousness of engagement be to keep heart a safe sacred a honour felt that admired told be only friendship till began to make comparison between lucy did not know how far be got after suppose be wrong in remaining so much in sussex argument with reconciled to expediency of be no better than danger be own be doing injury to anybody elinor smiled shook head edward heard with pleasure of colonel brandon being expected at cottage a really wished not only to be better acquainted with to have opportunity of convincing that no longer resented giving living of delaford at present said after thanks so ungraciously delivered a mine be on occasion must think have never forgiven for offering now felt astonished that have never yet be to place so little interest have taken in matter that owed knowledge of house garden glebe extent of parish condition of land rate of tithe to elinor who have heard so much of from colonel brandon heard with so much attention a to be entirely mistress of subject one question after only remained undecided between one difficulty only be to be overcome be brought together by mutual affection with warmest approbation of real friend intimate knowledge of other seemed to make happiness certain only wanted something to live upon edward have two thousand pound elinor one with delaford living be that must call own for be impossible that mr dashwood must advance anything be of quite enough in love to think that three hundred fifty pound year must supply with comfort of life edward be not entirely without hope of favourable change in mother towards on that rested for residue of income elinor have such dependence for since edward must still be unable to marry miss morton choosing have be spoken of in mr ferrars flattering language a only lesser evil than choosing lucy steele feared that robert offence must serve other purpose than to enrich fanny about four day after edward arrival colonel brandon appeared to complete mr dashwood satisfaction to give dignity of having for first time since living at barton more company with than house must hold edward be allowed to retain privilege of first comer colonel brandon therefore walked night to old quarter at park from whence usually returned in morning early enough to interrupt lover first tete tete before breakfast three week residence at delaford where in evening hour at least have little to do to calculate disproportion between thirty six seventeen brought to barton in temper of mind needed improvement in marianne look kindness of welcome encouragement of mother language to make cheerful among such friend however such flattery did revive rumour of lucy marriage have yet reached knew nothing of what have passed first hour of visit be consequently spent in hearing in wondering thing be explained to by mr dashwood found fresh reason to rejoice in what have done for mr ferrars since eventually promoted interest of elinor must be needle to say that gentleman advanced in good opinion of other a advanced in other acquaintance for must not be otherwise resemblance in good principle good sense in disposition manner of thinking must probably have be sufficient to unite in friendship without other attraction being in love with two sister two sister fond of other made that mutual regard inevitable immediate might otherwise have waited effect of time judgment letter from town few day before must have made nerve in elinor body thrill with transport now arrived to be read with le emotion that mirth mr jennings wrote to tell wonderful tale to vent honest indignation against jilting girl pour forth compassion towards poor mr edward who be sure have quite doted upon worthless hussy be now by account almost broken hearted at oxford do think continued nothing be ever carried on so sly for be two day before lucy called sat couple of hour with not soul suspected anything of matter not even nancy who poor soul came cry to day after in great fright for fear of mr ferrars a well a not knowing how to get to plymouth for lucy seems borrowed money before went off to be married on purpose suppose to make show with poor nancy have not seven shilling in world so be very glad to give five guinea to take down to exeter where think of staying three four week with mr burgess in hope a tell to fall in with doctor again must say that lucy crossness not to take along with in chaise be worse than poor mr edward can not get out of head must send for to barton miss marianne must try to comfort mr dashwood strain be more solemn mr ferrars be most unfortunate of woman poor fanny have suffered agony of sensibility considered existence of under blow with grateful wonder robert offence be unpardonable lucy be infinitely worse of be ever again to be mentioned to mr ferrars even if might hereafter be induced to forgive son wife must never be acknowledged a daughter be permitted to appear in presence secrecy with everything have be carried on between be rationally treated a enormously heightening crime because have suspicion of occurred to others proper measure must have be taken to prevent marriage called on elinor to join with in regretting that lucy engagement with edward have not rather be fulfilled than must thus be mean of spreading misery farther in family thus continued mr ferrars have never yet mentioned edward name doe not surprise to great astonishment not line have be received from on occasion perhaps however be kept silent by fear of offending will therefore give hint by line to oxford that sister think letter of proper submission from addressed perhaps to fanny by shown to mother might not be taken amiss for know tenderness of mr ferrars heart that wish for nothing so much a to be on good term with child paragraph be of importance to prospect conduct of edward determined to attempt reconciliation though not exactly in manner pointed out by brother sister letter of proper submission repeated must have beg mother pardon for robert ingratitude to breach of honour to can make submission be grown humble penitent by what have passed be grown very happy must not interest know of submission be proper for to make may certainly ask to be forgiven said elinor because have offended must think might now venture so far a to profess concern for having ever formed engagement drew on mother anger agreed that might when have forgiven perhaps little humility may be convenient while acknowledging second engagement almost a imprudent in eye a first have nothing to urge against still resisted idea of letter of proper submission therefore to make easier to a declared much greater willingness to make mean concession by word of mouth than on paper be resolved that instead of writing to fanny must go to london personally entreat good office in favour if really do interest said marianne in new character of candour in bringing about reconciliation will think that even john fanny be not entirely without merit after visit on colonel brandon side of only three four day two gentleman quitted barton together be to go immediately to delaford edward might have personal knowledge of future home assist patron friend in deciding on improvement be needed to from thence after staying there couple of night be to proceed on journey to town chapter l after proper resistance on part of mr ferrars just so violent so steady a to preserve from that reproach always seemed fearful of incurring reproach of being too amiable edward be admitted to presence pronounced to be again son family have of late be exceedingly fluctuating for many year of life have have two son crime annihilation of edward few week ago have robbed of one similar annihilation of robert have left for fortnight without now by resuscitation of edward have one again in spite of being allowed once more to live however did not feel continuance of existence secure till have revealed present engagement for publication of circumstance feared might give sudden turn to constitution carry off a rapidly a before with apprehensive caution therefore be revealed be listened to with unexpected calmness mr ferrars at first reasonably endeavoured to dissuade from marrying miss dashwood by argument in power told that in miss morton must have woman of higher rank larger fortune enforced assertion by observing that miss morton be daughter of nobleman with thirty thousand pound while miss dashwood be only daughter of private gentleman with more than three when found that though perfectly admitting truth of representation be by mean inclined to be guided by judged wisest from experience of past to submit therefore after such ungracious delay a owed to own dignity a served to prevent suspicion of good will issued decree of consent to marriage of edward elinor what must engage to do towards augmenting income be next to be considered here plainly appeared that though edward be now only son be by mean eldest for while robert be inevitably endowed with thousand pound year not smallest objection be made against edward taking order for sake of two hundred fifty at utmost be anything promised for present in future beyond ten thousand pound have be given with fanny be a much however a be desired more than be expected by edward elinor mr ferrars by shuffling excuse seemed only person surprised at not giving more with income quite sufficient to want thus secured to have nothing to wait for after edward be in possession of living readiness of house to colonel brandon with eager desire for accommodation of elinor be making considerable improvement after waiting time for completion after experiencing a usual thousand disappointment delay from unaccountable dilatoriness of workman elinor a usual broke through first positive resolution of not marrying till thing be ready ceremony took place in barton church early in autumn first month after marriage be spent with friend at mansion house from whence must superintend progress of parsonage direct thing a liked on spot must choose paper project shrubbery invent sweep mr jennings prophecy though rather jumbled together be chiefly fulfilled for be able to visit edward wife in parsonage by michaelmas found in elinor husband a really believed one of happiest couple in world have in fact nothing to wish for marriage of colonel brandon marianne rather better pasturage for cow be visited on first settling by almost relation friend mr ferrars came to inspect happiness be almost ashamed of having authorised even dashwoods be at expense of journey from sussex to do honour will not say that be disappointed dear sister said john a be walking together one morning before gate of delaford house must be saying too much for certainly have be one of most fortunate young woman in world a be confess must give great pleasure to call colonel brandon brother property here place house thing be in such respectable excellent condition wood have not seen such timber where in dorsetshire a there be now standing in delaford hanger though perhaps marianne may not seem exactly person to attract yet think must altogether be advisable for to have now frequently staying with for a colonel brandon seems great deal at home nobody can tell what may happen for when people be much thrown together see little of anybody else will always be in power to set off to advantage so forth in short may a well give chance understand though mr ferrars did come to see always treated with make believe of decent affection be never insulted by real favour preference be due to folly of robert cunning of wife be earned by before many month have passed away selfish sagacity of latter have at first drawn robert into scrape be principal instrument of deliverance from for respectful humility assiduous attention endless flattery a soon a smallest opening be given for exercise reconciled mr ferrars to choice re established completely in favour illustration everything in such respectable condition whole of lucy behaviour in affair prosperity crowned therefore may be held forth a most encouraging instance of what earnest unceasing attention to self interest however progress may be apparently obstructed will do in securing advantage of fortune with other sacrifice than of time conscience when robert first sought acquaintance privately visited in bartlett building be only with view imputed to by brother merely meant to persuade to give up engagement a there must be nothing to overcome affection of naturally expected that one two interview must settle matter in point however that only erred for though lucy soon gave hope that eloquence must convince in time visit conversation be always wanted to produce conviction doubt always lingered in mind when parted must only be removed by half hour discourse with attendance be by mean secured rest followed in course instead of talking of edward came gradually to talk only of robert subject on have always more to say than on other in soon betrayed interest even equal to own in short became speedily evident to that have entirely supplanted brother be proud of conquest proud of tricking edward very proud of marrying privately without mother consent what immediately followed be known passed month in great happiness at dawlish for have many relation old acquaintance to cut drew several plan for magnificent cottage from thence returning to town procured forgiveness of mr ferrars by simple expedient of asking at lucy instigation be adopted forgiveness at first indeed a be reasonable comprehended only robert lucy who have owed mother duty therefore must have transgressed none still remained week longer unpardoned perseverance in humility of conduct message in self condemnation for robert offence gratitude for unkindness be treated with procured in time haughty notice overcame by graciousness led soon afterwards by rapid degree to highest state of affection influence lucy became a necessary to mr ferrars a robert fanny while edward be never cordially forgiven for having once intended to marry elinor though superior to in fortune birth be spoken of a intruder be in thing considered always openly acknowledged to be favourite child settled in town received very liberal assistance from mr ferrars be on best term imaginable with dashwoods setting aside jealousy ill will continually subsisting between fanny lucy in husband of course took part a well a frequent domestic disagreement between robert lucy nothing must exceed harmony in lived together what edward have done to forfeit right of eldest son might have puzzled many people to find out what robert have done to succeed to might have puzzled still more be arrangement however justified in effect if not in cause for nothing ever appeared in robert style of living of talking to give suspicion of regretting extent of income a leaving brother too little bringing too much if edward might be judged from ready discharge of duty in particular from increasing attachment to wife home from regular cheerfulness of spirit might be supposed le contented with lot le free from wish of exchange elinor marriage divided a little from family a must well be contrived without rendering cottage at barton entirely useless for mother sister spent much more than time with mr dashwood be acting on motif of policy a well a pleasure in frequency of visit at delaford for wish of bringing marianne colonel brandon together be hardly le earnest though rather more liberal than what john have expressed be now darling object precious a be company of daughter to desired nothing so much a to give up constant enjoyment to valued friend to see marianne settled at mansion house be equally wish of edward elinor felt sorrow own obligation marianne by general consent be to be reward of with confederacy against with knowledge so intimate of goodness with conviction of fond attachment to herself at last though long after be observable to everybody else burst on what must do marianne dashwood be born to extraordinary fate be born to discover falsehood of own opinion to counteract by conduct most favourite maxim be born to overcome affection formed so late in life a at seventeen with sentiment superior to strong esteem lively friendship voluntarily to give hand to that other man who have suffered no le than under event of former attachment whom two year before have considered too old to be married who still sought constitutional safeguard of flannel waistcoat so be instead of falling sacrifice to irresistible passion a once have fondly flattered with expecting instead of remaining even for ever with mother finding only pleasure in retirement study a afterwards in more calm sober judgment have determined on found at nineteen submitting to new attachment entering on new duty placed in new home wife mistress of family patroness of village colonel brandon be now a happy a who best loved believed deserved to be in

complete in voluntary forgiveness of mr smith who by stating marriage with woman of character a source of clemency gave reason for believing have behaved with honour towards marianne might at once have be happy rich that repentance of misconduct thus brought own punishment be sincere need not be doubted that long thought of colonel brandon with envy of marianne with regret that be for ever inconsolable that fled from society contracted habitual gloom of temper died of broken heart must not be depended on for did lived to exert frequently to enjoy wife be not always out of humour home always uncomfortable in breed of horse dog in sporting of kind found inconsiderable degree of domestic felicity for marianne however in spite of incivility in surviving loss always retained that decided regard interested in thing befell made secret standard of perfection in woman many rising beauty must be slighted by in after day a bearing comparison with mr brandon mr dashwood be prudent enough to remain at cottage without attempting removal to delaford fortunately for sir john mr jennings when marianne be taken from margaret have reached age highly suitable for dancing not very ineligible for being supposed to have lover between barton delaford there be that constant communication strong family affection must naturally dictate among merit happiness of elinor marianne let not be ranked a least considerable that though sister living almost within sight of other must live without disagreement between producing coolness between husband end
