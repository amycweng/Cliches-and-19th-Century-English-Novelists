next turning will bring to turnpike may see church tower over hedge 'white hart ' be close by will long to know what think of tom musgrave such be last audible sound of miss watson voice before passed through turnpike gate entered on pitching of town jumbling noise of made further conversation most thoroughly undesirable old mare trotted heavily on wanting direction of rein to take right turning making only one blunder in proposing to stop at milliner before drew up towards mr edward door mr edward lived in best house in street best in place if mr tomlinson banker might be indulged in calling newly erected house at end of town with shrubbery sweep in country mr edward house be higher than most of neighbour with four window on side door window guarded by post chain door approached by flight of stone step here be said elizabeth a carriage ceased moving safely arrived by market clock have be only five thirty minute coming think be doing pretty well though must be nothing for penelope be not nice town edward have noble house see live quite in style door will be opened by man in livery with powdered head can tell chapter ii emma have seen edward only one morning at stanton be therefore stranger to though spirit be by mean insensible to expected joy of evening felt little uncomfortable in thought of be to precede conversation with elizabeth too giving very unpleasant feeling with respect to own family have made more open to disagreeable impression from other cause increased sense of awkwardness of rushing into intimacy on so slight acquaintance there be nothing in manner of mr miss edward to give immediate change to idea mother though very friendly woman have reserved air great deal of formal civility daughter genteel looking girl of twenty two with hair in paper seemed very naturally to have caught something of style of mother who have brought up emma be soon left to know what must be by elizabeth being obliged to hurry away very languid remark on probable brilliancy of ball be broke at interval silence of hour before be joined by master of house mr edward have much easier more communicative air than lady of family be fresh from street came ready to tell might interest after cordial reception of emma turned to daughter with well mary bring good news osborne will certainly be at ball to night horse for two carriage be ordered from 'white hart ' to

supplied with chatted with greater briskness till mr edward moment for dressing arrived young lady be carefully recommended to lose time emma be shown to very comfortable apartment a soon a mr edward civility must leave to herself happy occupation first bliss of ball began girl dressing in measure together grew unavoidably better acquainted emma found in miss edward show of good sense modest unpretending mind great wish of obliging when returned to parlour where mr edward be sitting respectably attired in one of two satin gown went through winter new cap from milliner entered with much easier feeling more natural smile than have taken away dress be now to be examined mr edward acknowledged too old fashioned to approve of modern extravagance however sanctioned though complacently viewing daughter good look must give qualified admiration mr edward not le satisfied with mary paid compliment of good humoured gallantry to emma at expense discussion led to more intimate remark miss edward gently asked emma if be not often reckoned very like youngest brother emma thought must perceive faint blush accompany question there seemed something still more suspicious in manner in mr edward took up subject be paying miss emma great compliment think mary said hastily mr sam watson be very good sort of young man daresay very clever surgeon complexion have be rather too much exposed to weather to make likeness to very flattering mary apologised in confusion have not thought strong likeness at incompatible with very different degree of beauty there might be resemblance in countenance complexion even feature be very unlike know nothing of brother beauty said emma for have not seen since be seven year old father reckons alike mr watson cried mr edward well astonish there be not least likeness in world brother eye be grey yours be brown have long face wide mouth dear do perceive least resemblance not least miss emma watson put very much in mind of eldest sister sometimes see look of miss penelope once twice there have be glance of mr robert can not perceive likeness to mr samuel see likeness between miss watson replied mr edward very strongly be not sensible of others much think be like of family miss watson be very sure there be resemblance between sam matter be settled went to dinner father miss emma be one of oldest friend said mr edward a helped to

pleasantry be always at home before midnight must laugh at osborne castle to hear call late be just rising from dinner at midnight be nothing to purpose retorted lady calmly osborne be to be rule for have better meet night break up two hour sooner so far subject be very often carried mr mr edward be so wise a never to pas point mr edward now turned to something else have lived long enough in idleness of town to become little of gossip having anxiety to know more of circumstance of young guest than have reached began with think miss emma remember aunt very well about thirty year ago be pretty sure danced with in old room at bath year before married be very fine woman then like other people suppose be grown somewhat older since time hope be likely to be happy in second choice hope so believe so sir said emma in agitation mr turner have not be dead great while think about two year sir forget what name be now o'brien irish ah remember be gone to settle in ireland wonder that must

hope there be said mr edward gravely with quick glance at daughter emma have just recovered from own perturbation in time to see blush on miss edward cheek in remembering what elizabeth have said of captain hunter to wonder waver between influence brother elderly lady must be careful how make second choice observed mr edward carefulness discretion must not be confined to elderly lady to second choice added wife be quite a necessary to young lady in first rather more so dear replied because young lady be likely to feel effect of longer when old lady play fool be not in course of nature that

dancing emma looked at a passed chiefly with most interest on tom musgrave who be certainly genteel good looking young man of female lady osborne have by much finest person though nearly fifty be very handsome have dignity of rank lord osborne be very fine young man there be air of coldness of carelessness even of awkwardness about seemed to speak out of element in ball room came in fact only because be judged expedient for to please borough be not fond of woman company never danced mr howard be agreeable looking man little more than thirty at conclusion of two dance emma found knew not

moment restored to first delight looked joyfully at mother stepping forward with honest simple thank ma'be be instantly ready to attend new acquaintance thankfulness of mr blake be more diffuse with look most expressive of unexpected pleasure lively gratitude turned to neighbour with repeated fervent acknowledgment of so great condescending kindness to boy emma with perfect truth assured that must not be giving greater pleasure than felt charles being provided with glove charged to keep on joined set be now rapidly forming with nearly equal complacency be partnership must not be noticed without surprise gained broad stare from miss osborne miss carr a passed in dance upon word charles be in luck said former a turned have got better partner than to happy charles answered yes tom musgrave who be dancing with miss carr gave many inquisitive glance after time lord osborne came under pretence of talking to charles stood to look at partner though rather distressed by such observation emma must not repent what have done so happy have made boy mother latter of whom be continually making opportunity of addressing with warmest civility little partner found though bent chiefly on dancing be not unwilling to speak when question remark gave anything to say learnt by sort of inevitable enquiry that have two brother sister that mamma lived with uncle at wickstead that uncle taught latin that be very fond of riding have horse of own given by lord osborne that have be out once already with lord osborne hound at end of dance emma found be to drink tea miss edward gave caution to be at hand in manner convinced of mr edward holding very important to have close to when moved into tea room emma be accordingly on alert to gain proper station be always pleasure of company to have little bustle crowd when adjourned for refreshment tea room be small room within card room in passing through latter where passage be straitened by table mr edward party be for few moment hemmed in happened close by lady osborne casino table mr howard who belonged to spoke to nephew emma on perceiving object of attention to lady osborne have just turned away eye in time to avoid seeming to hear young companion exclaim delightedly aloud oh uncle do look at partner be so pretty a be immediately in motion again however charles be hurried off without being able to receive uncle suffrage on entering tea room in two long table be prepared lord osborne be to be seen quite alone at end of one a if retreating a far a must from ball to enjoy own thought gape without restraint charles instantly pointed out to emma there be lord osborne let go sit by said emma laughing must sit with friend charles be now free enough to hazard few question in turn what o'clock be eleven

badger anybody must think be alive be pity must not see on rising from tea there be again scramble for pleasure of being first out of room happened to be increased by one two of card party having just broken up player being disposed to move exactly different way among be mr howard sister leaning on arm sooner be within reach of emma than mr blake calling notice by friendly touch said goodness to charles dear miss watson brings family upon give leave to introduce brother emma curtsied gentleman bowed made hasty request for honour of hand in two next dance to a hasty affirmative be given be immediately impelled in opposite direction emma be very well pleased with circumstance there be quietly cheerful gentlemanlike air in mr howard suited in few minute afterwards value of engagement increased when a be sitting in card room somewhat screened by door heard lord osborne who be lounging on vacant table near call tom musgrave towards say why dance with beautiful emma watson want to dance with will come stand by be determined on very moment lord will be introduced dance with directly aye do if find doe not want much talking to may introduce by by very well lord if be like sister will only want to be listened to will go moment will find in tea room that stiff old mr edward have never done tea away went lord osborne after emma lost time in hurrying from corner exactly other way forgetting in haste that left mr edward behind have quite lost said mr edward who followed in le than five minute if prefer room to other there be reason why must not be here have better all be together emma be saved trouble of apologising by being joined at moment by tom musgrave who requesting mr edward aloud to do honour of presenting to miss emma watson left that good lady without choice in business that of testifying by coldness of manner that did unwillingly honour of dancing with be solicited without loss of time emma however might like to be thought beautiful girl by lord commoner be so little disposed to favour tom musgrave that have considerable satisfaction in avowing previous engagement be evidently surprised discomposed style of last partner have probably led to believe not overpowered with application little friend charles blake cried must not expect to engross whole evening can never suffer be against rule of assembly be sure will never be patronised by good friend here mr edward be by much too nice judge of decorum to give licence to dangerous particularity be not going to dance with master blake sir gentleman little disconcerted must only hope might be fortunate time seeming unwilling to leave though friend lord osborne be waiting in doorway for result a emma with amusement perceived began to make civil enquiry after family how come that have not pleasure of seeing sister here evening assembly have be used to be so well treated by that know how to take neglect eldest sister be only one at home must not leave father miss watson only one at home

stanton will now endeavour to make amends for past emma calm curtsey in reply must have struck a very unlike encouraging warmth have be used to receive from sister gave probably novel sensation of doubting own influence of wishing for more attention than bestowed dancing now recommenced miss carr being impatient to call everybody be required to stand up tom musgrave curiosity be appeased on seeing mr howard come forward claim emma hand will do a well for be lord osborne remark when friend carried news be continually at howard elbow during two dance frequency of appearance there be only unpleasant part of engagement only objection must make to mr howard in thought a agreeable a looked though chatting on commonest topic have sensible unaffected way of expressing made whatever said worth hearing only regretted that have not be able to make pupil manner a unexceptionable a own two dance seemed very short have partner authority for considering so at conclusion osborne train be on move be off at last said lordship to tom how much longer do stay in heavenly place till sunrise faith lord have have quite enough of assure will not show here again when have have honour of attending lady osborne to carriage will retreat in a much secrecy a possible to most remote corner of house where will order barrel of oyster be famously snug let see soon at castle bring word how look by daylight emma mr blake parted a old acquaintance charles shook by hand wished good bye at least dozen time from miss osborne miss carr received something like jerking curtsey a passed even lady osborne gave look of complacency lordship actually came back after others be out of room to beg pardon look in window seat behind for glove be visibly compressed in hand a tom musgrave be seen no more may suppose plan to have succeeded imagine mortifying with barrel of oyster in dreary solitude gladly assisting landlady in bar to make fresh negus for happy dancer above emma must not help missing
