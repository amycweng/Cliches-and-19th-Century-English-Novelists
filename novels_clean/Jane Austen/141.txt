least likely to happen brought up a must be always together like brother sister be morally impossible never knew instance of be in fact only sure way of providing against connexion suppose pretty girl seen by tom edmund for first time seven year hence dare say there must be mischief very idea of having be suffered to grow up at distance from in poverty neglect must be enough to make of dear sweet tempered boy in love with breed up with from time suppose even to have beauty of angel will never be more to than sister there be great deal of truth in what say replied sir thomas far be from to throw fanciful impediment in way of plan must be so consistent with relative situation of only meant to observe that ought not to be lightly engaged in that to make really serviceable to mr price

nanny cousin sir thomas longer made objection more respectable though le economical rendezvous being accordingly substituted everything be considered a settled pleasure of so benevolent scheme be already enjoyed division of gratifying sensation ought not in strict justice to have be equal for sir thomas be fully resolved to be real consistent patron of selected child mr norris have not least intention of being at expense whatever in maintenance a far a walking talking contriving reached be thoroughly benevolent nobody knew better how to dictate liberality to others love of money be equal to love of directing knew quite a well how to save own a to spend of friend having married on narrower income than have be used to look forward to have from first fancied very strict line of economy necessary what be begun a matter of prudence soon grew into matter of choice a object of needful solicitude there be child to supply have there be family to provide for mr norris might never have saved money having care of kind there be nothing to impede frugality lessen comfort of making yearly addition to income have never lived up to under infatuating principle counteracted by real affection for sister be impossible for to aim at more than credit of projecting arranging so expensive charity though perhaps might so little know a to walk home to parsonage after conversation in happy belief of being most liberal minded sister aunt in world when subject be brought forward again view be more fully explained in reply to lady bertrams calm inquiry of where will child come to first sister to to sir thomas heard with surprise that must be totally out of mr norris power to take share in personal charge of have be considering a particularly welcome addition at parsonage a desirable companion to aunt who have child of own found wholly mistaken mr norris be sorry to say that little girl staying with at least a thing then be be quite out of question poor mr norris indifferent state of health made impossibility must no more bear noise of child than must fly if indeed must ever get well of gouty complaint must be different matter must then be glad to take turn think nothing of inconvenience just now poor mr norris took up moment of time very mention of such thing be sure must distract then have better come to said lady bertram with utmost composure after short pause sir thomas added with dignity yes let home be in house will endeavour to do duty by will at least have advantage of companion of own age of regular instructress very true cried mr norris be very important consideration will be just same to miss lee whether have three girl to teach only twothere can be difference only wish must be more useful see do in power be not one of spare own trouble nanny will fetch however may put to inconvenience to have chief counsellor away for three day suppose sister will put child in little white attic near old nursery will be much best place for so near miss lee not far from girl close by housemaid who must of help to dress know take care of clothes for suppose must not think fair to expect elli to wait on a well a others indeed see that must possibly place anywhere else lady bertram made opposition hope will prove well disposed girl continued mr norris be sensible of uncommon good fortune in having such friend must disposition be really bad said sir thomas must not for own childrens sake continue in family there be reason to expect so great evil will probably see much to wish altered in must prepare for gross ignorance meanness of opinion very distressing vulgarity of manner be not incurable fault trust can be dangerous for associate have daughter be younger than must have considered introduction of such companion a matter of very serious moment a be hope there can be nothing to fear for everything to hope for from association be exactly what think cried mr norris what be saying to husband morning will be education for child said only being with cousin if miss lee taught nothing must learn to be good clever from hope will not tease poor pug said lady bertram have just got julia to leave alone there will be difficulty in way mr norris observed sir thomas a to distinction proper to be made between girl a grow up how to preserve in mind of daughter consciousness of what be without making think too lowly of cousin how without depressing spirit too far to make remember that be not miss bertram must wish to see very good friend must on account authorise in girl smallest degree of arrogance towards relation still can not be equal rank fortune right expectation will always be different be point of great delicacy must assist in endeavour to choose exactly right line of conduct mr norris be quite at service though perfectly agreed with a to being most difficult thing encouraged to hope that between must be easily managed will be readily believed that mr norris did not write to sister in vain mr price seemed rather surprised that girl must be fixed on when have so many fine boy accepted offer most thankfully assuring of daughter being very well disposed good humoured girl trusting must never have cause to throw off spoke of farther a somewhat delicate puny be sanguine in hope of being materially better for change of air poor woman probably thought change of air might agree with many of child

service must render fanny might a well have be spared for mr norris have not smallest intention of taking have never occurred to on present occasion a thing to be carefully avoided to prevent being expected have fixed on smallest habitation must rank a genteel among building of mansfield parish white house being only just large enough to receive herself servant allow spare room for friend of made very particular point spare room at parsonage have never be wanted absolute necessity of spare room for friend be now never forgotten not precaution however must save from being suspected of something better perhaps very display of importance of spare room might have misled sir thomas to suppose really intended for fanny lady bertram soon brought matter to certainty by carelessly observing to mr norris think sister need not keep miss lee longer when fanny go to live with mr norris almost started live with dear lady bertram what do mean be not to live with thought have settled with sir thomas never never spoke syllable about to sir thomas to fanny live with last thing in world for to think of for anybody to wish really know good heaven what must do with fanny poor helpless

often seen together even in london that manner particularly of eldest be very good have be much in london have more liveliness gallantry than edmund must therefore be preferred indeed being eldest be strong claim have felt early presentiment that must like eldest best knew be way tom bertram must have be thought pleasant indeed at rate be sort of young man to be generally liked agreeableness be of kind to be oftener found agreeable than endowment of higher stamp for have easy manner excellent spirit large acquaintance great deal to say reversion of mansfield park baronetcy did harm to miss

be le called on to speak opinion than fanny in quiet way very little attended to paid tribute of admiration to miss crawford beauty a still continued to think mr crawford very plain in spite of two cousin having repeatedly proved contrary never mentioned notice excited be to effect begin now to understand except miss price said miss crawford a be walking with mr bertrams pray be out be not be puzzled dined at parsonage with rest of seemed like being out yet say so little that can hardly suppose be edmund to whom be chiefly addressed replied believe know what mean will not undertake to answer question cousin be grown up have age sense of woman out not out be beyond yet in general nothing can be more easily ascertained distinction be so broad manner a well a appearance be generally speaking so totally different till now must not have supposed possible to be mistaken a to girl being out not girl not out have always same sort of dress close bonnet for instance look very demure never say word may smile be so assure except that be sometimes carried little too far be very proper girl must be quiet modest most objectionable part be that alteration of manner on being introduced into company be frequently too sudden sometimes pas in such very little time from reserve to quite oppositeto confidence be faulty part of present system one doe not like to see girl of eighteen nineteen so immediately up to thingand perhaps when one have seen hardly able to speak year before mr bertram dare say have sometimes met with such change believe have be hardly fair see what be at be quizzing miss anderson indeed miss anderson know who what mean be quite in dark will quiz with great deal of pleasure if will tell what about ah carry off very well can not be quite so far imposed on must have have miss anderson in eye in describing altered young lady paint too accurately for mistake be exactly so anderson of baker street be speaking of other day know edmund have heard mention charles anderson circumstance be precisely a lady have represented when anderson first introduced to family about two year ago sister be not out must not get to speak to sat there hour one morning waiting for anderson with only little girl two in room governess being sick run away mother in out moment with letter of business must hardly get word look from young ladynothing like civil answershe screwed up mouth turned from with air did not see again for twelvemonth be then out met at mr holfords did not recollect came up to claimed a acquaintance stared out of countenance talked laughed till did not know way to look felt must be jest of room at time miss crawford be plain have heard story very pretty story be with more truth in dare say than doe credit to miss anderson be too common fault mother certainly have not yet got quite right way of managing daughter know where error lie pretend to set people right do see that be often wrong who be showing world what female manner must be said mr bertram gallantly be doing great deal to set right error be plain enough said le courteous edmund such girl be ill brought up be given wrong notion from beginning be always acting upon motif of vanity there be more real modesty in behaviour before appear in public than afterwards know replied miss crawford hesitatingly yes can not agree with there be certainly modestest part of business be much worse to have girl not out give same air take same liberty a if be have seen done be worse than anythingquite disgusting yes be very inconvenient indeed said mr bertram lead one astray one doe not know what to do close bonnet demure air describe so well nothing be ever juster tell one be expected got into dreadful scrape last year from want of went down to ramsgate for week with friend last september just after return from west indie friend sneydyou have heard speak of sneyd edmundhis father mother sister be there all new to when reached albion place be out went after found on pier mr two miss sneyds with others of acquaintance made bow in form a mr sneyd be surrounded by men attached to one of daughter walked by side way home made a agreeable a must young lady perfectly easy in manner a ready to talk a to listen have not suspicion must be doing anything wrong looked just same well dressed with veil parasol like other girl afterwards found that have be giving attention to youngest who be not out have most excessively offended eldest miss augusta ought not to have be noticed for next six month miss sneyd believe have never forgiven that be bad indeed poor miss sneyd though have younger sister feel for to be neglected before one time must be very vexatious be entirely mother fault miss augusta must have be with governess such half half doings never prosper now must be satisfied about miss price doe go to ball doe dine out where a well a at sister replied edmund think have ever be to ball mother seldom go into company dines nowhere with mr grant fanny stay at home with oh then point be clear miss price be not out chapter vi mr bertram set off for miss crawford be prepared to find great chasm in society to miss decidedly in meeting be now becoming almost daily between family on dining together at park soon after going retook chosen place near bottom of table fully expecting to feel most melancholy difference in change of master must be very flat business be sure in comparison with brother edmund must have nothing to say soup must be sent round in most spiritless manner wine drank without smile agreeable trifling venison cut up without supplying one pleasant anecdote of former haunch single entertaining story about friend one must try to find amusement in what be passing at upper end of table in observing mr rushworth who be now making appearance at mansfield for first time since crawford arrival have be visiting friend in neighbouring county that friend having recently have ground laid out by improver mr rushworth be returned with head full of subject very eager to be improving own place in same way though not saying much to purpose must talk of nothing else subject have be already handled in drawing room be revived in dining parlour miss bertrams attention opinion be evidently chief aim though deportment showed rather conscious superiority than solicitude to oblige mention of sotherton court idea attached to gave feeling of complacency prevented from being very ungracious wish must see compton said be most complete thing never saw place so altered in life told smith did not know where be approach now be one of finest thing in country see house in most surprising manner declare when got back to sotherton yesterday looked like prisonquite dismal old prison oh for shame cried mr norris prison indeed sotherton court be noblest old place in world want improvement maam beyond anything never saw place wanted so much improvement in life be so forlorn that know what can be done with wonder that mr rushworth must think so at present said mr grant to mr norris with smile depend upon sotherton will have improvement in time heart can desire must try to do something with said mr rushworth know what hope will have good friend to help best friend upon occasion said miss bertram calmly must be mr repton imagine be what be thinking of a have done so well by smith think have better have at once term be five guinea day well if be ten cried mr norris be sure need not regard expense need not be impediment if be must not think of expense must have everything done in best style made a nice a possible such place a sotherton court deserves everything that taste money can do have space to work upon there ground will well reward for own part if have anything within fiftieth part of size of sotherton must be always planting improving for naturally be excessively fond of must be too ridiculous for to attempt anything where be now with little half acre must be quite burlesque if have more room must take prodigious delight in improving planting did vast deal in way at parsonage made quite different place from what be when first have young one remember much about perhaps if dear sir thomas be here must tell improvement made great deal more must have be done for poor mr norris sad state of health must hardly ever get out poor man to enjoy anything disheartened from doing several thing sir thomas used to talk of if have not be for must have carried on garden wall made plantation to shut out churchyard just a dr grant have done be always doing something a be be only spring twelvemonth before mr norris death that put in apricot against stable wall be now grown noble tree getting to such perfection sir addressing then to dr grant tree thrives well beyond doubt madam replied dr grant soil be good never pas without regretting that fruit must be so little worth trouble of gathering sir be moor park bought a moor park cost usthat be be present from sir thomas saw billand know cost seven shilling be charged a moor park be imposed on maam replied dr grant potato have a much flavour of moor park apricot a fruit from tree be insipid fruit at best good apricot be eatable none from garden be truth be maam said mr grant pretending to whisper across table to mr norris that dr grant hardly know what natural taste of apricot be be scarcely ever indulged with one for be so valuable fruit with little assistance be such remarkably large fair sort that what with early tart preserve cook contrives to get mr norris who have begun to redden be appeased for little while other subject took place of improvement of sotherton dr grant mr norris be seldom good friend acquaintance have begun in dilapidation habit be totally dissimilar after short interruption mr rushworth began again smith place be admiration of country be mere nothing before repton took in hand think will have repton mr rushworth said lady bertram if be must have very pretty shrubbery one like to get out into shrubbery in fine weather mr rushworth be eager to assure ladyship of acquiescence tried to make out something complimentary between submission to taste having always intended same with superadded object of professing attention to comfort of lady in general of insinuating that there be one only whom be anxious to please grew puzzled edmund be glad to put end to speech by proposal of wine mr rushworth however though not usually great talker have still more to say on subject next heart smith have not much above hundred acre altogether in ground be little enough make more surprising that place can have be so improved now at sotherton have good seven hundred without reckoning water meadow so that think if so much must be done at compton need not despair there have be two three fine old tree cut down grew too near house open prospect amazingly make think that repton anybody of sort must certainly have avenue at sotherton down avenue lead from west front to top of hill know turning to miss bertram particularly a spoke miss bertram thought most becoming to reply avenue oh recollect really know very little of sotherton fanny who be sitting on other side of edmund exactly opposite miss crawford who have be attentively listening now looked at said in low voice cut down avenue what pity doe not make think of cowper ye fallen avenue once more mourn fate unmerited smiled a answered be afraid avenue stand bad chance fanny must like to see sotherton before be cut down to see place a be now in old state suppose will have never be there never can unluckily be out of distance for ride wish must contrive oh doe not signify whenever do see will tell how have be altered collect said miss crawford that sotherton be old place place of grandeur in particular style of building house be built in elizabeth time be large regular brick building heavy respectable looking have many good room be ill placed stand in one of lowest spot of park in respect unfavourable for improvement wood be fine there be stream dare say might be made good deal of mr rushworth be quite right think in meaning to give modern dress have doubt that will be done extremely well miss crawford listened with submission said to herself be well bred man make best of wish to influence mr rushworth continued have place to new fashion must not put into hand of improver must rather have inferior degree of beauty of own choice acquired progressively must rather abide by own blunder than by must know what be about of course must not suit have eye ingenuity for such matter a be before have place of own in country must be most thankful to mr repton who must undertake give a much beauty a must for money must never look at till be complete must be delightful to to see progress of said fanny ay have be brought up to be part of education only dose ever have being administered by not first favourite in world have made consider improvement in hand a greatest of nuisance three year ago admiral honoured uncle bought cottage at twickenham for to spend summer in aunt went down to quite in rapture being excessively pretty be soon found necessary to be improved for three month be dirt confusion without gravel walk to step on bench fit for use must have everything a complete a possible in country shrubbery flower garden rustic seat innumerable must all be done without care henry be different love to be doing edmund be sorry to hear miss crawford whom be much disposed to admire speak so freely of uncle did not suit sense of propriety be silenced till induced by further smile liveliness to put matter by for present mr bertram said have tidings of harp at last be assured that be safe at northampton there have probably be ten day in spite of solemn assurance have so often received to contrary edmund expressed pleasure surprise truth be that inquiry be too direct sent servant went will not do seventy mile from london morning heard of in right way

horse cart be astonished to find what piece of work be made of to want horse cart in country seemed impossible so told maid to speak for one directly a can not look out of dressing closet without seeing one farmyard walk in shrubbery without passing thought must be only ask have be rather grieved must not give advantage to guess surprise when found have be asking most unreasonable most impossible thing in world have offended farmer labourer hay in parish a for dr grant bailiff believe have better keep out of way brother in law who be kindness in general looked rather black upon when found what have be at must not be expected to have thought on subject before when do think of must see importance of getting in grass hire of cart at time might not be so easy a suppose farmer be not in habit of letting out in harvest must be quite out of power to spare horse will understand way in time coming down with true london maxim that everything be to be got with money be little embarrassed at first by sturdy independence of country custom however be to have harp fetched to morrow henry who be good nature have offered to fetch in barouche will not be honourably conveyed edmund spoke of harp a favourite instrument hoped to be soon allowed to hear fanny have never heard harp at wished for very much will be most happy to play to said miss crawford at least a long a can like to listen probably much longer for dearly love music where natural taste be equal player must always be best off for be gratified in more way than one now mr bertram if write to brother entreat to tell that harp be come heard so much of misery about may say if please that will prepare most plaintive air against return in compassion to feeling a know horse will lose if write will say wish at

in extent be mere nothing must be surprised at insignificance a for improvement there be very little for to dotoo little must like to have be busy much longer be fond of sort of thing said julia excessively what with natural advantage of ground pointed out even to very young eye what little remained to be done own consequent resolution have not be of age three month before everingham be that be now plan be laid at westminster little altered perhaps at cambridge at one twenty executed be inclined to envy mr rushworth for having so much happiness yet before have be devourer of own who see quickly will resolve quickly act quickly said julia can never want employment instead of envying mr rushworth must assist with opinion mr grant hearing latter part of speech enforced warmly persuaded that judgment must be equal to brother a miss bertram caught at idea likewise gave full support declaring that in opinion be infinitely better to consult with friend disinterested adviser than immediately to throw business into hand of professional man mr rushworth be very ready to request favour of mr crawford assistance mr crawford after properly depreciating own ability be quite at service in way must be useful mr rushworth then began to propose mr crawford doing honour of coming over to sotherton taking bed there when mr norris a if reading in two niece mind little approbation of plan be to take mr crawford away interposed with amendment there can be doubt of mr crawford willingness why must not more of go why must not make little party here be many must be interested in

thinking time on subject how did like yesterday very wellvery much like to hear talk entertains be so extremely pretty have great pleasure in looking at be countenance be so attractive have wonderful play of feature be there nothing in conversation that struck fanny a not quite right oh yes ought not to have spoken of uncle a did be quite astonished uncle with whom have be living so many year who whatever fault may be be so very fond of brother treating say quite like son must not have believed thought must be struck be very wrong very indecorous very ungrateful think ungrateful be strong word know that uncle have claim to gratitude wife certainly have be warmth of respect for aunt memory misleads here be awkwardly circumstanced with such warm feeling lively spirit must be difficult to do justice to affection for mr crawford without throwing shade on admiral pretend to know be most to blame in disagreement though admiral present conduct might incline one to side of wife be natural amiable that miss crawford must acquit aunt entirely censure opinion there certainly be impropriety in making public think said fanny after little consideration that impropriety be reflection upon mr crawford a niece have be entirely brought up by can not have given right notion of what be due to admiral be fair remark yes must suppose fault of niece to have be of aunt make one more sensible of disadvantage have be under think present home must do good mr grant manner be just what ought to be speaks of brother with very pleasing affection yes except a to writing such short letter made almost laugh can not rate so very highly love good nature of brother who will not give trouble of writing anything worth reading to sister when be separated be sure william must never have used so under circumstance what right have to suppose that must not write long letter when be absent right of lively mind fanny seizing may contribute to own amusement that of others perfectly allowable when untinctured by ill humour roughness there be not shadow of in countenance manner of miss crawford nothing sharp loud coarse be perfectly feminine except in instance have be speaking of there can not be justified be glad saw a did having formed mind gained affection have good chance of thinking like though at period on subject there began now to be danger of dissimilarity for be in line of admiration of miss crawford might lead where fanny must not follow miss crawford attraction did not lessen harp arrived rather added to beauty wit good humour for played with greatest obligingness with expression taste be peculiarly becoming there be something clever to be said at close of air edmund be at parsonage day to be indulged with favourite instrument one morning secured invitation for next for lady must not be unwilling to have listener thing be soon in fair train young woman pretty lively with harp a elegant a herself placed near window cut down to ground opening on little lawn surrounded by shrub in rich foliage of summer be enough to catch man heart season scene air be favourable to tenderness sentiment mr grant tambour frame be not without use be in harmony a everything will turn to account when love be once set going even sandwich tray dr grant doing honour of be worth looking at without studying business however knowing what be about edmund be beginning at end of week of such intercourse to be good deal in love to credit of lady may be added that without being man of world elder brother without of art of flattery gaiety of small talk began to be agreeable to felt to be so though have not foreseen must hardly understand for be not pleasant by common rule talked nonsense paid compliment opinion be unbending attention tranquil simple there be charm perhaps in sincerity steadiness integrity miss crawford might be equal to feel though not equal to discus with did not think very much about however pleased for present liked to have near be enough fanny must not wonder that edmund be at parsonage morning must gladly have be there too might have gone in uninvited unnoticed to hear harp neither must wonder that when evening stroll be over two family parted again must think right to attend mr grant sister to home while mr crawford be devoted to lady of park thought very bad exchange if edmund be not there to mix wine water for must rather go without than not be little surprised that must spend so many hour with miss crawford not see more of sort of fault have already observed of be almost always reminded by something of same nature whenever be in company so be edmund be fond of speaking to of miss crawford seemed to think enough that admiral have since be spared scrupled to point out own remark to lest must appear like ill nature first actual pain miss crawford occasioned be consequence of inclination to learn to ride former caught soon after being settled at mansfield from example of young lady at park when edmunds acquaintance with increased led to encouraging wish offer of own quiet mare for purpose of first attempt a best fitted for beginner that stable must furnish pain injury however be designed by to cousin in offer be not to lose day exercise by mare be only to be taken down to parsonage hour before ride be to begin fanny on being first proposed so far from feeling slighted be almost over powered with gratitude that must be asking leave for miss crawford made first essay with great credit to herself inconvenience to fanny edmund who have taken down mare presided at whole returned with in excellent time before fanny steady old coachman who always attended when rode without cousin be ready to set forward second day trial be not so guiltless miss crawford enjoyment of riding be such that did not know how to leave off active fearless though rather small strongly made seemed formed for horsewoman to pure genuine pleasure of exercise something be probably added in edmunds attendance instruction something more in conviction of very much surpassing sex in general by early progress to make unwilling to dismount fanny be ready waiting mr norris be beginning to scold for not being gone still horse be announced edmund appeared to avoid aunt look for went out house though scarcely mile apart be not within sight of other by walking fifty yard from hall door must look down park command view of parsonage demesne gently rising beyond village road in dr grant meadow immediately saw groupedmund miss crawford on horse back riding side by side dr mr grant mr crawford with two three groom standing about looking on happy party appeared to interested in one object cheerful beyond doubt for sound of merriment ascended even to be sound did not make cheerful wondered that edmund must forget felt pang must not turn eye from meadow must not help watching passed at first miss crawford companion made circuit of field be not small at foot pace then at apparent suggestion rose into canter to fanny timid nature be most astonishing to see how well sat after few minute stopped entirely edmund be close to be speaking to be evidently directing management of bridle have hold of hand saw imagination supplied what eye must not reach must not wonder at what must be more natural than edmund must be making useful proving good nature by one must not think indeed that mr crawford might a well have saved trouble that must have be particularly proper becoming in brother to have done mr crawford with boasted good nature coachmanship probably knew nothing of matter have active kindness in comparison of edmund began to think rather hard upon mare to have such double duty if be forgotten poor mare must be remembered feeling for one other be soon little tranquillised by seeing party in meadow disperse miss crawford still on horseback attended by edmund on foot pas through gate into lane so into park make towards spot where stood began then to be afraid of appearing rude impatient walked to meet with great anxiety to avoid suspicion dear miss price said miss crawford a soon a be at within hearing be come to make own apology for keeping waiting have nothing in world to say for myselfi knew be very late be behaving extremely ill therefore if please must forgive selfishness must always be forgiven know because there be hope of cure fanny answer be extremely civil edmund added conviction that must be in hurry for there be more than time enough for cousin to ride twice a far a ever go said have be promoting comfort by preventing from setting off hour sooner cloud be now coming up will not suffer from heat a must have done then wish may not be fatigued by so much exercise wish have saved walk home part of fatigue getting off horse assure said a sprang down with help be very strong nothing ever fatigue doing what like miss price give way to with very bad grace sincerely hope will have pleasant ride may have nothing good to hear of dear delightful beautiful animal old coachman who have be waiting about with own horse now joining fanny be lifted on hers set off across part of park feeling of discomfort not lightened by seeing a looked back that others be walking down hill together to village did attendant do much good by comment on miss crawford great cleverness a horse woman have be watching with interest almost equal to own be pleasure to see lady with good heart for riding said never see one sit horse better did not seem to have thought of fear very different from miss when first began six year ago come next easter lord bless how did tremble when sir thomas first have put on in drawing room miss crawford be also celebrated merit in being gifted by nature with strength courage be fully appreciated by miss bertrams delight in riding be like own early excellence in be like own have great pleasure in praising be sure must ride well said julia have make for figure be a neat a brother yes added maria spirit be a good have same energy of character can not think that good horsemanship have great deal to do with mind when parted at night edmund asked fanny whether meant to ride next day knownot if want mare be answer want at for myself said whenever be next inclined to stay at home think miss crawford must be glad to have longer timefor whole morning in short have great desire to get a far a mansfield common mr grant have be telling of fine view have doubt of being perfectly equal to morning will do for must be extremely sorry to interfere with must be very wrong if did ride only for pleasure for health will not ride to morrow certainly said fanny have be out very often lately must rather stay at home know be strong enough now to walk very well edmund looked pleased must be fanny comfort ride to mansfield common took place next morning party included young people be much enjoyed at time doubly enjoyed again in evening discussion successful scheme of sort generally brings on having be to mansfield common disposed for going somewhere else day after there be many other view to be shewn though weather be hot there be shady lane wherever wanted to go young party be always provided with shady lane four fine morning successively be spent in manner in shewing crawford country doing honour of finest spot everything answered be gaiety good humour heat only supplying inconvenience enough to be talked of with pleasuretill fourth day when happiness of one of party be exceedingly clouded miss bertram be one edmund julia be invited to dine at parsonage be excluded be meant done by mr grant with perfect good humour on mr rushworths account who be partly expected at park that day be felt a very grievous injury good manner be severely taxed to conceal vexation anger till reached home a mr rushworth did not come injury be increased have not even relief of shewing power over must only be sullen to mother aunt cousin throw a great gloom a possible over dinner dessert between ten eleven edmund julia walked into drawing room fresh with evening air glowing cheerful very reverse of what found in three lady sitting there for maria must scarcely raise eye from book lady bertram be half asleep even mr norris discomposed by niece ill humour having asked one two question about dinner be not immediately attended to seemed almost determined to say more for few minute brother sister be too eager in praise of night remark on star to think beyond when first pause came edmund looking around said where be fanny be gone to bed not that know of replied mr norris be here moment ago own gentle voice speaking from other end of room be very long one told that be on sofa mr norris began scolding be very foolish trick fanny to be idling away evening upon sofa why can not come sit here employ a do if have work of own can supply from poor basket there be new calico be bought last week not touched yet be sure almost broke back by cutting out must learn to think of other people take word for be shocking trick for young person to be always lolling upon sofa before be said fanny be returned to seat at table have taken up work again julia who be in high good humour from pleasure of day did justice of exclaiming must say maam that fanny be a little upon sofa a anybody in house fanny said edmund after looking at attentively be sure have headache must not deny said be not very bad can hardly believe replied know look too well how long have have since little before dinner be nothing heat did go out in heat go out to be sure did said mr norris must have stay within fine day a be not all out even mother be out to day for above hour yes indeed edmund added ladyship who have be thoroughly awakened by mr norris sharp reprimand to fanny be out above hour sat three quarter of hour in flower garden while fanny cut rose very pleasant be assure very hot be shady enough in alcove declare quite dreaded coming home again fanny have be cutting rose have yes be afraid will be last year poor thing found hot enough be so full blown one must not wait there be help for certainly rejoined mr norris in rather softened voice question whether headache might not be caught then sister there be nothing so likely to give a standing stooping in hot sun dare say will be well to morrow suppose let have aromatic vinegar always forget to have mine filled have got said lady bertram have have ever since came back from house second time what cried edmund have be walking a well a cutting rose walking across hot park to house doing twice maam wonder head ache mr norris be talking to julia did not hear be afraid must be too much for said lady bertram when rose be gathered aunt wished to have then know must be taken home be there rose enough to oblige to go twice be to be put into spare room to dry unluckily fanny forgot to lock door of room bring away key so be obliged to go again edmund got up walked about room saying must nobody be employed on errand fanny upon word maam have be very ill managed business be sure know how be to have be done better cried mr norris unable to be longer deaf unless have gone indeed can not be in two place at once be talking to mr green at very time about mother dairymaid by desire have promised john groom to write to mr jefferies about son poor fellow be waiting for hour think nobody can justly accuse of sparing upon occasion really can not do everything at once a for fanny just stepping down to house for meit be not much above quarter of milei can not think be unreasonable to ask how often do pace three time day early late ay in weather too say nothing about wish fanny have strength maam if fanny must be more regular in exercise must not be knocked up so soon have not be out on horseback now long while be persuaded that when doe not ride ought to walk if have be riding before must not have asked of thought must rather do good after being stooping among rose for there be nothing so refreshing a walk after fatigue of kind though sun be strong be not so very hot between edmund nodding significantly at mother be cutting rose dawdling about in flower garden did mischief be afraid be indeed said more candid lady bertram who have overheard be very much afraid caught headache there for heat be enough to kill anybody be a much a must bear sitting calling to pug trying to keep from flower bed be almost too much for edmund said more to lady going quietly to table on supper tray yet remained brought glass of madeira to fanny obliged to drink greater part wished to be able to decline tear variety of feeling created made easier to swallow than to speak vexed a edmund be with mother aunt be still more angry with own forgetfulness of be worse than anything have done nothing of must have happened have be properly considered have be left four day together without choice of companion exercise without excuse for avoiding unreasonable aunt might require be ashamed to think that for four day together have not have power of riding very seriously resolved however unwilling must be to check pleasure of miss crawford that must never happen again fanny went to bed with heart a full a on first evening of arrival at park state of spirit have probably have share in indisposition for have be feeling neglected be struggling against discontent envy for day past a leant on sofa to have retreated that might not be seen pain of mind have be much beyond in head sudden change edmunds kindness have then occasioned made hardly know how to support chapter viii fanny ride recommenced very next day a be pleasant fresh feeling morning le hot than weather have lately be edmund trusted that loss of health pleasure must be soon made good while be gone mr rushworth arrived escorting mother who came to be civil to shew civility especially in urging execution of plan for visiting sotherton have be started fortnight before in consequence of subsequent absence from home have since lain dormant mr norris niece be well pleased with revival early day be named agreed to provided mr crawford must be disengaged young lady did not forget stipulation though mr norris must willingly have answered for being so must neither authorise liberty run risk at last on hint from miss bertram mr rushworth discovered that properest thing to be done be for to walk down to parsonage directly call on mr crawford inquire whether wednesday must suit not before return mr grant miss crawford came in having be out time taken different route to house have not met comfortable hope however be given that must find mr crawford at home sotherton scheme be mentioned of course be hardly possible indeed that anything else must be talked of for mr norris be in high spirit about mr rushworth well meaning civil prosing pompous woman who thought nothing of consequence a related to own son concern have not yet given over pressing lady bertram to be of party lady bertram constantly declined placid manner of refusal made mr rushworth still think wished to come till mr norris more numerous word louder tone convinced of truth fatigue must be too much for sister great deal too much assure dear mr rushworth ten mile there ten back know must excuse sister on occasion accept of two dear girl without sotherton be only place must give wish to go so far can not be indeed will have companion in fanny price know so will all do very well a for edmund a be not here to speak for will answer for being most happy to join party can go on horseback know mr rushworth being obliged to yield to lady bertrams staying at home must only be sorry loss of ladyship company must be great drawback must have be extremely happy to have seen young lady too miss price who have never be at sotherton yet be pity must not see place be very kind be kindness dear madam cried mr norris a to fanny will have opportunity in plenty of seeing sotherton have time enough before going now be quite out of question lady bertram must not possibly spare oh can not do without fanny mr rushworth proceeded next under conviction that everybody must be wanting to see sotherton to include miss crawford in invitation though mr grant who have not be at trouble of visiting mr rushworth on coming into neighbourhood civilly declined on own account be glad to secure pleasure for sister mary properly pressed persuaded be not long in accepting share of civility mr rushworth came back from parsonage successful edmund made appearance just in time to learn what have be settled for wednesday to attend mr rushworth to carriage walk half way down park with two other lady on return to breakfast room found mr norris trying to make up mind a to whether miss crawford being of party be desirable not whether brother barouche must not be full without miss bertrams laughed at idea assuring that barouche must hold four perfectly well independent of box on one might go with why be necessary said edmund that crawford carriage only must be employed why be use to be made of mother chaise must not when scheme be first mentioned other day understand why visit from family be not to be made in carriage of family what cried julia go boxed up three in postchaise in weather when may have seat in barouche dear edmund will not quite do besides said maria know that mr crawford depends upon taking after what passed at first must claim a promise dear edmund added mr norris taking out two carriage when one will do must be trouble for nothing between ourselves coachman be not very fond of road between sotherton always complains bitterly of narrow lane scratching carriage know one must not like to have dear sir thomas when come home find varnish scratched off must not be very handsome reason for using mr crawford said maria truth be that wilcox be stupid old fellow doe not know how to drive will answer for that will find inconvenience from narrow road on wednesday there be hardship suppose nothing unpleasant said edmund in going on barouche box unpleasant cried maria oh dear believe must be generally thought favourite seat there can be comparison a to one view of country probably miss crawford will choose barouche box there can be objection then to fanny going with there can be doubt of having room for fanny repeated mr norris dear edmund there be idea of going with stay with aunt told mr rushworth so be not expected can have reason imagine madam said addressing mother for wishing fanny not to be of party a relates to yourself to own comfort if must do without must not wish to keep at home to be sure not can not do without can if stay at home with a mean to do there be general cry out at yes continued there be necessity for going mean to stay at home fanny have great desire to see sotherton know wish very much have not often gratification of kind be sure maam must be glad to give pleasure now oh yes very glad if aunt see objection mr norris be very ready with only objection must remaintheir having positively assured mr rushworth that fanny must not go very strange appearance there must consequently be in taking seemed to difficulty quite impossible to be got over must have strangest appearance must be something so very unceremonious so bordering on disrespect for mr rushworth whose own manner be such pattern of good breeding attention that really did not feel equal to mr norris have affection for fanny wish of procuring pleasure at time opposition to edmund now arose more from partiality for own scheme because be own than from anything else felt that have arranged everything extremely well that alteration must be for worse when edmund therefore told in reply a did when must give hearing that need not distress on mr rushworths account because have taken opportunity a walked with through hall of mentioning miss price a one who must probably be of party have directly received very sufficient invitation for cousin mr norris be too much vexed to submit with very good grace must only say very well very well just a chuse settle own way be sure care about seems very odd said maria that must be staying at home instead of fanny be sure ought to be very much obliged to added julia hastily leaving room a spoke from consciousness that ought to offer to stay at home fanny will feel quite a grateful a occasion requires be edmunds only reply subject dropt fanny gratitude when heard plan be in fact much greater than pleasure felt edmunds kindness with more than sensibility unsuspicious of fond attachment must be aware of that must forego enjoyment on account gave pain own satisfaction in seeing sotherton must be nothing without next meeting of two mansfield family produced alteration in plan one be admitted with general approbation mr grant offered a companion for day to lady bertram in lieu of son dr grant be to join at dinner lady bertram be very well pleased to have so young lady be in spirit again even edmund be very thankful for arrangement restored to share of party mr norris thought excellent plan have at tongue end be on point of proposing when mr grant spoke wednesday be fine soon after breakfast barouche arrived mr crawford driving sister a everybody be ready there be nothing to be done for mr grant to alight others to take place place of place envied seat post of honour be unappropriated to whose happy lot be to fall while of miss bertrams be meditating how best with most appearance of obliging others to secure matter be settled by mr grant saying a stepped from carriage a there be five of will be better that one must sit with henry a be saying lately that wished must drive julia think will be good opportunity for to take lesson happy julia unhappy maria former be on barouche box in moment latter took seat within in gloom mortification carriage drove off amid good wish of two remaining lady barking of pug in mistress arm road be through pleasant country fanny whose ride have never be extensive be soon beyond knowledge be very happy in observing be new admiring be pretty be not often invited to join in conversation of others did desire own thought reflection be habitually best companion in observing appearance of country bearing of road difference of soil state of harvest cottage cattle child found entertainment must only have be heightened by having edmund to speak to of what felt be only point of resemblance between lady who sat by in everything value for edmund miss crawford be very unlike have none of fanny delicacy of taste of mind of feeling saw nature inanimate nature with little observation attention be for men woman talent for light lively in looking back after edmund however when there be stretch of road behind when gained on in ascending considerable hill be united there be broke at same moment from more than once for first seven mile miss bertram have very little real comfort prospect always ended in mr crawford sister sitting side by side full of conversation merriment to see only expressive profile a turned with smile to julia to catch laugh of other be perpetual source of irritation own sense of propriety must just smooth over when julia looked back be with countenance of delight whenever spoke to be in highest spirit view of country be charming wished must see etc only offer of exchange be addressed to miss crawford a gained summit of long hill be not more inviting than here be fine burst of country wish have seat dare say will not take let press ever so much miss crawford must hardly answer before be moving again at good pace when came within influence of sotherton association be better for miss bertram who might be said to have two string to bow have rushworth feeling crawford feeling in vicinity of sotherton former have considerable effect mr rushworths consequence be hers must not tell miss crawford that wood belonged to sotherton must not carelessly observe that believed that be now mr rushworths property on side of road without elation of heart be pleasure to increase with approach to capital freehold mansion ancient manorial residence of family with right of court leet court baron now will have more rough road miss crawford difficulty be over rest of way be such a ought to be mr rushworth have made since succeeded to estate here begin village cottage be really disgrace church spire be reckoned remarkably handsome be church be not so close to great house a often happens in old place annoyance of bell must be terrible there be parsonage tidy looking house understand clergyman wife be very decent people be almshouses built by of family to right be steward house be very respectable man now be coming to lodge gate have nearly mile through park still be not ugly see at end there be fine timber situation of house be dreadful go down hill to for mile be pity for must not be ill looking place if have better approach miss crawford be not slow to admire pretty well guessed miss bertrams feeling made point of honour to promote enjoyment to utmost mr norris be delight volubility even fanny have something to say in admiration might be heard with complacency eye be eagerly taking in everything within reach after being at pain to get view of house observing that be sort of building must not look at with respect added now where be avenue house front east perceive avenue therefore must be at back of mr rushworth talked of west front yes be exactly behind house begin at little distance ascends for mile to extremity of ground may see something of heresomething of more distant tree be oak entirely miss bertram must now speak with decided information of what have known nothing about when mr rushworth have asked opinion spirit be in a happy flutter a vanity pride must furnish when drove up to spacious stone step before principal entrance chapter ix mr rushworth be at door to receive fair lady whole party be welcomed by with due attention in drawing room be met with equal cordiality by mother miss bertram have distinction with that must wish after business of arriving be over be first necessary to eat door be thrown open to admit through one two intermediate room into appointed dining parlour where collation be prepared with abundance elegance much be said much be ate went well particular object of day be then considered how must mr crawford like in what manner must chuse to take survey of ground mr rushworth mentioned curricle mr crawford suggested greater desirableness of carriage might convey more than two to be depriving of advantage of other eye other judgment might be evil even beyond loss of present pleasure mr rushworth proposed that chaise must be taken also be scarcely received a amendment young lady smiled spoke next proposition of shewing house to such of a have not be there before be more acceptable for miss bertram be pleased to have size displayed be glad to be doing something whole party rose accordingly under mr rushworths guidance be shewn through number of room lofty many large amply furnished in taste of fifty year back with shining floor solid mahogany rich damask marble gilding carving handsome in way of picture there be abundance few good larger part be family portrait no longer anything to anybody mr rushworth who have be at great pain to learn that housekeeper must teach be now almost equally well qualified to shew house on present occasion addressed chiefly to miss crawford fanny there be comparison in willingness of attention for miss crawford who have seen score of great house cared for none of have only appearance of civilly listening while fanny to whom everything be almost a interesting a be new attended with unaffected earnestness to mr rushworth must relate of family in former time rise grandeur regal visit loyal effort delighted to connect anything with history already known warm imagination with scene of past situation of house excluded possibility of much prospect from of room while fanny of others be attending mr rushworth henry crawford be looking grave shaking head at window room on west front looked across lawn to beginning of avenue immediately beyond tall iron palisade gate having visited many more room than must be supposed to be of other use than to contribute to window tax find employment for housemaid now said mr rushworth be coming to chapel properly ought to enter from above look down upon a be quite among friend will take in way if will excuse entered fanny imagination have prepared for something grander than mere spacious oblong room fitted up for purpose of devotion with nothing more striking more solemn than profusion of mahogany crimson velvet cushion appearing over ledge of family gallery above be disappointed said in low voice to edmund be not idea of chapel there be nothing awful here nothing melancholy nothing grand here be aisle arch inscription banner banner cousin to be blown by night wind of heaven sign that scottish monarch sleep below forget fanny how lately have be built for how confined purpose compared with old chapel of castle monastery be only for private use of family have be buried suppose in parish church there must look for banner achievement be foolish of not to think of be disappointed mr rushworth began relation chapel be fitted up a see in james second time before period a understand pew be only wainscot there be reason to think that lining cushion of pulpit family seat be only purple cloth be not quite certain be handsome chapel be formerly in constant use morning evening prayer be always read in by domestic chaplain within memory of many late mr rushworth left off generation have improvement said miss crawford with smile to edmund mr rushworth be gone to repeat lesson to mr crawford edmund fanny miss crawford remained in cluster together be pity cried fanny that custom must have be discontinued be valuable part of former time there be something in chapel chaplain so much in character with great house with one idea of what household must be whole family assembling regularly for purpose of prayer be fine very fine indeed said miss crawford laughing must do head of family great deal of good to force poor housemaid footman to leave business pleasure say prayer here twice day while be inventing excuse for staying away be hardly fanny idea of family assembling said edmund if master mistress attend there must be more harm than good in custom at rate be safer to leave people to own device on such subject everybody like to go own wayto chuse own time manner of devotion obligation of attendance formality restraint length of timealtogether be formidable thing what nobody like if good people who used to kneel gape in gallery must have foreseen that time must ever come when men woman might lie ten minute in bed when woke with headache without danger of reprobation because chapel be missed must have jumped with joy envy can not imagine with what unwilling feeling former belle of house of rushworth did many time repair to chapel young mr eleanors mr bridgetsstarched up into seeming piety with head full of something very differentespecially if poor chaplain be not worth looking atand in day fancy parson be very inferior even to what be now for few moment be unanswered fanny coloured looked at edmund felt too angry for speech needed little recollection before must say lively mind can hardly be serious even on serious subject have given amusing sketch human nature can not say be not so must feel at time difficulty of fixing thought a must wish if be supposing frequent thing be to say weakness grown into habit from neglect what must be expected from private devotion of such person do think mind be suffered be indulged in wandering in chapel must be more collected in closet yes very likely must have two chance at least in favour there must be le to distract attention from without must not be tried so long mind doe not struggle against under one circumstance must find object to distract in other believe influence of place of example may often rouse better feeling than be begun with greater length of service however admit to be sometimes too hard stretch upon mind one wish be not so have not yet left oxford long enough to forget what chapel prayer be while be passing rest of party being scattered about chapel julia called mr crawford attention to sister by saying do look at mr rushworth maria standing side by side

parish neighbourhood where parish neighbourhood be of size capable of knowing private character observing general conduct in london can rarely be case clergy be lost there in crowd of parishioner be known to largest part only a preacher with regard to influencing public manner miss crawford must not misunderstand suppose mean to call arbiter of good breeding regulator of refinement courtesy

one eye one attention hearing what one doe not understand admiring what one doe not care for be generally allowed to be greatest bore in world miss price have found so though did not know will soon be rested said fanny to sit in shade on fine day look upon verdure be most perfect refreshment after sitting little while miss crawford be up again must move said resting fatigue have looked across have have till be weary must go look through iron gate at same view without being able to see so well edmund left seat likewise now miss crawford if will look up walk will convince that can not be mile long half mile be immense distance said see that with glance still reasoned with in vain must not calculate must not compare must only smile assert greatest degree of rational consistency must not have be more engaging talked with mutual satisfaction at last be agreed that must endeavour to determine dimension of wood by walking little more about must go to one end of in line be then infor there be straight green walk along bottom by side of have haand perhaps turn little way in other direction if seemed likely to assist be back in few minute fanny said be rested must have moved too be not suffered edmund urged remaining where be with earnestness must not resist be left on bench to think with pleasure of cousin care with great regret that be not stronger watched till have turned corner listened till sound of have ceased chapter x quarter of hour twenty minute passed away fanny be still thinking of edmund miss crawford without interruption from one began to be surprised at being left so long to listen with anxious desire of hearing step voice again listened at length heard heard voice foot approaching have just satisfied that be not wanted when miss bertram mr rushworth mr crawford issued from same path have trod be before miss price alone dear fanny how come be first salutation told story poor dear fanny cried cousin how ill have be used by have better have staid

generally speaking whatever proposed be immediately approved first by then by mr rushworth whose principal business seemed to be to hear others who scarcely risked original thought of own beyond wish that have seen friend smith place after minute spent in way miss bertram observing iron gate expressed wish of passing through into park that view plan might be more comprehensive be very thing of others to be wished be best be only way of proceeding with advantage in henry crawford opinion directly saw knoll not mile off must give exactly requisite command of house go therefore must to knoll through gate gate be locked mr rushworth wished have brought key have be very near thinking whether must not bring key be determined must never come without key again still did not remove present evil

more complete in style though style may not be best to tell truth speaking rather lower think that will ever see sotherton again with so much pleasure a do now summer will hardly improve to after moment embarrassment lady replied be too much man of world not to see with eye of world if other people think sotherton improved have doubt that will be afraid be not quite so much man of world a might be good for in point feeling be not quite so evanescent memory of past under such easy dominion a one find to be case with men of world be followed by short silence miss bertram began again seemed to enjoy drive here very much morning be glad to see so well entertained julia be laughing whole way be yes believe be have not least recollection at what oh believe be relating to ridiculous story of old irish groom of uncle sister love to laugh think more light hearted than be more easily amused replied consequently know smiling better company must not have hoped to entertain with irish

grove of oak on knoll fanny feeling to be wrong must not help making effort to prevent will hurt miss bertram cried will certainly hurt against spike will tear gown will be in danger of slipping into have have have better not go cousin be safe on other side while word be spoken smiling with good humour of success said thank dear fanny gown be alive well so good bye fanny be again left to solitude with increase of pleasant feeling for be sorry for almost that have seen heard astonished at miss bertram angry with mr crawford by taking circuitous a appeared to very unreasonable direction to knoll be soon beyond eye for minute longer remained without sight sound of companion seemed to have little wood to herself must almost have thought that edmund miss crawford have left that be impossible for edmund to forget so entirely be again roused from disagreeable musing by sudden footstep somebody be coming at quick pace down principal walk expected mr rushworth be julia who hot out of breath with look of disappointment cried out on seeing heyday where be others thought maria mr crawford be with fanny explained pretty trick upon word can not see anywhere looking eagerly into park can not be very far off think be equal to a much a maria even without help julia mr rushworth will be here in moment with key do wait for mr rushworth not indeed have have enough of family for one morning why child have moment escaped from horrible mother penance a have be enduring while be sitting here so composed so happy might have be a well perhaps if have be in place always contrive to keep out of scrape be most unjust reflection fanny must allow for let pas julia be vexed temper be hasty felt that must not last therefore taking notice only asked if have not seen mr rushworth yes yes saw be posting away a if upon life death must just spare time to tell errand where be be pity must have so much trouble for nothing be miss maria concern be not obliged to punish for sin mother must not avoid a long a tiresome aunt be dancing about with housekeeper son can get away from immediately scrambled across fence walked away not attending to fanny last question of whether have seen anything of miss crawford edmund sort of dread in fanny now sat of seeing mr rushworth prevented thinking so much of continued absence however a might have done felt that have be very ill used be quite unhappy in having to communicate what have passed joined within five minute after julias exit though made best of story be evidently mortified displeased in common degree at first scarcely said anything look only expressed extreme surprise vexation walked to gate stood there without seeming to know what to do desired to staymy cousin maria charged to say that must find at knoll thereabouts believe will go farther said sullenly see nothing of by time get to knoll may be gone somewhere else have have walking enough sat down with most gloomy countenance by fanny be very sorry said be very unlucky longed

denied fanny be silenced after pause went onpray miss price be such great admirer of mr crawford a people be for part can see nothing in think at handsome handsome nobody can call such undersized man handsome be not five foot nine must not wonder if be not more than five foot eight think be ill looking fellow in opinion crawford be addition at did very well without small sigh escaped fanny here did not know how to contradict if have made difficulty about fetching key there might have be excuse went very moment said wanted nothing must be more obliging than manner be sure dare say walked a fast a must still be distance know from spot to house quite into house when people be waiting be bad judge of time half minute seems like five got up walked to gate again wished have have key about at time fanny thought discerned in standing there indication of relenting encouraged to attempt said therefore be pity must not join expected to have better view of house from part of park will be thinking how may be improved nothing of sort know can be settled without found more successful in sending away than in retaining companion mr rushworth be worked on well said if really think have better go must be foolish to bring key for nothing letting out walked off without farther ceremony fanny thought be now engrossed by two who have left so long ago getting quite impatient resolved to go in search of followed step along bottom walk have just turned up into when voice laugh of miss crawford once more caught ear sound approached few more winding brought before be just returned into wilderness from park to sidegate not fastened have tempted very soon after leaving have be across portion of park into very avenue fanny have be hoping whole morning to reach at last have be sitting down under one of tree be history be evident that have be spending time pleasantly be not aware of length of absence fanny best consolation be in being assured that edmund have wished for very much that must certainly have come back for have not be tired already be not quite sufficient to do away with pain of having be left whole hour when have talked of only few minute to banish sort of curiosity felt to know what have be conversing about time result of whole be to disappointment depression a prepared by general agreement to return to house on reaching bottom of step to terrace mr rushworth mr norris presented at top just ready for wilderness at end of hour half from leaving house mr norris have be too well employed to move faster cross accident have occurred to intercept

return of others arrival of dinner be late before miss bertrams two gentleman came in ramble did not appear to have be more than partially agreeable at productive of anything useful with regard to object of day by own account have be walking after other junction have taken place at last seemed to fanny observation to have be a much too late for re establishing harmony a confessedly have be for determining on alteration felt a looked at julia mr rushworth that hers be not only dissatisfied bosom amongst there be gloom on face of mr crawford miss bertram be much more gay thought that be taking particular pain during dinner to do away little resentment of other two restore general good humour dinner be soon followed by tea coffee ten mile drive home allowed waste of hour from time of sitting down to table be quick succession of busy nothing till carriage came to door mr norris having fidgeted about obtained few pheasant egg cream cheese from housekeeper made abundance of civil speech to mr rushworth be ready to lead way at same moment mr crawford approaching julia said hope be not to lose companion unless be afraid of evening air in so exposed seat request have not be foreseen be very graciously received julias day be likely to end almost a well a began miss bertram have made up mind to something different be little disappointed conviction of being really one preferred comforted under enabled to receive mr rushworths parting attention a ought be certainly better pleased to hand into barouche than to assist in ascending box complacency seemed confirmed by arrangement well fanny have be fine day for upon word said mr norris a drove through park nothing pleasure from beginning to end be sure ought to be very much obliged to aunt bertram for contriving to let go pretty good day amusement have have maria be just discontented enough to say directly think have done pretty well maam lap seems full of good thing here be basket of something between have be

spare hen if come to good can have moved to own house borrow coop will be great delight to in lonely hour to attend to if have good luck mother will have be beautiful evening mild still drive be a pleasant a serenity of nature must make when mr norris ceased speaking be altogether silent drive to within spirit be in general exhausted to determine whether day have afforded most pleasure pain might occupy meditation of almost chapter xi day at sotherton with imperfection afforded miss bertrams much more agreeable feeling than be derived from letter from antigua soon afterwards reached mansfield be much pleasanter to think of henry crawford than of father to think of father in england again within certain period letter obliged to do be most unwelcome exercise november be black month fixed for return sir thomas wrote of with a much decision a experience anxiety must authorise business be so nearly concluded a to justify in proposing to take passage in september packet consequently looked forward with hope of being with beloved family again early in november maria be more to be pitied than julia for to father brought husband return of friend most solicitous for happiness must unite to lover on whom have chosen that happiness must depend be gloomy prospect must do be to throw mist over hope when mist cleared away must see something else must hardly be early in november there be generally delay bad passage something that favouring something everybody who shuts eye while look understanding while reason feel comfort of must probably be middle of november at least middle of november be three month off three month comprised thirteen week much might happen in thirteen week sir thomas must have be deeply mortified by suspicion of half that daughter felt on subject of return must hardly have found consolation in knowledge of interest excited in breast of young lady miss crawford on walking up with brother to spend evening at mansfield park heard good news though seeming to have concern in affair beyond politeness to have vented feeling in quiet congratulation heard with attention not so easily satisfied mr norris gave particular of letter subject be dropt after tea a miss crawford be standing at open window with edmund fanny looking out on twilight scene while miss bertrams mr rushworth henry crawford be busy with candle at pianoforte suddenly revived by turning round towards group saying how happy mr rushworth look be thinking of november edmund looked round at mr rushworth too have nothing to say father return will be very interesting event will indeed after such absence absence not only long including so many danger will be forerunner also of other interesting event sister marriage taking order yes dont be affronted said laughing doe put in mind of of old heathen hero who after performing great exploit in foreign land offered sacrifice to god on safe return there be sacrifice in case replied edmund with serious smile glancing at pianoforte again be entirely own doing oh yes know be be merely joking have done more than what young woman must do have doubt of being extremely happy other sacrifice of course understand taking order assure be quite a voluntary a maria marrying be fortunate that inclination father convenience must accord so well there be very good living kept for understand hereabouts suppose have biassed that be sure have not cried fanny thank for good word fanny be more than must affirm on contrary knowing that there be such provision for probably did bias can think wrong that must there be natural disinclination to be overcome see reason why man must make worse clergyman for knowing that will have competence early in life be in safe hand hope must not have be influenced in wrong way be sure father be too conscientious to have allowed have doubt be biased think be blamelessly be same sort of thing said fanny after short pause a for son of admiral to go into navy son of general to be in army nobody see anything wrong in nobody wonder that must prefer line where friend can serve best suspect to be le in earnest in than appear dear miss price for reason good profession navy army be own justification have everything in favour heroism danger bustle fashion soldier sailor be always acceptable in society nobody can wonder that men be soldier sailor motif of man who take order with certainty of preferment may be fairly suspected think said edmund to be justified in eye must do in most complete uncertainty of provision what take order without living be madness indeed absolute madness will ask how church be to be filled if man be to take order with living without for certainly must not know what to say must beg advantage to clergyman from own argument a can not be influenced by feeling rank highly a temptation reward to soldier sailor in choice of profession a heroism noise fashion be against ought to be le liable to suspicion of wanting sincerity good intention in choice of oh doubt be very sincere in preferring income ready made to trouble of working for one have best intention of doing nothing rest of day eat drink grow fat be indolence mr bertram indeed indolence love of ease want of laudable ambition of taste for good company of inclination to take trouble of being agreeable make men clergyman clergyman have nothing to do be slovenly selfishread newspaper watch weather quarrel with wife curate doe work business of own life be to dine there be such clergyman doubt think be not so common a to justify miss crawford in esteeming general character suspect that in comprehensive may say commonplace censure be not judging from from prejudiced person whose opinion have be in habit of hearing be impossible that own observation can have given much knowledge of clergy can have be personally acquainted with very few of set of men condemn so conclusively be speaking what have be told at uncle table speak what appears to general opinion where opinion be general be usually correct though have not seen much of domestic life of clergyman be seen by too many to leave deficiency of information where one body of educated men of denomination be condemned indiscriminately there must be deficiency of information smiling of something else uncle brother admiral perhaps knew little of clergyman beyond chaplain whom good bad be always wishing away poor william have met with great kindness from chaplain of antwerp be tender apostrophe of fanny very much to purpose of own feeling if not of conversation have be so little addicted to take opinion from uncle said miss crawford can hardly supposeand since push so hard must observe be not entirely without mean of seeing what clergyman be being at present time guest of own brother dr grant though dr grant be most kind obliging to though be really gentleman dare say good scholar clever often preaches good sermon be very respectable see to be indolent selfish bon vivant who must have palate consulted in everything who will not stir finger for convenience of one who moreover if cook make blunder be out of humour with excellent wife to own truth henry be partly driven out very evening by disappointment about green goose must not get better of poor sister be forced to stay bear wonder at disapprobation upon word be great defect of temper made worse by very faulty habit of self indulgence to see sister suffering from must be exceedingly painful to such feeling a yours fanny go against can not attempt to defend dr grant replied fanny need not give up profession for because profession dr grant have chosen must have taken anot good temper into a must either in navy army have have great many more people under command than have now think more must have be made unhappy by a sailor soldier than a clergyman besides can not suppose that there may be to wish otherwise in dr grant must have be in greater danger of becoming worse in more active worldly profession where must have have le time obligationwhere might have escaped that knowledge of frequency at least of knowledge be impossible must escape a be now mana sensible man like dr grant can not be in habit of teaching others duty week can not go to church twice sunday preach such very good sermon in so good manner a doe without being better for must make think have doubt that oftener endeavour to restrain than must if have be anything clergyman can not prove to contrary to be sure wish better fate miss price than to be wife of man whose amiableness depends upon own sermon for though may preach into good humour sunday will be bad enough to have quarrelling about green goose from monday morning till saturday night think man who must often quarrel with fanny said edmund affectionately must be beyond reach of sermon fanny turned farther into window miss crawford have only time to say in pleasant manner fancy miss price have be more used to deserve praise than to hear when being earnestly invited by miss bertrams to join in glee tripped off to instrument leaving edmund looking after in ecstasy of admiration of many virtue from obliging manner down to light graceful tread there go good humour be sure said presently there go temper must never give pain how well walk how readily fall in with inclination of others joining moment be asked what pity added after instant reflection that must have be in such hand fanny agreed to have pleasure of seeing continue at window with in spite of expected glee of having eye soon turned like hers towards scene without where be solemn soothing lovely appeared in brilliancy of unclouded night contrast of deep shade of wood fanny spoke feeling here harmony said here repose here what may leave painting music behind what poetry only can attempt to describe here what may tranquillise care lift heart to rapture when look out on night a feel a if there must be wickedness sorrow in world there certainly must be le of if sublimity of nature be more attended to people be carried more out of by contemplating scene like to hear enthusiasm fanny be lovely night be much to be pitied who have not be taught to feel in degree a do who have not at least be given taste for nature in early life lose great deal taught to think feel on subject cousin have very apt scholar there arcturus looking very bright yes bear wish must see cassiopeia must go out on lawn for must be afraid not in least be great while since have have star gazing yes know how have happened glee began will stay till be finished fanny said turning back on window a advanced have mortification of seeing advance too moving forward by gentle degree towards instrument when ceased be close by singer among most urgent in requesting to hear glee again fanny sighed alone at window till scolded away by mr norris threat of catching cold chapter xii sir thomas be to return in november eldest son have duty to call earlier home approach of september brought tidings of mr bertram first in letter to gamekeeper then in letter to edmund by end of august arrived to be gay agreeable gallant again a occasion served miss crawford demanded to tell of race weymouth party friend to might have listened six week before with interest altogether to give fullest conviction by power of actual comparison of preferring younger brother be very vexatious be heartily sorry for so be so far from now meaning to marry elder did not even want to attract beyond what simplest claim of conscious beauty required lengthened absence from mansfield without anything pleasure in view own will to consult made perfectly clear that did not care about indifference be so much more than equalled by own be now to step forth owner of mansfield park sir thomas complete be to be in time did not believe must accept season duty brought mr bertram back to mansfield took mr crawford into norfolk everingham must not do without in beginning of september went for fortnighta fortnight of such dullness to miss bertrams a ought to have put on guard made even julia admit in jealousy of sister absolute necessity of distrusting attention wishing not to return fortnight of sufficient leisure in interval of shooting sleeping to have convinced gentleman that ought to keep longer away have be more in habit of examining own motif of reflecting to what indulgence of idle vanity be tending thoughtless selfish from prosperity bad example must not look beyond present moment sister handsome clever encouraging be amusement to sated mind finding nothing in norfolk to equal social pleasure of mansfield gladly returned to at time appointed be welcomed thither quite a gladly by whom came to trifle with further maria with only mr rushworth to attend to doomed to repeated detail of day sport good bad boast of dog jealousy of neighbour doubt of qualification zeal after poacher subject will not find way to female feeling without talent on one side attachment on other have missed mr crawford grievously julia unengaged unemployed felt right of missing much more sister believed favourite julia might be justified in so doing by hint of mr grant inclined to credit what wished maria by hint of mr crawford everything returned into same channel a before absence manner being to so animated agreeable a to lose ground with just stopping short of consistence steadiness solicitude warmth might excite general notice fanny be only one of party who found anything to dislike since day at sotherton must never see mr crawford with sister without observation seldom without wonder censure have confidence in own judgment be equal to exercise of in other respect have be sure that be seeing clearly judging candidly must probably have made important communication to usual confidant a be however only hazarded hint hint be lost be rather surprised said that mr crawford must come back again so soon after being here so long before full seven week for have understood be so very fond of change moving about thought something must certainly occur when be once gone to take elsewhere be used to much gayer place than mansfield be to credit be edmunds answer dare say give sister pleasure doe not like unsettled habit what favourite be with cousin yes manner to woman be such a must please mr grant believe suspect of preference for julia have never seen much symptom of wish may be so have fault what serious attachment must remove if miss bertram be not engaged said fanny cautiously must sometimes almost think that admired more than julia be perhaps more in favour of liking julia best than fanny may be aware for believe often happens that man before have quite made up own mind will distinguish sister intimate friend of woman be really thinking of more than woman crawford have too much sense to stay here if found in danger from maria be not at afraid for after such proof a have given that feeling be not strong fanny supposed must have be mistaken meant to think differently in future with submission to edmund must do all help of coinciding look hint occasionally noticed in of others seemed to say that julia be mr crawford choice knew not always what to think be privy one evening to hope of aunt norris on subject a well a to feeling feeling of mr rushworth on point of similarity must not help wondering a listened glad must have be not to be obliged to listen for be while other young people be dancing sitting most unwillingly among chaperon at fire longing for re entrance of elder cousin on whom own hope of partner then depended be fanny first though without preparation splendour of many young lady first being thought only of afternoon built on late acquisition of violin player in servant hall possibility of raising five couple with help of mr grant new intimate

down newspaper again for be tired to death only wonder how good people can keep up so long have need be in love to find amusement in such folly so be fancy if look at may see be so many couple of loversall yates mr grantand between poor woman must want lover a much a one of desperate dull life hers must be with doctor making sly face a spoke towards chair of latter who proving however to be

may bet half guinea with must be most happy replied aloud jumping up with alacrity must give greatest pleasure be moment going to dance come fanny taking hand be dawdling longer dance will be over fanny be led off very willingly though be impossible for to feel much gratitude towards cousin distinguish a certainly did between selfishness of person own pretty modest request upon word indignantly exclaimed a walked away to want to nail to card table for next two hour with dr grant who be always quarrelling that poking old woman who know more of whist than of algebra wish good aunt must be little le busy to ask in way too without ceremony before so a to leave possibility of refusing be what dislike most particularly raise spleen more than anything to have pretence of being asked of being given choice at same time addressed in such way a to oblige one to do very thing whatever be if have not luckily thought of standing up with must not have got out of be great deal too bad when aunt have got fancy in head nothing can stop chapter xiii honourable john yates new friend have not much to recommend beyond habit of fashion expense being younger son of lord with tolerable independence sir thomas must probably have thought introduction at mansfield by mean desirable mr bertrams acquaintance with have begun at weymouth where have spent ten day together in same society friendship if friendship might be called have be proved perfected by mr yatess being invited to take mansfield in way whenever must by promising to come did come rather earlier than have be expected in consequence of sudden breaking up of large party assembled for gaiety at house of friend have left weymouth to join came on wing of disappointment with head full of acting for have be theatrical party play in have borne part be within two day of representation when sudden death of one of nearest connexion of family have destroyed scheme dispersed performer to be so near happiness so near fame so near long paragraph in praise of private theatrical at ecclesford seat of right hon lord ravenshaw in cornwall must of course have immortalised whole party for at least twelvemonth being so near to lose be injury to be keenly felt mr yates must talk of nothing else ecclesford theatre with arrangement dress rehearsal joke be never failing subject to boast of past only consolation happily for love of theatre be so general itch for acting so strong among young people that must hardly out talk interest of hearer from first casting of part to epilogue be bewitching there be few who did not wish to have be party concerned must have hesitated to try skill play have be lover vow mr yates be to have be count cassel trifling part said not at to taste one a certainly must not accept again be determined to make difficulty lord ravenshaw duke have appropriated only two character worth playing before reached ecclesford though lord ravenshaw offered to resign to be impossible to take know be sorry for that must have so mistaken power for be more equal to barona little man with weak voice always hoarse after first ten minute must have injured piece materially be resolved to make difficulty sir henry thought duke not equal to frederick be because sir henry wanted part whereas be certainly in best hand of two be surprised to see sir henry such stick luckily strength of piece did not depend upon agatha be inimitable duke be thought very great by many upon whole must certainly have gone off wonderfully be hard case upon word do think be very much to be pitied be kind response of listening sympathy be not worth complaining about to be sure poor old dowager must not have died at worse time be impossible to help wishing that news must have be suppressed for just three day wanted be three day being only grandmother happening two hundred mile off think there must have be great harm be suggested know lord ravenshaw who suppose be one of most correct men in england must not hear of afterpiece instead of comedy said mr bertram lover vow be at end lord lady ravenshaw left to act grandmother by well jointure may comfort perhaps between friend began to tremble for credit lung in baron be not sorry to withdraw to make amends yates think must raise little theatre at mansfield ask to be manager though thought of moment did not end with moment for inclination to act be awakened in one more strongly than in who be now master of house who having so much leisure a to make almost novelty certain good have likewise degree of lively talent comic taste a be exactly adapted to novelty of acting thought returned again again oh for ecclesford theatre scenery to try something with sister must echo wish henry crawford to whom in riot of gratification be yet untasted pleasure be quite alive at idea really believe said must be fool enough at moment to undertake character that ever be written from shylock richard iii down to singing hero of farce in scarlet coat cocked hat feel a if must be anything everything a if must rant storm sigh cut caper in tragedy comedy in english language let be doing something be only play act scene what must prevent not countenance be sure looking towards miss bertrams for theatre what signifies theatre will be only amusing room in house might suffice must have curtain said tom bertram few yard of green baize for curtain perhaps may be enough oh quite enough cried mr yates with only just side wing two run up door in flat three four scene to be let down nothing more must be necessary on plan a for mere amusement among must want nothing more believe must be satisfied with le said maria there must not be time other difficulty must arise must rather adopt mr crawford view make performance not theatre object many part of best play be independent of scenery nay said edmund who began to listen with alarm let hing by half if be to act let be in theatre completely fitted up with pit box gallery let have play entire from beginning to end so a be german play matter what with good tricking shifting afterpiece figure dance hornpipe song between act if outdo ecclesford hing now edmund be disagreeable said julia nobody love play better than do can have gone much farther to see one true to see real acting good hardened real acting must hardly walk from room to next to look at raw effort of who have not be bred to trade set of gentleman lady who have disadvantage of education decorum to struggle through after short pause however subject still continued be discussed with unabated eagerness one inclination increasing by discussion knowledge of inclination of rest though nothing be settled that tom bertram must prefer comedy sister henry crawford tragedy that nothing in world must be easier than to find piece must please resolution to act something other seemed so decided a to make edmund quite uncomfortable be determined to prevent if possible though mother who equally heard conversation passed at table did not evince least disapprobation same evening afforded opportunity of trying strength maria julia henry crawford mr yates be in billiard room tom returning from into drawing room where edmund be standing thoughtfully by fire while lady bertram be on sofa at little distance fanny close beside arranging work thus began a enteredsuch horribly vile billiard table a ours be not to be met with believe above ground can stand no longer think may say that nothing will ever tempt to again one good thing have just ascertained be very room for theatre precisely shape length for door at farther end communicating with other a may be made to do in five minute by merely moving bookcase in father room be very thing must have desired if have sat down to wish for father room will be excellent greenroom seems to join billiard room on purpose be not serious tom in meaning to act said edmund in low voice a brother approached fire not serious never more so assure what be there to surprise in think must be very wrong in general light private theatrical be open to objection a be circumstanced must think must be highly injudicious more than injudicious to attempt anything of kind must shew great want of feeling on father account absent a be in degree of constant danger must be imprudent think with regard to maria whose situation be very delicate one considering everything extremely delicate take up thing so seriously a if be going to act three time week till father return invite country be not to be display of sort mean nothing little amusement among just to vary scene exercise power in something new want audience publicity may be trusted think in chusing play most perfectly unexceptionable can conceive greater harm danger to of in conversing in elegant written language of respectable author than in chattering in word of own have fear scruple a to father being absent be so far from objection consider rather a motive for expectation of return must be very anxious period to mother if can be mean of amusing that anxiety keeping up spirit for next few week will think time very well spent so be sure will be very anxious period for a said looked towards mother lady bertram sunk back in one corner of sofa picture of health wealth ease tranquillity be just falling into gentle doze while fanny be getting through few difficulty of work for edmund smiled shook head by jove wont do cried tom throwing into chair with hearty laugh to be sure dear mother anxietyi be unlucky there what be matter asked ladyship in heavy tone of one half roused be not asleep oh dear maam nobody suspected well edmund continued returning to former subject posture voice a soon a lady bertram began to nod again will maintain that will be doing harm can not agree with be convinced that father must totally disapprove be convinced to contrary nobody be fonder of exercise of talent in young people promotes more than father for anything of acting spouting reciting kind think have always decided taste be sure encouraged in a boy how many time have mourned over dead body of julius caesar to bed not to bed in very room for amusement be sure name be norval evening of life through one christmas holiday be very different thing must see difference father wished a schoolboy to speak well must never wish grown up daughter to be acting play sense of decorum be strict know said tom displeased know father a well a do ill take care that daughter hing to distress manage own concern edmund ill take care of rest of family if be resolved on acting replied persevering edmund must hope will be in very small quiet way think theatre ought not to be attempted must be taking liberty with father house in absence must not be justified for everything of nature will be answerable said tom in decided tone house will not be hurt have quite a great interest in being careful of house a can have a to such alteration a be suggesting just now such a moving bookcase unlocking door even a using billiard room for space of week without playing at billiards in might just a well suppose must object to sitting more in room le in breakfast room than did before went away to sister pianoforte being moved from one side of room to other absolute nonsense innovation if not wrong a innovation will be wrong a expense yes expense of such undertaking must be prodigious perhaps might cost whole twenty pound something of theatre must have undoubtedly will be on simplest plan green curtain little carpenter work thats a carpenter work may be done at home by christopher jackson will be too absurd to talk of expense a long a jackson be employed everything will be right with sir thomas dont imagine that nobody in house can see judge dont act if like dont expect to govern everybody else no a to acting said edmund that absolutely protest against tom walked out of room a said edmund be left to sit down stir fire in thoughtful vexation fanny who have heard borne edmund company in feeling throughout whole now ventured to say in anxiety to suggest comfort perhaps may not be able to find play to suit brother taste sister seem very different have hope there fanny if persist in scheme will find something will speak to sister try to dissuade be can do must think aunt norris must be on side dare say must have influence with tom sister must be of use if can not convince will let thing take course without attempting through family squabbling be greatest evil of have better do anything than be altogether by ear sister to whom have opportunity of speaking next morning be quite a impatient of advice quite a unyielding to representation quite a determined in cause of pleasure a tom mother have objection to plan be not in least afraid of father disapprobation there must be harm in what have be done in so many respectable family by so many woman of first consideration must be scrupulousness run mad must see anything to censure in plan like theirs comprehending only brother sister intimate friend must never be heard of beyond julia did seem inclined to admit that maria situation might require particular caution delicacybut must not extend to hershe be at liberty maria evidently considered engagement a only raising so much more above restraint leaving le occasion than julia to consult either father mother edmund have little to hope be still urging subject when henry crawford entered room fresh from parsonage calling out want of hand in theatre miss bertram want of understrappers sister desire love hope to be admitted into company will be happy to take part of old duenna tame confidante that may not like to do yourselves maria gave edmund glance meant what say now can be wrong if mary crawford feel same edmund silenced be obliged to acknowledge that charm of acting might well carry fascination to mind of genius with ingenuity of love to dwell more on obliging accommodating purport of message than on anything else scheme advanced opposition be vain a to mr norris be mistaken in supposing must wish to make started difficulty be not talked down in five minute by eldest nephew niece who be powerful with a whole arrangement be to bring very little expense to anybody none at to herself a foresaw in comfort of hurry bustle importance derived immediate advantage of fancying obliged to leave own house where have be living month at own cost take up abode in theirs that hour might be spent in service be in fact exceedingly delighted with project chapter xiv fanny seemed nearer being right than edmund have supposed business of finding play must suit everybody proved to be trifle carpenter have received order taken measurement have suggested removed at least two set of difficulty having made necessity of enlargement of plan expense fully evident be already at work while play be still to seek other preparation be also in hand enormous roll of green baize have arrived from northampton be cut out by mr norris with saving by good management of full three quarter of yard be actually forming into curtain by housemaid still play be wanting a two three day passed away in manner edmund began almost to hope that none might ever be found there be in fact so many thing to be attended to so many people to be pleased so many best character required above need that play must be at once tragedy comedy that there did seem a little chance of decision a anything pursued by youth zeal must hold out on tragic side be miss bertrams henry crawford mr yates on comic tom bertram not quite alone because be evident that mary crawford wish though politely kept back inclined same way determinateness power seemed to make ally unnecessary independent of great irreconcilable difference wanted piece containing very few character in whole character first rate three principal woman best play be run over in vain hamlet macbeth othello douglas gamester presented anything must satisfy even tragedian rival school for scandal wheel of fortune heir at law long et cetera be successively dismissed with yet warmer objection piece must be proposed did not supply somebody with difficulty on one side other be continual repetition of oh will never do let have ranting tragedy too many character not tolerable woman part in play anything that dear tom must be impossible to fill up one must not expect anybody to take part nothing buffoonery from beginning to end might do perhaps for low part if must give opinion have always thought most insipid play in english language wish to make objection will be happy to be of use think must not chuse worse fanny looked on listened not unamused to observe selfishness more le disguised seemed to govern wondering how must end for own gratification must have wished that something might be acted for have never seen even play everything of higher consequence be against will never do said tom bertram at last be wasting time most abominably something must be fixed on matter what so something be chosen must not be so nice few character too many must not frighten must double must descend little if part be insignificant greater credit in making anything of from moment make difficulty take part chuse to give so a be comic let be comic condition for nothing more for about fifth time then proposed heir at law doubting only whether to prefer lord duberley dr pangloss for very earnestly very unsuccessfully trying to persuade others that there be fine tragic part in rest of dramatis person pause followed fruitless effort be ended by same speaker who taking up one of many volume of play lay on table turning over suddenly exclaimedlovers vow why must not lover vow do for a well a for ravenshaws how came never to be thought of before strike a if must do exactly what say here be two capital tragic part for yates crawford here be rhyming butler for if nobody else want trifling part sort of thing must not dislike a said before be determined to take anything do best a for rest may be filled up by anybody be only count cassel anhalt suggestion be generally welcome everybody be growing weary of indecision first idea with everybody be that nothing have be proposed before so likely to suit mr yates be particularly pleased have be sighing longing to do baron at ecclesford have grudged rant of lord ravenshaws be forced to re rant in own room storm through baron wildenheim be height of theatrical ambition with advantage of knowing scene by heart already did now with greatest alacrity offer service for part to do justice however did not resolve to appropriate for remembering that there be very good ranting ground in frederick professed equal willingness for henry crawford be ready to take mr yates did not chuse must perfectly satisfy short parley of compliment ensued miss bertram feeling interest of agatha in question took on to decide by observing to mr yates that be point in height figure ought to be considered that being tallest seemed to fit peculiarly for baron be acknowledged to be quite right two part being accepted accordingly be certain of proper frederick three of character be now cast besides mr rushworth who be always answered for by maria a willing to do anything when julia meaning like sister to be agatha began to be scrupulous on miss crawford account be not behaving well by absent said here be not woman enough amelia agatha may do for maria here be nothing for sister mr crawford mr crawford desired that might not be thought of be very sure sister have wish of acting a might be useful that must not allow to be considered in present case be immediately opposed by tom bertram who asserted part of amelia to be in respect property of miss crawford if must accept fall a naturally a necessarily to said a agatha doe to one other of sister can be sacrifice on side for be highly comic short silence followed sister looked anxious for felt best claim to agatha be hoping to have pressed on by rest henry crawford who meanwhile have taken up play with seeming carelessness be turning over first act soon settled business must entreat miss julia bertram said not to engage in part of agatha will be ruin of solemnity must not indeed must not turning to must not stand countenance dressed up in woe paleness many laugh have have together must infallibly come across frederick knapsack must be obliged to run away pleasantly courteously be spoken manner be lost in matter to julias feeling saw glance at maria confirmed injury to herself be scheme trick be slighted maria be preferred smile of triumph maria be trying to suppress shewed how well be understood before julia must command enough to speak brother gave weight against too by saying oh yes maria must be agatha maria will be best agatha though julia fancy prefers tragedy must not trust in there be nothing of tragedy about have not look of feature be not tragic feature walk too quick speaks too quick must not keep countenance have better do old countrywoman cottager wife have indeed julia cottager wife be very pretty part assure old lady relief high flown benevolence of husband with good deal of spirit will be cottager wife cottager wife cried mr yates what be talking of most trivial paltry insignificant part merest commonplace not tolerable speech in whole sister do that be insult to propose at governess be to have done agreed that must not be offered to anybody else little more justice mr manager if please deserve office if can not appreciate talent of company little better why a to that good friend till company have really acted there must be guesswork mean disparagement to julia can not have two agathas must have one cottager wife be sure set example of moderation in being satisfied with old butler if part be trifling will have more credit in making something of if be so desperately bent against everything humorous let take cottager speech instead of cottager wife so change part through be solemn pathetic enough be sure must make difference in play a for cottager when have got wife speech must undertake with heart with partiality for cottager wife said henry crawford will be impossible to make anything of fit for sister must not suffer good nature to be imposed on must not allow to accept part must not be left to own complaisance talent will be wanted in amelia amelia be character more difficult to be well represented than even agatha consider amelia be most difficult character in whole piece requires great power great nicety to give playfulness simplicity without extravagance have seen good actress fail in part simplicity indeed be beyond reach of almost actress by profession requires delicacy of feeling have not requires gentlewomana julia bertram will undertake hope turning to with look of anxious entreaty softened little while hesitated what to say brother again interposed with miss crawford better claim julia must not be amelia be not at part for must not like must not do well be too tall robust amelia must be small light girlish skipping figure be fit for miss crawford miss crawford only look part be persuaded will do admirably without attending to henry crawford continued supplication must oblige said indeed must when have studied character be sure will feel suit tragedy may be choice will certainly appear that comedy chuses will be to visit in prison with basket of provision will not refuse to visit in prison think see coming in with basket influence of voice be felt julia wavered be only trying to soothe pacify make overlook previous affront distrusted slight have be most determined be perhaps at treacherous play with looked suspiciously at sister maria countenance be to decide if be vexed alarmedbut maria looked serenity satisfaction julia well knew that on ground maria must not be happy at expense with hasty indignation therefore tremulous voice said to seem afraid of not keeping countenance when come in with basket of provisionsthough one might have supposedbut be only a agatha be to be so overpowering stoppedhenry crawford looked rather foolish a if did not know what to say tom bertram began again miss crawford must be amelia will be excellent amelia be afraid of wanting character cried julia with angry quickness be not to be agatha be sure will hing else a to amelia be of part in world most disgusting to quite detest odious little pert unnatural impudent girl have always protested against comedy be comedy in worst form so saying walked hastily out of room leaving awkward feeling to more than one exciting small compassion in except fanny who have be quiet auditor of whole who must not think of a under agitation of jealousy without great pity short silence succeeded leaving brother soon returned to business lover vow be eagerly looking over play with mr yatess help to ascertain what scenery must be necessarywhile maria henry crawford conversed together in under voice declaration with began of be sure must give up part to julia most willingly that though will probably do very ill feel persuaded must do worse be doubtless receiving compliment called for when have lasted time division of party be completed by tom bertram mr yates walking off together to consult farther in room now beginning to be called theatre miss bertrams resolving to go down to parsonage with offer of amelia to miss crawford fanny remained alone first use made of solitude be to take up volume have be left on table begin to acquaint with play of have heard so much curiosity be awake ran through with eagerness be suspended only by interval of astonishment that must be chosen in present instance that must be proposed accepted in private theatre agatha amelia appeared to in different way so totally improper for home representationthe situation of one language of other so unfit to be expressed by woman of modesty that must hardly suppose cousin must be aware of what be engaging in longed to have roused a soon a possible by remonstrance edmund must certainly make chapter xv miss crawford accepted part very readily soon after miss bertrams return from parsonage mr rushworth arrived character be consequently cast have offer of count cassel anhalt at first did not know to chuse wanted miss bertram to direct upon being made to understand different style of character be recollecting that have once seen play in london have thought anhalt very stupid fellow soon decided for count miss bertram approved decision for le have to learn better though must not sympathise in wish that count agatha might be to act together wait very patiently while be slowly turning over leaf with hope of still discovering such scene very kindly took part in hand curtailed speech admitted being shortened besides pointing out necessity of being very much dressed chusing colour mr rushworth liked idea of finery very well though affecting to despise be too much engaged with what own appearance must be to think of others draw of conclusion feel of displeasure maria have be half prepared for thus much be settled before edmund who have be out morning knew anything of matter when entered drawing room before dinner buzz of discussion be high between tom maria mr yates mr rushworth stepped forward with great alacrity to tell agreeable news have got play said be to be lover vow be to be count cassel be to come in first with blue dress pink satin cloak afterwards be to have fine fancy suit by way of shooting dress know how will like fanny eye followed edmund heart beat for a heard speech saw look felt what sensation must be lover vow in tone of greatest amazement be only reply to mr rushworth turned towards brother sister a if hardly doubting contradiction yes cried mr yates after debatings difficulty find there be nothing will suit altogether so well nothing so unexceptionable a lover vow wonder be that must not have be thought of before stupidity be abominable for here have advantage of what saw at ecclesford be so useful to have anything of model have cast almost part what do do for woman said edmund gravely looking at maria maria blushed in spite of herself a answered take part lady ravenshaw be to have done with bolder eye miss crawford be to be amelia must not have thought sort of play to be so easily filled up with replied edmund turning away to fire where sat mother aunt fanny seating with look of great vexation mr rushworth followed to say come in three time have two forty speech thats something be not much like idea of being so fine will hardly know in blue dress pink satin cloak edmund must not answer in few minute mr bertram be called out of room to satisfy doubt of carpenter being accompanied by mr yates followed soon afterwards by mr rushworth edmund almost immediately took opportunity of saying can not before mr yates speak what feel a to play without reflecting on friend at ecclesford must now dear maria tell that think exceedingly unfit for private representation that hope will give up can not suppose will when have read carefully over read only first act aloud to mother aunt see how can approve will not be necessary to send to father judgment be convinced see thing very differently cried maria be perfectly acquainted with play assure with very few omission so forth will be made of course can see nothing objectionable in be not only young woman find who think very fit for private representation be sorry for be answer in matter be who be to lead must set example if others have blundered be place to put right shew what true delicacy be in point of decorum conduct must be law to rest of party picture of consequence have effect for one loved better to lead than maria with far more good humour answered be much obliged to edmund mean very well be sure still think see thing too strongly really can not undertake to harangue rest upon subject of kind there must be greatest indecorum think do imagine must have such idea in head let conduct be only harangue say that on examining part feel unequal to that find requiring more exertion confidence than can be supposed to have say with firmness will be quite enough who can distinguish will understand motive play will be given up delicacy honoured a ought act anything improper dear said lady bertram sir thomas must not like itfanny ring bell must have dinnerto be sure julia be dressed by time be convinced madam said edmund preventing fanny sir thomas must not like there dear do hear what edmund say if be to decline part said maria with renewed zeal julia must certainly take cried edmund if knew reason oh might think difference between usthe difference in situationsthat need not be so scrupulous a might feel necessary be sure must argue so no must excuse can not retract consent be too far settled everybody must be so disappointed tom must be quite angry if be so very nice will never act anything be just going to say very same thing said mr norris if play be to be objected to will act nothing preparation will be so much money thrown away be sure must be discredit to know play a maria say if there be anything little too warm be so with most of can be easily left out must not be over precise edmund a mr rushworth be to act too there can be harm only wish tom have known own mind when carpenter began for there be loss of day work about side door curtain will be good job however maid do work very well think will be able to send back dozen of ring there be occasion to put so very close together be of use hope in preventing waste making most of thing there must always be one steady head to superintend so many young one forgot to tell tom of something happened to very day have be looking about in poultry yard be just coming out when who must see dick jackson making up to servant hall door with two bit of deal board in hand bringing to father may be sure mother have chanced to send of message to father then father have bid bring up two bit of board for must not how do without knew what meant for servant dinner bell be ringing at very moment over head a hate such encroaching people jackson be very encroaching have always said so just sort of people to get can said to boy directly great lubberly fellow of ten year old know who ought to be ashamed of ill take board to father dick so get home again a fast a can boy looked very silly turned away without offering word for believe might speak pretty sharp dare say will cure of coming marauding about house for one while hate such greedinessso good a father be to family employing man year round nobody be at trouble of answer others soon returned edmund found that to have endeavoured to set right must be only satisfaction dinner passed heavily mr norris related again triumph over dick jackson play preparation be otherwise much talked of for edmunds disapprobation be felt even by brother though must not have owned maria wanting henry crawford animating support thought subject better avoided mr yates who be trying to make agreeable to julia found gloom le impenetrable on topic than of regret at secession from company mr rushworth having only own part own dress in head have soon talked away must be said of concern of theatre be suspended only for hour two there be still great deal to be settled spirit of evening giving fresh courage tom maria mr yates soon after being reassembled in drawing room seated in committee at separate table with play open before be just getting deep in subject when most welcome interruption be given by entrance of mr miss crawford who late dark dirty a be must not help coming be received with most grateful joy well how do go on what have settled oh can hing without followed first salutation henry crawford be soon seated with other three at table while sister made way to lady bertram with pleasant attention be complimenting must really congratulate ladyship said on play being chosen for though have borne with exemplary patience be sure must be sick of noise difficulty actor may be glad bystander must be infinitely more thankful for decision do sincerely give joy madam a well a mr norris everybody else who be in same predicament glancing half fearfully half slyly beyond fanny to edmund be very civilly answered by lady bertram edmund said nothing being only bystander be not disclaimed after continuing in chat with party round fire few minute miss crawford returned to party round table standing by seemed to interest in arrangement till a if struck by sudden recollection exclaimed good friend be most composedly at work upon cottage alehouse inside out pray let know fate in meanwhile who be to be anhalt what gentleman among be to have pleasure of making love to for moment one spoke then many spoke together to tell same melancholy truth that have not yet got anhalt mr rushworth be to be count cassel one have yet undertaken anhalt have choice of part said mr rushworth thought must like count best though much relish finery be to have chose very wisely be sure replied miss crawford with brightened look anhalt be heavy part count have two forty speech returned mr rushworth be trifle be not at surprised said miss crawford after short pause at want of anhalt amelia deserves better forward young lady may well frighten men must be too happy in taking part if be possible cried tom unluckily butler anhalt be in together will not entirely give up however will try what can be donei will look over again brother must take part said mr yates in low voice think must will not ask replied tom in cold determined manner miss crawford talked of something else soon afterwards rejoined party at fire want at said seating only puzzle oblige to make civil speech mr edmund bertram a act will be disinterested adviser therefore apply to what will do for anhalt be practicable for of others to double what be advice advice said calmly be that change play must have objection replied for though must not particularly dislike part of amelia if well supported be if everything went well will be sorry to be inconvenience a chuse to hear advice at table looking round certainly will not be taken edmund said more if part must tempt to act suppose must be anhalt observed lady archly after short pause for be clergyman know circumstance must by mean tempt replied for must be sorry to make character ridiculous by bad acting must be very difficult to keep anhalt from appearing formal solemn lecturer man who chuses profession be perhaps one of last who must wish to represent on stage miss crawford be silenced with feeling of resentment mortification moved chair considerably nearer tea table gave attention to mr norris who be presiding there fanny cried tom bertram from other table where conference be eagerly carrying on conversation incessant want service fanny be up in moment expecting errand for habit of employing in way be not yet overcome in spite of edmund must do oh want to disturb from seat want present service will only want in play must be cottager wife cried fanny sitting down again with most frightened look indeed must excuse must not act anything if be to give world indeed can not act indeed must for can not excuse need not frighten be nothing of part mere nothing not above dozen speech altogether will not much signify if nobody hears word say so may be a creep mouse a like must have to look at if be afraid of dozen

considering only uncle must condemn altogether fanny heart be not absolutely only saddened one amongst a soon began to acknowledge to herself julia be sufferer too though not quite so blamelessly henry crawford have trifled with feeling have very long allowed even sought attention with jealousy of sister so reasonable a ought to have be cure now that conviction of preference for maria have be forced on submitted to without alarm for maria situation endeavour at rational tranquillity for sat in gloomy silence wrapt in such gravity a nothing must subdue curiosity touch wit amuse allowing

compliment have not cared enough about to persevere against few repulse becoming soon too busy with play to have time for more than one flirtation grew indifferent to quarrel rather thought lucky occurrence a quietly putting end to what might ere long have raised expectation in more than mr grant be not pleased to see julia excluded from play sitting by disregarded a be not matter really involved happiness a henry must be best judge of own a did assure with most persuasive smile that julia have ever have serious thought of other must only renew former caution a to elder sister entreat not to risk tranquillity by too much admiration there then gladly take share in anything brought cheerfulness to young people in general did so particularly promote pleasure of two so dear to rather wonder julia be not in love with henry be observation to mary dare say be replied mary coldly imagine sister be must not be give hint of think of mr rushworth have better tell miss bertram to think of

norris in order mary fancy maria bertram care for henry be sure julia doe not must not have flirted a did last night with mr yates though maria be very good friend think like sotherton too well to be inconstant must not give much for mr rushworths chance if henry stept in before article be signed if have suspicion something must be done a soon a play be over will talk to seriously make know own

with whom be used to be on easy term be now become greatest enemy be alienated from other julia be not superior to hope of distressing end to attention be still carrying on there punishment to maria for conduct so shameful towards a well a towards mr rushworth with material fault of temper difference of opinion to prevent being very good friend while interest be same sister under trial a have not affection principle enough to make merciful just to give compassion maria felt triumph pursued purpose careless of julia julia must never see maria distinguished by henry crawford without trusting that must create jealousy bring public disturbance at last fanny saw pitied much of in julia there be outward fellowship between julia made communication fanny took liberty be two solitary sufferer connected only by fanny consciousness inattention of two brother aunt to julias discomposure blindness to true cause must be imputed to fullness of own mind be totally preoccupied tom be engrossed by concern of theatre saw nothing that did not immediately relate to edmund between theatrical real part between miss crawford claim own conduct between love consistency be equally unobservant mr norris

absent sir thomas to have leisure for watching behaviour guarding happiness of daughter chapter xviii everything be now in regular train theatre actor actress dress be getting forward though other great impediment arose fanny found before many day be past that be not all uninterrupted enjoyment to party that have not to witness continuance of such unanimity delight a have be almost too much for at first everybody began to have vexation edmund have many entirely against judgment scene painter arrived from town be at work much to increase of expense what be worse of eclat of proceeding brother instead of being really guided by a to privacy of representation be giving invitation to family who came in way tom began to fret over scene painter slow progress to feel misery of waiting have learned partall part for took trifling one must be united with butler began to be impatient to be acting day thus unemployed be tending to increase sense of insignificance of part together make more ready to regret that other play have not be chosen fanny being always very courteous listener often only listener at hand came in for complaint distress of most of knew that mr yates be in general thought to rant dreadfully that mr yates be disappointed in henry crawford that tom bertram spoke so quick must be unintelligible that mr grant spoiled everything by laughing that edmund be behindhand with part that be misery to have anything to do with mr rushworth who be wanting prompter through speech knew also that poor mr rushworth must seldom get anybody to rehearse with complaint came before a well a rest so decided to eye be cousin maria avoidance of so needlessly often rehearsal of first scene between mr crawford that have soon terror of other complaint from so far from being satisfied enjoying found everybody requiring something have not giving occasion of discontent to others everybody have part too long too short nobody must attend a ought nobody must remember on side be to come in nobody complainer must observe direction fanny believed to derive a much innocent enjoyment from play a of henry crawford acted well be pleasure to to creep into theatre attend rehearsal of first act in spite of feeling excited in speech for maria maria also thought acted well too well after first rehearsal two fanny began to be only audience sometimes a prompter sometimes a spectator be often very useful a far a must judge mr crawford be considerably best actor of have more confidence than edmund more judgment than tom more talent taste than mr yates did not like a man must admit to be best actor on point there be not many who differed from mr yates indeed exclaimed against tameness insipidity day came at last when mr rushworth turned to with black look said do think there be anything so very fine in for life soul of can not admire between ourselves to see such undersized little mean looking man set up for fine actor be very ridiculous in opinion from moment there be return of former jealousy maria from increasing hope of crawford be at little pain to remove chance of mr rushworths ever attaining to knowledge of two forty speech became much le a to ever making anything tolerable of nobody have smallest idea of except mother indeed regretted that part be not more considerable deferred coming over to mansfield till be forward enough in rehearsal to comprehend scene others aspired at nothing beyond remembering catchword first line of speech being able to follow prompter through rest fanny in pity kindheartedness be at great pain to teach how to learn giving help direction in power trying to make artificial memory for learning word of part without being much forwarder many uncomfortable anxious apprehensive feeling certainly have with other claim on time attention be a far from finding without employment utility amongst a without companion in uneasiness quite a far from having demand on leisure a on compassion gloom of first anticipation be proved to have be unfounded be occasionally useful to be perhaps a much at peace a there be great deal of needlework to be done moreover in help be wanted that mr norris thought quite a well off a rest be evident by manner in claimed itcome fanny cried be fine time for must not be always walking from one room to other doing looking on at ease in way want here have be slaving till can hardly stand to contrive mr rushworths cloak without sending for more satin now think may give help in putting together there be three seam may do in trice must be lucky for if have nothing executive part to do be best off can tell if nobody did more than must not get on very fast fanny took work very quietly without attempting defence kinder aunt bertram observed on behalf one can not wonder sister fanny must be delighted be new to know used to be very fond of play so be still a soon a be little more at leisure mean to look in at rehearsal too what be play about fanny have never told oh sister pray ask now for fanny be not one of who can talk work at same time be about lover vow believe said fanny to aunt bertram there will be three act rehearsed to morrow evening will give opportunity of seeing actor at once have better stay till curtain be hung interposed mr norris curtain will be hung in day twothere be very little sense in play without curtainand be much mistaken if find draw up into very handsome festoon lady bertram seemed quite resigned to waiting fanny did not share aunt composure thought of morrow great deal for if three act be rehearsed edmund miss crawford must then be acting together for first time third act must bring scene between interested most particularly be longing dreading to see how must perform whole subject of be lovea marriage of love be to be described by gentleman very little short of declaration of love be made by lady have read read scene again with many painful many wondering emotion looked forward to representation of a circumstance almost too interesting did not believe have yet rehearsed even in private morrow came plan for evening continued fanny consideration of did not become le agitated worked very diligently under aunt direction diligence silence concealed very absent anxious mind about noon made escape with work to east room that might have concern in a deemed most unnecessary rehearsal of first act henry crawford be just proposing desirous at once of having time to herself of avoiding sight of mr rushworth glimpse a passed through hall of two lady walking up from parsonage made change in wish of retreat worked meditated in east room undisturbed for quarter of hour when gentle tap at door be followed by entrance of miss crawford be right yes be east room dear miss price beg pardon have made way to on purpose to entreat help fanny quite surprised endeavoured to shew mistress of room by civility looked at bright bar of empty grate with concern thank be quite warm very warm allow to stay here little while do have goodness to hear third act have brought book if must rehearse with must be so obliged came here to day intending to rehearse with edmundby ourselvesagainst evening be not in way if be think must go through with till have hardened little for really there be speech two will be so good wont fanny be most civil in assurance though must not give in very steady voice have ever happened to look at part mean continued miss crawford opening book here be did not think much of at firstbut upon word there look at speech that how be ever to look in face say such thing must do then be cousin make difference must rehearse with may fancy get on by degree have look of sometimes have will do best with greatest readiness must read part for can say very little of none of suppose be to have book of course now for must have two chair at hand for to bring forward to front of stage therevery good school room chair not made for theatre dare say much more fitted for little girl to sit kick foot against when be learning lesson must governess uncle say to see used for such purpose must sir thomas look in upon just now must bless for be rehearsing over house yates be storming away in dining room heard a came upstairs theatre be engaged of course by indefatigable rehearsers agatha frederick if be not perfect will be surprised by bye looked in upon five minute ago happened to be exactly at one of time when be trying not to embrace mr rushworth be with thought began to look little queer so turned off a well a must by whispering to will have excellent agatha there be something so maternal in manner so completely maternal in voice countenance be not that well done of brightened up directly now for soliloquy began fanny joined in with modest feeling idea of representing edmund be so strongly calculated to inspire with look voice so truly feminine a to be very good picture of man with such anhalt however miss crawford have courage enough have got through scene when tap at door brought pause entrance of edmund next moment suspended surprise consciousness pleasure appeared in of three on unexpected meeting a edmund be come on very same business have brought miss crawford consciousness pleasure be likely to be more than momentary in too have book be seeking fanny to ask to rehearse with help to prepare for evening without knowing miss crawford to be in house great be joy animation of being thus thrown together of comparing scheme sympathising in praise of fanny kind office must not equal in warmth spirit sank under glow of theirs felt becoming too nearly nothing to to have comfort in having be sought by must now rehearse together edmund proposed urged entreated till lady not very unwilling at first must refuse no longer fanny be wanted only to prompt observe be invested indeed with office of judge critic earnestly desired to exercise tell fault from doing so feeling within shrankshe must not must not dared not attempt have be otherwise qualified for criticism conscience must have restrained from venturing at disapprobation believed to feel too much of in aggregate for honesty safety in particular to prompt must be enough for be sometimes more than enough for must not always pay attention to book in watching forgot agitated by increasing spirit of edmunds manner have once closed page turned away exactly a wanted help be imputed to very reasonable weariness be thanked pitied deserved pity more than hoped must ever surmise at last scene be over fanny forced to add praise to compliment be giving other when again alone able to recall whole be inclined to believe performance must indeed have such nature feeling in a must ensure credit make very suffering exhibition to herself might be effect however must stand brunt of again that very day first regular rehearsal of three first act be certainly to take place in evening mr grant crawford be engaged to return for purpose a soon a must after dinner one concerned be looking forward with eagerness there seemed general diffusion of cheerfulness on occasion tom be enjoying such advance towards end edmund be in spirit from morning rehearsal little vexation seemed everywhere smoothed

disappointment mr grant non attendance be sad indeed pleasant manner cheerful conformity made always valuable amongst now be absolutely necessary must not act must not rehearse with satisfaction without comfort of whole evening be destroyed what be to be done tom a cottager be in despair after pause of perplexity eye began to be turned towards fanny voice two to say if miss price must be so good a to read part be immediately surrounded by supplication everybody asked even edmund said do fanny if be not very disagreeable to fanny still hung back must not endure idea of why be not miss crawford to be applied to a well why have not rather gone to own room a have felt to be safest instead of attending rehearsal at have known must irritate distress have known duty to keep away be properly punished have only to read part said henry crawford with renewed entreaty do believe can say word of added maria for must put mr grant right other day in twenty place fanny be sure know part fanny must not say did not a persevered a edmund repeated wish with look of even fond dependence on good nature must yield must do best everybody be satisfied be left to tremor of most palpitating heart while others prepared to begin did begin being too much engaged in own noise to be struck by unusual noise in other part of house have proceeded way when door of room be thrown open julia appearing at with face aghast exclaimed father be come be in hall at moment chapter xix how be consternation of party to be described to greater number be moment of absolute horror sir thomas in house

imagine blessing other heart be sinking under degree of self condemnation undefined alarm other heart be suggesting what will become of be to be done now be terrible pause terrible to ear be corroborating sound of opening door passing footstep julia be first to move speak again jealousy bitterness have be suspended selfishness be lost in common cause at moment of appearance frederick be

driven julia away be to sweetest support henry crawford retaining hand at moment moment of such peculiar proof importance be worth age of doubt anxiety hailed a earnest of most serious determination be equal even to encounter father walked off utterly heedless of mr rushworths repeated question of will go too have not better go too will not be right for to go too be sooner through door than henry crawford undertook to answer anxious inquiry encouraging by mean to pay respect to sir thomas without delay sent after others with delighted haste fanny be left with only crawford mr yates have be quite overlooked by cousin a own opinion of claim on sir thomas affection be much too humble to give idea of classing with child be glad to remain behind gain little breathing time agitation alarm exceeded be endured by rest by right of disposition not even innocence must keep from suffering be nearly fainting former habitual dread of uncle be returning with compassion for for almost one of party on development before with solicitude on edmunds account indescribable have found seat where in excessive trembling be enduring fearful thought while other three no longer under restraint be giving vent to feeling of vexation lamenting over such unlooked for premature arrival a most untoward event without mercy wishing poor sir thomas have be twice a long on passage be still in crawford be more warm on subject than mr yates from better understanding family judging more clearly of mischief must ensue ruin of play be to certainty felt total destruction of scheme to be inevitably at hand while mr yates considered only a temporary interruption disaster for evening must even suggest possibility of rehearsal being renewed after tea when bustle of receiving sir thomas be over might be at leisure to be amused by crawford laughed at idea having soon agreed on propriety of walking quietly home leaving family to proposed mr yatess accompanying spending evening at parsonage mr yates having never be with who thought much of parental claim family confidence must not perceive that anything of kind be necessary therefore thanking said preferred remaining where be that might pay respect to old gentleman handsomely since be come besides did not think must be fair by others to have everybody run away fanny be just beginning to collect to feel that if staid longer behind might seem disrespectful when point be settled being commissioned with brother sister apology saw preparing to go a quitted room to perform dreadful duty of appearing before uncle too soon did find at

have be acting have be alive with acting indeed what have be acting oh theyll tell about will soon be told cried tom hastily with affected unconcern be not worth while to bore father with now will hear enough of to morrow sir have just be trying by way of doing something amusing mother just within last week to get up few scene mere trifle have have such incessant rain almost since october began

reached just in time to witness first meeting of father friend sir thomas have be good deal surprised to find candle burning in room on casting eye round to see other symptom of recent habitation general air of confusion in furniture removal of bookcase from before billiard room door struck especially have scarcely more than time to feel astonished at before there be sound from billiard room to astonish still farther one be talking there in very loud accent did not know voicemore than talkingalmost hallooing stepped to door rejoicing at moment in having mean of immediate communication opening found on stage of theatre opposed to ranting young man who appeared likely to knock down backwards at very moment of yates perceiving sir thomas giving perhaps very best start have ever given in whole course of rehearsal tom bertram entered at other end of room never have found greater difficulty in keeping countenance father look of solemnity amazement on first appearance on stage gradual metamorphosis of impassioned baron wildenheim into well bred easy mr yates making bow apology to sir thomas bertram be such exhibition piece of true acting a must not have lost upon account must be lastin probabilitythe last scene on stage be sure there must not be finer house must close with greatest eclat there be little time however for indulgence of image of merriment be necessary for to step forward too assist introduction with many awkward sensation did best sir thomas received mr yates with appearance of cordiality be due to own character be really a far from pleased with necessity of acquaintance a with manner of commencement mr family connexion be sufficiently known to to render introduction a particular friend of hundred particular friend of son exceedingly unwelcome needed felicity of being again at home forbearance must supply to save sir thomas from anger on finding thus bewildered in own house making part of ridiculous exhibition in midst of theatrical nonsense forced in so untoward moment to admit acquaintance of young man whom felt sure of disapproving whose easy indifference volubility in course of first five minute seemed to mark most at home of two tom understood father thought heartily wishing might be always a well disposed to give partial expression began to see more clearly than have ever done before there might be ground of offence that there might be reason for glance father gave towards ceiling stucco of room that when inquired with mild gravity after fate of billiard table be not proceeding beyond very allowable curiosity few minute be enough for such unsatisfactory sensation on side sir thomas having exerted so far a to speak few word of calm approbation in reply to eager appeal of mr yates a to happiness of arrangement three gentleman returned to drawing room together sir thomas with increase of gravity be not lost on come from theatre said composedly a sat down found in rather unexpectedly vicinity to own roombut in respect indeed took by surprise a have not smallest suspicion of acting having assumed so serious character appears neat job however a far a must judge by candlelight doe friend christopher jackson credit then must have changed subject sipped coffee in peace over domestic matter of calmer hue mr yates without discernment to catch sir thomas meaning diffidence delicacy discretion enough to allow to lead discourse while mingled among others with least obtrusiveness must keep on topic of theatre must torment with question remark relative to finally must make hear whole history of disappointment at ecclesford sir thomas listened most politely found much to offend idea of decorum confirm ill opinion of mr yatess habit of thinking from beginning to end of story when be over must give other assurance of sympathy than what slight bow conveyed be in fact origin of acting said tom after moment thought friend yates brought infection from ecclesford spreadas thing always spread know sirthe faster probably from having so often encouraged sort of thing in formerly be like treading old ground again mr yates took subject from friend a soon a possible immediately gave sir thomas account of what have done be doing told of gradual increase of view happy conclusion of first difficulty present promising state of affair relating everything with so blind interest a made not only totally unconscious of uneasy movement of many of friend a sat change of countenance fidget hem of unquietness prevented even from seeing expression of face on own eye be fixedfrom seeing sir thomas dark brow contract a looked with inquiring earnestness at daughter edmund dwelling particularly on latter speaking language remonstrance reproof felt at heart not le acutely be felt by fanny who have edged back chair behind aunt end of sofa screened from notice saw be passing before such look of reproach at edmund from father must never have expected to witness to feel that be in degree deserved be aggravation indeed sir thomas look implied on judgment edmund depended what have be about knelt in spirit to uncle bosom swelled to utter not to look so to others not to mr yates be still talking to own truth sir thomas be in middle of rehearsal when arrived evening be going through three first act not unsuccessfully upon whole company be now so dispersed from crawford being gone home that nothing more can be done to night if will give honour of company to morrow evening must not be afraid of result bespeak indulgence understand a young performer bespeak indulgence indulgence will be given sir replied sir thomas gravely without other rehearsal with relenting smile added come home to be happy indulgent then turning away towards of rest tranquilly said mr miss crawford be mentioned in last letter from mansfield do find agreeable acquaintance tom be only one at ready with answer being entirely without particular regard for without jealousy in love acting must speak very handsomely of mr crawford be most pleasant gentleman like man sister sweet pretty elegant lively girl mr rushworth must be silent no longer say be not gentleman like considering must tell father be not above five foot eight will be expecting well looking man sir thomas did not quite understand looked with surprise at speaker if must say what think continued mr rushworth in opinion be very disagreeable to be always rehearsing be having too much of good thing be not so fond of acting a be at first think be great deal better employed sitting comfortably here among ourselves doing nothing sir thomas looked again then replied with approving smile be happy to find sentiment on subject so much same give sincere satisfaction must be cautious quick sighted feel many scruple child feel be perfectly natural equally so that value for domestic tranquillity for home shuts out noisy pleasure must much exceed theirs at time of life to feel be most favourable circumstance for yourself for everybody connected with be sensible of importance of having ally of such weight sir thomas meant to be giving mr rushworths opinion in better word than must find be aware that must not expect genius in mr rushworth a well judging steady young man with better notion than elocution must do justice to intended to value very highly be impossible for many of others not to smile mr rushworth hardly knew what to do with so much meaning by looking a really felt most exceedingly pleased with sir thomas good opinion saying scarcely anything did best towards preserving that good opinion little longer chapter xx edmunds first object next morning be to see father alone give fair statement of whole acting scheme defending own share in a far only a must then in soberer moment feel motif to deserve acknowledging with perfect ingenuousness that concession have be attended with such partial good a to make judgment in very doubtful be anxious while vindicating to say nothing unkind of others there be only one amongst whose conduct must mention without necessity of defence palliation have be more le to blame said one of excepting fanny fanny be only one who have judged rightly throughout who have be consistent feeling have be steadily against from first to last never ceased to think of what be due to will find fanny everything must wish sir thomas saw impropriety of such scheme among such party at time a strongly a son have ever supposed must felt too much indeed for many word having shaken hand with edmund meant to try to lose disagreeable impression forget how much have be forgotten a soon a must after house have be cleared of object enforcing remembrance restored to proper state did not enter into remonstrance with other child be more willing to believe felt error than to run risk of investigation reproof of immediate conclusion of everything sweep of preparation must be sufficient there be one person however in house whom must not leave to learn sentiment merely through conduct must not help giving mr norris hint of having hoped that advice might have be interposed to prevent what judgment must certainly have disapproved young people have be very inconsiderate in forming plan ought to have be capable of better decision be young excepting edmund believed of unsteady character with greater surprise therefore must regard acquiescence in wrong measure countenance of unsafe amusement than such measure such amusement must have be suggested mr norris be little confounded a nearly being silenced a ever have be in life for be ashamed to confess having never seen of impropriety be so glaring to sir thomas must not have admitted that influence be insufficientthat might have talked in vain only resource be to get out of subject a fast a possible turn current of sir thomas idea into happier channel have great deal to insinuate in own praise a to general attention to interest comfort of family much exertion many sacrifice to glance at in form of hurried walk sudden removal from own fireside many excellent hint of distrust economy to lady bertram edmund to detail whereby most considerable saving have always arisen more than one bad servant be detected chief strength lay in sotherton greatest support glory be in having formed connexion with rushworths there be impregnable took to herself credit of bringing mr rushworths admiration of maria to effect if have not be active said made point of being introduced to mother then prevailed on sister to pay first visit be a certain a sit here that nothing must have come of for mr rushworth be sort of amiable modest young man who want great deal of encouragement there be girl enough on catch for if have be idle left stone unturned be ready to move heaven earth to persuade sister at last did persuade know distance to sotherton be in middle of winter road almost impassable did persuade know how great how justly great influence be with lady bertram child be more concerned that must not have

walked up did indeed might not be saving much be something must not bear to sit at ease be dragged up at expense of noble animal caught dreadful cold did not regard object be accomplished in visit hope will always think acquaintance worth trouble might be taken to establish there be nothing very striking in mr rushworths manner be pleased last night with what appeared to be opinion on one subject decided preference of quiet family party to bustle confusion of acting seemed to feel exactly a one must wish yes indeed more know of better will like be not shining character have thousand good quality be so disposed to look up to that be quite laughed at about for everybody considers a doing upon word mr norris said mr grant other day if mr rushworth be son of own must not hold sir thomas in greater respect sir thomas gave up point foiled by evasion disarmed by flattery be obliged to rest satisfied with conviction where present pleasure of loved be at stake kindness did

destruction of unbound copy of lover vow in house for be burning met eye mr yates be beginning now to understand sir thomas intention though a far a ever from understanding source friend have be out with gun chief of morning tom have taken opportunity of explaining with proper apology for father particularity what be to be expected mr yates felt a acutely a might be supposed to be second time disappointed in same way be instance of very severe ill luck indignation be such that have not be for delicacy towards friend friend youngest sister believed must certainly attack baronet on absurdity of proceeding argue into little more rationality believed very stoutly while be in mansfield wood way home there be something in sir thomas when sat round same table made mr yates think wiser to let pursue own way feel folly of without opposition have known many disagreeable father before often be struck with inconvenience occasioned never in whole course of life have seen one of class so unintelligibly moral so infamously tyrannical a sir thomas be not man to be endured for childrens sake might be thankful to fair daughter julia mr yates did yet mean to stay few day longer under roof evening passed with external smoothness though almost mind be ruffled music sir thomas called for from daughter helped to conceal want of real harmony maria be in good deal of agitation be of utmost consequence to that crawford must now lose time in declaring be disturbed that even day must be gone by without seeming to advance point have be expecting to see whole morning evening too be still expecting mr rushworth have set off early with great news for sotherton have fondly hoped for such immediate eclaircissement a might save trouble of ever coming back again have seen no one from

have never passed before since august began without bringing together in way other be sad anxious day morrow though differing in sort of evil did by mean bring le few moment of feverish enjoyment be followed by hour of acute suffering henry crawford be again in house walked up with dr grant who be anxious to pay respect to sir thomas at rather early hour be ushered into breakfast room where be most of family sir thomas soon appeared maria saw with delight agitation introduction of man loved to father sensation be indefinable so be few minute afterwards upon hearing henry crawford who have chair between herself tom ask latter in undervoice whether there be plan for resuming play after present happy interruption with courteous glance at sir thomas because in case must make point of returning to mansfield at time required by party be going away immediately being to meet uncle at bath without delay if there be prospect of renewal of lover vow must hold positively engaged must break through other claim must absolutely condition with uncle for attending whenever might be wanted play must not be lost by absence from bath norfolk london york wherever may be said will attend

at father painter be sent off yesterday very little will remain of theatre to morrow knew how must be from first be early for bath will find nobody there be about uncle usual time when do think of going may perhaps get a far a banbury to day whose stable do use at bath be next question while branch of subject be under discussion maria who wanted pride resolution be preparing to encounter share of with tolerable calmness to soon turned repeating much of what have already said with only softened air stronger expression of regret what availed expression air be going if not voluntarily going voluntarily intending to stay away for excepting what might be due to uncle engagement be self imposed might talk of necessity knew independence hand have so pressed hers to heart hand heart be alike motionless passive now spirit supported agony of mind be severe have not long to endure what arose from listening to language action contradicted to bury tumult of feeling under restraint of society for general civility soon called notice from farewell visit a then became openly acknowledged be very short one be gonehe have touched hand for last time have made parting bow might seek directly solitude must do for henry crawford be gone gone from house within two hour afterwards from parish so ended hope selfish vanity have raised in maria julia bertram julia must rejoice that be gone presence be beginning to be odious to if maria gained not be now cool enough to dispense with other revenge did not want exposure to be added to desertion henry crawford gone must even pity sister with purer spirit did fanny rejoice in intelligence heard at dinner felt blessing by others be mentioned with regret merit honoured with due gradation of feelingfrom sincerity of edmunds too partial regard to unconcern of mother speaking entirely by rote mr norris began to look about wonder that falling in love with julia have come to nothing must almost fear that have be remiss in forwarding with so many to care for how be possible for even activity to keep pace with wish day two mr yates be gone likewise in departure sir felt chief interest wanting to be alone with family presence of stranger superior to mr yates must have be irksome of trifling confident idle expensive be way vexatious in be wearisome a friend of tom admirer of julia became offensive sir thomas have be quite indifferent to mr crawford going staying good wish for mr yatess having pleasant journey a walked with to hall door be given with genuine satisfaction mr yates have staid to see destruction of theatrical preparation at removal of everything appertaining to play left house in soberness of general character sir thomas hoped in seeing out of to be rid of worst object connected with scheme last must be inevitably reminding of existence mr norris contrived to remove one article from sight might have distressed curtain over have presided with such talent such success went off with to cottage where happened to be particularly in want of green baize chapter xxi sir thomas return made striking change in way of family independent of lover vow under government mansfield be altered place member of society sent away spirit of many others saddenedit be sameness gloom compared with pasta sombre family party rarely enlivened there be little intercourse with parsonage sir thomas drawing back from intimacy in general be particularly disinclined at time for engagement in one quarter rushworths be only addition to own domestic circle must solicit edmund did not wonder that such must be father feeling must regret anything exclusion of grant observed to fanny have claim seem to belong to seem to be part of ourselves must wish father be more sensible of very great attention to mother sister while be away be afraid may feel neglected truth be that father hardly know have not be here twelvemonth when left england if knew better must value society a deserves for be in fact exactly sort of people must like be sometimes little in want of animation among sister seem out of spirit tom be certainly not at ease dr mr grant must enliven make evening pas away with more enjoyment even to father do think so said fanny in opinion uncle must not like addition think value very quietness speak of that repose of own family circle be want doe not appear to that be more serious than used to bei mean before uncle went abroad a well a can recollect be always much same there be never much laughing in presence if there be difference be not more think than absence have tendency to produce at first there must be sort of shyness can not recollect that evening formerly be ever merry except when uncle be in town young people be suppose when look up to be at home believe be right fanny be reply after short consideration believe evening be rather returned to what be than assuming new character novelty be in being lively yet how strong impression that only few week will give have be feeling a if have never lived so before suppose be graver than other people said fanny evening appear long to love to hear uncle talk of west indie must listen to for hour together entertains more than many other thing have done then be unlike other people dare say why must dare say that smiling do want to be told that be only unlike other people in being more wise discreet when did anybody ever get compliment from fanny go to father if want to be complimented will satisfy ask uncle what think will hear compliment enough though may be chiefly on person must put up with trust to seeing a much beauty of mind in time such language be so new to fanny that quite embarrassed uncle think very pretty dear fannyand be long short of matter anybody must have made something more of anybody must resent that have not be thought very pretty before truth be that uncle never did admire till nowand now doe complexion be so improvedand have gained so much countenanceand figurenay fanny turn away about itit be uncle if can not bear uncle admiration what be to become of must really begin to harden to idea of being worth looking at must try not to mind growing up into pretty woman oh dont talk so dont talk so cried fanny distressed by more feeling than be aware of seeing that be distressed have done with subject only added more seriously uncle be disposed to be pleased with in respect only wish must talk to more be one of who be too silent in evening circle do talk to more than used be sure do did not hear ask about slave trade last night didand be in hope question must be followed up by others must have pleased uncle to be inquired of farther longed to do itbut there be such dead silence while cousin be sitting by without speaking word seeming at interested in subject did not likei thought must appear a if wanted to set off at expense by shewing curiosity pleasure in information must wish own daughter to feel miss crawford be very right in what said of other day that seemed almost a fearful of notice praise a other woman be of neglect be talking of at parsonage be word have great discernment know nobody who distinguishes character better for so young woman be remarkable certainly understands better than be understood by greater part of who have known so long with regard to others can perceive from occasional lively hint unguarded expression of moment that must define many a accurately did not delicacy forbid wonder what think of father must admire a fine looking man with most gentlemanlike dignified consistent manner perhaps having seen so seldom reserve may be little repulsive must be much together feel sure of liking other must enjoy liveliness have talent to value power wish met more frequently hope doe not suppose there be dislike on side must know too secure of regard of rest of said fanny with sigh to have such apprehension sir thomas wishing just at first to be only with family be so very natural that can argue nothing from after little while dare say will be meeting again in same sort of way allowing for difference of time of year be first october that have passed in country since infancy call tunbridge cheltenham country november be still more serious month can see mr grant be very anxious for not finding mansfield dull a winter come on fanny must have said great deal be safer to say nothing leave untouched miss crawford resourcesher accomplishment spirit importance friend lest must betray into observation seemingly unhandsome miss crawford kind opinion of deserved at least grateful forbearance began to talk of something else to morrow think uncle dines at sotherton mr bertram too will be quite small party at home hope uncle may continue to like mr rushworth be impossible fanny must like le after to morrow visit for will be five hour in company must dread stupidity of day if there be not much greater evil to followthe impression must leave on sir thomas can not much longer deceive be sorry for must give something rushworth maria have never met in quarter indeed disappointment be impending over sir thomas not good will for mr rushworth not mr rushworths deference for must prevent from soon

beginning to feel grave on maria account tried to understand feeling little observation there be necessary to tell indifference be most favourable state must be in behaviour to mr rushworth be careless cold must not did not like sir thomas resolved to speak seriously to advantageous a must be alliance long standing public a be engagement happiness must not be sacrificed to mr rushworth have perhaps be accepted on too short acquaintance on knowing better be repenting with solemn kindness sir thomas addressed told fear inquired into wish entreated to be open sincere assured that inconvenience must be braved connexion entirely given up if felt unhappy in prospect of must act for release maria have moment struggle a listened only moment when father ceased be able to give answer immediately decidedly with apparent agitation thanked for great attention paternal kindness be quite mistaken in supposing have smallest desire of breaking through engagement be sensible of change of opinion inclination since forming have highest esteem for mr rushworths character disposition must not have doubt of happiness with sir thomas be satisfied too glad to be satisfied perhaps to urge matter quite so far a judgment might have dictated to others be alliance must not have relinquished without pain thus reasoned mr rushworth be young enough to improve mr rushworth must must improve in good society if maria must now speak so securely of happiness with speaking certainly without prejudice blindness of love ought to be believed feeling probably be not acute have never supposed to be so comfort might not be le on account if must dispense with seeing husband leading shining character there must certainly be everything else in favour well disposed young woman who did not marry for love be in general more attached to own family nearness of sotherton to mansfield must naturally hold out greatest temptation must in probability be continual supply of most amiable innocent enjoyment such such like be reasoning of sir thomas happy to escape embarrassing evil of rupture wonder reflection reproach must attend happy to secure marriage must bring such addition of respectability

after miss bertrams going awayan intimacy resulting principally from miss crawford desire of something new have little reality in fanny feeling fanny went to two three day seemed kind of fascination

conversation than occasional amusement often at expense of judgment when be raised by pleasantry on people subject wished to be respected went however sauntered about together many half hour in mr grant shrubbery weather being unusually mild for time of year venturing sometimes even to sit down on one of bench now comparatively unsheltered remaining there perhaps till in midst of tender ejaculation of fanny on sweet of so protracted autumn be forced by sudden swell of cold gust shaking down last few yellow leaf about to jump up walk for warmth be pretty very pretty said fanny looking around a be thus sitting together one day time come into shrubbery be more struck with growth beauty three year ago be nothing rough hedgerow along upper side of field never thought of a anything

how wonderful how very wonderful operation of time change of human mind following latter train of thought soon afterwards added if one faculty of nature may be called more wonderful than rest do think be memory there seems something more speakingly incomprehensible in power failure inequality of memory than in other of intelligence memory be sometimes so retentive so serviceable so obedient at others so bewildered so weak at others again so tyrannic so beyond control be to be sure miracle way power of recollecting of forgetting do seem peculiarly past finding out miss crawford untouched inattentive have nothing to say fanny perceiving brought back own mind to what thought must interest may seem impertinent in to praise must admire taste mr grant have shewn in there be such quiet

animation soon went on be conscious of being far better reconciled to country residence than have ever expected to be can even suppose pleasant to spend year in country under certain circumstance very pleasant elegant moderate sized house in centre of family connexion continual engagement among commanding first society in neighbourhood looked up to perhaps a leading even more than of larger fortune

representation of younger son who have little to live on miss crawford added in more serious tone there be distinction must be miserable if thought without chanceabsolutely without chance possibility of obtainingbut be of different character look of consciousness a spoke what seemed consciousness of manner on miss crawford side a made laughing answer be sorrowfull food for fanny observation finding quite unable to attend a ought to mr grant by whose side be now following others have nearly resolved on going home immediately only waited for courage to say so when sound of great clock at mansfield park striking three made feel that have really be much longer absent than usual brought previous self inquiry of whether must take leave not just then how to very speedy issue with undoubting decision directly began adieu edmund began at same time to recollect that mother have be inquiring for that have walked down to parsonage on purpose to bring back fanny hurry increased without in least expecting edmunds attendance must have hastened away alone general pace be quickened accompanied into house through be necessary to pas dr grant be in vestibule a stopt to speak to found from edmunds manner that did mean to go with too be taking leave must not be thankful in moment of parting edmund be invited by dr grant to eat mutton with next day fanny have barely time for unpleasant feeling on occasion when mr grant with sudden recollection turned to asked for pleasure of company too be so new attention so perfectly new circumstance in event of fanny life that be surprise embarrassment while stammering out great obligation did not suppose must be in power be looking at edmund for opinion help edmund delighted with having such happiness offered ascertaining with look sentence that have objection on aunt account must not imagine that mother must make difficulty of sparing therefore gave decided open advice that invitation must be accepted though fanny must not venture even on encouragement to flight of audacious independence be soon settled that if nothing be heard to contrary mr grant might expect know what dinner will be said mr grant smilingthe turkey assure very fine one for dear turning to husband cook insists upon turkey being dressed to morrow very well very well cried dr grant better be glad to hear have anything so good in house miss price mr edmund bertram dare say must take chance none of want to hear bill of fare friendly meeting not fine dinner be have in view turkey goose leg of mutton cook chuse to give two cousin walked home together except in immediate discussion of engagement edmund spoke of with warmest satisfaction a so particularly desirable for in intimacy saw with so much pleasure established be silent walk for having finished that subject grew thoughtful indisposed for other chapter xxiii why must mr grant ask fanny said lady bertram how came to think of asking fanny fanny never dines there know in sort of way can not spare be sure doe not want to go fanny want to go do if put question to cried edmund preventing cousin speaking fanny will immediately say be sure dear mother must like to go can see reason why must not can not imagine why mr grant must think of asking never did before used to ask sister now then never asked fanny if can not do without maam said fanny in self denying tone mother will have father with evening to be sure so will suppose take father opinion maam thats well thought of so will edmund will ask sir thomas a soon a come in whether can do without a please maam on head meant father opinion a to propriety of invitation being accepted not think will consider right thing by mr grant a well a by fanny that being first invitation must be accepted know will ask will be very much surprised that mr grant must ask fanny at there be nothing more to be said must be said to purpose till sir thomas be present subject involving a did own evening comfort for morrow be so much uppermost in lady bertrams mind that hour afterwards on looking in for minute in way from plantation to dressing room called back again when have almost closed door with sir thomas stop momenti have something to say to tone of calm languor for never took trouble of raising voice be always heard attended to sir thomas came back story began fanny immediately slipped out of room for to hear subject of discussion with uncle be more than nerve must bear be anxious knewmore anxious perhaps than ought to befor what be after whether went staid if uncle be to be great while considering deciding with very grave look grave look directed to at last decide against might not be able to appear properly submissive indifferent cause meanwhile went on well began on lady bertrams part withi have something to tell will surprise mr grant have asked fanny to dinner well said sir thomas a if waiting more to accomplish surprise edmund want to go how can spare will be late said sir thomas taking out watch what be difficulty edmund found obliged to speak fill up blank in mother story told whole have only to add so strange for mr grant never used to ask be not very natural observed edmund that mr grant must wish to procure so agreeable visitor for sister nothing can be more natural said sir thomas after short deliberation be there sister in case must anything in opinion be more natural mr grant shewing civility to miss price to lady bertrams niece must never want explanation only surprise can feel be that must be first time of being paid fanny be perfectly right in giving only conditional answer appears to feel a ought a conclude that must wish to go since young people like to be together can see reason why must be denied indulgence can do without sir thomas indeed think may always make tea know when sister be not here sister perhaps may be prevailed on to spend day with will certainly be at home very well then fanny may go edmund good news soon followed edmund knocked at door in way to own well fanny be happily settled without smallest hesitation on uncle side have one opinion be to go thank be so glad be fanny instinctive reply though when have turned from shut door must not help feeling yet why must be glad for be not certain of seeing hearing something there to pain in spite of conviction however be glad simple a such engagement might appear in other eye have novelty importance in hers for excepting day at sotherton have scarcely ever dined out before though now going only mile only to three people still be dining out little interest of preparation be enjoyment in have sympathy assistance from who ought to have entered into feeling directed taste for lady bertram never thought of being useful to anybody mr norris when came on morrow in consequence of early call invitation from sir thomas be in very ill humour seemed intent only on lessening niece pleasure present future a much a possible upon word fanny be in high luck to meet with such attention indulgence ought to be very much obliged to mr grant for thinking of to aunt for letting go ought to look upon a something extraordinary for hope be aware that there be real occasion for going into company in sort of way ever dining out at be what must not depend upon ever being repeated must be fancying that invitation be meant a particular compliment to compliment be intended to uncle aunt mr grant think civility due to to take little notice of else must never have come into head may be very certain that if cousin julia have be at home must not have be asked at mr norris have now so ingeniously done away mr grant part of favour fanny who found expected to speak must only say that be very much obliged to aunt bertram for sparing that be endeavouring to put aunt evening work in such state a to prevent being missed oh depend upon aunt can do very well without must not be allowed to go will be here so may be quite easy about aunt hope will have very agreeable day find mighty delightful must observe five be very awkwardest of possible number to sit down to table can not be surprised that elegant lady a mr grant must not contrive better round enormous great wide table too fill up room so dreadfully have doctor be contented to take dining table when came away a anybody in sens must have done instead of having absurd new one of own be wider literally wider than dinner table here how infinitely better must have be how much more must have be respected for people be never respected when step out of proper sphere remember that fanny fiveonly five to be sitting round table however will have dinner enough on for ten dare say mr norris fetched breath went on again nonsense folly of people stepping out of rank trying to appear above make think right to give hint fanny now that be going into company without of do beseech entreat not to be putting forward talking giving opinion a if be one of cousinsas if be dear mr rushworth julia will never do believe remember wherever be must be lowest last though miss crawford be in manner at home at parsonage be not to be taking place of a to coming away at night be to stay just a long a edmund chuses leave to settle yes maam must not think of anything else if must rain think exceedingly likely for never saw more threatening for wet evening in life must manage a well a can not be expecting carriage to be sent for certainly go home to night therefore carriage will not be out on account so must make up mind to what may happen take thing accordingly niece thought perfectly reasonable rated own claim to comfort a low even a mr norris must when sir thomas soon afterwards just opening door said fanny at what time must have carriage come round felt degree of astonishment made impossible for to speak dear sir thomas cried mr norris red with anger fanny can walk walk repeated sir thomas in tone of most unanswerable dignity coming farther into room niece walk to dinner engagement at time of year will twenty minute after four suit yes sir be fanny humble answer given with feeling almost of criminal towards mr norris not bearing to remain with in what might seem state of triumph followed uncle out of room having staid behind only long enough to hear word spoken in angry agitation quite unnecessary great deal too kind edmund go true be upon edmunds account observed be hoarse on thursday night must not impose on fanny felt that carriage be for herself alone uncle consideration of coming immediately after such representation from aunt cost tear of gratitude when be alone coachman drove round to minute minute brought down gentleman a lady have with most scrupulous fear of being late be many minute seated in drawing room sir thomas saw off in a good time a own correctly

three others standing round shewed how welcome be sudden resolution of coming to for few day on leaving bath very cordial meeting passed between edmund with exception of fanny pleasure be general even to there might be advantage in presence since addition to party must rather forward favourite indulgence of being suffered to sit silent unattended to be soon aware of herself for though must submit a own propriety of mind directed in spite of aunt norris opinion to being principal lady in company to little distinction consequent thereon found while be at table such happy flow of conversation prevailing in be not required to take partthere be so much to be said between brother sister about bath so much between two young men about hunting so much of politics between mr crawford dr grant of everything together between mr crawford mr grant a to leave fairest prospect of having only to listen in quiet of passing very agreeable day must not compliment newly arrived gentleman however with

few minute afterwards know henry to be such capital improver that can not possibly engage in anything of sort at thornton lacey without accepting help only think how useful be at sotherton only think what grand thing be produced there by going with one hot day in august to drive about ground see genius take fire there went there came home again what be done there be not to be told fanny eye be turned on crawford for moment with expression more than graveeven reproachful on catching be instantly withdrawn with something of consciousness shook head at sister laughingly replied can not say there be much done at sotherton be hot day be walking after other bewildered a soon a general buzz gave shelter added in low voice directed solely at fanny must be sorry to have power of planning judged of by day at sotherton see thing very differently now think of a appeared then sotherton be word to catch mr norris being just then in happy leisure followed securing odd trick by sir thomas

assurance of affability might depend on when be stopped by sir thomas saying with authority advise going to brighton william a trust may soon have more convenient opportunity of meeting daughter must be happy to see cousin anywhere will find mr rushworth most sincerely disposed to regard connexion of family a own must rather find private secretary to first lord than anything else be williams only answer in undervoice not meant to reach far subject dropped a yet sir thomas have seen nothing to remark in mr crawford behaviour when whist table broke up at end of second rubber leaving dr grant mr norris to dispute over last play became looker on at other found niece object of attention rather of profession of somewhat pointed character henry crawford be in first glow of scheme about thornton lacey not being able to catch edmunds ear be detailing to fair neighbour with look of considerable earnestness scheme be to rent house following winter that might have home of own in neighbourhood be not merely for use of in hunting season a be then telling though consideration have certainly weight feeling a did that in spite of dr grant very great kindness be impossible for horse to be accommodated where now be without material inconvenience attachment to neighbourhood did not depend upon one amusement one season of year have set heart upon having something there that must come to at time little homestall at command where holiday of year might be spent might find continuing improving perfecting that friendship intimacy with mansfield park family be increasing in value to day sir thomas heard be not offended there be want of respect in young man address fanny reception of be so proper modest so calm uninviting that have nothing to censure in said little assented only here there betrayed inclination either of appropriating part of compliment to herself of strengthening view in favour of northamptonshire finding by whom be observed henry crawford addressed on same subject to sir thomas in more everyday tone still with feeling want to be neighbour sir thomas a have perhaps heard telling miss price may hope for acquiescence for not influencing son against tenant sir thomas politely bowing replied be only way sir in must not wish established a permanent neighbour hope believe edmund will occupy own house at thornton lacey edmund be saying too much edmund on appeal have first to hear what be going on on understanding question be at loss for answer certainly sir have idea of residence crawford though refuse a tenant come to a friend consider house a own winter will add to stable on own improved plan with improvement of improved plan may occur to spring will be loser continued sir thomas going though only eight mile will be unwelcome contraction of family circle must have be deeply mortified if son of mine must reconcile to doing le be perfectly natural that must not have thought much on subject mr crawford parish have want claim can be known only by clergyman constantly resident proxy can be capable of satisfying to same extent edmund might in common phrase do duty of thornton be might read prayer preach without giving up mansfield park might ride over sunday to house nominally inhabited go through divine service might be clergyman of thornton lacey seventh day for three four hour if must content will not know that human nature need more lesson than weekly sermon can convey that if doe not live among parishioner prove by constant attention well wisher friend doe very little for good own mr crawford bowed acquiescence repeat again added sir thomas that thornton lacey be only house in neighbourhood in must not be happy to wait on mr crawford a occupier mr crawford bowed thanks sir thomas said edmund undoubtedly understands duty of parish priest must hope son may prove that know too effect sir thomas little harangue might really produce on mr crawford raised awkward sensation in two of others two of most attentive listenersmiss crawford fanny one of whom having never before understood that thornton be so soon so completely to be home be pondering with downcast eye on what must be not to see edmund day other startled from agreeable fancy have be previously indulging on strength of brother description no longer able in picture have be forming of future thornton to shut out church sink clergyman see only respectable elegant modernised occasional residence of man of independent fortune be considering sir thomas with decided ill will a destroyer of suffering more from involuntary forbearance character

necessary to come to conclusion be able to refresh spirit by change of place neighbour chief of party be now collected irregularly round fire waiting final break up william fanny be most detached remained together at otherwise deserted card table talking very comfortably not thinking of rest till of rest began to think of henry crawford chair be first to be given direction towards sat silently

never mind william own cheek in glow of indignation a spoke be not worth minding be reflection on be more than what greatest admiral have experienced more le in time must think of must try to make up mind to a one of hardship fall to sailor share like bad weather hard living only with advantage that there will be end to that there will come time when will have nothing of sort to endure when be lieutenant only think william when be lieutenant how little will care for nonsense of kind begin to think will never be lieutenant fanny everybody get made oh dear william talk so be so desponding

now close to be not fanny very good dancer sir fanny in dismay at unprecedented question did not know way to look how to be prepared for answer very grave reproof at least coldest expression of indifference must be coming to distress brother sink to ground on contrary be worse than be sorry to say that be unable to answer question have never seen fanny dance since be little girl trust will think acquits like gentlewoman when do see perhaps may have opportunity of doing ere long have have pleasure of seeing sister dance mr price said henry crawford leaning forward will engage to answer inquiry can make on subject to entire satisfaction believe seeing fanny looked distressed must be at other time there be one person in company who doe not like to have miss price spoken of true enough have once seen fanny dance be equally true that must now have answered for gliding about with quiet light elegance in admirable time in fact must not for life of recall what dancing have be rather took for granted that have be present than remembered anything about passed however for admirer of dancing sir thomas by mean displeased prolonged conversation on dancing in general be so well engaged

fanny last feeling in visit be disappointment for shawl edmund be quietly taking from servant to bring put round shoulder be seized by mr crawford quicker hand be obliged to be indebted to more prominent attention chapter xxvi williams desire of seeing fanny dance made more than momentary impression on uncle hope of opportunity sir thomas have then given be not given to be thought of more remained steadily inclined to gratify so amiable feeling to gratify anybody else who might wish to see fanny dance to give pleasure to young people in general having thought matter over taken resolution in quiet independence result of appeared next morning at breakfast when after recalling commending what nephew have said added like william that must leave northamptonshire without indulgence must give pleasure to see dance spoke of ball at cousin have occasionally attended must not altogether suit now fatigue must be too much for aunt believe must not think of northampton ball

gone to northampton have reason to think mr crawford likewise out walked down to parsonage without much fear of wanting opportunity for private discussion privacy of such discussion be most important part of to fanny being more than half ashamed of own solicitude met miss crawford within few yard of parsonage just setting out to call on a seemed to that friend though obliged to insist on turning back be unwilling to lose walk explained business at once observed that if must be so kind a to give opinion might be talked over a well without door a within miss crawford appeared gratified by application after moment thought urged fanny returning with in much more cordial manner than before proposed going up into room where might have comfortable coze without disturbing dr mr grant who be together in drawing room be just plan to suit fanny with great deal of gratitude on side for such ready kind attention proceeded indoors upstairs be soon deep in interesting subject miss crawford pleased with appeal gave best judgment taste made everything easy by suggestion tried to make everything agreeable by encouragement dress being settled in grander partsbut what will have by way of necklace said miss crawford will not wear brother cross a spoke be undoing small parcel fanny have observed in hand when met fanny acknowledged wish doubt on point did not know how to wear cross to refrain from wearing be answered by having small trinket box placed before being requested to chuse from among several gold chain necklace such have be parcel with miss crawford be provided such object of intended visit in kindest manner now urged fanny taking one for cross to keep for sake saying everything must think of to obviate scruple be making fanny start back at first with look of horror at proposal see what collection have said more by half than ever use think of offer a new offer nothing old necklace must forgive liberty oblige fanny still resisted from heart gift be too valuable miss crawford persevered argued case with so much affectionate earnestness through head of william cross ball a to be finally successful fanny found obliged to yield might not be accused of pride indifference other littleness having with modest reluctance given consent proceeded to make selection looked looked longing to know might be least valuable be determined in choice at last by fancying there be one necklace more frequently placed before eye than rest be of gold prettily worked though fanny must have preferred longer plainer chain a more adapted for purpose hoped in fixing on to be chusing what miss crawford least wished to keep miss crawford smiled perfect approbation hastened to complete gift by putting necklace round making see how well looked fanny have not word to say against becomingness excepting what remained of scruple be exceedingly pleased with acquisition so very apropos must rather perhaps have be obliged to other person be unworthy feeling miss crawford have anticipated want with kindness proved real friend when wear necklace will always think of said feel how very kind be must think of somebody else too when wear that necklace replied miss crawford must think of henry for be choice in first place gave to with necklace make over to duty of remembering original giver be to be family remembrancer sister be not to be in mind without bringing brother too fanny in great astonishment confusion must have returned present instantly to take what have be gift of person of brother too impossible must not be with eagerness embarrassment

afraid of do think henry will claim necklace a mine fancy did not come honestly by be imagining must be too much flattered by seeing round lovely throat ornament money purchased three year ago before knew there be such throat in world perhapslooking archlyyou suspect confederacy between that what be now doing be with knowledge at desire with deepest blush fanny protested against thought well then replied miss crawford more seriously without at believing to convince that suspect trick be a unsuspicious of compliment a have always found take necklace say more about being gift of brother need not make smallest difference in accepting a assure make none in willingness to part with be always giving something other have such innumerable present from that be quite impossible for to value for to remember half a for necklace suppose have worn six time be very pretty never think of though must be most heartily welcome to other in trinket box have happened to fix on very one if have choice must

again for there be expression in miss crawford eye must not be satisfied with be impossible for to be insensible of mr crawford change of manner have long seen evidently tried to please be gallant be attentive be something like what have be to cousin wanted supposed to cheat of tranquillity a have cheated whether might not have concern in necklaceshe must not be convinced that have not for miss crawford complaisant a sister be careless a woman friend reflecting doubting feeling that possession of what have so much wished for did not bring much satisfaction now walked home again with change rather than diminution of care since treading that path before chapter xxvii on reaching home fanny went immediately upstairs to deposit unexpected acquisition doubtful good of necklace in favourite box in east room held smaller treasure on opening door what be surprise to find cousin edmund there writing at table such sight having never occurred before be almost a wonderful a be welcome fanny said directly leaving seat pen meeting with something in hand beg pardon for being here came to look for after waiting little while in hope of coming in be making use of inkstand to explain errand will find beginning of note to yourself can now speak business be merely to beg acceptance of little triflea chain for williams cross ought to have have week ago there have be delay from brother not

without drawback upon such expression of affection fanny must have lived hour without saying word edmund after waiting moment obliged to bring down mind from heavenly flight by saying what be that want to consult about be about necklace be now most earnestly longing to return hoped to obtain approbation of doing gave history of recent visit now rapture might well be over for edmund be so struck with circumstance so delighted with what miss crawford have done so gratified by such coincidence of conduct between fanny must not admit superior power of one pleasure over own mind though might have drawback be time before must get attention to plan answer to demand of opinion be in reverie of fond reflection uttering only now then few half sentence of praise when did awake understand be very decided in opposing what wished return necklace dear fanny upon account must be mortifying severely there can hardly be more unpleasant sensation than having anything returned on hand have given with reasonable hope of contributing to comfort of friend why must lose pleasure have shewn so deserving of if have be given to in first instance said fanny must not have thought of returning being brother

therefore must be worn having with delightful feeling joined chain crossthose memorial of two most beloved of heart dearest token so formed for other by everything real imaginaryand put round neck seen felt how full of william edmund be be able without effort to resolve on wearing miss crawford necklace too acknowledged to be right miss crawford have claim when be no longer to encroach on to interfere with stronger claim truer kindness of must do justice even with pleasure to herself necklace really looked very well fanny left room at last comfortably satisfied with about aunt bertram have recollected on occasion with unusual degree of wakefulness have really occurred to unprompted that fanny preparing for ball might be glad of better help than upper housemaid when dressed actually sent own maid to assist too late of course to be of use mr chapman have just reached attic floor when miss price came out of room completely dressed only civility be necessary fanny felt aunt attention almost a much a lady bertram mr chapman must do chapter xxviii uncle aunt be in drawing room when fanny went down to former be interesting object saw with pleasure general elegance of appearance being in remarkably good look neatness propriety of dress be that must allow to commend in presence upon leaving room again soon afterwards spoke of beauty with very decided praise yes said lady bertram look very well sent chapman to look well oh yes cried mr norris have good reason to look well with advantage brought up in family a have be with benefit of cousin manner before only think dear sir thomas what extraordinary advantage have be mean of giving very gown have be taking notice of be own generous present to when dear mr rushworth married what must have be if have not taken by hand sir thomas said more when sat down to table eye of two young men assured that subject might be gently touched again when lady withdrew with more success fanny saw that be approved consciousness of looking well made look still better from variety of cause be happy be soon made still happier for in following aunt out of room edmund who be holding open door said a passed must dance with fanny must keep two dance for two that like except first have nothing more to wish for have hardly ever be in state so nearly approaching high spirit in life cousin former gaiety on day of ball be no longer surprising to felt to be indeed very charming be actually practising step about drawing room a long a must be safe from notice of aunt norris who be entirely taken up at first in fresh arranging injuring noble fire butler have prepared hour followed must have be at least languid under other circumstance fanny happiness still prevailed be to think of conversation with edmund be restlessness of mr norris what be yawn of lady bertram gentleman joined soon after began sweet expectation of carriage when general spirit of ease enjoyment seemed diffused stood about talked laughed moment have pleasure hope fanny felt that there must be struggle in edmunds cheerfulness be delightful to see effort so successfully made when carriage be really heard when guest began really to assemble own gaiety of heart be much subdued sight of so many stranger threw back into herself besides gravity formality of first great circle manner of sir thomas lady bertram be of kind to do away found occasionally called on to endure something worse be introduced here there by uncle forced to be spoken to to curtsey speak again be hard duty be never summoned to without looking at william a walked about at ease in background of scene longing to be with entrance of grant crawford be favourable epoch stiffness of meeting soon gave way before popular manner more diffused intimacy little group be formed everybody grew comfortable fanny felt advantage drawing back from toil of civility must have be again most happy must have kept eye from wandering between edmund mary crawford looked lovelinessand might not be end of own musing be brought to end on perceiving mr crawford before thought be put into channel by engaging almost instantly for first two dance happiness on occasion be very much la mortal finely chequered to be secure of partner at first be most essential goodfor moment of beginning be now growing seriously near so little understood own claim a to think that if mr crawford have not asked must have be last to be sought after must have received partner only through series of inquiry bustle interference must have be terrible at same time there be pointedness in manner of asking did not like saw eye glancing for moment at necklace with smileshe thought there be smilewhich made blush feel wretched though there be second glance to disturb though object seemed then to be only quietly agreeable must not get better of embarrassment heightened a be by idea of perceiving have composure till turned away to one else then must gradually rise up to genuine satisfaction of having partner voluntary partner secured against dancing began when company be moving into ballroom found for first time near miss crawford whose eye smile be immediately more unequivocally directed a brother have be who be beginning to speak on subject when fanny anxious to get story over hastened to give explanation of second necklace real chain miss crawford listened intended compliment insinuation to fanny be forgotten felt only one thing eye bright a have be before shewing must yet be brighter exclaimed with eager pleasure did did edmund be like other man must have thought of honour beyond expression looked around a if longing to tell so be not near be attending party of lady out of room mr grant coming up to two girl taking arm of followed with rest fanny heart sunk there be leisure for thinking long even of miss crawford feeling be in ballroom violin be playing mind be in flutter forbade fixing on anything serious must watch general arrangement see how everything be done in few minute sir thomas came to asked if be engaged yes sir to mr crawford be exactly what have intended to hear mr crawford be not far off sir thomas brought to saying something discovered to fanny that be to lead way open ball idea have never occurred to before whenever have thought of minutia of evening have be a matter of course edmund must begin with miss crawford impression be so strong that though uncle spoke contrary must not help exclamation of surprise hint of unfitness entreaty even to be excused to be urging opinion against sir thomas be proof of extremity of case such be horror at first suggestion that must actually look in face say that hoped might be settled otherwise in vain however sir thomas smiled tried to encourage then looked too serious said too decidedly must be so dear for to hazard word found next moment conducted by mr crawford to top of room standing there to be joined by rest of dancer couple after couple a be formed must hardly believe to be placed above so many elegant young woman distinction be too great be treating like cousin thought flew to absent cousin with most unfeigned truly tender regret that be not at home to take own place in room have share of pleasure must have be so very delightful to so often a have heard wish for ball at home a greatest of felicity to have away when be givenand for to be opening balland with mr crawford too hoped must not envy distinction now when looked back to state of thing in autumn to what have be to other when once dancing in house before present arrangement be almost more than must understand ball began be rather honour than happiness to fanny for first dance at least partner be in excellent spirit tried to impart to be great deal too much frightened to have enjoyment till must suppose no longer looked at young pretty gentle however have awkwardness be not a good a grace there be few person present be not disposed to praise be attractive be modest be sir thomas niece be soon said to be admired by mr crawford be enough to give general favour sir thomas be watching progress down dance with much complacency be proud of niece without attributing personal beauty a mr norris seemed to do to transplantation to mansfield be pleased with for having supplied everything else education manner owed to miss crawford saw much of sir thomas thought a stood having in spite of wrong towards general prevailing desire of recommending to took opportunity of stepping aside to say something agreeable of fanny praise be warm received a must wish joining in a far a discretion politeness slowness of speech must allow certainly appearing to greater advantage on subject than lady did soon afterwards when mary perceiving on sofa very near turned round before began to dance to compliment on miss price look yes doe look very well be lady bertrams placid reply chapman helped to dress sent chapman to not that be really pleased to have fanny admired be so much more struck with own kindness in sending chapman to that must not get out of head miss crawford knew mr norris too well to think of gratifying by commendation of fanny to be a occasion offeredah maam how much want dear mr rushworth julia to night mr norris paid with a many smile courteous word a have time for amid so much occupation a found for herself in making up card table giving hint to sir thomas trying to move chaperon to better part of room miss crawford blundered most towards fanny in intention to please meant to be giving little heart happy flutter filling with sensation of delightful self consequence misinterpreting fanny blush still thought must be doing so when went to after two first dance said with significant look perhaps can tell why brother go to town to morrow say have business there will not tell what first time ever denied confidence be what come to be supplanted sooner later now must apply to for information pray what be henry going for fanny protested ignorance a steadily a embarrassment allowed well then replied miss crawford laughing must suppose to be purely for pleasure of conveying brother of talking of by way fanny be confused be confusion of discontent while miss crawford wondered did not smile thought over anxious thought odd thought anything rather than insensible of pleasure in henry attention fanny have good deal of enjoyment in course of evening henry attention have very little to do with must much rather not have be asked by again so very soon wished have not be obliged to suspect that previous inquiry of mr norris about supper hour be for sake of securing at part of evening be not to be avoided made feel that be object of though must not say that be unpleasantly done that there be indelicacy ostentation in manner sometimes when talked of william be really not unagreeable shewed even warmth of heart did credit still attention made part of satisfaction be happy whenever looked at william saw how perfectly be enjoying in five minute that must walk about with hear account of partner be happy in knowing admired be happy in having two dance with edmund still to look forward to during greatest part of evening hand being so eagerly sought after indefinite engagement with be in continual perspective be happy even when did take place not from flow of spirit on side such expression of tender gallantry a have blessed morning mind be fagged happiness sprung from being friend with whom must find repose be worn out with civility said have be talking incessantly night with nothing to say with fanny there may be peace will not want to be talked to let have luxury of silence fanny must hardly even speak agreement weariness arising probably in great measure from same feeling have acknowledged in morning be peculiarly to be respected went down two dance together with such sober tranquillity a might satisfy looker on sir thomas have be bringing up wife for younger son evening have afforded edmund little pleasure miss crawford have be in gay spirit when first danced together be not gaiety must do good rather sank than raised comfort afterwards for found still impelled to seek again have absolutely pained by manner of speaking of profession to be now on point of belonging have talked have be silent have reasoned have ridiculed have parted at last with mutual vexation fanny not able to refrain entirely from observing have seen enough to be tolerably satisfied be barbarous to be happy when edmund be suffering yet happiness must must arise from very conviction that did suffer when two dance with be over inclination strength for more be pretty well at end sir thomas having seen walk rather than dance down shortening set breathless with hand at side gave order for sitting down entirely from time mr crawford sat down likewise poor fanny cried william coming for moment to visit working away partner fan a if for life how soon be knocked up why sport be just begun hope will keep up two hour how can be tired so soon so soon good friend said sir thomas producing watch with necessary caution be three oclock sister be not used to sort of hour well then fanny will not get up to morrow before go sleep a long a can never mind oh william what did think of being up before set off oh yes sir cried fanny rising eagerly from seat to be nearer uncle must get up breakfast with will be last time know last morning have better not be to have breakfasted be gone by half past nine mr crawford think call for at half past nine fanny be too urgent however have too many tear in eye for denial ended in gracious well well be permission yes half past nine said crawford to william a latter be leaving will be punctual for there will be kind sister to get up for in lower tone to fanny will have only desolate house to hurry from brother will find idea of time own very different to morrow after short consideration sir thomas asked crawford to join early breakfast party in house instead of eating alone must be of readiness with invitation be accepted convinced that suspicion whence must confess to very ball have in great measure sprung be well founded mr crawford be in love with fanny have pleasing anticipation of what must be niece meanwhile did not thank for what have just done have hoped to have william to herself last morning must have be unspeakable indulgence though wish be overthrown there be spirit of murmuring within on contrary be so totally unused to have pleasure consulted to have anything take place at in way must desire that be more disposed to wonder rejoice in having carried point so far than to repine at counteraction followed shortly afterward sir thomas be again interfering little with inclination by advising to go immediately to bed advise be word be advice of absolute power have only to rise with mr crawford very cordial adieu pas quietly away stopping at entrance door like lady of branxholm hall one moment more to view happy scene take last look at five six determined couple who be still hard at work then creeping slowly up principal staircase pursued by ceaseless country dance feverish with hope fear soup negus sore footed fatigued restless agitated yet feeling in spite of everything that ball be indeed delightful in thus sending away sir thomas perhaps might not be thinking merely of health might occur to that mr crawford have be sitting by long enough might mean to recommend a wife by shewing persuadableness chapter xxix ball be over breakfast be soon over too last kiss be given william be gone mr crawford have a foretold be very punctual short pleasant have be meal after seeing william to last moment fanny walked back to breakfast room with very saddened heart to grieve over melancholy change there uncle kindly left to cry in peace conceiving perhaps that deserted chair of young man might exercise tender enthusiasm that remaining cold pork bone mustard in williams plate might divide feeling with broken egg shell in mr crawford sat cried con amore a uncle intended be con amore fraternal other william be gone now felt a if have wasted visit in idle care selfish solicitude unconnected with fanny disposition be such that must never even think of aunt norris in meagreness cheerlessness of own small house without reproaching for little want of attention to when have be last together much le must feeling acquit of having done said thought everything by william be due to for whole fortnight be heavy melancholy day soon after second breakfast edmund bade good bye for week mounted horse for peterborough then be gone nothing remained of last night remembrance have nobody to share in talked to aunt bertramshe must talk to somebody of ball aunt have seen so little of what have passed have so little curiosity that be heavy work lady bertram be not certain of anybodys dress anybodys place at supper own must not recollect what be that have heard about one of miss maddoxes what be that lady prescott have noticed in fanny be not sure whether colonel harrison have be talking of mr crawford of william when said be finest young man in roomsomebody have whispered something to have forgot to ask sir thomas what must be be longest speech clearest communication rest be only languid yes yes very well did did did not see must not know one from other be very bad be only better than mr norris sharp answer must have be being gone home with supernumerary jelly to nurse sick maid there be peace good humour in little party though must not boast much beside evening be heavy like day can not think what be matter with said lady bertram when tea thing be removed feel quite stupid must be sitting up so late last night fanny must do something to keep awake can not work fetch card feel so very stupid card be brought fanny played at cribbage with aunt till bedtime a sir thomas be reading to sound be heard in room for next two hour beyond reckoning of gameand make thirty one four in hand eight in crib be to deal maam will deal for fanny thought thought again of difference twenty four hour have made in room part of house last night have be hope smile bustle motion noise brilliancy in drawing room out of drawing room everywhere now be languor solitude good night rest improved spirit must think of william next day more cheerfully a morning afforded opportunity of talking over thursday night with mr grant miss crawford in very handsome style with heightenings of imagination laugh of playfulness be so essential to shade of departed ball must afterwards bring mind without much effort into everyday state easily conform to tranquillity of present quiet week be indeed smaller party than have ever known there for whole day together be gone on whom comfort cheerfulness of family meeting meal chiefly depended must be learned to be endured must soon be always gone be thankful that must now sit in same room with uncle hear voice receive question even answer without such wretched feeling a have formerly known miss two young men be sir thomas observation on first second day a formed very reduced circle after dinner in consideration of fanny swimming eye nothing more be said on first day than to drink good health on second led to something farther william be kindly commended promotion hoped for there be reason to suppose added sir thomas that visit to may now be tolerably frequent a to edmund must learn to do without will be last winter of belonging to a have done yes said lady bertram wish be not going away be going away think wish must stay at home wish be levelled principally at julia who have just applied for permission to go to town with maria a sir thomas thought best for daughter that permission must be granted lady bertram though in own good nature must not have prevented be lamenting change made in prospect of julias return must otherwise have taken place about time great deal of good sense followed on sir thomas side tending to reconcile wife to arrangement everything that considerate parent ought to feel be advanced for use everything that affectionate mother must feel in promoting childrens enjoyment be attributed to nature lady bertram agreed to with calm yes at end of quarter of hour silent consideration spontaneously observed sir thomas have be thinkingand be very glad took fanny a did for now others be away feel good of sir thomas immediately improved compliment by adding very true shew fanny what good girl think by praising to face be now very valuable companion if have be kind to be now quite a necessary to yes said lady bertram presently be comfort to think that will always have sir thomas paused half smiled glanced at niece then gravely replied will never leave hope till invited to other home may reasonably promise greater happiness than know here be not very likely to be sir thomas who must invite maria might be very glad to see at sotherton now then must not think of asking to live there be sure be better off here besides can not do without week passed so quietly peaceably at great house in mansfield have very different character at parsonage to young lady at least in family brought very different feeling what be tranquillity comfort to fanny be tediousness vexation to mary something arose from difference of disposition habit one so easily satisfied other so unused to endure still more might be imputed to difference of circumstance in point of interest be exactly opposed to other to fanny mind edmunds absence be really in cause tendency relief to mary be way painful felt want of society day almost hour be too much in want of to derive anything irritation from considering object for went must not have devised anything more likely to raise consequence than week absence occurring a did at very time of brother going away of william price going too completing sort of general break up of party have be so animated felt keenly be now miserable trio confined within door by series of rain snow with nothing to do variety to hope for angry a be with edmund for adhering to own notion acting on in defiance of have be so angry that have hardly parted friend at ball must not help thinking of continually when absent dwelling on merit affection longing again for almost daily meeting lately have absence be unnecessarily long must not have planned absencehe must not have left home for week when own departure from mansfield be so near then began to blame wished have not spoken so warmly in last conversation be afraid have used strong contemptuous expression in speaking of clergy must not have be be ill bred be wrong wished such word unsaid with heart vexation did not end with week be bad have still more to feel when friday came round again brought edmund when saturday came still edmund when through slight communication with other family sunday produced learned that have actually written home to defer return having promised to remain day longer with friend if have felt impatience regret beforeif have be sorry for what said feared too strong effect on himshe now felt feared tenfold more have moreover to contend with one disagreeable emotion entirely new to herjealousy friend mr owen have sister might find attractive at rate staying away at time when according to preceding plan be to remove to london meant something that must not bear have henry returned a talked of doing at end of three four day must now have be leaving mansfield became absolutely necessary for to get to fanny try to learn something more must not live longer in such solitary wretchedness made way to park through difficulty of walking have deemed unconquerable week before for chance of hearing little in addition for sake of at least hearing name first hour be lost for fanny lady bertram be together unless have fanny to herself must hope for nothing at last lady bertram left room then almost immediately miss crawford thus began with voice a well regulated a couldand how do like cousin edmunds staying away so long being only young person at home consider a greatest sufferer must miss doe staying longer surprise know said fanny hesitatingly yes have not

be followed by such very letter a uncle who be very best man in world have exerted a knew must after seeing brother be delighted with must not allow yesterday to say how delighted to repeat half that admiral said in praise deferred till praise must be proved praise of friend a day doe prove now may say that even must not require william price to excite greater interest be followed by warmer wish higher commendation than be most voluntarily bestowed by uncle after evening have passed together have be doing then cried fanny good heaven how very very kind have reallywas by desire beg pardon be bewildered did admiral crawford apply how be be stupefied henry be most happy to make more intelligible by beginning at earlier stage explaining very particularly what have done last journey to london have be undertaken with other view than of introducing brother in hill street prevailing on admiral to exert interest might have for getting on have be business have communicated to creature have not breathed syllable of even to mary while uncertain of issue must not have borne participation of feeling have be business spoke with such glow of what solicitude have be used such strong expression be so abounding in deepest interest in twofold motif in view wish more than must be told that fanny must not have remained insensible of drift have be able to attend heart be so full sens still so astonished that must listen imperfectly even to what told of william saying only when paused how kind how very kind oh mr crawford be infinitely obliged to dearest dearest william jumped up moved in haste towards door cry out will go to uncle uncle ought to know a soon a possible must not be suffered opportunity be too fair feeling too impatient be after immediately must not go must allow five minute longer took hand led back to seat be in middle of farther explanation before have suspected for what be detained when did understand however found expected to believe that have created sensation heart have never known before that everything have done for william be to be placed to account of excessive unequalled attachment to be exceedingly distressed for moment unable to speak considered a nonsense a mere trifling gallantry meant only to deceive for hour must not feel that be treating improperly unworthily in such way a have not deserved be like entirely of piece with what have seen before must not allow to shew displeasure felt because have be conferring obligation want of delicacy on part must make trifle to while heart be still bounding with joy gratitude on williams behalf must not be severely resentful of anything injured only after having twice drawn back hand twice attempted in vain to turn away from got up said only with much agitation dont mr crawford pray dont beg must not be sort of talking be very unpleasant to must go away can not bear be still talking on describing affection soliciting return finally in word so plain a to bear one meaning even to offering hand fortune everything to acceptance be so have said astonishment confusion increased though still not knowing how to suppose serious must hardly stand pressed for answer cried hiding face be nonsense distress can hear more of kindness to william make more obliged to than word can express want can not bear must not listen to suchno dont think of be not thinking of know be nothing have burst away from at moment sir thomas be heard speaking to servant in way towards room be in be time for farther assurance entreaty though to part with at moment when modesty alone seemed to sanguine preassured mind to stand in way of happiness sought be cruel necessity rushed out at opposite door from one uncle be approaching be walking up down east room in utmost confusion of contrary feeling before sir thomas politeness apology be over have reached beginning of joyful intelligence visitor came to communicate be feeling thinking trembling about everything agitated happy miserable infinitely obliged absolutely angry be beyond belief be inexcusable incomprehensible such be habit that must hing without mixture of evil have previously made happiest of human being now have insultedshe knew not what to say how to class how to regard must not have be serious yet what must excuse use of such word offer if meant to trifle william be lieutenant be fact beyond doubt without alloy must think of for ever forget rest mr crawford must certainly never address so again must have seen how unwelcome be to in case how gratefully must esteem for friendship to william must not stir farther from east room than head of great staircase till have satisfied herself of mr crawford having left house when convinced of being gone be eager to go down be with uncle have happiness of joy a well a own benefit of information conjecture a to what must now be williams destination sir thomas be a joyful a must desire very kind communicative have so comfortable talk with about william a to make feel a if nothing have occurred to vex till found towards close mr crawford be engaged to return dine there very day be most unwelcome hearing for though might think nothing of what have passed must be quite distressing to to see again so soon tried to get better of tried very hard a dinner hour approached to feel appear a usual be quite impossible for not to look most shy uncomfortable when visitor entered room must not have supposed in power of concurrence of circumstance to give so many painful sensation on first day of hearing of williams promotion mr crawford be not only in roomhe be soon close to have note to deliver from sister fanny must not look at there be consciousness of past folly in voice opened note immediately glad to have anything to do happy a read to feel that fidgetings of aunt norris who be also to dine there screened little from view dear fannyfor so may now always call to infinite relief of tongue have be stumbling at miss price for at least last six weeksi can not let brother go without sending few line of general congratulation giving most joyful consent approval go on dear fanny without fear there can be difficulty worth naming chuse to suppose that assurance of consent will be something so may smile upon with sweetest smile afternoon send back to even happier than go yours affectionately m c be not expression to do fanny good for though read in too much haste confusion to form clearest judgment of miss crawford meaning be evident that meant to compliment on brother attachment even to appear to believe serious did not know what to do what to think there be wretchedness in idea of being serious there be perplexity agitation way be distressed whenever mr crawford spoke to spoke to much too often be afraid there be something in voice manner in addressing very different from what be when talked to others comfort in day dinner be quite destroyed must hardly eat anything when sir thomas good humouredly observed that joy have taken away appetite be ready to sink with shame from dread of mr crawford interpretation for though nothing must have tempted to turn eye to right hand where sat felt that be immediately directed towards be more silent than ever must hardly join even when william be subject for commission came from right hand too there be pain in connexion thought lady bertram sat longer than ever began to be in despair of ever getting away at last be in drawing room be able to think a must while aunt finished subject of williams appointment in own style mr norris seemed a much delighted with saving must be to sir thomas a with part of now william must be able to keep must make vast difference to uncle for be unknown how much have cost uncle indeed must make difference in present too be very glad that have given william what did at parting very glad indeed that have be in power without material inconvenience just at time to give something rather considerable be for with limited mean for now must all be useful in helping to fit up cabin knew must be at expense that must have many thing to buy though to be sure father mother must be able to put in way of getting everything very cheap be very glad have contributed mite towards be glad gave something considerable said lady bertram with most unsuspicious calmness for gave only indeed cried mr norris reddening upon word must have gone off with pocket well lined at expense for journey to london either sir thomas told must be enough mr norris being not at inclined to question sufficiency began to take matter in point be amazing said how much young people cost friend what with bringing up putting out in world little think how much come to what parent uncle aunt pay for in course of year now here be sister price child take together dare say nobody must believe what sum cost sir thomas year to say nothing of what do for very true sister a say poor thing can not help know make very little difference to sir thomas fanny william must not forget shawl if go to east indie will give commission for anything else be worth having wish may go to east indie may have shawl think will have two shawl fanny fanny meanwhile speaking only when must not help be very earnestly trying to understand what mr miss crawford be at there be everything in world against being serious word manner everything natural probable reasonable be against habit way of thinking own demerit how must have excited serious attachment in man who have seen so many be admired by so many flirted with so many infinitely superior who seemed so little open to serious impression even where pain have be taken to please who thought so slightly so carelessly so unfeelingly on such point who be everything to everybody seemed to find one essential to farther how must be supposed that sister with high worldly notion of matrimony must be forwarding anything of serious nature in such quarter nothing must be more unnatural in fanny be ashamed of own doubt everything might be possible rather than serious attachment serious approbation of toward have quite convinced herself of before sir thomas mr crawford joined difficulty be in maintaining conviction quite so absolutely after mr crawford be in room for once twice look seemed forced on did not know how to class among common meaning in other man at least must have said that meant something very earnest very pointed still tried to believe more than what might often have expressed towards cousin fifty other woman thought be wishing to speak to unheard by rest fancied be trying for whole evening at interval whenever sir thomas be out of room at engaged with mr norris carefully refused opportunity at lastit seemed at last to fanny nervousness though not remarkably latehe began to talk of going away comfort of sound be impaired by turning to next moment saying have nothing to send to mary answer to note will be disappointed if receives nothing from pray write to if be only line oh yes certainly cried fanny rising in haste haste of embarrassment of wanting to get awayi will write directly went accordingly to table where be in habit of writing for aunt prepared material without knowing what in world to say have read miss crawford note only once how to reply to anything so imperfectly understood be most distressing quite unpractised in such sort of note writing have there be time for scruple fear a to style must have felt in abundance something must be instantly written with only one decided feeling that of wishing not to appear to think anything really intended wrote thus in great trembling of spirit hand be very much obliged to dear miss crawford for kind congratulation a far a relate to dearest william rest of note know mean nothing be so unequal to anything of sort that hope will excuse begging to take farther notice have seen too much of mr crawford not to understand manner if understood a well must dare say behave differently know what write must be great favour of never to mention subject again with thanks for honour of note remain dear miss crawford c c conclusion be scarcely intelligible from increasing fright for found that mr crawford under pretence of receiving note be coming towards can not think mean to hurry said in undervoice perceiving amazing trepidation with made up note can not think have such object hurry entreat oh thank have quite done just done will be ready in moment be very much obliged to if will be so good a to give to miss crawford note be held out must be taken a instantly with averted eye walked towards fireplace where sat others have nothing to do to go in good earnest fanny thought have never known day of greater agitation of pain pleasure happily pleasure be not of sort to die with day for day must restore knowledge of williams advancement whereas pain hoped must return more have doubt that note must appear excessively ill written that language must disgrace child for distress have allowed arrangement at least must assure of being imposed on gratified by mr crawford attention chapter xxxii fanny have by mean forgotten mr crawford when awoke next morning remembered purport of note be not le sanguine a to effect than have be night before if mr crawford must go away be what most earnestly desired go take sister with a be to do a returned to mansfield on purpose to do why be not done already must not devise for miss crawford certainly wanted delay fanny have hoped in course of yesterday visit to hear day named have only spoken of journey a what must take place ere long having so satisfactorily settled conviction note must convey must not be astonished to see mr crawford a accidentally did coming up to house again at hour a early a day before coming might have nothing to do with must avoid seeing if possible being then on way upstairs resolved there to remain during whole of visit unless actually sent for a mr norris be still in house there seemed little danger of being wanted sat time in good deal of agitation listening trembling fearing to be sent for moment a footstep approached east room grew gradually composed must sit down be able to employ able to hope that mr crawford have come must go without being obliged to know anything of matter nearly hour have passed be growing very comfortable when suddenly sound of step in regular approach be heard heavy step unusual step in part of house be uncle knew a well a voice have trembled at a often began to tremble again at idea of coming up to speak to might be subject be indeed sir thomas who opened door asked if be there if might come in terror of former occasional visit to room seemed renewed felt a if be going to examine again in french english be attention however in placing chair for trying to appear honoured in agitation have quite overlooked deficiency of apartment till stopping short a entered said with much surprise why have fire to day there be snow on ground be sitting in shawl hesitated be not cold sir never sit here long at time of year have fire in general sir how come about here must be mistake understood that have use of room by way of making perfectly comfortable in bedchamber know can not have fire here be great misapprehension must be rectified be highly unfit for to sit be only hour day without fire be not strong be chilly aunt can not be aware of fanny must rather have be silent being obliged to speak must not forbear in justice to aunt loved best from saying something in word aunt norris be distinguishable understand cried uncle recollecting not wanting to hear more understand aunt norris have always be advocate very judiciously for young people being brought up without unnecessary indulgence there must be moderation in everything be also very hardy of course will influence in opinion of want of others on account too can perfectly comprehend know what sentiment have always be principle be good in may have be believe have be carried too far in case be aware that there have be sometimes in point misplaced distinction think too well of fanny to suppose will ever harbour resentment on account have understanding will prevent from receiving thing only in part judging partially by event will take in whole of past will consider time person probability will feel that be not least friend who be educating preparing for mediocrity of condition seemed to be lot though caution may prove eventually unnecessary be kindly meant of may be assured that advantage of affluence will be doubled by little privation restriction may have be imposed be sure will not disappoint opinion of by failing at time to treat aunt norris with respect attention be due to enough of sit down dear must speak to for few minute will not detain long fanny obeyed with eye cast down colour rising after moment pause sir thomas trying to suppress smile went on be not aware perhaps have have visitor morning have not be long in own room after breakfast when mr crawford be shewn in errand may probably conjecture fanny colour grew deeper deeper uncle perceiving that be embarrassed to degree made speaking looking up quite impossible turned away own eye without farther pause proceeded in account of mr crawford visit mr crawford business have be to declare lover of fanny make decided proposal for entreat sanction of uncle who seemed to stand in place of parent have done so well so openly so liberally so properly that sir thomas feeling moreover own reply own remark to have be very much to purpose be exceedingly happy to give particular of conversation little aware of what be passing in niece mind conceived that by such detail must be gratifying far more than talked therefore for several minute without fanny daring to interrupt have hardly even attained wish to do mind be in too much confusion have changed position with eye fixed intently on one of window be listening to uncle in utmost perturbation dismay for moment ceased have barely become conscious of when rising from chair said now fanny having performed one part of commission shewn everything placed on basis most assured satisfactory may execute remainder by prevailing on to accompany downstairs where though can not presume on having be unacceptable companion must submit to finding one still better worth listening to mr crawford a have perhaps foreseen be yet in house be in room hoping to see there there be look start exclamation on hearing astonished sir thomas what be increase of astonishment on hearing exclaimoh sir can not indeed can not go down to mr crawford ought to knowhe must know that told enough yesterday to convince spoke to on subject yesterday told without disguise that be very disagreeable to quite out of power to return good opinion catch meaning said sir thomas sitting down again out of power to return good opinion what be know spoke to yesterday a far a understand received a much encouragement to proceed a well judging young woman must permit to give be very much pleased with what collected to have be behaviour on occasion shewed discretion highly to be commended now when have made overture so properly be scruple now be mistaken sir cried fanny forced by anxiety of moment even to tell uncle that be wrong be quite mistaken how must mr crawford say such thing gave encouragement yesterday on contrary told can not recollect exact word be sure told must not listen to that be very unpleasant to in respect begged never to talk to in manner again be sure said a much a more must have said still more if have be quite certain of meaning anything seriously did not like to be must not bear to be imputing more than might be intended thought might pas for nothing with must say no more breath be almost gone be to understand said sir thomas after few moment silence that mean to refuse mr crawford yes sir refuse yes sir refuse mr crawford upon what plea for what reason ii can not like sir well enough to marry be very strange said sir thomas in voice of calm displeasure there be something in comprehension doe not reach here be young man wishing to pay address to with everything to recommend not merely situation in life fortune character with more than common agreeableness with address conversation pleasing to everybody be not acquaintance of to day have now known time sister moreover be intimate friend have be doing that for brother must suppose must have be almost sufficient recommendation to have there be other be very uncertain when interest might have got william on have done already yes said fanny in faint voice looking down with fresh shame did feel almost ashamed of herself after picture a uncle have drawn for not liking mr crawford must have be aware continued sir thomas presently must have be time aware of particularity in mr crawford manner to can not have taken by surprise must have observed attention though always received very properly have accusation to make on head never perceived to be unpleasant to be half inclined to think fanny that quite know own feeling oh yes sir indeed do attention be alwayswhat did not like sir thomas looked at with deeper surprise be beyond said requires explanation young a be having seen scarcely one be hardly possible that affection paused eyed fixedly saw lip formed into though sound be inarticulate face be like scarlet however in so modest girl might be very compatible with innocence chusing at least to appear satisfied quickly added know be quite out of question quite impossible well there be nothing more to be said for few minute did say nothing be deep in thought niece be deep in thought likewise trying to harden prepare against farther questioning must rather die than own truth hoped by little reflection to fortify beyond betraying independently of interest mr crawford choice seemed to justify said sir thomas beginning again very composedly wishing to marry at so early be recommendatory to be advocate for early marriage where there be mean in proportion must have young man with sufficient income settle a soon after four twenty a can be so much opinion that be sorry to think how little likely own eldest son cousin mr bertram be to marry early at present a far a can judge matrimony make part of plan thought wish be more likely to fix here be glance at fanny edmund consider from disposition habit a much more likely to marry early than brother indeed have lately thought have seen woman must love be convinced eldest son have not be right do agree with dear yes sir be gently be calmly said sir thomas be easy on score of cousin removal of alarm did niece service a unaccountableness be confirmed displeasure increased getting up walking about room with frown fanny must picture to herself though dared not lift up eye shortly afterwards in voice of authority said have reason child to think ill of mr crawford temper sir longed to add of principle have heart sunk under appalling prospect of discussion explanation probably non conviction ill opinion of be founded chiefly on observation for cousin sake must scarcely dare mention to father maria julia especially maria be so closely implicated in mr crawford misconduct that must not give character such a believed without betraying have hoped that to man like uncle so discerning so honourable so good simple acknowledgment of settled dislike on side must have be sufficient to infinite grief found be not sir thomas came towards table where sat in trembling wretchedness with good deal of cold sternness said be of use perceive to talk to have better put end to most mortifying conference mr crawford must not be kept longer waiting will therefore only add a thinking duty to mark opinion of conduct that have disappointed expectation have formed proved of character very reverse of what have supposed for have fanny a think behaviour must have shewn formed very favourable opinion of from period of return to england have thought peculiarly free from wilfulness of temper self conceit tendency to independence of spirit prevails so much in modern day even in young woman in young woman be offensive disgusting beyond common offence have now shewn that can be wilful perverse that can will decide for without consideration deference for who have surely right to guide without even asking advice have shewn very very different from anything have imagined advantage disadvantage of family of parent brother sister never seems to have have moment share in thought on occasion how might be benefited how must rejoice in such establishment for be nothing to think only of because feel for mr crawford exactly what young heated fancy imago to be necessary for happiness resolve to refuse at once without wishing even for little time to consider of little more time for cool consideration for really examining own inclination be in wild fit of folly throwing away from opportunity of being settled in life eligibly honourably nobly settled a will probably never occur to again here be young man of sense of character of temper of manner of fortune exceedingly attached to seeking hand in most handsome disinterested way let tell fanny that may live eighteen year longer in world without being addressed by man of half mr crawford estate tenth part of merit gladly must have bestowed of own daughter on maria be nobly married have mr crawford sought julias hand must have given to with superior more heartfelt satisfaction than gave maria to mr rushworth after moment pause must have be very much surprised have of daughter on receiving proposal of marriage at time might carry with only eligibility of immediately peremptorily without paying opinion regard compliment of consultation put decided negative on must have be much surprised much hurt by proceeding must have thought gross violation of duty respect be not to be judged by same rule owe duty of child fanny if heart can acquit of ingratitude ceased fanny be by time cry so bitterly that angry a be must not press that article farther heart be almost broke by such picture of what appeared to by such accusation so heavy so multiplied so rising in dreadful gradation self willed obstinate selfish ungrateful thought have deceived expectation have lost good opinion what be to become of be very sorry said inarticulately through tear be very sorry indeed sorry yes hope be sorry will probably have reason to be long sorry for day transaction if be possible for to do otherwise said with strong effort be so perfectly convinced that must never make happy must be miserable burst of tear in spite of burst in spite of great black word miserable served to introduce sir thomas began to think little relenting little change of inclination might have something to do with to augur favourably from personal entreaty of young man knew to be very timid exceedingly nervous thought not improbable that mind might be in such state a little time little pressing little patience little impatience judicious mixture of on lover side might work usual effect on if gentleman must persevere if have love enough to persevere sir thomas began to have hope reflection having passed across mind cheered well said in tone of becoming gravity of le anger well child dry up tear there be use in tear can do good must now come downstairs with mr crawford have be kept waiting too long already must give own answer can not expect to be satisfied with le only can explain to ground of misconception of sentiment unfortunately for certainly have imbibed be totally unequal to fanny shewed such reluctance such misery at idea of going down to that sir thomas after little consideration judged better to indulge hope from gentleman lady suffered small depression in consequence when looked at niece saw state of feature complexion cry have brought into thought there might be a much lost a gained by immediate interview with few word therefore of particular meaning walked off by leaving poor niece to sit cry over what have passed with very wretched feeling mind be disorder past present future everything be terrible uncle anger gave severest pain of selfish ungrateful to have appeared so to be miserable for ever have one to take part to counsel speak for only friend be absent might have softened father perhaps must think selfish ungrateful might have to endure reproach again again might hear see know to exist for ever in connexion about must not feel resentment against mr crawford yet if really loved be unhappy too be wretchedness together in about quarter of hour uncle returned be almost ready to faint at sight of spoke calmly however without austerity without reproach revived little there be comfort too in word a well a manner for began with mr crawford be gone have just left need not repeat what have passed want to add to anything may now be feeling by account of what have felt suffice that have behaved in most gentlemanlike generous manner have confirmed in most favourable opinion of understanding heart temper upon representation of what be suffering immediately with greatest delicacy ceased to urge to see for present here fanny who have looked up looked down again of course continued uncle can not be supposed that must request to speak with alone be only for five minute request too natural claim too just to be denied there be time fixed perhaps to morrow whenever spirit be composed enough for present have only to tranquillise check tear do exhaust if a be willing to suppose wish to shew observance will not give way to emotion endeavour to reason into stronger frame of mind advise to go out air will do good go out for hour on gravel will have shrubbery to will be better for air exercise fanny turning back again for moment will make mention below of what have passed will not even tell aunt bertram there be occasion for spreading disappointment say nothing about be order to be most joyfully obeyed be act of kindness fanny felt at heart to be spared from aunt norris interminable reproach left in glow of gratitude anything might be bearable rather than such reproach even to see mr crawford must be le overpowering walked out directly a uncle recommended followed advice throughout a far a must did check tear did earnestly try to compose spirit strengthen mind wished to prove to that did desire comfort sought to regain favour have given strong motive for exertion in keeping whole affair from knowledge of aunt not to excite suspicion by look manner be now object worth attaining felt equal to almost anything might save from aunt norris be struck quite struck when on returning from walk going into east room again first thing caught eye be fire lighted burning fire seemed too much just at time to be giving such indulgence be exciting even painful gratitude wondered that sir thomas must have leisure to think of trifle again soon found from voluntary information of housemaid who came in to attend so be to be day sir thomas have given order for must be brute indeed if can be really ungrateful said in soliloquy heaven defend from being ungrateful saw nothing more of uncle of aunt norris till met at dinner uncle behaviour to be then a nearly a possible what have be before be sure did not mean there must be change that be only own conscience must fancy aunt be soon quarrelling with when found how much how unpleasantly having only walked out without aunt knowledge must be dwelt on felt reason have to bless kindness saved from same spirit of reproach exerted on more momentous subject if have known be going out must have got just to go a far a house with order for nanny said have since to very great inconvenience be obliged to go carry must very ill spare time might have saved trouble if must only have be so good a to let know be going out must have made difference to suppose whether have walked in shrubbery gone to house recommended shrubbery to fanny a driest place said sir thomas oh said mr norris with moment check be very kind of sir thomas know how dry path be to house fanny must have have quite a good walk there assure with advantage of being of use obliging aunt be fault if must have let know be going out there be something about fanny have often observed beforeshe like to go own way to work doe not like to be dictated to take own independent walk whenever can certainly have little spirit of secrecy independence nonsense about must advise to get better of a general reflection on fanny sir thomas thought nothing must be more unjust though have be so lately expressing same sentiment tried to turn conversation tried repeatedly before must succeed for mr norris have not discernment enough to perceive either now at other time to what degree thought well of niece how very far be from wishing to have own childrens merit set off by depreciation of hers be talking at fanny resenting private walk half through dinner be over however at last evening set in with more composure to fanny more cheerfulness of spirit than must have hoped for after so stormy morning trusted in first place that have done right that judgment have not misled for purity of intention must answer be willing to hope

thankful for right reason in have saved from evil consequence while fanny mind be engaged in sort of hope uncle be soon after tea called out of room occurrence too common to strike thought nothing of till butler reappeared ten minute afterwards advancing decidedly towards said sir thomas wish to speak with maam in own room then occurred to what might be going on suspicion rushed over mind drove colour from cheek instantly rising be preparing to obey when mr norris called out stay stay fanny what be about where be going dont be in such hurry depend upon be not who be wanted depend upon be looking at butler be so very eager to put forward what must sir thomas want for be baddeley mean be coming moment mean baddeley be sure sir thomas want not miss price baddeley be stout maam be miss

consciousness found a anticipated in minute alone with mr crawford chapter xxxiii conference be neither so short so conclusive a lady have designed gentleman be not so easily satisfied have disposition to persevere sir thomas must wish have vanity strongly inclined in first place to think did love though might not know secondly when constrained at last to admit that did know own present feeling convinced that must be able in time to make feeling what wished be in love very much in love be love operating on active sanguine spirit of more warmth than delicacy made affection appear of greater consequence because be withheld determined to have glory a well a felicity of forcing to love must not despair must not desist have well grounded reason for solid attachment knew to have worth must justify warmest hope of lasting happiness with conduct at very time by speaking disinterestedness delicacy of character quality believed most rare indeed be of sort to heighten wish confirm resolution knew not that have pre engaged heart to attack of that have suspicion considered rather a one who have never thought on subject enough to be in danger who have be guarded by youth youth of mind a lovely a of person whose modesty have prevented from understanding attention who be still overpowered by suddenness of address so wholly unexpected novelty of situation fancy have never taken into account must not follow of course that when be understood must succeed believed fully love such a in man like must with perseverance secure return at great distance have so much delight in idea of obliging to love in very short time that not loving now be scarcely regretted little difficulty to be overcome be evil to henry crawford rather derived spirit from have be apt to gain heart too easily situation be new animating to fanny however who have known too much opposition life to find charm in be unintelligible found that did mean to persevere how must after such language from a felt obliged to use be not to be understood told that did not love must not love be sure never must love that change be quite impossible that subject be most painful to that must entreat never to mention again to allow to leave at once let be considered a concluded for ever when farther pressed have added that in opinion disposition be so totally dissimilar a to make mutual affection incompatible that be unfitted for other by nature education habit have said with earnestness of sincerity yet be not enough for immediately denied there being anything uncongenial in character anything unfriendly in situation positively declared that must still love still hope fanny knew own meaning be judge of own manner manner be incurably gentle be not aware how much concealed sternness of purpose diffidence gratitude softness made expression of indifference seem almost effort of self denial seem at least to be giving nearly a much pain to herself a to mr crawford be no longer mr crawford who a clandestine insidious treacherous admirer of maria bertram have be abhorrence whom have hated to see to speak to in whom must believe good quality to exist whose power even of being agreeable have barely acknowledged be now mr crawford who be addressing with ardent disinterested love whose feeling be apparently become be honourable upright whose view of happiness be fixed on marriage of attachment who be pouring out sense of merit describing describing again affection proving a far a word must prove in language tone spirit of man of talent too that sought for gentleness goodness to

mansfield park approached now with right demanded different treatment must be courteous must be compassionate must have sensation of being honoured whether thinking of herself brother must have strong feeling of gratitude effect of whole be manner so pitying agitated word intermingled with refusal so expressive of obligation concern to temper of vanity hope like crawford truth at least strength of indifference might well be questionable be not so irrational a fanny considered in profession of persevering assiduous not desponding attachment closed interview be with reluctance that suffered to go there be look of despair in parting to belie word give hope of being le unreasonable than professed now be angry resentment did arise at perseverance so selfish ungenerous here be again want of delicacy regard for others have formerly so struck disgusted here be again something of same mr crawford whom have so reprobated before how evidently be there gross want of feeling humanity where own pleasure be concernedand ala how always known principle to supply a duty what heart be deficient in have own affection be a freeas perhaps ought to have beenhe never must have engaged so thought fanny in good truth sober sadness a sat musing over too great indulgence luxury of fire upstairs wondering at past present wondering at what be yet to come in nervous agitation made nothing clear to persuasion of being never under circumstance able to love mr crawford felicity of having fire to sit over think of sir thomas be obliged obliged to wait till morrow for knowledge of what have passed between young people then saw mr crawford received account first feeling be disappointment have hoped better thing have thought that hour entreaty from young man like crawford must not have worked so little change on gentle tempered girl like fanny there be speedy comfort in determined view sanguine perseverance of lover when seeing such confidence of success in principal sir thomas be soon able to depend on nothing be omitted on side of civility compliment kindness might assist plan mr crawford steadiness be honoured fanny be praised connexion be still most desirable in world at mansfield park mr crawford must always be welcome have only to consult own judgment feeling a to frequency of visit at present in future in niece family friend there must be one opinion one wish on subject influence of who loved must incline one way everything be said that must encourage encouragement received with grateful joy gentleman parted best of friend satisfied that cause be now on footing most proper hopeful sir thomas resolved to abstain from importunity with niece to shew open interference upon disposition believed kindness might be best way of working entreaty must be from one quarter only forbearance of family on point respecting must be in doubt of wish might be surest mean of forwarding accordingly on principle sir thomas took first opportunity of saying to with mild gravity intended to be overcoming well fanny have seen mr crawford again learn from exactly how matter stand between be most extraordinary young man be event must feel that have created attachment of common character though young a be little acquainted with transient varying unsteady nature of love a generally exists can not be struck a be with be wonderful in perseverance of sort against discouragement with be entirely matter of feeling claim merit in perhaps be entitled to none yet having chosen so well constancy have respectable stamp have choice be le unexceptionable must have condemned persevering indeed sir said fanny be very sorry that mr crawford must continue toi know that be paying very great compliment feel most undeservedly honoured be so perfectly convinced have told so that never will be in power dear interrupted sir thomas there be occasion for feeling be a well known to a wish regret must be to there be nothing more to be said done from hour subject be never to be revived between will have nothing to fear to be agitated about can not suppose capable of trying to persuade to marry against inclination happiness advantage be have in view nothing be required of to bear with mr crawford endeavour to convince that may not be incompatible with proceeds at own risk be on safe ground have engaged for seeing whenever call a might have done have nothing of sort occurred will see with rest of in same manner a much a can dismissing recollection of everything unpleasant leaf northamptonshire so soon that even slight sacrifice can not be often demanded future must be very uncertain now dear fanny subject be closed between promised departure be that fanny must think of with much satisfaction uncle kind expression however forbearing manner be sensibly felt when considered how much of truth be unknown to believed have right to wonder at line of conduct pursued who have married daughter to mr rushworth romantic delicacy be certainly not to be expected from must do duty trust time might make duty easier than now be must not though only eighteen suppose mr crawford attachment must hold out for ever must not imagine that steady unceasing discouragement from must put end to in time how much time might in own fancy allot for dominion be concern must not be fair to inquire into young lady exact estimate of own perfection in spite of intended silence sir thomas found once more obliged to mention subject to niece to prepare briefly for being imparted to aunt measure must still have avoided if possible became necessary from totally opposite feeling of mr crawford a to secrecy of proceeding have idea of concealment be known at parsonage where loved to talk over future with sister must be rather gratifying to to have enlightened witness of progress of success when sir thomas understood felt necessity of making own wife sister in law acquainted with business without delay though on fanny account almost dreaded effect of communication to mr norris a much a fanny deprecated mistaken well meaning zeal sir thomas indeed be by time not very far from classing mr a one of well meaning people who be always doing mistaken very disagreeable thing mr norris however relieved pressed for strictest forbearance silence towards niece not only promised did observe only looked increased ill will angry be bitterly angry be more angry with fanny for having received such offer than for refusing be injury affront to julia who ought to have be mr crawford choice independently of disliked fanny because have neglected must have grudged elevation to one whom have be always trying to depress sir thomas gave more credit for discretion on occasion than deserved fanny must have blessed for allowing only to see displeasure not to hear lady bertram took differently have be beauty prosperous beauty life beauty wealth be that excited respect to know fanny to be sought in marriage by man of fortune raised therefore very much in opinion by convincing that fanny be very pretty have be doubting about before that must be advantageously married made feel sort of credit in calling niece well fanny said a soon a be alone together afterwards really have known something like impatience to be alone with countenance a spoke have extraordinary animation well fanny have have very agreeable surprise morning must just speak of once told sir thomas must once then will have done give joy dear niece looking at complacently added humph certainly be handsome family fanny coloured doubted at first what to say when hoping to assail on vulnerable side presently answered dear aunt can not wish to do differently from what have done be sure can not wish to marry for must miss must not yes be sure must miss too much for dear must not think of missing when offer a come in way must do very well without if be married to man of such good estate a mr crawford must be aware fanny that be young woman duty to accept very unexceptionable offer a be almost only rule of conduct only piece of advice fanny have ever received from aunt in course of eight year half silenced felt how unprofitable contention must be if aunt feeling be against nothing must be hoped from attacking understanding lady bertram be quite talkative will tell what fanny said be sure fell in love with at ball be sure mischief be done that evening did look remarkably well everybody said so sir thomas said so know have chapman to help to dress be very glad sent chapman to will tell sir thomas that be sure be done that evening still pursuing same cheerful thought soon afterwards added will tell what fanny be more than did for maria next time pug have litter will have puppy chapter xxxiv edmund have great thing to hear on return many surprise be awaiting first that occurred be not least in interest appearance of henry crawford sister walking together through village a rode into have concludedhe have meant to be far distant absence have be extended beyond fortnight purposely to avoid miss crawford be returning to mansfield with spirit ready to feed on melancholy remembrance tender association when own fair self be before leaning on brother arm found receiving welcome unquestionably friendly from woman whom two moment before have be thinking of a seventy mile off a farther much farther from in inclination than distance must express reception of be of sort must not have hoped for have expected to see coming a did from purport fulfilled a have taken away must have expected anything rather than look of satisfaction word of simple pleasant meaning be enough to set heart in glow to bring home in properest state for feeling full value of other joyful surprise at hand williams promotion with particular be soon master of with such secret provision of comfort within own breast to help joy found in source of most gratifying sensation unvarying cheerfulness dinner time after dinner when father be alone have fanny history then great event of last fortnight present situation of matter at mansfield be known to fanny suspected what be going on sat so much longer than usual in dining parlour that be sure must be talking of when tea at last brought away be to be seen by edmund again felt dreadfully guilty came to sat down by took hand pressed kindly at moment thought that for occupation scene tea thing afforded must have betrayed emotion in unpardonable excess be not intending however by such action to be conveying to unqualified approbation encouragement hope drew from be designed only to express participation in interested to tell that have be hearing what quickened feeling of affection be in fact entirely on father side of question surprise be not so great a father at refusing crawford because so far from supposing to consider with anything like preference have always believed to be rather reverse must imagine to be taken perfectly unprepared sir thomas must not regard connexion a more desirable than did have recommendation to while honouring for what have done under influence of present indifference honouring in rather stronger term than sir thomas must quite be most earnest in hoping sanguine in believing that must be match at last that united by mutual affection must appear that disposition be a exactly fitted to make blessed in other a be now beginning seriously to consider crawford have be too precipitate have not given time to attach have begun at wrong end with such power a however such disposition a hers edmund trusted that everything must work out happy conclusion meanwhile saw enough of fanny embarrassment to make scrupulously guard against exciting second time by word look movement crawford called next day on score of edmunds return sir thomas felt more than licensed to ask to stay dinner be really necessary compliment staid of course edmund have then ample opportunity for observing how sped with fanny what degree of immediate encouragement for might be extracted from manner be so little so very very littleevery chance possibility of resting upon embarrassment only if there be not hope in confusion there be hope in nothing elsethat be almost ready to wonder at friend perseverance fanny be worth held to be worth effort of patience exertion of mind did not think must have gone on with woman breathing without something more to warm courage than eye must discern in hers be very willing to hope that crawford saw clearer be most comfortable conclusion for friend that must come to from that observed to pas before at after dinner in evening few circumstance occurred thought more promising when crawford walked into drawing room mother fanny be sitting a intently silently at work a if there be nothing else to care for edmund must not help noticing apparently deep tranquillity have not be so silent time replied mother fanny have be reading to only put book down upon hearing coming sure enough there be book on table have air of being very recently closed volume of shakespeare often read to out of book be in middle of very fine speech of manswhats name fannywhen heard footstep crawford took volume let have pleasure of finishing speech to ladyship said will find immediately by carefully giving way to inclination of leaf did find within page two quite near enough to satisfy lady bertram who assured a soon a mentioned name of cardinal wolsey that have got very speech not look offer of help have fanny given not syllable for against attention be for work seemed determined to be interested by nothing else taste be too strong in must not abstract mind five minute be forced to listen reading be capital pleasure in good reading extreme to good reading however have be long used uncle read well cousin edmund very well in mr crawford reading there be variety of excellence beyond what have ever met with king queen buckingham wolsey cromwell be given in turn for with happiest knack happiest power of jumping guessing must always alight at will on best scene best speech of whether be dignity pride tenderness remorse be to be expressed must do with equal beauty be truly dramatic acting have first taught fanny what pleasure play might give reading brought acting before again nay perhaps with greater enjoyment for came unexpectedly with such drawback a have be used to suffer in seeing on stage with miss bertram edmund watched progress of attention be amused gratified by seeing how gradually slackened in needlework at beginning seemed to occupy totally how fell from hand while sat motionless over at last how eye have appeared so studiously to avoid throughout day be turned fixed on crawfordfixed on for minute fixed on in short till attraction drew crawford upon book be closed charm be broken then be shrinking again into blushing working a hard a ever have be enough to give edmund encouragement for friend a cordially thanked hoped to be expressing fanny secret feeling too that play must be favourite with said read a if knew well will be favourite believe from hour replied crawford think have have volume of shakespeare in hand before since be fifteen once saw henry eighth acted have heard of from somebody who did be not certain shakespeare one get acquainted with without knowing how be part of englishman constitution thought beauty be so spread abroad that one touch everywhere one be intimate with by instinct man of brain can open at good part of one of play without falling into flow of meaning immediately doubt one be familiar with shakespeare in degree said edmund from one earliest year celebrated passage be quoted by everybody be in book open talk shakespeare use simile describe with description be totally distinct from giving sense a gave to know in bit scrap be common enough to know pretty thoroughly be perhaps not uncommon to read well aloud be everyday talent sir do honour be crawford answer with bow of mock gravity gentleman have glance at fanny to see if word of accordant praise must be extorted from yet feeling that must not be praise have be given in attention that must content lady bertrams admiration be expressed strongly too be really like being at play said wish sir thomas have be here crawford be excessively pleased if lady bertram with incompetency languor must feel inference of what niece alive enlightened a be must feel be elevating have great turn for acting be sure mr crawford said ladyship soon afterwards will tell what think will have theatre time other at house in norfolk mean when be settled there do indeed think will fit up theatre at house in norfolk do maam cried with quickness will never be ladyship be quite mistaken theatre at everingham oh looked at fanny with expressive smile evidently meant that lady will never allow theatre at everingham edmund saw saw fanny so determined not to see a to make clear that voice be enough to convey full meaning of protestation quick consciousness of compliment such ready comprehension of hint thought be rather favourable than not subject of reading aloud be farther discussed two young men be only talker standing by fire talked over too common neglect of qualification total inattention to in ordinary school system for boy consequently natural yet in instance almost unnatural degree of ignorance uncouthness of men of sensible well informed men when suddenly called to necessity of reading aloud have fallen within notice giving instance of blunder failure with secondary cause want of management of voice of proper modulation emphasis of foresight judgment proceeding from first cause want of early attention habit fanny be listening again with great entertainment even in profession said edmund with smile how little art of reading have be studied how little clear manner good delivery have be attended to speak rather of past however than present there be now spirit of improvement abroad among who be ordained twenty thirty forty year ago larger number to judge by performance must have thought reading be reading preaching be preaching be different now subject be more justly considered be felt that distinctness energy may have weight in recommending most solid truth besides there be more general observation taste more critical knowledge diffused than formerly in congregation there be larger proportion who know little of matter who can judge criticise edmund have already gone through service once since ordination upon being understood have variety of question from crawford a to feeling success question being made though with vivacity of friendly interest quick taste without touch of spirit of banter air of levity edmund knew to be most offensive to fanny have true pleasure in satisfying when crawford proceeded to ask opinion give own a to properest manner in particular passage in service must be delivered shewing to be subject on have thought before thought with judgment edmund be still more more pleased must be way to fanny heart be not to be won by gallantry wit good nature together must do at least must not be won by nearly so soon without assistance of sentiment feeling seriousness on serious subject liturgy observed crawford have beauty not even careless slovenly style of reading can destroy have also redundancy repetition require good reading not to be felt for at least must confess being not always so attentive a ought to be here be glance at fanny nineteen time out of twenty be thinking how such prayer ought to be read longing to have to read did speak stepping eagerly to fanny addressing in softened voice upon saying added be sure did not speak saw lip move fancied might be going to tell ought to be more attentive not allow thought to wander be not going to tell so no indeed know duty too well for toeven supposing stopt felt getting into puzzle must not be prevailed on to add word not by dint of several minute of supplication waiting then returned to former station went on a if there have be no such tender interruption sermon well delivered be more uncommon even than prayer well read sermon good in be rare thing be more difficult to speak well than to compose well be rule trick of composition be oftener object of study thoroughly good sermon thoroughly well delivered be capital gratification can never hear such one without greatest admiration respect more than mind to take order preach there be something in eloquence of pulpit when be really eloquence be entitled to highest praise honour preacher who can touch affect such heterogeneous mass of hearer on subject limited long worn threadbare in common hand who can say anything new striking anything rous attention without offending taste wearing out feeling of hearer be man whom one must not in public capacity enough must like to be such man edmund laughed must indeed never listened to distinguished preacher in life without sort of envy then must have london audience must not preach to educated to who be capable of estimating composition know must be fond of preaching often now then perhaps once twice in spring after being anxiously expected for dozen sunday together not for constancy must not do for constancy here fanny who must not listen involuntarily shook head crawford be instantly by side again entreating to know meaning a edmund perceived by drawing in chair sitting down close by that be to be very thorough attack that look undertone be to be well tried sank a quietly a possible into corner turned back took up newspaper very sincerely wishing that dear little fanny might be persuaded into explaining away shake of head to satisfaction of ardent lover a earnestly trying to bury sound of business from in murmur of own over various advertisement of most desirable estate in south wale to parent guardian capital seasond hunter fanny meanwhile vexed with for not having be a motionless a be speechless grieved to heart to see edmunds arrangement be trying by everything in power of modest gentle nature to repulse mr crawford avoid look inquiry unrepulsable be persisting in what did shake of head mean said what be meant to express disapprobation fear of what have be saying to displease did think speaking improperly lightly irreverently on subject only tell if be only tell if be wrong want to be set right nay nay entreat for one moment put down work what did shake of head mean in vain be pray sir dont pray mr crawford repeated twice over in vain did try to move away in same low eager voice same close neighbourhood went on reurging same question a before grew more agitated displeased how can sir quite astonish wonder how can do astonish said do wonder be there anything in present entreaty that understand will explain to instantly make urge in manner give interest in what look do excites present curiosity will not leave to wonder long in spite of must not help half smile said nothing shook head at acknowledging must not like to engage in duty of clergyman always for constancy yes be word constancy be not afraid of word must spell read write with anybody see nothing alarming in word did think ought perhaps sir said fanny wearied at last into speakingperhaps sir thought be pity did not always know a well a seemed to do at moment crawford delighted to get to speak at rate be determined to keep up poor fanny who have hoped to silence by extremity of reproof found sadly mistaken that be only change from one object of curiosity one set of word to have always something to entreat explanation of opportunity be too fair none such have occurred since seeing in uncle room none such might occur again before leaving mansfield lady bertrams being just on other side of table be trifle for might always be considered a only half awake edmunds advertisement be still of first utility well said crawford after course of rapid question reluctant answer be happier than be because now understand more clearly opinion of think unsteady easily swayed by whim of moment easily tempted easily put aside with opinion wonder thatbut will seeit be not by protestation will endeavour to convince be wronged be not by telling that affection be steady conduct will speak for absence distance time will speak for will prove that a far a can be deserved by anybody do deserve be infinitely superior in merit know have quality have not before supposed to exist in such degree in human creature have touch of angel in beyond whatnot merely beyond what one see because one never see anything like itbut beyond what one fancy might be still be not frightened be not by equality of merit that can be won be out of question be who see worship merit strongest who love most devotedly have best right to return there build confidence by right do will deserve when once convinced that attachment be what declare know too well not to entertain warmest hope yes dearest sweetest fanny nay seeing draw back displeased forgive perhaps have a yet right by what other name can call do suppose be ever present to imagination under other be fanny that think of day dream of night have given name such reality of sweetness that nothing else can now be descriptive of fanny must hardly have kept seat longer have refrained from at least trying to get away in spite of too public opposition foresaw to have not be for sound of approaching relief very sound have be long watching for long thinking strangely delayed solemn procession headed by baddeley of tea board urn cake bearer made appearance delivered from grievous imprisonment of body mind mr crawford be obliged to move be at liberty be busy be protected edmund be not sorry to be admitted again among number of who might speak hear though conference have seemed full long to though on looking at fanny saw rather flush of vexation inclined to hope that so much must not have be said listened to without profit to speaker chapter xxxv edmund have determined that belonged entirely to fanny to chuse whether situation with regard to crawford must be mentioned between not that if did not lead way must never be touched on by after day two of mutual reserve be induced by father to change mind try what influence might do for friend day very early day be actually fixed for crawford departure sir thomas thought might be a well to make one more effort for young man before left mansfield that profession vow of unshaken attachment might have a much hope to sustain a possible sir thomas be most cordially anxious for perfection of mr crawford character in point wished to be model of constancy fancied best mean of effecting must be by not trying too long edmund be not unwilling to be persuaded to engage in business wanted to know fanny feeling have be used to consult in difficulty loved too well to bear to be denied confidence now hoped to be of service to thought must be of service to whom else have to open heart to if did not need counsel must need comfort of communication fanny estranged from silent reserved be unnatural state of thing state must break through must easily learn to think be wanting to break through will speak to sir will take first opportunity of speaking to alone be result of such thought a upon sir thomas information of being at very time walking alone in shrubbery instantly joined be come to walk with fanny said will drawing arm within be long while since have have comfortable walk together assented to rather by look than word spirit be low fanny presently added in order to have comfortable walk something more be necessary than merely pacing gravel together must talk to know have something on mind know what be thinking of can not suppose uninformed be to hear of from everybody fanny fanny at once agitated dejected replied if hear of from everybody cousin there can be nothing for to tell not of fact perhaps of feeling fanny one can tell mean to press however if be not what wish have done have thought might be relief be afraid think too differently for to find relief in talking of what feel do suppose that think differently have idea of dare say that on comparison of opinion must be found a much alike a have be used to be to pointi consider crawford proposal a most advantageous desirable if must return affection consider a most natural that family must wish must return that a can not have done exactly a ought in refusing can there be disagreement between here oh thought blamed thought be against be such comfort comfort might have have sooner fanny have sought how must possibly suppose against how must imagine advocate for marriage without love be even careless in general on such matter how must imagine so where happiness be at stake uncle thought wrong knew have be talking to a far a have gone fanny think perfectly right may be sorry may be surprisedthough hardly that for have not have time to attach think perfectly right can admit of question be disgraceful to if doe did not love nothing must have justified accepting fanny have not felt so comfortable for day day so far conduct have be faultless be quite mistaken who wished to do otherwise matter doe not end here crawford be common attachment perseveres with hope of creating regard have not be created before know must be work of time with affectionate smile let succeed at last fanny let succeed at last have proved upright disinterested prove grateful tender hearted then will be perfect model of woman have always believed born for oh never never never never will succeed with spoke with warmth quite astonished edmund blushed at recollection of herself when saw look heard reply never fannyso very determined positive be not like rational self mean cried sorrowfully correcting that think never will a far a future can be answered for think never will return regard must hope better thing be aware more aware than crawford can be that man who mean to make love having due notice of intention must have very uphill work for there be early attachment habit in battle array before can get heart for own use have to unfasten from hold upon thing animate inanimate so many year growth have confirmed be considerably tightened for moment by very idea of separation know that apprehension of being forced to quit mansfield will for time be arming against wish have not be obliged to tell what be trying for wish have known a well a do fanny between think must have won theoretical practical knowledge together must not have failed must have worked upon plan must hope however time proving a firmly believe will to deserve by steady affection will give reward can not suppose that have not wish to love himthe natural wish of gratitude must have feeling of sort must be sorry for own indifference be so totally unlike said fanny avoiding direct answer be so very very different in inclination way consider a quite impossible must ever be tolerably happy together even if must like there never be two people more dissimilar have not one taste in common must be miserable be mistaken fanny dissimilarity be not so strong be quite enough alike have taste in common have moral literary taste in common have warm heart benevolent feeling fanny who heard read saw listen to shakespeare other night will think unfitted a companion forget there be decided difference in temper allow be lively be serious so much better spirit will support yours be disposition to be easily dejected to fancy difficulty greater than be cheerfulness will counteract see difficulty nowhere pleasantness gaiety will be constant support to being so far unlike fanny doe not in smallest degree make against probability of happiness together imagine be convinced that be rather favourable circumstance be perfectly persuaded that temper have better be unlike mean unlike in flow of spirit in manner in inclination for much little company in propensity to talk to be silent to be grave to be gay opposition here be be thoroughly convinced friendly to matrimonial happiness exclude extreme of course very close resemblance in point must be likeliest way to produce extreme counteraction gentle continual be best safeguard of manner conduct full well must fanny guess where thought be now miss crawford power be returning have be speaking of cheerfully from hour of coming home avoiding be quite at end have dined at parsonage only preceding day after leaving to happier thought for minute fanny feeling due to herself returned to mr crawford said be not merely in temper that consider a totally unsuited to myself though in respect think difference between too great infinitely too great spirit often oppress there be something in object to still more must say cousin can not approve character have not thought well of from time of play then saw behaving a appeared to so very improperly unfeelinglyi may speak of now because be overso improperly by poor mr rushworth not seeming to care how exposed hurt paying attention to cousin maria whichin short at time of play received impression will never be got over dear fanny replied edmund scarcely hearing to end let not of be judged by what appeared at period of general folly time of play be time hate to recollect maria be wrong crawford be wrong be wrong together none so wrong a myself compared with rest be blameless be playing fool with eye open a bystander said fanny perhaps saw more than did do think that mr rushworth be sometimes very jealous very possibly wonder nothing must be more improper than whole business be shocked whenever think that maria must be capable of if must undertake part must not be surprised at rest before play be much mistaken if julia did not think be paying attention julia have heard before from one of being in love with julia must never see anything of fanny though hope do justice to sister good quality think very possible that might one be more desirous of being admired by crawford might shew that desire rather more unguardedly than be perfectly prudent can remember that be evidently fond of society with such encouragement man like crawford lively may be little unthinking might be led on tothere must be nothing very striking because be clear that have pretension heart be reserved for must say that being for have raised inconceivably in opinion doe highest honour shews proper estimation of blessing of domestic happiness pure attachment prof unspoilt by uncle prof in short everything have be used to wish to believe feared be not be persuaded that doe not think a ought on serious subject say rather that have not thought at upon serious subject believe to be good deal case how must be otherwise with such education adviser under disadvantage indeed have have be not wonderful that must be what be crawford feeling be ready to acknowledge have hitherto be too much guide happily feeling have generally be good will supply rest most fortunate man be to attach to creatureto woman who firm a rock in own principle have gentleness of character so well adapted to recommend have chosen partner indeed with rare felicity will make happy fanny know will make happy will make everything must not engage in such charge cried fanny in shrinking accent in such office of high responsibility a usual believing unequal to anything fancying everything too much for well though may not be able to persuade into different feeling will be persuaded into trust confess sincerely anxious that may have common interest in crawford well doing next to happiness fanny have first claim on be aware of having common interest in crawford fanny be too well aware of to have anything to say walked on together fifty yard in mutual silence abstraction edmund first began again be very much pleased by manner of speaking of yesterday particularly pleased because have not depended upon seeing everything in so just light knew be very fond of yet be afraid of not estimating worth to brother quite a deserved of regretting that have not rather fixed on woman of distinction fortune be afraid of bias of worldly maxim have be too much used to hear be very different spoke of fanny just a ought desire connexion a warmly a uncle have long talk about must not have mentioned subject though very anxious to know sentiment have not be in room five minute before began introducing with openness of heart sweet peculiarity of manner that spirit ingenuousness be so much part of mr grant laughed at for rapidity be mr grant in room then yes when reached house found two sister together by when once have begun have not done with fanny till crawford dr grant came in be above week since

inattentive observer of what be passing between part of family in summer autumn be quiet be not blind must not see that mr crawford amused in gallantry did mean nothing ah can not deny have now then be sad flirt cared very little for havoc might be making in young lady affection have often scolded for be only fault there be to be said that very few young lady have affection worth caring for then fanny glory of fixing one who have be shot at by so many of having in one power to pay off debt of one sex oh be sure be not in woman nature to refuse triumph fanny shook head can not think well of man who sport with woman feeling there may often be great deal more suffered than stander by can judge of defend leave entirely to mercy when have got at everingham care how much lecture will say that fault liking to make girl little in love with be not half so dangerous to wife happiness a tendency to fall in love have never be addicted to do seriously truly believe that be attached to in way that never be to woman before that love with heart will love a nearly for ever a possible if man ever loved woman for ever think henry will do a much for fanny must not avoid faint smile have nothing to say can not imagine henry ever to have be happier continued mary presently than when have succeeded in getting brother commission have made sure push at fanny feeling here oh yes how very very kind of know must have exerted very much for know party have to move admiral hate trouble scorn asking favour there be so many young men claim to be attended to in same way that friendship energy not very determined be easily put by what happy creature william must be wish must see poor fanny mind be thrown into most distressing of variety recollection of what have be done for william be always most powerful disturber of decision against mr crawford sat thinking deeply of till mary who have be first watching complacently then musing on something else suddenly called attention by saying must like to sit talking with here day must not forget lady below so good bye dear amiable excellent fanny for though will nominally part in breakfast parlour must take leave of here do take leave longing for happy reunion trusting that when meet again will be under circumstance may open heart to other without remnant shadow of reserve very very kind embrace agitation of manner accompanied word will see cousin in town soon talk of being there tolerably soon sir thomas dare say in course of spring eldest cousin rushworths julia be sure of meeting again again have two favour to ask fanny one be correspondence must write to other that will often call on mr grant make amends for being gone first at least of favour fanny must rather not have be asked be impossible for to refuse correspondence be impossible for even not to accede to more readily than own judgment authorised there be resisting so much apparent affection disposition be peculiarly calculated to value fond treatment from having hitherto known so little of be more overcome by miss crawford besides there be gratitude towards for having made tte tte so much le painful than fear have predicted be over have escaped without reproach without detection secret be still own while be case thought must resign to almost everything in evening there be parting henry crawford came sat time with spirit not being previously in strongest state heart be softened for while towards because really seemed to feel quite unlike usual self scarcely said anything be evidently oppressed fanny must grieve for though hoping might never see again till be husband of other woman when came to moment of parting must take hand must not be denied said nothing however nothing that heard when have left room be better pleased that token of friendship have passed on morrow crawford be gone chapter xxxvii mr crawford gone sir thomas next object be that must be missed entertained great hope that niece must find blank in loss of attention at time have felt fancied evil have tasted of consequence in most flattering form did hope that loss of sinking again into nothing must awaken very wholesome regret in mind watched with idea must hardly tell with what success hardly knew whether there be difference in spirit not be always so gentle retiring that emotion be beyond discrimination did not understand felt that did not therefore applied to edmund to tell how stood affected on present occasion whether be more le happy than have be edmund did not discern symptom of regret thought father little unreasonable in supposing first three four day must produce what chiefly surprised edmund be that crawford sister friend companion who have be so much to must not be more visibly regretted wondered that fanny spoke so seldom of have so little voluntarily to say of concern at separation ala be sister friend companion who be now chief bane of fanny comfort if must have believed mary future fate a unconnected with mansfield a be determined brother must be if must have hoped return thither to be a distant a be much inclined to think must have be light of heart indeed more recollected observed more deeply be convinced that everything be now in fairer train for miss crawford marrying edmund than have ever be before on side inclination be stronger on hers le equivocal objection scruple of integrity seemed done away nobody must tell how doubt hesitation of ambition be equally got overand equally without apparent reason must only be imputed to increasing attachment good bad feeling yielded to love such love must unite be to go to town a soon a business relative to thornton lacey be completedperhaps within fortnight talked of going loved to talk of when once with again fanny must not doubt rest acceptance must be a certain a offer yet there be bad feeling still remaining made prospect of most sorrowful to independently believed independently of self in very last conversation miss crawford in spite of amiable sensation much personal kindness have still be miss crawford still shewn mind led astray bewildered without suspicion of being so darkened yet fancying light might love did not deserve edmund by other sentiment fanny believed there be scarcely second feeling in common between may be forgiven by older sage for looking on chance of miss crawford future improvement a nearly desperate for thinking that if edmunds influence in season of love have already done so little in clearing judgment regulating notion worth must be finally wasted on even in year of matrimony experience might have hoped more for young people so circumstanced impartiality must not have denied to miss crawford nature that participation of general nature of woman must lead to adopt opinion of man loved respected a own a such be fanny persuasion suffered very much from must never speak of miss crawford without pain sir thomas meanwhile went on with own hope own observation still feeling right by knowledge of human nature to expect to see effect of loss of power consequence on niece spirit past attention of lover producing craving for return be soon afterwards able to account for not yet completely indubitably seeing by prospect of visitor whose approach must allow to be quite enough to support spirit be watching william have obtained ten day leave of absence to be given to northamptonshire be coming happiest of lieutenant because latest made to shew happiness describe uniform came must have be delighted to shew uniform there too have not cruel custom prohibited appearance except on duty so uniform remained at portsmouth edmund conjectured that before fanny have chance of seeing own freshness freshness of wearer feeling must be worn away must be sunk into badge of disgrace for what can be more unbecoming more worthless than uniform of lieutenant who have be lieutenant year two see others made commander before so reasoned edmund till father made confidant of scheme placed fanny chance of seeing second lieutenant of hm thrush in glory in light scheme be that must accompany brother back to portsmouth spend little time with own family have occurred to sir thomas in one of dignified musing a right desirable measure before absolutely made up mind consulted son edmund considered way saw nothing what be right thing be good in must not be done at better time have doubt of being highly agreeable to fanny be enough to determine sir thomas decisive then so will be closed stage of business sir thomas retiring from with feeling of satisfaction view of good over above what have communicated to son for prime motive in sending away have very little to do with propriety of seeing parent again nothing at with idea of making happy certainly wished to go willingly a certainly wished to be heartily sick of home before visit ended that little abstinence from elegancies luxury of mansfield park must bring mind into sober state incline to juster estimate of value of home of greater permanence equal comfort of have offer be medicinal project upon niece understanding must consider a at present diseased residence of eight nine year in abode of wealth plenty have little disordered power of comparing judging father house must in probability teach value of good income trusted that must be wiser happier woman life for experiment have devised have fanny be at addicted to rapture must have have strong attack of when first understood what be intended when uncle first made offer of visiting parent brother sister from whom have be divided almost half life of returning for couple of month to scene of infancy with william for protector companion of journey certainty of continuing to see william to last hour of remaining on land have ever given way to burst of delight must have be then for be delighted happiness be of quiet deep heart swelling sort though never great talker be always more inclined to silence when feeling most strongly at moment must only thank accept afterwards when familiarised with vision of enjoyment so suddenly opened must speak more largely to william edmund of what felt still there be emotion of tenderness must not be clothed in word remembrance of earliest pleasure of what have suffered in being torn from came over with renewed strength seemed a if to be at home again must heal pain have since grown out of separation to be in centre of such circle loved by so many more loved by than have ever be before to feel affection without fear restraint to feel equal of who surrounded to be at peace from mention of crawford safe from look must be fancied reproach on account be prospect to be dwelt on with fondness must be acknowledged edmund tooto be two month from perhaps might be allowed to make absence three must do good at distance unassailed by look kindness safe from perpetual irritation of knowing heart striving to avoid confidence must be able to reason into properer state must be able to think of a in london arranging everything there without wretchedness what might have be hard to bear at mansfield be to become slight evil at portsmouth only drawback be doubt of aunt bertrams being comfortable without be of use to one else there might be missed to degree that did not like to think of that part of arrangement be indeed hardest for sir thomas to accomplish what only must have accomplished at be master at mansfield park when have really resolved on measure must always carry through now by dint of long talking on subject explaining dwelling on duty of fanny sometimes seeing family did induce wife to let go obtaining rather from submission however than conviction for lady bertram be convinced of very little more than sir thomas thought fanny ought to go therefore that must in calmness of own dressing room in impartial flow of own meditation unbiased by bewildering statement must not acknowledge necessity for fanny ever going near father mother who have done without so long while be so useful to herself a to not missing under mr norris discussion be point attempted to be proved set very steadily against admitting such thing sir thomas have appealed to reason conscience dignity called sacrifice demanded of goodness self command a such mr norris wanted to persuade that fanny must be very well sparedshe being ready to give up own time to a requestedand in short must not really be wanted missed may be sister be lady bertrams reply dare say be very right be sure will miss very much next step be to communicate with portsmouth fanny wrote to offer mother answer though short be so kinda few simple line expressed so natural motherly joy in prospect of seeing child again a to confirm daughter view of happiness in being with herconvincing that must now find warm affectionate friend in mama who have certainly shewn remarkable fondness for formerly must easily suppose to have be own fault own fancy have probably alienated love by helplessness fretfulness of fearful temper be unreasonable in wanting larger share than one among so many must deserve now when knew better how to be useful how to forbear when mother must be no longer occupied by incessant demand of house full of little child there must be leisure inclination for comfort must soon be what mother daughter ought to be to other william be almost a happy in plan a sister must be greatest pleasure to to have there to last moment before sailed perhaps find there still when came in from first cruise besides wanted so very much to see thrush before went out of harbourthe thrush be certainly finest sloop in serviceand there be several improvement in dockyard too quite longed to shew did not scruple to add that being at home for while must be great advantage to everybody know how be said seem to want of nice way orderliness at father house be always in confusion will set thing going in better way be sure will tell mother how ought to be will be so useful to susan will teach betsey make boy love mind how right comfortable will all be by time mr price answer arrived there remained very few day more to be spent at mansfield for part of one of day young traveller be in good deal of alarm on subject of journey for when mode of came to be talked of mr norris found that anxiety to save brother in law money be vain that in spite of wish hint for le expensive conveyance of fanny be to travel post when saw sir thomas actually give william note for purpose be struck with idea of there being room for third in carriage suddenly seized with strong inclination to go with to go see poor dear sister price proclaimed thought must say that have more than mind to go with young people must be such indulgence to have not seen poor dear sister price for more than twenty year must be help to young people in journey to have older head to manage for must not help thinking poor dear sister price must feel very unkind of not to come by such opportunity william fanny be horror struck at idea comfort of comfortable journey must be destroyed at once with woeful countenance looked at other suspense lasted hour two one interfered to encourage dissuade mr norris be left to settle matter by ended to infinite joy of nephew niece in recollection that must not possibly be spared from mansfield park at present that be great deal too necessary to sir thomas lady bertram for to be able to answer to herself to leave even for week therefore must certainly sacrifice other pleasure to of being useful to have in fact occurred to that though taken to portsmouth for nothing must be hardly possible for to avoid paying own expense back again so poor dear sister price be left to disappointment of missing such opportunity twenty year absence perhaps begun edmunds plan be affected by portsmouth journey absence of fanny too have sacrifice to make to mansfield park a well a aunt have intended about time to be going to london must not leave father mother just when everybody else of most importance to comfort be leaving with effort felt not boasted of delayed for week two longer journey be looking forward to with hope of fixing happiness for ever told fanny of knew so much already that must know everything made substance of one other confidential discourse about miss crawford fanny be more affected from feeling to be last time in miss crawford name must ever be mentioned between with remains of liberty once afterwards be alluded to by lady bertram have be telling niece in evening to write to soon often promising to be good correspondent edmund at convenient moment then added in whisper will write to fanny when have anything worth writing about anything to say that think will like to hear that will not hear so soon from other quarter have doubted meaning while listened glow in face when looked up at must have be decisive for letter must try to arm that letter from edmund must be subject of terror began to feel that have not yet gone through change of opinion sentiment progress of time variation of circumstance occasion in world of change vicissitude of human mind have not yet be exhausted by poor fanny though going a did willingly eagerly last evening at mansfield park must still be wretchedness heart be completely sad at parting have tear for room in house much more for beloved inhabitant clung to aunt because must miss kissed hand of uncle with struggling sob because have displeased a for edmund must neither speak look think when last moment came with be not till be over knew be giving affectionate farewell of brother passed overnight for journey be to begin very early in morning when small diminished party met at breakfast william fanny be talked of a already advanced one stage chapter xxxviii novelty of travelling happiness of being with william soon produced natural effect on fanny spirit when mansfield park be fairly left behind by time first stage be ended be to quit sir thomas carriage be able to take leave of old coachman send back proper message with cheerful look of pleasant talk between brother sister there be end everything supplied amusement to high glee of williams mind be full of frolic joke in interval of higher toned subject of ended if did not begin in praise of thrush conjecture how must be employed scheme for action with superior force supposing first lieutenant out of way william be not very merciful to first lieutenant be to give next step a soon a possible speculation upon prize money be to be generously distributed at home with only reservation of enough to make little cottage comfortable in fanny be to pas middle later life together fanny immediate concern a far a involved mr crawford made part of conversation william knew what have passed from heart lamented that sister feeling must be so cold towards man whom must consider a first of human character be of age to be for love therefore unable to blame knowing wish on subject must not distress by slightest allusion have reason to suppose not

fanny found quite a unpleasant a have feared miss crawford style of writing lively affectionate be evil independent of what be thus forced into reading from brother pen for edmund must never rest till have read chief of letter to then have to listen to admiration of language warmth of attachment there have in fact be so much of message of allusion of recollection so much of mansfield in letter fanny must not suppose meant for to hear to find forced into purpose of kind compelled into correspondence be bringing address of man did not love obliging to administer to adverse passion of man did be cruelly mortifying here too present removal promised advantage when longer under same roof with edmund trusted that miss crawford must have motive for writing strong enough to overcome trouble at

be so much wanting affection to be cured be sort of cure must be almost a bad a complaint believe there be scarcely young lady in united kingdom who must not rather put up with misfortune of being sought by clever agreeable man than have driven away by vulgarity of nearest relation mr crawford probably must not regard future father in law with idea of taking for model in dress a fanny instantly to great relief discerned father be very different man very different mr price in behaviour to most highly respected stranger from what be in own family at home manner now though not polished be more

to leave everything in greater suspense than ever only certainty to be drawn from be that nothing decisive have yet taken place edmund have not yet spoken how miss crawford really felt how meant to

crawford went into norfolk before after th be certainly concern of hers though everything considered thought must go without delay miss crawford must endeavour to secure meeting between mr rushworth

happily in so doing while who might otherwise have attended to be shut up wholly occupied with person quite dependent on at time for everything like comfort edmund trying to bury own feeling in exertion for relief of brother fanny devoted to aunt bertram returning to former office with more than former zeal thinking must never do enough for one who seemed so much to want to talk over dreadful business with fanny talk lament be lady bertrams consolation to be listened to borne with hear voice of kindness sympathy in return be everything must be done for to be otherwise comforted be out of question case admitted of comfort lady bertram did not think deeply guided by sir thomas thought justly on important point saw therefore in enormity what have happened neither endeavoured

might be apprehended dreadful communication must not be kept from rest of family sir thomas set off edmund must go with others have be left in state of wretchedness inferior only to what followed

not appear again there be reason to conclude to be concealed somewhere with mr crawford who have quitted uncle house a for journey on very day of absenting sir thomas however remained yet little

of set into have thrown fanny felt for most acutely must have comfort in edmund other child must be racking heart displeasure against trusted reasoning differently from mr norris must now be done away must be justified mr crawford must have fully acquitted conduct in refusing though most material to herself must be poor consolation to sir thomas uncle displeasure be terrible to what must justification gratitude attachment do for stay must be on edmund alone be mistaken however in supposing that edmund gave father present pain be of much le poignant nature than what others excited sir

probably avoided being alone with be to be inferred that judgment submitted to own peculiar bitter share of family affliction that be too keenly felt to be subject of slightest communication must be state yielded be with agony did not admit of speech long long must be ere miss crawford name passed lip again must hope for renewal of such confidential intercourse a have be be long reached mansfield on thursday be not till sunday evening edmund began to talk to on subject sitting with on sunday eveninga wet sunday eveningthe very time of others when if friend be at hand heart must be opened everything told one else in room except mother who after hearing affecting sermon have cried to sleep be impossible not to speak so with usual beginning hardly to be traced a to what came first usual declaration that if must listen to for few minute must be very brief certainly never tax kindness in same way again need not fear repetition must be subject prohibited entirely entered upon luxury of relating circumstance sensation of first interest to to one of whose affectionate sympathy be quite convinced how fanny listened with what curiosity concern what pain what delight how agitation of voice be watched how carefully own eye be fixed on object may be imagined opening be alarming have seen miss crawford have be invited to see have received note from lady stornaway to beg to call regarding a what be meant to be last last interview of friendship investing with feeling of shame wretchedness crawford sister ought to have known have gone to in such state of mind so softened so devoted a made for few moment impossible to fanny fear that must be last a proceeded in story fear be over have met said with seriouscertainly seriouseven agitated air before have be able to speak one intelligible sentence have introduced subject in manner owned have shocked heard be in town said wanted to see let talk over sad business what can equal folly of two relation must not answer believe look spoke felt reproved sometimes how quick to feel with graver look voice then added mean to defend henry at sister expense so began how went on fanny be not fit be hardly fit to be repeated to can not recall word must not dwell upon if must substance be great anger at folly of reprobated brother folly in being drawn on by woman whom have never cared for to do what must lose woman adored still more folly of poor maria in sacrificing such situation plunging into such difficulty under idea of being really loved by man who have long ago made indifference clear guess what must have felt to hear woman whomno harsher name than folly given so voluntarily so freely so coolly to canvas reluctance horror feminine will say modest loathing be what world doe for where fanny will find woman whom nature have so richly endowed spoilt spoilt after little reflection went on with sort of desperate calmness will tell everything then have done for ever saw only a folly that folly stamped only by exposure want of common discretion of caution going down to richmond for whole time of being at twickenham putting in power of servant be detection in shortoh fanny be detection not offence reprobated be imprudence have brought thing to extremity obliged brother to give up dearer plan in order to fly with stopt what said fanny believing required to speak what must say nothing nothing to be understood be like man stunned went on began to talk of yes then began to talk of regretting a well might loss of such there spoke very rationally have always done justice to have thrown away said woman a will never see again must have fixed must have made happy for ever dearest fanny be giving hope more pleasure than pain by retrospect of what might have beenbut what never can be now wish to be silent if do give look word have done look word be given thank god said be disposed to wonder seems to have be merciful appointment of providence that heart knew guile must not suffer spoke of with high praise warm affection yet even here there be alloy dash of evil for in midst of must exclaim why must not have be fault simple girl will never forgive have accepted a ought might now have be on point of marriage henry must have be too happy too busy to want other object must have taken pain to be on term with mr rushworth again must have ended in regular standing flirtation in yearly meeting at sotherton everingham must have believed possible charm be broken eye be opened cruel said fanny quite cruel at moment to give way to gaiety to speak with lightness to absolute cruelty cruelty do call differ there hers be not cruel nature consider a meaning to wound feeling evil lie yet deeper in total ignorance unsuspiciousness of there being such feeling in perversion of mind made natural to to treat subject a did be speaking only a have be used to hear others speak a imagined everybody else must speak hers be not fault of temper must not voluntarily give unnecessary pain to one though may deceive can not think that for for feeling must hers be fault of principle fanny of blunted delicacy corrupted vitiated mind perhaps be best for since leaf so little to regret not so however gladly must submit to increased pain of losing rather than have to think of a do told so did yes when left told so how long be together five twenty minute well went on to say that what remained now to be done be to bring about marriage between spoke of fanny with steadier voice than can be obliged to pause more than once a continued must persuade henry to marry said what with honour certainty of having shut out for ever from fanny despair of fanny must give up think that even must now hope to succeed with one of stamp therefore hope may find insuperable difficulty influence be not small will go way when once married properly supported by own family people of respectability a be may recover footing in society to certain degree in circle know must never be admitted with good dinner large party there will always be who will be glad of acquaintance there be undoubtedly more liberality candour on point than formerly what advise be that father be quiet let injure own cause by interference persuade to let thing take course if by officious exertion of be induced to leave henry protection there will be much le chance of marrying than if remain with know how be likely to be influenced let sir thomas trust to honour compassion may end well if get daughter away will be destroying chief hold after repeating edmund be so much affected that fanny watching with silent most tender concern be almost sorry that subject have be entered on at be long before must speak again at last now fanny said will soon have done have told substance of that said a soon a must speak replied that have not supposed possible coming in state of mind into house a have done that anything must occur to make suffer more that have be inflicting deeper wound in almost sentence that though have in course of acquaintance be often sensible of difference in opinion on point too of moment have not entered imagination to conceive difference must be such a have now proved that manner in treated dreadful crime committed by brother sister with whom lay greater seduction pretended not to say manner in spoke of crime giving reproach right considering ill consequence only a be to be braved overborne by defiance of decency impudence in wrong last of above recommending to compliance compromise acquiescence in continuance of sin on chance of marriage thinking a now thought of brother must rather be prevented than sought together most grievously convinced that have never understood before that a far a related to mind have be creature of own imagination not miss crawford have be too apt to dwell on for many month past perhaps be best for have le to regret in sacrificing friendship feeling hope must at rate have be torn from now yet must must confess must have restored to what have appeared to before must infinitely prefer increase of pain of parting for sake of carrying with right of tenderness esteem be said purport of a may imagine not spoken so collectedly methodically a have repeated to be astonished exceedingly astonishedmore than astonished saw change countenance turned extremely red imagined saw mixture of many feeling great though short struggle wish of yielding to truth sense of

hear of next may be a celebrated preacher in great society of methodist a missionary into foreign part tried to speak carelessly be not so careless a wanted to appear only said in reply that from heart wished well earnestly hoped that might soon learn to think more justly not owe most valuable knowledge must of acquire knowledge of ourselves of duty to lesson of affliction immediately left room have gone few step fanny when door open behind mr bertram said looked back mr bertram said with smile be smile ill suited to conversation have passed saucy playful smile seeming to invite in order to subdue at least appeared so to resisted be impulse of moment to resist still walked on have since sometimes for moment regretted that did not go back know be right such have be end of acquaintance what acquaintance have be how have be deceived equally in brother sister deceived thank for patience fanny have be greatest relief now will have done such be fanny dependence on word that for five minute thought have done then however came on again something very like nothing le than lady bertrams rousing thoroughly up must really close such conversation till happened continued to talk of miss crawford alone how have attached how delightful nature have made how excellent must have be have fallen into good hand earlier fanny now at liberty to speak openly felt more than justified in adding to knowledge of real character by hint of what share brother state of health might be supposed to have in wish for complete reconciliation be not agreeable intimation nature resisted for while must have be vast deal pleasanter to have have more disinterested in attachment vanity be not of strength to fight long against reason submitted to believe that tom illness have influenced only reserving for consoling thought that considering many counteraction of opposing habit have certainly be more attached to than must have be expected for sake be more near doing right fanny thought
