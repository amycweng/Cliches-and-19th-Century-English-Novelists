more elegant than dress dare say lace upon mr hurst gown here be interrupted again mr bennet protested against description of finery be therefore obliged to seek branch of subject related with much bitterness of spirit exaggeration shocking rudeness of mr darcy can assure added that lizzy doe not lose much by not suiting fancy for be most disagreeable horrid man not at worth pleasing so high so conceited that there be enduring walked here walked there fancying so very great not handsome enough to dance with wish have be there dear to have given one of set down quite detest man chapter iv when jane elizabeth be alone former who have be cautious in praise of mr bingley before expressed to sister how very much admired be just what young man ought to be said sensible good humoured lively

oh be great deal too apt know to like people in general never see fault in body world be good agreeable in eye never heard speak ill of human being in life must wish not to be hasty in censuring one always speak what think know do be that make wonder with good sense to be so honestly blind to folly nonsense of others affectation of candour be common enough one meet where to be candid without ostentation design to take good of body character make still better say nothing of bad belongs to alone so like man sister too do manner be not equal to certainly not at first be very pleasing woman when converse with miss bingley be to live with brother keep house be much mistaken if will not find very charming neighbour in elizabeth listened in silence be not convinced behaviour at assembly have not be calculated to please in general with more quickness of observation le pliancy of temper than sister with judgment too unassailed by attention to herself be very little disposed to approve be in fact very fine lady not deficient in good humour when be pleased in power of being agreeable where chose proud conceited be rather handsome have be educated in one of first private seminary in town have fortune of twenty thousand pound be in habit of spending more than ought of associating with people of rank be therefore in respect entitled to think well of meanly of others be of respectable family in north of england circumstance more deeply impressed on memory than brother fortune own have be acquired by trade mr bingley inherited property to amount of nearly hundred thousand pound from father who have intended to purchase estate did not live to do mr bingley intended likewise sometimes made choice of county a be now provided with good house liberty of manor be doubtful to many of who best knew easiness of temper whether might not spend remainder of day at netherfield leave next generation to purchase sister be very anxious for having estate of own though be now established only a tenant miss bingley be by mean unwilling to preside at table be mr hurst who have married man of more fashion than fortune disposed to consider house a home when suited mr bingley have not be of age two year when be tempted by accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house did look at into for hour be pleased with situation principal room satisfied with what owner said in praise took immediately between darcy there be very steady friendship in spite of great opposition of character bingley be endeared to darcy by easiness openness ductility of temper though disposition must offer greater contrast to own though with own never appeared dissatisfied on strength of darcy regard bingley have firmest reliance of judgment highest opinion in understanding darcy be superior bingley be by mean deficient darcy be clever be at same time haughty reserved fastidious manner though well bred be not inviting in respect friend have greatly advantage bingley be sure of being liked wherever appeared darcy be continually giving offence manner in spoke of meryton assembly be sufficiently characteristic bingley have never met with pleasanter people prettier girl in life body have be most kind attentive to there have be formality no stiffness have soon felt acquainted with room a to miss bennet must not conceive angel more beautiful darcy on contrary have seen collection of people in whom there be little beauty fashion for none of whom have felt smallest interest from none received attention pleasure miss bennet acknowledged to be pretty smiled too much mr hurst sister allowed to be so still admired liked pronounced to be sweet girl one whom must not object to know more of miss bennet be therefore established a sweet girl brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of a chose chapter v within short walk of longbourn lived family with whom bennet be particularly intimate sir william lucas have be formerly in trade in meryton where have made tolerable fortune risen to honour of knighthood by address to king during mayoralty distinction have perhaps be felt too strongly have given disgust to business to residence in small market town quitting have removed with family to house about mile from meryton denominated from period lucas lodge where must think with pleasure of own importance unshackled by business occupy solely in being civil to world for though elated by rank did not render supercilious on contrary be attention to body by nature inoffensive friendly obliging presentation at st james have made courteous lady lucas be very good kind of woman not too clever to be valuable neighbour to mr bennet have several child eldest of sensible intelligent young woman about twenty seven be elizabeth intimate friend that miss lucas miss bennet must meet to talk over ball be absolutely necessary morning after assembly brought former to longbourn to hear to communicate began evening well charlotte said mr bennet with civil self command to miss lucas be mr bingley first choice yes seemed to like second better oh mean jane suppose because danced with twice to be sure that did seem a if admired indeed rather believe did heard something about hardly know what something about mr robinson perhaps mean what overheard between mr robinson did not mention to mr robinson asking how liked meryton assembly whether did not think there be great many pretty woman in room thought prettiest answering immediately to last question oh eldest miss bennet beyond doubt there can not be two opinion on point upon word well be very decided indeed that doe seem a if however may come to nothing know overhearings be more to purpose than yours eliza said charlotte mr darcy be not so well worth listening to a friend be poor eliza to be only just tolerable beg must not put into lizzy head to be vexed by ill treatment for be such disagreeable man that must be quite misfortune to be liked by mr long told last night that sat close to for hour without once opening lip be quite sure ma'be be not there little mistake said jane certainly saw mr darcy speaking to aye because asked at last how liked netherfield must not help answering said seemed very angry at being spoke to miss bingley told said jane that never speaks much unless among intimate acquaintance with be remarkably agreeable believe word of dear if have be so very agreeable must have talked to mr long can guess how be body say that be ate up with pride dare say have heard somehow that mr long doe not keep carriage have come to ball in hack chaise mind not talking to mr long said miss lucas wish have danced with eliza time lizzy said mother must not dance with if be believe ma'be may safely promise never to dance with pride said miss lucas doe not offend so much a pride often doe because there be excuse for one can not wonder that so very fine young man with family fortune thing in favour must think highly of if may so express have right to be proud be very true replied elizabeth must easily forgive pride if have not mortified mine pride observed mary who piqued upon solidity of reflection be very common failing believe by have ever read be convinced that be very common indeed that human nature be particularly prone to that there be very few of who cherish feeling of self complacency on score of quality other real imaginary vanity pride be different thing though word be often used synonimously person may be proud without being vain pride relates more to opinion of ourselves vanity to what must have others think of if be a rich a mr darcy cried young lucas who came with sister must not care how proud be must keep pack of foxhound drink bottle of wine day then must drink great deal more than ought said mr bennet if be to see at must take away bottle directly boy protested that must not continued to declare that must argument ended only with visit chapter vi lady of longbourn soon waited on of visit be returned in due form miss bennet pleasing manner grew on good will of mr hurst miss bingley though mother be found to be intolerable younger sister not worth speaking to wish of being better acquainted with be expressed towards two eldest by jane attention be received with greatest pleasure elizabeth still saw superciliousness in treatment of body hardly excepting even sister must not like though kindness to jane such a be have value a arising in probability from influence of brother admiration be generally evident whenever met that did admire to be equally evident that jane be yielding to preference have begun to entertain for from first be in way to be very much in love considered with pleasure that be not likely to be discovered by world in general since jane united with great strength of feeling composure of temper uniform cheerfulness of manner must guard from suspicion of impertinent mentioned to friend miss lucas may perhaps be pleasant replied charlotte to be able to impose on public in such case be sometimes disadvantage to be so very guarded if woman conceals affection with same skill from object of may lose opportunity of fixing will then be poor consolation to believe world equally in dark there be so much of gratitude vanity in almost attachment that be not safe to leave to can begin freely slight preference be natural enough there be very few of who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement in nine case out of ten woman have better shew more affection than feel bingley like sister undoubtedly may never do more than like if doe not help on doe help on a much a nature will allow if can perceive regard for must be simpleton indeed not to discover too remember eliza that doe not know jane disposition a do if woman be partial to man doe not endeavour to conceal must find out perhaps must if see enough of though bingley jane meet tolerably often be never for many hour together a always see other in large mixed party be impossible that moment must be employed in conversing together jane must therefore make most of half hour in can command attention when be secure of there will be leisure for falling in love a much a chuses plan be good one replied elizabeth where nothing be in question desire of being well married if be determined to get rich husband husband dare say must adopt be not jane feeling be not acting by design a yet can not even be certain of degree of own regard of reasonableness have known only fortnight danced four dance with at meryton saw one morning at own house have since dined in company with four time be not quite enough to make understand character not a represent have merely dined with might only have discovered whether have good appetite must remember that four evening have be also spent together four evening may do great deal yes four evening have enabled to ascertain that like vingt un better than commerce with respect to other leading characteristic imagine that much have be unfolded well said charlotte wish jane success with heart if be married to to morrow must think have a good chance of happiness a if be to be studying character for twelvemonth happiness in marriage be entirely matter of chance if disposition of party be ever so well known to other ever so similar before hand doe not advance felicity in least always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have share of vexation be better to know a little a possible of defect of person with whom be to pas life make laugh charlotte be not sound know be not sound that must never act in way occupied in observing mr bingley attention to sister elizabeth be far from suspecting that be becoming object of interest in eye of friend mr darcy have at first scarcely allowed to be pretty have looked at without admiration at ball when next met looked at only to criticise sooner have made clear to friend that have hardly good feature in face than began to find be rendered uncommonly intelligent by beautiful expression of dark eye to discovery succeeded others equally mortifying though have detected with critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in form be forced to acknowledge figure to be light pleasing in spite of asserting that manner be not of fashionable world be caught by easy playfulness of be perfectly unaware to be only man who made agreeable where who have not thought handsome enough to dance with began to wish to know more of a step towards conversing with attended to conversation with others doing so drew notice be at sir william lucas where large party be assembled what doe mr darcy mean said to charlotte by listening to conversation with colonel forster be question mr darcy only can answer if doe more will certainly let know see what be about have very satirical eye if begin by being impertinent will soon grow afraid of on approaching soon afterwards though without seeming to have intention of speaking miss lucas defied friend to mention subject to immediately provoking elizabeth to do turned to said did not think mr darcy expressed uncommonly well just now when be teazing colonel forster to give ball at meryton with great energy be subject always make lady energetic be severe on will be turn soon to be teazed said miss lucas be going to open instrument eliza know what follows be very strange creature by way of friend always wanting to play sing before body body if vanity have taken musical turn must have be invaluable a be must really rather not sit down before who must be in habit of hearing very best performer on miss lucas persevering however added very well if must be so must gravely glancing at mr darcy there be fine old saying body here be of course familiar with 'keep breath to cool porridge will keep mine to swell song performance be pleasing though by mean capital after song two before must reply to entreaty of several that must sing again be eagerly succeeded at instrument by sister mary who having in consequence of being only plain one in family worked hard for knowledge accomplishment be always impatient for display mary have genius taste though vanity have given application have given likewise pedantic air conceited manner must have injured higher degree of excellence than have reached elizabeth easy unaffected have be listened to with much more pleasure though not playing half so well mary at end of long concerto be glad to purchase praise gratitude by scotch irish air at request of younger sister who with of lucas two three officer joined eagerly in dancing at one end of room mr darcy stood near in silent indignation at mode of passing evening to exclusion of conversation be too much engrossed by own thought to perceive that sir william lucas be neighbour till sir william thus began what charming amusement for young people be mr darcy there be nothing like dancing after consider a one of first refinement of polished society certainly sir have advantage also of being in vogue amongst le polished society of world savage can dance sir william only smiled friend performs delightfully continued after pause on seeing bingley join group doubt not that be adept in science mr darcy saw dance at meryton believe sir yes indeed received inconsiderable pleasure from sight do often dance at st james never sir do not think must be proper compliment to place be compliment never pay to place if can avoid have house in town conclude mr darcy bowed have once thought of fixing in town for be fond of superior society did not feel quite certain that air of london must agree with lady lucas paused in hope of answer companion be not disposed to make elizabeth at instant moving towards be struck with notion of doing very gallant thing called out to dear miss eliza why be not dancing mr darcy must allow to present young lady to a very desirable partner can not refuse to dance be sure when so much beauty be before taking hand must have given to mr darcy who though extremely surprised be not unwilling to receive when instantly drew back said with discomposure to sir william indeed sir have not least intention of dancing entreat not to suppose moved way in order to beg for partner mr darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed honour of hand in vain elizabeth be determined did sir william at shake purpose by attempt at persuasion excel so much in dance miss eliza that be cruel to deny happiness of seeing though gentleman dislike amusement in general can have objection be sure to oblige for one half hour mr darcy be politeness said elizabeth smiling be indeed considering inducement dear miss eliza can not wonder at complaisance for who must object to partner elizabeth looked archly turned away resistance have not injured with gentleman be thinking of with complacency when thus accosted by miss bingley can guess subject of reverie must imagine not be considering how insupportable must be to pas many evening in manner in such society indeed be quite of opinion be never more annoyed insipidity yet noise nothingness yet self importance of people what must give to hear stricture on conjecture be totally wrong assure mind be more agreeably engaged have be meditating on very great pleasure pair of fine eye in face of pretty woman can bestow miss bingley immediately fixed eye on face desired must tell what lady have credit of inspiring such reflection mr darcy replied with great intrepidity miss elizabeth bennet miss elizabeth bennet repeated miss bingley be astonishment how long have be favourite pray when be to wish joy

in amongst have pleasure of distinguishing much superior solicitude of mr bingley must not make very favourable answer jane be by mean better sister on hearing repeated three four time how much be grieved how shocking be to have bad cold how excessively disliked being ill then thought more of matter indifference towards jane when not immediately before restored elizabeth to enjoyment of

considered by others have very little notice from miss bingley be engrossed by mr darcy sister scarcely le so a for mr hurst by whom elizabeth sat be indolent man who lived only to eat drink play at card who when found prefer plain dish to ragout have nothing to say to when dinner be over returned directly to jane miss bingley began abusing a soon a be out of room manner be pronounced to be very bad indeed mixture of pride impertinence have conversation style taste beauty mr hurst thought same added have nothing in short to recommend being excellent walker will never forget appearance morning

petticoat hope saw petticoat six inch deep in mud be absolutely certain gown have be let down to hide not doing office picture may be very exact louisa said bingley be lost upon thought elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well when came into room morning dirty petticoat quite escaped notice observed mr darcy be sure said miss bingley be inclined to think that must not wish to see sister make such exhibition certainly not to walk three mile four mile five mile whatever be above ancles in dirt alone quite alone what must mean by seems to to shew abominable sort of conceited independence most country town indifference to decorum shews affection for sister be very pleasing said bingley be afraid mr darcy observed miss bingley in half whisper that adventure have rather affected admiration of fine eye not at all replied be brightened by exercise short pause followed speech mr hurst began again have excessive regard for jane bennet be really very sweet girl wish with heart be well settled with father mother such low connection be afraid there be chance of think have heard say that uncle be attorney in meryton yes have who life somewhere near cheapside be capital added sister laughed heartily if have uncle enough to fill cheapside cried bingley must not make one jot le agreeable must very materially lessen chance of marrying men of consideration in world replied darcy to speech bingley made answer sister gave hearty assent indulged mirth for time at expense of dear friend vulgar relation with renewal of tenderness however repaired to room on leaving dining parlour sat with till summoned to coffee be still very poorly elizabeth must not quit at till late in evening when have comfort of seeing asleep when appeared to rather right than pleasant that must go down stair on entering drawing room found whole party at loo be immediately invited to join suspecting to be playing high declined making sister excuse said must amuse for short time must stay

deserve such praise such censure cried elizabeth be not great reader have pleasure in many thing in nursing sister be sure have pleasure said bingley hope will soon be increased by seeing quite well elizabeth thanked from heart then walked towards table where few book be lying immediately offered to fetch others that library afforded wish collection be larger for benefit own credit be idle fellow though have not many have more than ever look into elizabeth assured that must suit perfectly with in room be astonished said miss bingley that father must have left so small collection of book what delightful library have at pemberley mr darcy ought to be good replied have be work of many generation then have added so much to be always buying book can not comprehend neglect of family library in such day a neglect be sure neglect nothing can add to beauty of noble place charles when build house wish may be half a delightful a pemberley wish may must really advise to make purchase in neighbourhood take pemberley for kind of model there be not finer county in england than derbyshire with heart will buy pemberley if darcy will sell be talking of possibility charles upon word caroline must think more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation elizabeth be so much caught by what passed a to leave very little attention for book soon laying wholly aside drew near card table stationed between mr bingley eldest sister to observe game be miss darcy much grown since spring said miss bingley will be a tall a be think will be now about miss elizabeth bennet height rather taller how long to see again never met with anybody who delighted so much countenance such manner so extremely accomplished for age performance on piano forte be exquisite be amazing to said

not do be sure never heard young lady spoken of for first time without being informed that be very accomplished list of common extent of accomplishment said darcy have too much truth word be applied to many woman who deserves otherwise than by netting purse covering skreen be very far from agreeing with in estimation of lady in general can not boast of knowing more than dozen in whole range of acquaintance be really accomplished be sure said miss bingley then observed must comprehend great deal in idea of accomplished woman yes do comprehend great deal in oh certainly cried faithful assistant one can be really esteemed accomplished who doe not greatly surpass what be usually met with woman must have thorough knowledge of music singing drawing dancing modern language to deserve word besides must posse certain something in air manner of walking tone of voice address expression word will be deserved must posse added darcy to must yet add something more substantial in improvement of mind by extensive reading be no longer surprised at knowing only six accomplished woman rather wonder now at knowing be so severe upon own sex a to doubt possibility of never saw such woman never saw such capacity taste application elegance a describe united mr hurst miss bingley cried out against injustice of implied doubt be protesting that knew many woman who answered description when mr hurst called to order with bitter complaint of inattention to what be going forward a conversation be thereby at end elizabeth soon afterwards left room eliza bennet said miss bingley when door be closed on be one of young lady who seek to recommend to other sex by undervaluing own with many men dare say succeeds in opinion be paltry device very mean art undoubtedly replied darcy to whom remark be chiefly addressed there be meanness in art lady sometimes condescend to employ for captivation bear affinity to cunning be despicable miss bingley be not so entirely satisfied with reply a to continue subject elizabeth joined again only to say that sister be worse that must not leave bingley urged mr jones being sent for immediately while sister convinced that country advice must be of service recommended express to town for one of most eminent physician must not hear of be not so unwilling to comply with brother proposal be settled that mr jones must be sent for early in morning if miss bennet be not decidedly better bingley be quite uncomfortable sister declared that be miserable solaced wretchedness however by duet after supper while must find better relief to feeling than by giving housekeeper direction possible attention might be paid to sick lady sister chapter ix elizabeth passed chief of night in sister room in morning have pleasure of being able to send tolerable answer to enquiry very early received from mr bingley by housemaid time afterwards from two elegant lady who waited on sister in spite of amendment however requested to have note sent to longbourn desiring mother to visit jane form own judgment of situation note be immediately dispatched content a quickly complied with mr bennet accompanied by two youngest girl reached netherfield soon after family breakfast have found jane in apparent danger mr bennet must have be very miserable being satisfied on seeing that illness be not alarming have wish of recovering immediately a restoration to health must probably remove from netherfield must not listen therefore to daughter proposal of being carried home did apothecary who arrived about same time think at advisable after sitting little while with jane on miss bingley appearance invitation mother three daughter attended into breakfast parlour bingley met with hope mr bennet have not found miss bennet worse than expected indeed have sir be answer be great deal too ill to be moved mr jones say must not think of moving must trespass little longer on kindness removed cried bingley must not be thought of sister

sweetest temper ever met with often tell other girl be nothing to have sweet room here mr bingley charming prospect over gravel walk know place in country be equal to netherfield will not think of quitting in hurry hope though have short lease do be done in hurry replied therefore if must resolve to quit netherfield must probably be off in five minute at present however consider a quite fixed here be exactly what must have supposed of said elizabeth begin to comprehend do cried turning towards oh yes understand perfectly wish might take for compliment to be so easily seen through be afraid be pitiful be a happens doe not necessarily follow that deep intricate character be more le estimable than one a yours lizzy cried mother remember where be run on in wild manner that be suffered to do at home did not know before continued bingley immediately that be studier of character must be amusing study yes intricate character be most amusing have at least advantage country said darcy can in general supply few subject for study in country neighbourhood move in very confined unvarying society people alter so much that there be something new to be observed in for ever yes indeed cried mr bennet offended by manner of mentioning country neighbourhood assure there be quite a much of going on in country a in town body be surprised darcy after looking at for moment turned silently away mr bennet who fancied have gained complete victory over continued triumph can not see that london have great advantage over country for part except shop public place country be vast deal pleasanter be not mr bingley when be in country replied never wish to leave when be in town be pretty much same have advantage can be equally happy in aye be because have right disposition that gentleman looking at darcy seemed to think country be nothing at indeed mama be mistaken said elizabeth blushing for mother quite mistook mr darcy only meant that there be not such variety of people to be met with in country a in town must acknowledge to be true certainly dear nobody said there be a to not meeting with many people in neighbourhood believe there be few neighbourhood larger know dine with four twenty family nothing concern for elizabeth must enable bingley to keep countenance sister be le delicate directed eye towards mr darcy with very expressive smile elizabeth for sake of saying something might turn mother thought now asked if charlotte lucas have be at longbourn since coming away yes called yesterday with father what agreeable man sir william be mr bingley be not so much man of fashion so genteel so easy have always something to say to body be idea of good breeding person who fancy very important never open mouth quite mistake matter did charlotte dine with must go home

handsome not that think charlotte so very plain then be particular friend seems very pleasant young woman said bingley oh dear yes must own be very plain lady lucas have often said so envied jane beauty like to boast of own child to be sure jane one doe not often see body better looking be what body say trust own partiality when be only fifteen there be gentleman at brother gardiner in town so much in love with sister in law be sure must make offer before came away however did not perhaps thought too young however wrote verse on very pretty be so ended affection said elizabeth impatiently there have be many one fancy overcome in same way wonder who first discovered efficacy of poetry in driving away love have be used to consider poetry a food of love said darcy of fine stout healthy love may thing nourishes what be strong already if be only slight thin sort of inclination be convinced that one good sonnet will starve entirely away darcy only smiled general pause ensued made elizabeth tremble lest mother must be exposing again longed to speak must think of nothing to say after short silence mr bennet began repeating thanks to mr bingley for kindness to jane with apology for troubling also with lizzy mr bingley be unaffectedly civil in answer forced younger sister to be civil also say what occasion required performed part indeed without much graciousness mr bennet be satisfied soon afterwards ordered carriage upon signal youngest of daughter put forward two girl have be whispering to other during whole visit result of be that youngest must tax mr bingley with having promised on first coming into country to give ball at netherfield lydia be stout well grown girl of fifteen with fine complexion good humoured countenance favourite with mother whose affection have brought into public at early age have high animal spirit sort of natural self consequence attention of officer to whom uncle good dinner own easy manner recommended have increased into assurance be very equal therefore to address mr bingley on subject of ball abruptly reminded of promise adding that must be most shameful thing in world if did not keep answer to sudden attack be delightful to mother ear be perfectly ready assure to keep engagement when sister be recovered will if please name very day of ball must not wish to be dancing while be ill lydia declared satisfied oh yes must be much better to wait till jane be well by time most likely captain carter must be at meryton again when have given ball added will insist on giving one also will tell colonel forster will be quite shame if doe not mr bennet daughter then departed elizabeth returned instantly to jane leaving own relation behaviour to remark of two lady mr darcy latter of whom however must not be prevailed on to join in censure of in spite of miss bingley witticism on fine eye chapter x day passed much a day before have done mr hurst miss bingley have spent hour of morning with invalid who continued though slowly to mend in evening elizabeth joined party in drawing room loo table however did not appear mr darcy be writing miss bingley seated near be watching progress of letter repeatedly calling off attention by message to sister mr hurst mr bingley be at piquet mr hurst be observing game elizabeth took up needlework be sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy companion perpetual commendation of lady on hand writing on evenness of line on length of letter with perfect unconcern with praise be received formed curious dialogue be exactly in unison with opinion of how delighted miss darcy will be to receive letter made answer write uncommonly fast be mistaken write rather slowly how many letter must have occasion to write in course of year letter of business too how odious must think be fortunate then that fall to lot instead of to yours pray tell sister long to see have already told so once by desire be afraid like pen let mend for mend pen remarkably well thank always mend own how can contrive to write so even be silent tell sister be delighted to hear of improvement on harp pray let know be quite in rapture with beautiful little design for table think infinitely superior to miss grantley will give leave to defer rapture till write again at present have not room to do justice oh be of consequence will see in january do always write such charming long letter to mr darcy be generally long whether always charming be not for to determine be rule with that person who can write long letter with ease can not write ill will not do for compliment to darcy caroline cried brother because doe not write with ease study too much for word of four syllable darcy style of writing be very different from yours oh cried miss bingley charles writes in most careless way imaginable leaf out word blot rest idea flow so rapidly have not time to express by mean letter sometimes convey idea at to correspondent humility mr bingley said elizabeth must disarm reproof nothing be more deceitful said darcy than appearance of humility be often only carelessness of opinion sometimes indirect boast of two do call little recent piece of modesty indirect boast for be really proud of defect in writing because consider a proceeding from rapidity of thought carelessness of execution if not estimable think at least highly interesting power of doing thing with quickness be always much prized by possessor often without attention to imperfection of performance when told mr bennet morning that if ever resolved on quitting netherfield must be gone in five minute meant to be sort of panegyric of compliment to yet what be there so very laudable in precipitance must leave very necessary business undone can be of real advantage to one else nay cried bingley be too much to remember at night foolish thing be said in morning yet upon honour believed what said of to be true believe at moment at least therefore did not assume character of needle precipitance merely to shew off before lady dare say believed be by mean convinced that must be gone with such celerity conduct must be quite a dependant on chance a of man know if a be mounting horse friend be to say 'bingley have better stay till next week must probably do must probably not go at word might stay month have only proved by cried elizabeth mr bingley did not do justice to own disposition have shewn off now much more than did be exceedingly gratified said bingley by converting what friend say into compliment on sweetness of temper be afraid be giving turn that gentleman did by mean intend for must certainly think better of if under circumstance be to give flat denial ride off a fast a must must mr darcy then consider rashness of original intention a atoned for by obstinacy in adhering to upon word can not exactly explain matter darcy must speak for expect to account for opinion chuse to call mine have never acknowledged allowing case however to stand according to representation must remember miss bennet that friend who be supposed to desire return to house delay of plan have merely desired asked without offering one argument in favour of propriety to yield readily easily to persuasion of friend be merit with to yield without conviction be compliment to understanding of appear to mr darcy to allow nothing for influence of friendship affection regard for requester must often make one readily yield to request without waiting for argument to reason one into be not particularly speaking of such case a have supposed about mr bingley may a well wait perhaps till circumstance occurs before discus discretion of behaviour thereupon in general ordinary case between friend friend where one of be desired by other to change resolution of very great moment must think ill of person for complying with desire without waiting to be argued into will not be advisable before proceed on subject to arrange with rather more precision degree of importance be to appertain to request a well a degree of intimacy subsisting between party by mean cried bingley let hear particular not forgetting comparative height size for will have more weight in argument miss bennet than may be aware of assure that if darcy be not such great tall fellow in comparison with must not pay so much deference declare know more aweful object than darcy on particular occasion in particular place at own house especially of sunday evening when have nothing to do mr darcy smiled elizabeth thought must perceive that be rather offended therefore checked laugh miss bingley warmly resented indignity have received in expostulation with brother for talking such nonsense see design bingley said friend dislike argument want to silence perhaps do argument be too much like dispute if miss bennet will defer yours till be out of room will be very thankful then may say like of what ask said elizabeth be sacrifice on side mr darcy have much better finish letter mr darcy took advice did finish letter when business be over applied to miss bingley elizabeth for indulgence of music miss bingley moved with alacrity to piano forte after polite request that elizabeth must lead way other a politely more earnestly negatived seated mr hurst sang with sister while be thus employed elizabeth must not help observing a turned over music book lay on instrument how frequently mr darcy eye be fixed on hardly knew how to suppose that must be object of admiration to so great man yet that must look at because disliked be still more strange must only imagine however at last that drew notice because there be something about more wrong reprehensible according to idea of right than in other person present supposition did not pain liked too little to care for approbation after playing italian song miss bingley varied charm by lively scotch air soon afterwards mr darcy drawing near elizabeth said to feel great inclination miss bennet to seize such opportunity of dancing reel smiled made answer repeated question with surprise at silence oh said heard before must not immediately determine what to say in reply wanted know to say 'yes that might have pleasure of despising taste always delight in overthrowing kind of scheme cheating person of premeditated contempt have therefore made up mind to tell want to dance reel at now despise if dare indeed dare elizabeth having rather expected to affront be amazed at gallantry there be mixture of sweetness archness in manner made difficult for to affront anybody darcy have never be so bewitched by woman a be by really believed that be not for inferiority of connection must be in danger miss bingley saw suspected enough to be jealous great anxiety for recovery of dear friend jane received assistance from desire of getting rid of elizabeth often tried to provoke darcy into disliking guest by talking of supposed marriage planning happiness in such alliance hope said a be walking together in shrubbery next day will give mother in law few hint when desirable event take place a to advantage of holding tongue if can compass do cure younger girl of running after officer if may mention so delicate subject endeavour to check little something bordering on conceit impertinence lady posse have thing else to propose for domestic felicity oh yes do let portrait of uncle aunt philip be placed in gallery at pemberley put next to great uncle judge be in same profession know only in different line a for elizabeth picture must not attempt to have taken for what painter must do justice to beautiful eye must not be easy indeed to catch expression colour shape eye lash so remarkably fine might be copied at moment be met from walk by mr hurst elizabeth did not know that intended to walk said miss bingley in confusion lest have be overheard used abominably ill answered mr hurst in running away without telling that be coming out then taking disengaged arm of mr darcy left elizabeth to walk by path just admitted three mr darcy felt rudeness immediately said walk be not wide enough for party have better go into avenue elizabeth who have not least inclination to remain with laughingly answered stay where be be charmingly group 'd appear to uncommon advantage picturesque must be spoilt by admitting fourth good bye then ran gaily off rejoicing a rambled about in hope of being at home again in day two jane be already so much recovered a to intend leaving room for couple of hour that evening chapter xi when lady removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to sister seeing well guarded from cold attended into drawing room where be welcomed by two friend with many profession of pleasure elizabeth have never seen so agreeable a be during hour passed before gentleman appeared power of conversation be considerable must describe entertainment with accuracy relate anecdote with humour laugh at acquaintance with spirit when gentleman entered jane be no longer first object miss bingley eye be instantly turned towards darcy have something to say to before have advanced many step addressed directly to miss bennet with polite congratulation mr hurst also made slight bow said be very glad diffuseness warmth remained for bingley salutation be full of joy attention first hour be spent in piling up fire lest must suffer from change of room removed at desire to other side of fire place that might be farther from door then sat down by talked scarcely to one else elizabeth at work in opposite corner saw with great delight when tea be over mr hurst reminded sister in law of card table in vain have obtained private intelligence that mr darcy did not wish for card mr hurst soon found even open petition rejected assured that one intended to play silence of whole party on subject seemed to justify mr hurst have therefore nothing to do to stretch on one of sophas go to sleep darcy took up book miss bingley did same mr hurst principally occupied in playing with bracelet ring joined now then in brother conversation with miss bennet miss bingley attention be quite a much engaged in watching mr darcy progress through book a in reading own be perpetually making inquiry looking at page must not win however to conversation merely answered question read on at length quite exhausted by attempt to be amused with own book have only chosen because be second volume of gave great yawn said how pleasant be to spend evening in way declare after there be enjoyment like reading how much sooner one tire of thing than of book when have house of own will be miserable if have not excellent library one made reply then yawned again threw aside book cast eye round room in quest of amusement when hearing brother mentioning ball to miss bennet turned suddenly towards said by bye charles be really serious in meditating dance at netherfield must advise before determine on to consult wish of present party be much mistaken if there be not among to whom ball must be rather punishment than pleasure if mean darcy cried brother may go to bed if chuses before begin a for ball be quite settled thing a soon a nicholls have made white soup enough will send round card must like ball infinitely better replied if be carried on in different manner there be something insufferably tedious in usual process of meeting must surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made order of day much more rational dear caroline dare say must not be near so much like ball miss bingley made answer soon afterwards got up walked about room figure be elegant walked well darcy at whom be aimed be still inflexibly studious in desperation of feeling resolved on one effort more turning to elizabeth said miss eliza bennet let persuade to follow example take turn about room assure be very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude elizabeth be surprised agreed to immediately miss bingley succeeded le in real object of civility mr darcy looked up be a much awake to novelty of attention in quarter a elizabeth must be unconsciously closed book be directly invited to join party declined observing that must imagine two motif for chusing to walk up down room together with of motif joining must interfere what must mean be dying to know what must be meaning asked elizabeth whether must at understand not at be answer depend upon mean to be severe on surest way of disappointing will be to ask nothing about miss bingley however be incapable of disappointing mr darcy in thing persevered therefore in requiring explanation of two motif have not smallest objection to explaining said a soon a allowed to speak either chuse method of passing evening because be in other confidence have secret affair to discus because be conscious that figure appear to greatest advantage in walking if first must be completely in way if second can admire much better a sit by fire oh shocking cried miss bingley never heard thing so abominable how will punish for speech nothing so easy if have inclination said elizabeth can plague punish one teaze laugh at intimate a be must know how be to be done upon honour do assure that intimacy have not yet taught that teaze calmness of temper presence of mind feel may defy there a to laughter will not expose ourselves if please by attempting to laugh without subject mr darcy may hug mr darcy be not to be laughed at cried elizabeth be uncommon advantage uncommon hope will continue for must be great loss to to have many such acquaintance dearly love laugh miss bingley said have given credit for more than can be wisest best of men nay wisest best of action may be rendered ridiculous by person whose first object in life be joke certainly replied elizabeth there be such people hope be not one of hope never ridicule what be wise good folly nonsense whim inconsistency do divert own laugh at can suppose be precisely what be without perhaps be not possible for one have be study of life to avoid weakness often expose strong understanding to ridicule such a vanity pride yes vanity be weakness indeed pride where there be real superiority of mind pride will be always under good regulation elizabeth turned away to hide smile examination of mr darcy be over presume said miss bingley pray what be result be perfectly convinced by mr darcy have defect owns without disguise said darcy have made such pretension have fault enough be not hope of understanding temper dare not vouch for be believe too little yielding certainly too little for convenience of world can not forget folly vice of others so soon a ought offence against feeling be not puffed about with attempt to move temper must perhaps be called resentful good opinion once lost be lost for ever be failing indeed cried elizabeth implacable resentment be shade in character have chosen fault well really can not laugh at be safe from there be believe in disposition tendency to particular evil natural defect not even best education can overcome defect be propensity to hate body yours replied with smile be wilfully to misunderstand do let have little music cried miss bingley tired of conversation in have share louisa will not mind waking mr hurst sister made not smallest objection piano forte be opened darcy after few moment recollection be not sorry for began to feel danger of paying elizabeth too much attention chapter xii in consequence of agreement between sister elizabeth wrote next morning to mother to beg that carriage might be sent for in course of day mr bennet who have calculated on daughter remaining at netherfield till following tuesday must exactly finish jane week must not bring to receive with pleasure before answer therefore be not propitious at least not to elizabeth wish for be impatient to get home mr bennet sent word that must not possibly have carriage before tuesday in postscript be added that if mr bingley sister pressed to stay longer must spare very well against staying longer however elizabeth be positively resolved did much expect must be asked fearful on contrary a being considered a intruding needlessly long urged jane to borrow mr bingley carriage immediately at length be settled that original design of leaving netherfield that morning must be mentioned request made communication excited many profession of concern enough be said of wishing to stay at least till following day to work on jane till morrow going be deferred miss bingley be then sorry that have proposed delay for jealousy dislike of one sister much exceeded affection for other master of house heard with real sorrow that be to go so soon repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that must not be safe for that be not enough recovered jane be firm where felt to be right to mr darcy be welcome intelligence elizabeth have be at netherfield long enough attracted more than liked miss bingley be uncivil to more teazing than usual to wisely resolved to be particularly careful that sign of admiration must now escape nothing must elevate with hope of influencing felicity sensible that if such idea have be suggested behaviour during last day must have material weight in confirming crushing steady to purpose scarcely spoke ten word to through whole of saturday though be at one time left by for hour adhered most conscientiously to book must not even look at on sunday after morning service separation so agreeable to almost took place miss bingley civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly a well a affection for jane when parted after assuring latter of pleasure must always give to see at longbourn netherfield embracing most tenderly even shook hand with former elizabeth took leave of whole party in liveliest spirit be not welcomed home very cordially by mother mr bennet wondered at coming thought very wrong to give so much trouble be sure jane must have caught cold again father though very laconic in expression of pleasure be really glad to see have felt importance in family circle evening conversation when be assembled have lost much of animation almost sense by absence of jane elizabeth found mary a usual deep in study of thorough bass human nature have new extract to admire new observation of thread bare morality to listen to catherine lydia have information for of different sort much have be done much have be said in regiment since preceding wednesday several of officer have dined lately with uncle private have be flogged have actually be hinted that colonel forster be going to be married chapter xiii hope dear said mr bennet to wife a be at breakfast next morning that have ordered good dinner to day because have reason to expect addition to family party who do mean dear know of nobody be coming be sure unless charlotte lucas must happen to call in hope dinner be good enough for believe often see such at home person of whom speak be gentleman stranger mr bennet eye sparkled gentleman stranger be mr bingley be sure why jane never dropt word of sly thing well be sure will be extremely glad to see mr bingley good lord how unlucky there be not bit of fish to be got to day lydia love ring bell must speak to hill moment be not mr bingley said husband be person whom never saw in whole course of life roused general astonishment have pleasure of being eagerly questioned by wife five daughter at once after amusing time with curiosity thus explained about month ago received letter about fortnight ago answered for thought case of delicacy requiring early attention be from cousin mr collins who when be dead may turn out of house a soon a plea oh dear cried wife can not bear to hear that mentioned pray talk of odious man do think be hardest thing in world that estate must be entailed away from own child be sure if have be must have tried long ago to do something other about jane elizabeth attempted to explain to nature of entail have often attempted before be subject on mr bennet be beyond reach of reason continued to rail bitterly against cruelty of settling estate away from family of five daughter in favour of man whom nobody cared anything about certainly be most iniquitous affair said mr bennet nothing can clear mr collins from guilt of inheriting longbourn if will listen to letter may perhaps be little softened by manner of expressing that be sure will not think be very impertinent of to write to at very hypocritical hate such false friend why must not keep on quarrelling with a father did before why indeed doe seem to have have filial scruple on head a will hear hunsford near westerham kent th october dear disagreement subsisting between late honoured father always gave much uneasiness since have have misfortune to lose have frequently wished to heal breach for time be kept back by own doubt fearing lest might seem disrespectful to memory for to be on good term with one with whom have always pleased to be at variance there mr bennet mind however be now made up on subject for having received ordination at easter have be so fortunate a to be distinguished by patronage of right honourable lady catherine de bourgh widow of sir lewis de bourgh whose bounty beneficence have preferred to valuable rectory of parish where will be earnest endeavour to demean with grateful respect towards ladyship be ever ready to perform rite ceremony be instituted by church of england a clergyman moreover feel duty to promote establish blessing of peace in family within reach of influence on ground flatter that present overture of good will be highly commendable that circumstance of being next in entail of longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on side not lead to reject offered olive branch can not be otherwise than concerned at being mean of injuring amiable daughter beg leave to apologise for a well a to assure of readiness to make possible amends of hereafter if must have objection to receive into house propose satisfaction of waiting on family monday november th by four o'clock will probably trespass on hospitality till saturday se'night following can do without inconvenience a lady catherine be far from objecting to occasional absence on sunday provided that other clergyman be engaged to do duty of day remain dear sir with respectful compliment to lady daughter well wisher friend william collins at four o'clock therefore may expect peace making gentleman said mr bennet a folded up letter seems to be most conscientious polite young man upon word doubt not will prove valuable acquaintance especially if lady catherine must be so indulgent a to let come to again there be sense in what say about girl however if be disposed to make amends will not be person to discourage though be difficult said jane to guess in what way can mean to make atonement think due wish be certainly to credit elizabeth be chiefly struck with extraordinary deference for lady catherine kind intention of christening marrying burying parishioner whenever be required must be oddity think said can not make out there be something very pompous in style what can mean by apologizing for being next in entail can not suppose must help if must can be sensible man sir dear think not have great hope of finding quite reverse there be mixture of servility self importance in letter promise well be impatient to see in point of composition said mary letter doe not seem defective idea of olive branch perhaps be not wholly new yet think be well expressed to catherine lydia letter writer be in degree interesting be next to impossible that cousin must come in scarlet coat be now week since have received pleasure from society of man in other colour a for mother mr collins letter have done away much of ill will be preparing to see with degree of composure astonished husband daughter mr collins be punctual to time be received with great politeness by whole family mr bennet indeed said little lady be ready enough to talk mr collins seemed neither in need of encouragement inclined to be silent be tall heavy looking young man of five twenty air be grave stately manner be very formal have not be long seated before complimented mr bennet on having so fine family of daughter said have heard much of beauty in instance fame have fallen short of truth added that did not doubt seeing in due time well disposed of in marriage gallantry be not much to taste of of hearer mr bennet who quarrelled with compliment answered most readily be very kind sir be sure wish with heart may prove so for else will be destitute enough thing be settled so oddly allude perhaps to entail of estate ah sir do indeed be grievous affair to poor girl must confess not that mean to find fault with for such thing know be chance in world there be knowing how estate will go when once come to be entailed be very sensible madam of hardship to fair cousin must say much on subject that be cautious of appearing forward precipitate can assure young lady that

when mr philip understood from what rosings be who be proprietor when have listened to description of only one of lady catherine drawing room found that chimney piece alone have cost eight hundred pound felt force of compliment must hardly have resented comparison with housekeeper room in describing to grandeur of lady catherine mansion with occasional digression in praise of own humble abode improvement be receiving be happily employed until gentleman joined found in mr philip very attentive listener whose opinion of consequence increased with what heard who be resolving to retail among neighbour a soon a must to girl who must not listen to cousin who have nothing to do to wish for instrument examine own indifferent imitation of china on mantle piece interval of waiting appeared very long be over at last however gentleman did approach when mr wickham walked into room elizabeth felt that have be seeing before thinking of since with smallest degree of unreasonable admiration officer of shire be in general very creditable gentleman like set best of be of present party mr wickham be a far beyond in person countenance air walk a be superior to broad faced stuffy uncle philip

supplied with coffee muffin when card table be placed have opportunity of obliging in return by sitting down to whist know little of game at present said will be glad to improve for in situation of life mr philip be very thankful for compliance must not wait for reason mr wickham did not play at whist with ready delight be received at other table between elizabeth lydia at first there seemed danger of lydia engrossing entirely for be most determined talker being likewise extremely fond of lottery ticket soon grew too much interested in game too eager in making bet exclaiming after prize to have attention for one in particular allowing for common demand of game mr wickham be therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth be very willing to hear though what chiefly wished to hear must not hope to be told history of acquaintance with mr darcy dared not even mention that gentleman curiosity however be unexpectedly relieved mr began subject inquired how far be from meryton after receiving answer asked in hesitating manner how long mr darcy have be staying there about month said elizabeth then unwilling to let subject drop added be man of very large property in derbyshire understand yes replied wickham estate there be noble one clear ten thousand per annum must not have met with person more capable of giving certain information on head than for have be connected with family in particular manner from infancy elizabeth must not look surprised may well be surprised miss bennet at assertion after seeing a probably might very cold manner of meeting yesterday be much acquainted with mr darcy a much a ever wish to be cried elizabeth warmly have spent four day in same house with think very disagreeable have right to give opinion said wickham a to being agreeable otherwise be not qualified to form one have known too long too well to be fair judge be impossible for to be impartial believe opinion of must in general astonish perhaps must not express quite so strongly anywhere else here be in own family upon word say more here than might say in house in neighbourhood except netherfield be not at liked in hertfordshire body be disgusted with pride will not find more favourably spoken of by one can not pretend to be sorry said wickham after short interruption that that man must not be estimated beyond desert with believe doe not often happen world be blinded by fortune consequence frightened by high imposing manner see only a chuses to be seen must take even on slight acquaintance to be ill tempered man wickham only shook head wonder said at next opportunity of speaking whether be likely to be in country much longer at know heard nothing of going away when be at netherfield hope plan in favour of shire will not be affected by being in neighbourhood oh be not for to be driven away by mr darcy if wish to avoid seeing must go be not on friendly term always give pain to meet have reason for avoiding what might proclaim to world sense of very great ill usage most painful regret at being what be father miss bennet late mr darcy be one of best men ever breathed truest friend ever have can never be in company with mr darcy without being grieved to soul by thousand tender recollection behaviour to have be scandalous verily believe must forgive thing thing rather than disappointing hope disgracing memory of father elizabeth found interest of subject increase listened with heart delicacy of prevented farther inquiry mr wickham began to speak on more general topic meryton neighbourhood society appearing highly pleased with that have yet seen speaking of latter especially with gentle very intelligible gallantry be prospect of constant society good society added be chief inducement to enter shire knew to be most respectable agreeable corp friend denny tempted farther by account of present quarter very great attention excellent acquaintance meryton have procured society own be necessary to have be disappointed man spirit will not bear solitude must have employment society military life be not what be intended for circumstance have now made eligible church ought to have be profession be brought up for church must at time have be in possession of most valuable living have pleased gentleman be speaking of just now indeed yes late mr darcy bequeathed next presentation of best living in gift be godfather excessively attached to can not do justice to kindness meant to provide for amply thought have done when living fell be given elsewhere good heaven cried elizabeth how must that be how must will be disregarded why did not seek legal redress there be just such informality in term of bequest a to give hope from law man of honour must not have doubted intention mr darcy chose to doubt to treat a merely conditional recommendation to assert have forfeited claim to by extravagance imprudence in short thing nothing certain be that living became vacant two year ago exactly a be of age to hold that be given to man le certain be can not accuse myself of having really done thing to deserve to lose have warm unguarded temper may perhaps have sometimes spoken opinion of to too freely can recal nothing worse fact be that be very different sort of men that hate be quite shocking deserves to be publicly disgraced time other will be will not be by till can forget father can never defy expose elizabeth honoured for such feeling thought handsomer than ever a expressed what said after pause can have be motive what can have induced to behave so cruelly thorough determined dislike of dislike can not attribute in measure to jealousy have late mr darcy liked le son might have borne with better father uncommon attachment to irritated believe very early in life have not temper to bear sort of competition in stood sort of preference be often given have not thought mr darcy so bad a though have never liked have not thought so very ill of have supposed to be despising fellow creature in general did not suspect of descending to such malicious revenge such injustice such inhumanity a after few minute reflection however continued do remember boasting one day at netherfield of implacability of resentment of having unforgiving temper disposition must be dreadful will not trust on subject replied wickham can hardly be just to elizabeth be again deep in thought after time exclaimed to treat in such manner god son friend favourite of father must have added young man too like whose very countenance may vouch for being amiable contented with one too who have probably be own companion from childhood connected together a think said in closest manner be born in same parish within same park greatest part of youth be passed together inmate of same house sharing same amusement object of same parental care father began life in profession uncle mr philip appears to do so much credit to gave up thing to be of use to late mr darcy devoted time to care of pemberley property be most highly esteemed by mr darcy most intimate confidential friend mr darcy often acknowledged to be under greatest obligation to father active superintendance when immediately before father death mr darcy gave voluntary promise of providing for be convinced that felt to be a much debt of gratitude to a of affection to myself how strange cried elizabeth how abominable wonder that very pride of mr darcy have not made just to if from better motive that must not have be too proud to be dishonest for dishonesty must call be wonderful replied wickham for almost action may be traced to pride pride have often be best friend have connected nearer with virtue than other feeling be none of consistent in behaviour to there be stronger impulse even than pride can such abominable pride a have ever done good yes have often led to be liberal generous to give money freely to display hospitality to assist tenant relieve poor family pride filial pride for be very proud of what father be have done not to appear to disgrace family to degenerate from popular quality lose influence of pemberley house be powerful motive have also brotherly pride with brotherly affection make very kind careful guardian of sister will hear generally cried up a most attentive best of brother what sort of girl be miss darcy shook head wish must call amiable give pain to speak ill of darcy be too much like brother very very proud a child be affectionate pleasing extremely fond of have devoted hour hour to amusement be nothing to now be handsome girl about fifteen sixteen understand highly accomplished since father death home have be london where lady life with superintends education after many pause many trial of other subject elizabeth must not help reverting once more to first saying be astonished at intimacy with mr bingley how can mr bingley who seems good humour be really believe truly amiable be in friendship with man how can suit other do know mr bingley not at be sweet tempered amiable charming man can not know what mr darcy be probably not mr darcy can please where chuses doe not want ability can be conversible companion if think worth while among who be at equal in consequence be very different man from what be to le prosperous pride never desert with rich be liberal minded just sincere rational honourable perhaps agreeable allowing something for fortune figure whist party soon afterwards breaking up player gathered round other table mr collins took station between cousin elizabeth mr philip usual inquiry a to success be made by latter have not be very great have lost point when mr philip began to express concern thereupon assured with much earnest gravity that be not of least importance that considered money a mere trifle begged must not make uneasy know very well madam said that when person sit down to card table must take chance of thing happily be not in such circumstance a to make five shilling object there be undoubtedly many who must not say same thanks to lady catherine de bourgh be removed far beyond necessity of regarding little matter mr wickham attention be caught after observing mr collins for few moment asked elizabeth in low voice whether relation be very intimately acquainted with family of de bourgh lady catherine de bourgh replied have very lately given living hardly know how mr collins be first introduced to notice certainly have not known long know of course that lady catherine de bourgh lady anne darcy be sister consequently that be aunt to present mr darcy indeed did not knew nothing at of lady catherine connection never heard of existence till day before yesterday daughter miss de bourgh will have very large fortune be believed that cousin will unite two estate information made elizabeth smile a thought of poor miss bingley vain indeed must be attention vain useless affection for sister praise of if be already self destined to mr collins said speaks highly of lady catherine daughter from particular that have related of ladyship suspect gratitude misleads that in spite of being patroness be arrogant conceited woman believe to be in great degree replied wickham have not seen for many year very well remember never liked that manner be dictatorial insolent have reputation of being remarkably sensible clever rather believe derives part of ability from rank fortune part from authoritative manner rest from pride of nephew who chuses that one connected with must have understanding of first class elizabeth allowed that have given very rational account of continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put end to card gave rest of lady share of mr wickham attention there must be conversation in noise of mr philip supper party manner recommended to body said be said well whatever did done gracefully elizabeth went away with head full of must think of nothing of mr wickham of what have told way home there be not time for even to mention name a went for lydia mr collins be once silent lydia talked incessantly of lottery ticket of fish have lost fish have won mr collins in describing civility of mr mr philip protesting that did not in least regard loss at whist enumerating dish at supper repeatedly fearing that crouded cousin have more to say than must well manage before carriage stopped at longbourn house chapter xvii elizabeth related to jane next day what have passed between mr wickham jane listened with astonishment concern knew not how to believe that mr darcy must be so unworthy of mr bingley regard yet be not in nature to question veracity of young man of such amiable appearance a wickham possibility of having really endured such unkindness be enough to interest tender feeling nothing therefore remained to be done to think well of to defend conduct of throw into account of accident mistake must not be otherwise explained have said be deceived dare say in way other of can form idea interested people have perhaps misrepresented to other be in short impossible for to conjecture cause circumstance may have alienated without actual blame on side very true indeed now dear jane what have got to say in behalf of interested people who have probably be concerned in business do clear too will be obliged to think ill of somebody laugh a much a chuse will not laugh out of opinion dearest lizzy do consider in what disgraceful light place mr darcy to be treating father favourite in such manner one whom father have promised to provide for be impossible man of common humanity man who have value for character must be capable of can most intimate friend be so excessively deceived in oh can much more easily believe mr bingley being imposed on than mr wickham must invent history of a gave last night name fact thing mentioned without ceremony if be not so let mr darcy contradict besides there be truth in look be difficult indeed be distressing one doe not know what to think beg pardon one know exactly what to think jane must think with certainty on only one point mr bingley if have be imposed on must have much to suffer when affair became public two young lady be summoned from shrubbery where conversation passed by arrival of of very person of whom have be speaking mr bingley sister came to give personal invitation for long expected ball at netherfield be fixed for following tuesday two lady be delighted to see dear friend again called age since have met repeatedly asked what have be doing with since separation to rest of family paid little attention avoiding mr bennet a much a possible saying not much to elizabeth nothing at to others be soon gone again rising from seat with activity took brother by surprise hurrying off a if eager to escape from mr bennet civility prospect of netherfield ball be extremely agreeable to female of family mr bennet chose to consider a given in compliment to eldest daughter be particularly flattered by receiving invitation from mr bingley instead of ceremonious card jane pictured to herself happy evening in society of two friend attention of brother elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing great deal with mr wickham of seeing confirmation of thing in mr darcy look behaviour happiness anticipated by catherine lydia depended le on single event particular person for though like elizabeth meant to dance evening with mr wickham be by mean only partner who must satisfy ball be at rate ball even mary must assure family that have disinclination for while can have morning to myself said be enough think sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagement society have claim on profess one of who consider interval of recreation amusement a desirable for body elizabeth spirit be so high on occasion that though did not often speak unnecessarily to mr collins must not help asking whether intended to accept mr bingley invitation if did whether must think proper to join in evening amusement be rather surprised to find that entertained scruple on head be very far from dreading rebuke from archbishop lady catherine de bourgh by venturing to dance be by mean of opinion assure said that ball of kind given by young man of character to respectable people can have evil tendency be so far from objecting to dancing that will hope to be honoured with hand of fair cousin in course of evening take opportunity of soliciting yours miss elizabeth for two first dance especially preference trust cousin jane will attribute to right cause not to disrespect for elizabeth felt completely taken in have fully proposed being engaged by wickham for very dance to have mr collins instead liveliness have be never worse timed there be help for however mr wickham happiness own be per force delayed little longer mr collins proposal accepted with a good grace a must be not better pleased with gallantry from idea suggested of something more now first struck that be selected from among sister a worthy of being mistress of hunsford parsonage of assisting to form quadrille table at rosings in absence of more eligible visitor idea soon reached to conviction a observed increasing civility toward heard frequent attempt at compliment on wit vivacity though more astonished than gratified herself by effect of charm be not long before mother gave to understand that probability of marriage be exceedingly agreeable to elizabeth however did not chuse to take hint being well aware that serious dispute must be consequence of reply mr collins might never make offer till did be useless to quarrel about if there have not be netherfield ball to prepare for talk of younger miss bennet must have be in pitiable state at time for from day of invitation to day of ball there be such succession of rain a prevented walking to meryton once aunt officer news must be sought after very shoe rose for netherfield be got by proxy even elizabeth might have found trial of patience in weather totally suspended improvement of acquaintance with mr wickham nothing le than dance on tuesday must have made friday saturday sunday monday endurable to kitty lydia chapter xviii till elizabeth entered drawing room at netherfield looked in vain for mr wickham among cluster of red coat there assembled doubt of being present have never occurred to certainty of meeting have not be checked by of recollection might not unreasonably have alarmed have dressed with more than usual care prepared in highest spirit for conquest of remained unsubdued of heart trusting that be not more than might be won in course of evening in instant arose dreadful suspicion of being purposely omitted for mr darcy pleasure in bingleys invitation to officer though be not exactly case absolute fact of absence be pronounced by friend mr denny to whom lydia eagerly applied who told that wickham have be obliged to go to town on business day before be not yet returned adding with significant smile imagine business must have called away just now if have not wished to avoid certain gentleman here part of intelligence though unheard by lydia be caught by elizabeth a assured that darcy be not le answerable for wickham absence than if first surmise have be just feeling of displeasure against former be so sharpened by immediate disappointment that must hardly reply with tolerable civility to polite inquiry directly afterwards approached to make attention forbearance patience with darcy be injury to wickham be resolved against sort of conversation with turned away with degree of ill humour must not wholly surmount even in speaking to mr bingley whose blind partiality provoked elizabeth be not formed for ill humour though prospect of own be destroyed for evening must not dwell long on spirit having told grief to charlotte lucas whom have not seen for week be soon able to make voluntary transition to oddity of cousin to point out to particular notice two first dance however brought return of distress be dance of mortification mr collins awkward solemn apologising instead of attending often moving wrong without being aware of gave shame misery disagreeable partner for couple of dance can give moment of release from be ecstacy danced next with officer have refreshment of talking of wickham of hearing that be universally liked when dance be over returned to charlotte lucas be in conversation with when found suddenly addressed by mr darcy who took so much by surprise in application for hand that without knowing what did accepted walked away again immediately be left to fret over own want of presence of mind charlotte tried to console dare say will find very agreeable heaven forbid must be greatest misfortune of to find man agreeable whom one be determined to hate wish such evil when dancing recommenced however darcy approached to claim hand charlotte must not help cautioning in whisper not to be simpleton allow fancy for wickham to make appear unpleasant in eye of man of ten time consequence elizabeth made answer took place in set amazed at dignity to be arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr darcy reading in neighbour look equal amazement in beholding stood for time without speaking word began to imagine that silence be to last through two dance at first be resolved not to break till suddenly fancying that must be greater punishment to partner to oblige to talk made slight observation on dance replied be again silent after pause of minute addressed second time with be turn to say something now mr darcy talked about dance ought to make kind of remark on size of room number of couple smiled assured that wished to say must be said very well that reply will do for present perhaps by bye may observe private ball be much pleasanter than public one now may be silent do talk by rule then while be dancing sometimes one must speak little know must look odd to be entirely silent for hour together yet for advantage of conversation ought to be so arranged a that may have trouble of saying a little a possible be consulting own feeling in present case do imagine that be gratifying mine replied elizabeth archly for have always seen great similarity in turn of mind be of unsocial taciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless expect to say something will amaze whole room be handed down to posterity with eclat of proverb be very striking resemblance of own character be sure said how near may be to mine can not pretend to say think faithful portrait undoubtedly must not decide on own performance made answer be again silent till have gone down dance when asked if sister did not very often walk to meryton answered in affirmative unable to resist temptation added when met there other day have just be forming new acquaintance effect be immediate deeper shade of hauteur overspread feature said not word elizabeth though blaming for own weakness must not go on at length darcy spoke in constrained manner said mr wickham be blessed with such happy manner a may ensure making friend whether may be equally capable of retaining be le certain have be so unlucky a to lose friendship replied elizabeth with emphasis in manner be likely to suffer from life darcy made answer seemed desirous of changing subject at moment sir william lucas appeared close to meaning to pas through set to other side of room on perceiving mr darcy stopt with bow of superior courtesy to compliment on dancing partner have be most highly gratified indeed dear sir such very superior dancing be not often seen be evident that belong to first circle allow to say however that fair partner doe not disgrace must hope to have pleasure often repeated especially when certain desirable event dear miss eliza glancing at sister bingley will take place what congratulation will then flow in appeal to mr darcy let not interrupt sir will not thank for detaining from bewitching converse of young lady whose bright eye be also upbraiding latter part of address be scarcely heard by darcy sir william allusion to friend seemed to strike forcibly eye be directed with very serious expression towards bingley jane who be dancing together recovering however shortly turned to partner said sir william interruption have made forget what be talking of think be speaking at sir william must not have interrupted two people in room who have le to say for have tried two three subject already without success what be to talk of next can not imagine what think of book said smiling book oh be sure never read same not with same feeling be sorry think so if be case there can at least be want of subject may compare different opinion can not talk of book in ball room head be always full of something else present always occupies in such scene doe said with look of doubt yes always replied without knowing what said for thought have wandered far from subject a soon afterwards appeared by suddenly exclaiming remember hearing once say mr darcy that hardly ever forgave that resentment once created be unappeasable be very cautious suppose a to being created be said with firm voice never allow to be blinded by prejudice hope not be particularly incumbent on who never change opinion to be secure of judging properly at first may ask to what question tend merely to illustration of character said endeavouring to shake off gravity be trying to make out what be success shook head get on at hear such different account of a puzzle exceedingly can readily believe answered gravely that report may vary greatly with respect to must wish miss bennet that be not to sketch character at present moment a there be reason to fear that performance must reflect credit on if take likeness now may never have opportunity must by mean suspend pleasure of yours coldly replied said more went down other dance parted in silence on side dissatisfied though not to equal degree for in darcy breast there be tolerable powerful feeling towards soon procured pardon directed anger against have not long separated when miss bingley came towards with expression of civil disdain thus accosted so miss eliza hear be quite delighted with george wickham sister have be talking to about asking thousand question find that young man forgot to tell among other communication that be son of old wickham late mr darcy steward let recommend however a friend not to give implicit confidence to assertion for a to mr darcy using ill be perfectly false for on contrary have be always remarkably kind to though george wickham have treated mr darcy in most infamous manner know particular know very well that mr darcy be not in least to blame that can not bear to hear george wickham mentioned that though brother thought must not well avoid including in invitation to officer be excessively glad to find that have taken out of way coming into country at be most insolent thing indeed wonder how must presume to do pity miss eliza for discovery of favourite guilt really considering descent one must not expect much better guilt descent appear by account to be same said elizabeth angrily for have heard accuse of nothing worse than of being son of mr darcy steward of can assure informed beg pardon replied miss bingley turning away with sneer excuse interference be kindly meant insolent girl said elizabeth to herself be much mistaken if expect to influence by paltry attack a see nothing in own wilful ignorance malice of mr darcy then sought eldest sister who have undertaken to make inquiry on same subject of bingley jane met with smile of such sweet complacency glow of such happy expression a sufficiently marked how well be satisfied with occurrence of evening elizabeth instantly read feeling at moment solicitude for wickham resentment against enemy thing else gave way before hope of jane being in fairest way for happiness want to know said with countenance no le smiling than sister what have learnt about mr wickham perhaps have be too pleasantly engaged to think of third person in case may be sure of pardon replied jane have not forgotten have nothing satisfactory to tell mr bingley doe not know whole of history be quite ignorant of circumstance have principally offended mr darcy will vouch for good conduct probity honour of friend be perfectly convinced that mr wickham have deserved much le attention from mr darcy than have received be sorry to say that by account a well a sister mr wickham be by mean respectable young man be afraid have be very imprudent have deserved to lose mr darcy regard mr bingley doe not know mr wickham no never saw till other morning at meryton account then be what have received from mr darcy be perfectly satisfied what doe say of living doe not exactly recollect circumstance though have heard from mr darcy more than once belief that be left to conditionally only have not doubt of mr bingley sincerity said elizabeth warmly must excuse not being convinced by assurance only mr bingley defence of friend be very able one dare say since be unacquainted with several part of story have learnt rest from friend will venture still to think of gentleman a did before then changed discourse to one more gratifying to on there must be difference of sentiment elizabeth listened with delight to happy though modest hope jane entertained of bingley regard said in power to heighten confidence in on being joined by mr bingley elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas to whose inquiry after pleasantness of last partner have scarcely replied before mr collins came up to told with great exultation that have just be so fortunate a to make most important discovery have found out said by singular accident that there be now in room near relation of patroness happened to overhear gentleman mentioning to young lady who doe honour of house name of cousin miss de bourgh of mother lady catherine how wonderfully sort of thing occur who must have thought of meeting with perhaps nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in assembly be most thankful that discovery be made in time for to pay respect to be now going to do trust will excuse not having done before total ignorance of connection must plead apology be not going to introduce to mr darcy indeed be will intreat pardon for not having done earlier believe to be lady catherine nephew will be in power to assure that ladyship be quite well yesterday se'night elizabeth tried hard to dissuade from scheme assuring that mr darcy must consider addressing without introduction a impertinent freedom rather than compliment to aunt that be not in least necessary there must be notice on side that if be must belong to mr darcy superior in consequence to begin acquaintance mr collins listened to with determined air of following own inclination when ceased speaking replied thus dear miss elizabeth have highest opinion in world of excellent judgment in matter within scope of understanding permit to say that there must be wide difference between established form of ceremony amongst laity regulate clergy for give leave to observe consider clerical office a equal in point of dignity with highest rank in kingdom provided that proper humility of behaviour be at same time maintained must therefore allow to follow dictate of conscience on occasion lead to perform what look on a point of duty pardon for neglecting to profit by advice on other subject will be constant guide though in case before consider more fitted by education habitual study to decide on what be right than young lady like with low bow left to attack mr darcy whose reception of advance eagerly watched whose astonishment at being so addressed be very evident cousin prefaced speech with solemn bow though must not hear word of felt a if hearing saw in motion of lip word apology hunsford lady catherine de bourgh vexed to see expose to man mr darcy be eyeing with unrestrained wonder when at last mr collins allowed time to speak replied with air of distant civility mr collins however be not discouraged from speaking again mr darcy contempt seemed abundantly increasing with length of second speech at end of only made slight bow moved way mr collins then returned to elizabeth have reason assure said to be dissatisfied with reception mr darcy seemed much pleased with attention answered with utmost civility even paid compliment of saying that be so well convinced of lady catherine discernment a to be certain must never bestow favour unworthily be really very handsome thought upon whole be much pleased with a elizabeth have longer interest of own to pursue turned attention almost entirely on sister mr bingley train of agreeable reflection observation gave birth to made perhaps almost a happy a jane saw in idea settled in very house in felicity marriage of true affection must bestow felt capable under such circumstance of endeavouring even to like bingley two sister mother thought plainly saw be bent same way determined not to venture near lest might hear too much when sat down to supper therefore considered most unlucky perverseness placed within one of other deeply be vexed to find that mother be talking to one person lady lucas freely openly of nothing else of expectation that jane must be soon married to mr bingley be animating subject mr bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating advantage of match being such charming young man so rich living three mile from be first point of self gratulation then be such comfort to think how fond two sister be of jane to be certain that must desire connection a much a must do be moreover such promising thing for younger daughter a jane marrying so greatly must throw in way of other rich men lastly be so pleasant at time of life to be able to consign single daughter to care of sister that might not be obliged to go into company more than liked be necessary to make circumstance matter of pleasure because on such occasion be etiquette one be le likely than mr bennet to find comfort in staying at home at period of life concluded with many good wish lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate though evidently triumphantly believing there be chance of in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check rapidity of mother word persuade to describe felicity in le audible whisper for to inexpressible vexation must perceive that chief of be overheard by mr darcy who sat opposite to mother only scolded for being nonsensical what be mr darcy to pray must be afraid of be sure owe such particular civility a to be obliged to say nothing may not like to hear for heaven sake madam speak lower what advantage can be to to offend mr darcy will never recommend to friend by so doing nothing that must say however have influence mother must talk of view in same intelligible tone elizabeth blushed blushed again with shame vexation must not help frequently glancing eye at mr darcy though glance convinced of what dreaded for though be not always looking at mother be convinced that attention be invariably fixed by expression of face changed gradually from indignant contempt to composed steady gravity at length however mr bennet have more to say lady lucas who have be long yawning at repetition of delight saw likelihood of sharing be left to comfort of cold ham chicken elizabeth now began to revive not long be interval of tranquillity for when supper be over singing be talked of have mortification of seeing mary after very little entreaty preparing to oblige company by many significant look silent entreaty did endeavour to prevent such proof of complaisance in vain mary must not understand opportunity of exhibiting be delightful to began song elizabeth eye be fixed on with most painful sensation watched progress through several stanza with impatience be very ill rewarded at close for mary on receiving amongst thanks of table hint of hope that might be prevailed on to favour again after pause of minute began mary power be by mean fitted for such display voice be weak manner affected elizabeth be in agony looked at jane to see how bore jane be very composedly talking to bingley looked at two sister saw making sign of derision at other at darcy who continued however impenetrably grave looked at father to entreat interference lest mary must be singing night took hint when mary have finished second song said aloud will do extremely well child have delighted long enough let other young lady have time to exhibit mary though pretending not to hear be somewhat disconcerted elizabeth sorry for sorry for father speech be afraid anxiety have done no good others of party be now applied to if said mr collins be so fortunate a to be able to sing must have great pleasure be sure in obliging company with air for consider music a very innocent diversion perfectly compatible with profession of clergyman mean however to assert that can be justified in devoting too much of time to music for there be certainly other thing to be attended to rector of parish have much to do in first place must make such agreement for tythes a may be beneficial to not offensive to patron must write own sermon time remains will not be too much for parish duty care improvement of dwelling can not be excused from making a comfortable a possible think of light importance that must have attentive conciliatory manner towards body especially towards to whom owes preferment can not acquit of duty must think well of man who must omit occasion of testifying respect towards body connected with family with bow to mr darcy concluded speech have be spoken so loud a to be heard by room many stared many smiled one looked more amused than mr bennet while wife seriously commended mr collins for having spoken so sensibly observed in half whisper to lady lucas that be remarkably clever good kind of young man to elizabeth appeared that have family made agreement to expose a much a must during evening must have be impossible for to play part with more spirit finer success happy did think for bingley sister that of exhibition have escaped notice that feeling be not of sort to be much distressed by folly must have witnessed that two sister mr darcy however must have opportunity of ridiculing relation be bad enough must not determine whether silent contempt of gentleman insolent smile of lady be more intolerable rest of evening brought little amusement be teazed by mr collins who continued most perseveringly by side though must not prevail with to dance with again put out of power to dance with others in vain did entreat to stand up with somebody else offer to introduce to young lady in room assured that a to dancing be perfectly indifferent to that chief object be by delicate attention to recommend to that must therefore make point of remaining close to whole evening there be arguing upon project owed greatest relief to friend miss lucas who often joined good naturedly engaged mr collins conversation to herself be at least free from offence of mr darcy farther notice though often standing within very short distance of quite disengaged never came near enough to speak felt to be probable consequence of allusion to mr wickham rejoiced in longbourn party be last of company to depart by manoeuvre of mr bennet have to wait for carriage quarter of hour after body else be gone gave time to see how heartily be wished away by of family mr hurst sister scarcely opened mouth except to complain of fatigue be evidently impatient to have house to repulsed attempt of mr bennet at conversation by so doing threw languor over whole party be very little relieved by long speech of mr collins who be complimenting mr bingley sister on elegance of entertainment hospitality politeness have marked behaviour to guest darcy said nothing at mr bennet in equal silence be enjoying scene mr bingley jane be standing together little detached from rest talked only to other elizabeth preserved a steady silence a mr hurst miss bingley even lydia be too much fatigued to utter more than occasional exclamation of lord how tired be accompanied by violent yawn when at length arose to take leave mr bennet be most pressingly civil in hope of seeing whole family soon at longbourn addressed particularly to mr bingley to assure how happy must make by eating family dinner with at time without ceremony of formal invitation bingley be grateful pleasure readily engaged for taking earliest opportunity of waiting on after return from london whither be obliged to go next day for short time mr bennet be perfectly satisfied quitted house under delightful persuasion that allowing for necessary preparation of settlement new carriage wedding clothes must undoubtedly see daughter settled at netherfield in course of three four month of having daughter married to mr collins thought with equal certainty with considerable though not equal pleasure elizabeth be least dear to of child though man match be quite good enough for worth of be eclipsed by mr bingley netherfield chapter xix next day opened new scene at longbourn mr collins made declaration in form having resolved to do without loss of time a leave of absence extended only to following saturday having feeling of diffidence to make distressing to even at moment set about in very orderly manner with observance supposed regular part of business on finding mr bennet elizabeth one of younger girl together soon after breakfast addressed mother in word may hope madam for interest with fair daughter elizabeth when solicit for honour of private audience with in course of morning before elizabeth have time for thing blush of surprise mr bennet instantly answered oh dear yes certainly be sure lizzy will be very happy be sure can have objection come kitty want up stair gathering work together be hastening away when elizabeth called out dear ma'be go beg will not go mr collins must excuse can have nothing to say to that body need not hear be going away nonsense lizzy desire will stay where be upon elizabeth seeming really with vexed embarrassed look about to escape added lizzy insist upon staying hearing mr collins elizabeth must not oppose such injunction moment consideration making also sensible that must be wisest to get over a soon a quietly a possible sat down again tried to conceal by incessant employment feeling be divided between distress diversion mr bennet kitty walked off a soon a be gone mr collins began believe dear miss elizabeth that modesty so far from doing disservice rather add to other perfection must have be le amiable in eye have there not be little unwillingness allow to assure have respected mother permission for address can hardly doubt purport of discourse however natural delicacy may lead to dissemble attention have be too marked to be mistaken almost a soon a entered house singled out a companion of future life before be run away with by feeling on subject perhaps will be advisable for to state reason for marrying moreover for coming into hertfordshire with design of selecting wife a certainly did idea of mr collins with solemn composure being run away with by feeling made elizabeth so near laughing that must not use short pause allowed in attempt to stop farther continued reason for marrying be first that think right thing for clergyman in easy circumstance like to set example of matrimony in parish secondly that be convinced will add very greatly to happiness thirdly perhaps ought to have mentioned earlier that be particular advice recommendation of very noble lady whom have honour of calling patroness twice have condescended to give opinion unasked too on subject be very saturday night before left hunsford between pool at quadrille while mr jenkinson be arranging miss de bourgh foot stool that said collins must marry clergyman like must marry chuse properly chuse gentlewoman for sake for own let be active useful sort of person not brought up high able to make small income go good way be advice find such woman a soon a can bring to hunsford will visit allow by way to observe fair cousin reckon notice kindness of lady catherine de bourgh a among least of advantage in power to offer will find manner beyond thing can describe wit vivacity think must be acceptable to especially when tempered with silence respect rank will inevitably excite thus much for general intention in favour of matrimony remains to be told why view be directed to longbourn instead of own neighbourhood where assure there be many amiable young woman fact be being a be to inherit estate after death of honoured father who however may live many year longer must not satisfy without resolving to chuse wife from among daughter that loss to might be a little a possible when melancholy event take place however a have already said may not be for several year have be motive fair cousin flatter will not sink in esteem now nothing remains for to assure in most animated language of violence of affection to fortune be perfectly indifferent will make demand of nature on father since be well aware that must not be complied with that one thousand pound in per cent will not be yours till after mother decease be that may ever be entitled to on head therefore will be uniformly silent may assure that ungenerous reproach will ever pas lip when be married be absolutely necessary to interrupt now be too hasty sir cried forget have made answer let do without farther loss of time accept thanks for compliment be paying be very sensible of honour of proposal be impossible for to do otherwise than decline be not now to learn replied mr collins with formal wave of hand that be usual with young lady to reject address of man whom secretly mean to accept when first applies for favour that sometimes refusal be repeated second even third time be therefore by mean discouraged by what have just said will hope to lead to altar ere long upon word sir cried elizabeth hope be rather extraordinary one after declaration do assure that be not one of young lady if such young lady there be who be so daring a to risk happiness on chance of being asked second time be perfectly serious in refusal must not make happy be convinced that be last woman in world who must make so nay be friend lady catherine to know be persuaded must find in respect ill qualified for situation be certain that lady catherine must think so said mr collins very gravely can not imagine that ladyship must at disapprove of may be certain that when have honour of seeing again will speak in highest term of modesty economy other amiable qualification indeed mr collins praise of will be unnecessary must give leave to judge for pay compliment of believing what say wish very happy very rich by refusing hand do in power to prevent being otherwise in making offer must have satisfied delicacy of feeling with regard to family may take possession of longbourn estate whenever fall without self reproach matter may be considered therefore a finally settled rising a thus spoke must have quitted room have not mr collins thus addressed when do honour of speaking to next on subject will hope to receive more favourable answer than have now given though be far from accusing of cruelty at present because know to be established custom of sex to reject man on first application perhaps have even now said a much to encourage suit a must be consistent with true delicacy of female character really mr collins cried elizabeth with warmth puzzle exceedingly if what have hitherto said can appear to in form of encouragement know not how to express refusal in such way a may convince of being one must give leave to flatter dear cousin that refusal of address be merely word of course reason for believing be briefly doe not appear to that hand be unworthy acceptance that establishment can offer must be other than highly desirable situation in life connection with family of de bourgh relationship to own be circumstance highly in favour must take into farther consideration that in spite of manifold attraction be by mean certain that offer of marriage may ever be made portion be unhappily so small that will in likelihood undo effect of loveliness amiable qualification a must therefore conclude that be not serious in rejection of will chuse to attribute to wish of increasing love by suspense according to usual practice of elegant female do assure sir have pretension to kind of elegance consists in tormenting respectable man must rather be paid compliment of being believed sincere thank again again for honour have done in proposal to accept be absolutely impossible feeling in respect forbid can speak plainer consider now a elegant female intending to plague a rational creature speaking truth from heart be uniformly charming cried with air of awkward gallantry be persuaded that when sanctioned by express authority of excellent parent proposal will not fail of being acceptable to such perseverance in wilful self deception elizabeth must make reply immediately in silence withdrew determined if persisted in considering repeated refusal a flattering encouragement to apply to father whose negative might be uttered in such manner a must be decisive whose behaviour at least must not be mistaken for affectation coquetry of elegant female chapter xx mr collins be not left long to silent contemplation of successful love for mr bennet having dawdled about in vestibule to watch for end of conference sooner saw elizabeth open door with quick step pas towards staircase than entered breakfast room congratulated in warm term on happy prospect of nearer connection mr collins received returned felicitation with equal pleasure then proceeded to relate particular of interview with result of trusted have reason to be satisfied since refusal cousin have steadfastly given must naturally flow from bashful modesty genuine delicacy of character information however startled mr bennet must have be glad to be equally satisfied that daughter have meant to encourage by protesting against proposal dared not to believe must not help saying so depend upon mr collins added that lizzy will be brought to reason will speak to about directly be very headstrong foolish girl doe not know own interest will make know pardon for interrupting madam cried mr collins if be really headstrong foolish know not whether must altogether be very desirable wife to man in situation who naturally look for happiness in marriage state if therefore actually persists in rejecting suit perhaps be better not to force into accepting because if liable to such defect of temper must not contribute much to felicity sir quite misunderstand said mr bennet alarmed lizzy be only headstrong in such matter a in thing else be a good natured girl a ever lived will go directly to mr bennet will very soon settle with be sure must not give time to reply hurrying instantly to husband called out a entered library oh mr bennet be wanted immediately be in uproar must come make lizzy marry mr collins for vow will not have if make haste will change mind not have mr bennet raised eye from book a entered fixed on face with calm unconcern be not in least altered by communication have not pleasure of understanding said when have finished speech of what be talking of mr collins lizzy lizzy declares will not have mr collins mr collins begin to say that will not have lizzy what be to do on occasion seems hopeless business speak to lizzy about tell that insist upon marrying let be called down will hear opinion mr bennet rang bell miss elizabeth be summoned to library come here child cried father a appeared have sent for on affair of importance understand mr collins have made offer of marriage be true elizabeth replied that be very well offer of marriage have refused have sir very well now come to point mother insists upon accepting be not so mr bennet yes will never see again unhappy alternative be before elizabeth from day must be stranger to one of parent mother will never see again if marry mr collins will never see again if do elizabeth must not smile at conclusion of such beginning mr bennet who have persuaded herself that husband regarded affair a wished be excessively disappointed what do mean mr bennet by talking in way promised to insist upon marrying dear replied husband have two small favour to request first that will allow free use of understanding on present occasion secondly of room will be glad to have library to myself a soon a may be not yet however in spite of disappointment in husband did mr bennet give up point talked to elizabeth again again coaxed threatened by turn endeavoured to secure jane in interest jane with possible mildness declined interfering elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness sometimes with playful gaiety replied to attack though manner varied however determination never did mr collins meanwhile be meditating in solitude on what have passed thought too well of to comprehend on motive cousin must refuse though pride be hurt suffered in other way regard for be quite imaginary possibility of deserving mother reproach prevented feeling regret while family be in confusion charlotte lucas came to spend day with be met in vestibule by lydia who flying to cried in half whisper be glad be come for there be such fun here what do think have happened morning mr collins have made offer to lizzy will not have charlotte have hardly time to answer before be joined by kitty who came to tell same news sooner have entered breakfast room where mr bennet be alone than likewise began on subject calling on miss lucas for compassion entreating to persuade friend lizzy to comply with wish of family pray do dear miss lucas added in melancholy tone for nobody be on side nobody take part with be cruelly used nobody feel for poor nerve charlotte reply be spared by entrance of jane elizabeth aye there come continued mr bennet looking a unconcerned a may be caring more for than if be at york provided can have own way tell what miss lizzy if take into head to go on refusing offer of marriage in way will never get husband at be sure know who be to maintain when father be dead will not be able to keep so warn have done with from very day told in library know must never speak to again will find a good a word have pleasure in talking to undutiful child not have much pleasure indeed in talking to body people who suffer a do from nervous complaint can have great inclination for talking nobody can tell what suffer be always so who complain be never pitied daughter listened in silence to effusion sensible that attempt to reason with sooth must only increase irritation talked on therefore without interruption from of till be joined by mr collins who entered with air more stately than usual on perceiving whom said to girl now do insist upon that of hold tongue let mr collins have little conversation together elizabeth passed quietly out of room jane kitty followed lydia stood ground determined to hear must charlotte detained first by civility of mr collins whose inquiry after family be very minute then by little curiosity satisfied with walking to window pretending not to hear in doleful voice mr bennet thus began projected conversation oh mr collins dear madam replied let be for ever silent on point far be from presently continued in voice marked displeasure to resent behaviour of daughter resignation to inevitable evil be duty of peculiar duty of young man who have be so fortunate a have be in early preferment trust be resigned perhaps not le so from feeling doubt of positive happiness have fair cousin honoured with hand for have often observed that resignation be never so perfect a when blessing denied begin to lose somewhat of value in estimation will not hope consider a shewing disrespect to family dear madam by thus withdrawing pretension to daughter favour without having paid mr bennet compliment of requesting to interpose authority in behalf conduct may fear be objectionable in having accepted dismission from daughter lip instead of own be liable to error have certainly meant well through whole affair object have be to secure amiable companion for myself with due consideration for advantage of family if manner have be at reprehensible here beg leave to apologise chapter xxi discussion of mr collins offer be now nearly at end elizabeth have only to suffer from uncomfortable feeling necessarily attending occasionally from peevish allusion of mother a for gentleman feeling be chiefly expressed not by embarrassment dejection by trying to avoid by stiffness of manner resentful silence scarcely ever spoke to assiduous attention have be so sensible of be transferred for rest of day to miss lucas whose civility in listening to be seasonable relief to especially to friend morrow produced abatement of mr bennet ill humour ill health mr collins be also in same state of angry pride elizabeth have hoped that resentment might shorten visit plan did not appear in least affected by be always to have gone on saturday to saturday still meant to stay after breakfast girl walked to meryton to inquire if mr wickham be returned to lament over absence from netherfield ball joined on entering town attended to aunt where regret vexation concern of body be well talked over to elizabeth however voluntarily acknowledged that necessity of absence have be self imposed found said a time drew near have better not meet mr darcy to be in same room same party with for so many hour together might be more than must bear scene might arise unpleasant to more than highly approved forbearance have leisure for full discussion of for commendation civilly bestowed on other a wickham officer walked back with to longbourn during walk particularly attended to accompanying be double advantage felt compliment offered to be most acceptable a occasion of introducing to father mother soon after return letter be delivered to miss bennet came from netherfield be opened immediately envelope contained sheet of elegant little hot pressed paper well covered with lady fair flowing hand elizabeth saw sister countenance change a read saw dwelling intently on particular passage jane recollected soon putting letter away tried to join with usual cheerfulness in general conversation elizabeth felt anxiety on subject drew off attention even from wickham sooner have companion taken leave than glance from jane invited to follow up stair when have gained own room jane taking out letter said be from caroline bingley what contains have surprised good deal whole party have left netherfield by time be on way to town without intention of coming back again will hear what

separation by very frequent most unreserved correspondence depend on for to high flown expression elizabeth listened with insensibility of distrust though suddenness of removal surprised saw nothing in really to lament be not to be supposed that absence from netherfield must prevent mr bingley being there a to loss of society be persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard in enjoyment of be unlucky said after short pause that must not be able to see friend before leave country may not hope that period of future happiness to miss bingley look forward may arrive earlier than be aware that delightful intercourse have known a friend will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction a sister mr bingley will not be detained in london by caroline decidedly say that none of party will return into hertfordshire winter will read to when brother left yesterday imagined that business took to london might be concluded in three four day a be certain can not be so at same time convinced that when charles get to town will be in hurry to leave again have determined on following thither that may not be obliged to spend vacant hour in comfortless hotel many of acquaintance be already there for winter wish must hear that dearest friend have intention of making one in croud of despair sincerely hope christmas in hertfordshire may abound in gaiety that season generally brings that beau will be so numerous a to prevent feeling loss of three of whom will deprive be evident by added jane that come back more winter be only evident that miss bingley doe not mean must why will think so

hope of keeping there try to persuade that doe not care about jane shook head indeed jane ought to believe one who have ever seen together can doubt affection miss bingley be sure can not be not such simpleton must have seen half a much love in mr darcy for herself must have ordered wedding clothes case be be not rich enough grand enough for be more anxious to get miss darcy for brother from notion that when there have be one intermarriage may have le trouble in achieving second in there be certainly ingenuity dare say must succeed if miss de bourgh be out of way dearest jane can not seriously imagine that because miss bingley tell brother greatly admires miss darcy be in smallest degree le sensible of merit than when took leave of on tuesday that will be in power to persuade that instead of being in love with be very much in love with friend if thought alike of miss bingley replied jane representation of might make quite easy know foundation be unjust caroline be incapable of

fret no longer dear sister can be happy even supposing best in accepting man whose sister friend be wishing to marry elsewhere must decide for said elizabeth if upon mature deliberation find that misery of disobliging two sister be more than equivalent to happiness of being wife advise by mean to refuse how can talk so said jane faintly smiling must know that though must be exceedingly grieved at disapprobation must not hesitate did not think must that being case can not consider situation with much compassion if return more winter choice will never be required thousand thing may arise in six month idea of returning more elizabeth treated with utmost contempt appeared to merely suggestion of caroline interested wish must not for moment suppose that wish however openly artfully spoken must influence young man so totally independent of one represented to sister a forcibly a possible what felt on subject have soon pleasure of seeing happy effect jane temper be not desponding be gradually led to hope though diffidence of affection sometimes overcame hope that bingley must return to answer wish of heart agreed that mr bennet must only hear of departure of family without being alarmed on score of gentleman conduct even partial communication gave great deal of concern bewailed a exceedingly unlucky that lady must happen to go away just a be getting so intimate together after lamenting however at length have consolation of thinking that mr bingley must be soon down again soon dining at longbourn conclusion of be comfortable declaration that though have be invited only to family dinner must take care to have two full course chapter xxii bennet be engaged to dine with lucas again during chief of day be miss lucas so kind a to listen to mr collins elizabeth took

conjecture design be not willing to have attempt known till success must be known likewise for though feeling almost secure with reason for charlotte have be tolerably encouraging be comparatively diffident since adventure of wednesday reception however be of most flattering kind miss lucas perceived from upper window a walked towards house instantly set out to meet accidentally in lane little

applied to for consent be bestowed with most joyful alacrity mr collins present circumstance made most eligible match for daughter to whom must give little fortune prospect of future wealth be exceedingly fair lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than matter have ever excited before how many year longer mr bennet be likely to live sir william gave a decided opinion that whenever mr collins must be in possession of longbourn estate must be highly expedient that wife must make appearance at st james whole family in short be properly overjoyed on occasion younger girl

so often young man such a describe mr bingley so easily fall in love with pretty girl for few week when accident separate so easily forgets that sort of inconstancy be very frequent excellent consolation in way said elizabeth will not do for suffer by accident doe not often happen that interference of friend will persuade young man of independent fortune to think more of girl whom be

so much better hope will not meet at doe not jane correspond with sister will not be able to help calling will drop acquaintance entirely in spite of certainty in elizabeth affected to place point a well a still more interesting one of bingley being withheld from seeing jane felt solicitude on subject convinced on examination that did not consider entirely hopeless be possible sometimes thought probable that affection might be re animated influence of friend successfully combated by more natural influence of jane attraction miss bennet accepted aunt invitation with pleasure bingleys be otherwise in thought at time than a hoped that by caroline not living in same house with brother might occasionally spend morning with without danger of seeing gardiner staid week at longbourn what with philip lucas officer there be not day without engagement mr bennet have so carefully provided for entertainment of brother sister that did not once sit down to family dinner when engagement be for home of officer always made part of of officer mr wickham be sure to be one on occasion mr gardiner rendered suspicious by elizabeth warm commendation of narrowly observed without supposing from what saw to be very seriously in love preference of other be plain enough to make little uneasy resolved to speak to elizabeth on subject before left hertfordshire represent to imprudence of encouraging such attachment to mr gardiner wickham have one mean of affording pleasure unconnected with general power about ten dozen year ago before marriage have spent considerable time in very part of derbyshire to belonged have therefore many acquaintance in common though wickham have be little there since death of darcy father five year before be yet in power to give fresher intelligence of former friend than have be in way of procuring mr gardiner have seen pemberley known late mr darcy by character perfectly well here consequently be inexhaustible subject of discourse in comparing recollection of pemberley with minute description wickham must give in bestowing tribute of praise on character of late possessor be delighting on being made acquainted with present mr darcy treatment of tried to remember something of gentleman reputed disposition when lad might agree with be confident at last that recollected having heard mr fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of a very proud ill

under alarm will take care of myself of mr wickham too will not be in love with if can prevent elizabeth be not serious now beg pardon will try again at present be not in love with mr wickham certainly be not be beyond comparison most agreeable man ever saw if becomes really attached to believe will be better that must not see imprudence of oh that abominable mr darcy father opinion of doe

requiring elegance of dress in becomes daughter must advise merely to put on of clothes be superior to rest there be occasion for thing more lady catherine will not think worse of for being simply dressed like to have distinction of rank preserved while be dressing came two three time to different door to recommend being quick a lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for dinner such formidable account of ladyship manner of living quite frightened maria lucas who have be little used to company looked forward to introduction at rosings with a much apprehension a father have done to presentation at st james a weather be fine have pleasant walk of about mile across park park have beauty prospect elizabeth saw much to be pleased with though must not be in such rapture a mr collins expected scene to inspire be slightly affected by enumeration of window in front of house relation of what glazing altogether have originally cost sir lewis de bourgh when ascended step to hall maria alarm be moment increasing even sir william did not look perfectly calm elizabeth courage did not fail have heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke awful from extraordinary talent

introduction must be be performed in proper manner without of apology thanks must have thought necessary in spite of having be at st james sir william be so completely awed by grandeur surrounding that have just courage enough to make very low bow take seat without saying word daughter frightened almost out of sens sat on edge of chair not knowing way to look elizabeth found quite equal to scene must observe three lady before composedly lady catherine be tall large woman with strongly marked feature might once have be handsome air be not conciliating be manner of receiving such a to make visitor forget inferior rank be not rendered formidable by silence said be spoken in so authoritative tone a marked self importance brought mr wickham immediately to elizabeth mind from observation of day altogether believed lady catherine to be exactly what have represented when after examining mother in whose countenance deportment soon found resemblance of mr darcy turned eye on daughter must almost have joined in maria astonishment at being so thin so small there be in figure face likeness between lady miss de bourgh be pale sickly feature though not plain be insignificant

bear lady catherine seemed gratified by excessive admiration gave most gracious smile especially when dish on table proved novelty to party did not supply much conversation elizabeth be ready to speak whenever there be opening be seated between charlotte miss de bourgh former of whom be engaged in listening to lady catherine latter said not word to dinner time mr jenkinson be chiefly employed in watching how little miss de bourgh ate pressing to try other dish fearing be indisposed maria thought speaking out of question gentleman did nothing eat admire when lady returned to drawing room there be little to be done to hear lady catherine talk did without intermission till coffee came in delivering opinion on subject in so decisive manner a proved that be not used to have judgment controverted enquired into charlotte domestic concern familiarly minutely gave great deal of advice a to management of told how thing ought to be regulated in so small family a instructed a to care of cow poultry elizabeth found that nothing be beneath great lady attention must furnish with occasion of dictating to others in interval of discourse with mr collins addressed variety of question to

mind upon word said ladyship give opinion very decidedly for so young person pray what be age with three younger sister grown up replied elizabeth smiling ladyship can hardly expect to own lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving direct answer elizabeth suspected to be first creature who have ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence can not be more than twenty

soon a have driven from door elizabeth be called on by cousin to give opinion of that have seen at rosings for charlotte sake made more favourable than really be commendation though costing trouble must by mean satisfy mr collins be very soon obliged to take ladyship praise into own hand chapter vii sir william staid only week at hunsford visit be long enough to convince of daughter being most comfortably settled of possessing such husband neighbour a be not often met with while sir william be with mr collins devoted morning to driving out in gig shewing country when went away whole family returned to usual employment elizabeth be thankful to find that did not see more of cousin by alteration for chief of time between breakfast dinner be now passed by at work in garden in reading writing looking out of window in own book room fronted road room in lady sat be backwards elizabeth at first have rather wondered that charlotte must not prefer dining parlour for common use be better sized room have pleasanter aspect soon saw that friend have excellent reason for what did for mr collins must undoubtedly have be much le in own apartment have sat in one equally lively gave charlotte credit for arrangement from drawing room must distinguish nothing in lane be indebted to mr collins for knowledge of what carriage went along how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in phaeton never failed coming to inform of though happened almost day not unfrequently stopped at parsonage have few minute conversation with charlotte be scarcely ever prevailed on to get out very few day passed in mr collins did not walk to rosings not many in wife did not think necessary to go likewise till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family living to be disposed of must not understand sacrifice of so many hour now then be honoured with call from ladyship nothing escaped observation be passing in room during visit examined into employment looked at work advised to do differently found fault with arrangement of furniture detected housemaid in negligence if accepted refreshment seemed to do only for sake of finding out that mr collins joint of meat be too large for family elizabeth soon perceived that though great lady be not in commission of peace for county be most active magistrate in own parish minutest concern of be carried to by mr collins whenever of cottager be disposed to be quarrelsome discontented too poor sallied forth into village to settle difference silence complaint scold into harmony plenty entertainment of dining at rosings be repeated about twice week allowing for loss of sir william there being only one card table in evening such entertainment be counterpart of first other engagement be few a style of living of neighbourhood in general be beyond collins reach however be evil to elizabeth upon whole spent time comfortably enough there be half hour of pleasant conversation with charlotte weather be so fine for time of year that have often great enjoyment out of door favourite walk where frequently went while others be calling on lady catherine be along open grove edged that side of park where there be nice sheltered path one seemed to value where felt beyond reach of lady catherine curiosity in quiet way first fortnight of visit soon passed away easter be approaching week preceding be to bring addition to family at rosings in so small circle must be important elizabeth have heard soon after arrival that mr darcy be expected there in course of few week though there be not many of acquaintance whom did not prefer coming must furnish one comparatively new to look at in rosings party might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley design on be by behaviour to cousin for whom be evidently destined by lady catherine who talked of coming with greatest satisfaction spoke of in term of highest admiration seemed almost angry to find that have already be frequently seen by miss lucas arrival be soon known at parsonage for mr collins be walking whole morning within view of lodge opening into hunsford lane in order to have earliest assurance of after making bow a carriage turned into park hurried home with great intelligence on following morning hastened to rosings to pay respect there be two nephew of lady catherine to require for mr darcy have brought with colonel fitzwilliam younger son of uncle lord to great surprise of party when mr collins returned gentleman accompanied charlotte have seen from husband room crossing road immediately running into other told girl what honour might expect adding may thank eliza for piece of civility mr darcy must never have come so soon to wait upon elizabeth have scarcely time to disclaim right to compliment before approach be announced by door bell shortly afterwards three gentleman entered room colonel fitzwilliam who led way be about thirty not handsome in person address most truly gentleman mr darcy looked just a have be used to look in hertfordshire paid compliment with usual reserve to mr collins might be feeling towards friend met with appearance of composure elizabeth merely curtseyed to without saying word colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with readiness ease of well bred man talked very pleasantly cousin after having addressed slight observation on house garden to mr collins sat for time without speaking to body at length however civility be so far awakened a to enquire of elizabeth after health of family answered in usual way after moment pause added eldest sister have be in town three month have never happened to see there be perfectly sensible that never have wished to see whether must betray consciousness of what have passed between bingleys jane thought looked little confused a answered that have never be so fortunate a to meet miss bennet subject be pursued farther gentleman soon afterwards went away chapter viii colonel fitzwilliam manner be very much admired at parsonage lady felt that must add considerably to pleasure of engagement at rosings be day however before received invitation thither for while there be visitor in house must not be necessary be not till easter day almost week after gentleman arrival that be honoured by such attention then be merely asked on leaving church to come there in evening for last week have seen very little of lady catherine daughter colonel fitzwilliam have called at parsonage more than once during time mr darcy have only seen at church invitation be accepted of course at proper hour joined party in lady catherine drawing room ladyship received civilly be plain that company be by mean so acceptable a when must get nobody else be in fact almost engrossed by nephew speaking to especially to darcy much more than to other person in room colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see thing be welcome relief to at rosings mr collins pretty friend have moreover caught fancy very much now seated by talked so agreeably of kent hertfordshire of travelling staying at home of new book music that elizabeth have never be half so well entertained in room before conversed with so much spirit flow a to draw attention of lady catherine a well a of mr darcy eye have be soon repeatedly turned towards with look of curiosity that ladyship after while shared feeling be more openly acknowledged for did not scruple to call out what be that be saying fitzwilliam what be be talking of what be telling miss bennet let hear what be be speaking of music madam said when no longer able to avoid reply of music then pray speak aloud be of subject delight must have share in conversation if be speaking of music there be few people in england suppose who have more true enjoyment of music than better natural taste if have ever learnt must have be great proficient so must anne if health have allowed to apply be confident that must have performed delightfully how doe georgiana get on darcy mr darcy spoke with affectionate praise of sister proficiency be very glad to hear such good account of said lady catherine pray tell from that can not expect to excel if doe not practise great deal assure madam replied that doe not need such advice practises very constantly so much better can not be done too much when next write to will charge not to neglect on account often tell young lady that excellence in music be to be acquired without constant practice have told miss bennet several time that will never play really well unless practises more though mr collins have instrument be very welcome a have often told to come to rosings day play on piano forte in mr jenkinson room must be in nobody way know in part of house mr darcy looked little ashamed of aunt ill breeding made answer when coffee be over colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to sat down directly to instrument drew chair near lady catherine listened to half song then talked a before to other nephew till latter walked away from moving with usual deliberation towards piano forte stationed so a to command full view of fair performer countenance elizabeth saw what be doing at first convenient pause turned to with arch smile said mean to frighten mr darcy by coming in state to hear will not be alarmed though sister doe play so well there be stubbornness about that never can bear to be frightened at will of others courage always rise with attempt to intimidate will not say that be mistaken replied because must not really believe to entertain design of alarming have have pleasure of acquaintance long enough to know that find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinion in fact be not own elizabeth laughed heartily at picture of herself said to colonel fitzwilliam cousin will give very pretty notion of teach not to believe word say be particularly unlucky in meeting with person so well able to expose real character in part of world where have hoped to pas off with degree of credit indeed mr darcy be very ungenerous in to mention that knew to disadvantage in hertfordshire give leave to say very impolitic too for be provoking to retaliate such thing may come out a will shock relation to hear be not afraid of said smilingly pray let hear what have to accuse of cried colonel fitzwilliam must like to know how behaves among stranger will hear then prepare for something very dreadful first time of ever seeing in hertfordshire must know be at ball at ball what do think did danced only four dance be sorry to pain so be danced only four dance though gentleman be scarce to certain knowledge more than one young lady be sitting down in want of partner mr darcy can not deny fact have not at time honour of knowing lady in assembly beyond own party true nobody can ever be introduced in ball room well colonel fitzwilliam what do play next finger wait order perhaps said darcy must have judged better have sought introduction be ill qualified to recommend to stranger will ask cousin reason of said elizabeth still addressing colonel fitzwilliam will ask why man of sense education who have lived in world be ill qualified to recommend to stranger can answer question said fitzwilliam without applying to be because will not give trouble certainly have not talent people posse said darcy of conversing easily with have never seen before can not catch tone of conversation appear interested in concern a often see done finger said elizabeth move over instrument in masterly manner see so many woman do have not same force rapidity produce same expression then have always supposed to be own fault because must not take trouble of practising be not that believe finger a capable a other woman of superior execution darcy smiled said be perfectly right have employed time much better one admitted to privilege of hearing can think thing wanting of perform to stranger here be interrupted by lady catherine who called out to know what be talking of elizabeth immediately began playing again lady catherine approached after listening for few minute said to darcy miss bennet must not play at amiss if practised more must have advantage of london master have very good notion of fingering though taste be not equal to anne anne must have be delightful performer have health allowed to learn elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially assented to cousin praise at moment at other must discern symptom of love from whole of behaviour to miss de bourgh derived comfort for miss bingley that might have be just a likely to marry have be relation lady catherine continued remark on elizabeth performance mixing with many instruction on execution taste elizabeth received with forbearance of civility at request of gentleman remained at instrument till ladyship carriage be ready to take home chapter ix elizabeth be sitting by next morning writing to jane while mr collins maria be gone on business into village when be startled by ring at door certain signal of visitor a have heard carriage thought not unlikely to be lady catherine under apprehension be putting away half finished letter that might escape impertinent question when door opened to very great surprise mr darcy mr darcy only entered room seemed astonished too on finding alone apologised for intrusion by letting know that have understood lady to be within then sat down when enquiry after rosings be made seemed in danger of sinking into total silence be absolutely necessary therefore to think of something in emergence recollecting when have seen last in hertfordshire feeling curious to know what must say on subject of hasty departure observed how very suddenly quitted netherfield last november mr darcy must have be most agreeable surprise to mr bingley to see after so soon for if recollect right went day before sister be well hope when left perfectly so thank found that be to receive other answer after short pause added think have understood that mr bingley have not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again have never heard say so be probable that may spend very little of time there in future have many friend be at time of life when friend engagement be continually increasing if mean to be little at netherfield must be better for neighbourhood that must give up place entirely for then might possibly get settled family there perhaps mr bingley did not take house so much for convenience of neighbourhood a for own must expect to keep quit on same principle must not be surprised said darcy if be to give up a soon a eligible purchase offer elizabeth made answer be afraid of talking longer of friend having nothing else to say be now determined to leave trouble of finding subject to took hint soon began with seems very comfortable house lady catherine believe did great deal to when mr collins first came to hunsford believe did be sure must not have bestowed kindness on more grateful object mr collins appears very fortunate in choice of wife yes indeed friend may well rejoice in having met with one of very few sensible woman who must have accepted have made happy if have friend have excellent understanding though be not certain that consider marrying mr collins a wisest thing ever did seems perfectly happy however in prudential light be certainly very good match for must be very agreeable to to be settled within so easy distance of own family friend easy distance do call be nearly fifty mile what be fifty mile of good road little more than day journey yes call very easy distance must never have considered distance a one of advantage of match cried elizabeth must never have said mr collins be settled near family be proof of own attachment to hertfordshire thing beyond very neighbourhood of longbourn suppose must appear far a spoke there be sort of smile elizabeth fancied understood must be supposing to be thinking of jane netherfield blushed a answered mean to say that woman may not be settled too near family far near must be relative depend on many varying circumstance where there be fortune to make expence of travelling unimportant distance becomes evil be not case here mr mr collins have comfortable income not one a will allow of frequent journey be persuaded friend must not call near family under le than present distance mr darcy drew chair little towards said can not have right to such very strong local attachment can not have be always at longbourn elizabeth looked surprised gentleman experienced change of feeling drew back chair took newspaper from table glancing over said in colder voice be pleased with kent short dialogue on subject of country ensued on side calm concise soon put end to by entrance of charlotte sister just returned from walk tete tete surprised mr darcy related mistake have occasioned intruding on miss bennet after sitting few minute longer without saying much to body went away what can be meaning of said charlotte a soon a be gone dear eliza must be in love with must never have called on in familiar way when elizabeth told of silence did not seem very likely even to charlotte wish to be case after various conjecture must at last only suppose visit to proceed from difficulty of finding thing to do be more probable from time of year field sport be over within door there be lady catherine book billiard table gentleman can not be always within door in nearness of parsonage pleasantness of walk to of people who lived in two cousin found temptation from period of walking thither almost day called at various time of morning sometimes separately sometimes together now then accompanied by aunt be plain to colonel fitzwilliam came because have pleasure in society persuasion of course recommended still more elizabeth be reminded by own satisfaction in being with a well a by evident admiration of her of former favourite george wickham though in comparing saw there be le captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam manner believed might have best informed mind why mr darcy came so often to parsonage be more difficult to understand must not be for society a frequently sat there ten minute together without opening lip when did speak seemed effect of necessity rather than of choice sacrifice to propriety not pleasure to seldom appeared really animated mr collins knew not what to make of colonel fitzwilliam occasionally laughing at stupidity proved that be generally different own knowledge of must not have told a must have liked to believe change effect of love object of love friend eliza sat seriously to work to find out watched whenever be at rosings whenever came to hunsford without much success certainly looked at friend great deal expression of look be disputable be earnest steadfast gaze often doubted whether there be much admiration in sometimes seemed nothing absence of mind have once twice suggested to elizabeth possibility of being partial to elizabeth always laughed at idea mr collins did not think right to press subject from danger of raising expectation might only end in disappointment for in opinion admitted not of doubt that friend dislike must vanish if must suppose to be in power in kind scheme for elizabeth sometimes planned marrying colonel fitzwilliam be beyond comparison pleasantest man certainly admired situation in life be most eligible to counterbalance advantage mr darcy have considerable patronage in church cousin must have none at chapter x more than once did elizabeth in ramble within park unexpectedly meet mr darcy felt perverseness of mischance must bring where one else be brought to prevent ever happening again took care to inform at first that be favourite haunt of hers how must occur second time therefore be very odd did even third seemed like wilful ill nature voluntary penance for on occasion be not merely few formal enquiry awkward pause then away actually thought necessary to turn back walk with never said great deal did give trouble of talking of listening much struck in course of third rencontre that be asking odd unconnected question about pleasure in being at hunsford love of solitary walk opinion of mr mr collins happiness that in speaking of rosings not perfectly understanding house seemed to expect that whenever came into kent again must be staying there too word seemed to imply must have colonel fitzwilliam in thought supposed if meant thing must mean allusion to what might arise in quarter distressed little be quite glad to find at gate in pale opposite parsonage be engaged one day a walked in re perusing jane last letter dwelling on passage proved that jane have not written in spirit when instead of being again surprised by mr darcy saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam be meeting putting away letter immediately forcing smile said did not know before ever walked way have be making tour of park replied a generally do year intend to close with call at parsonage be going much farther must have turned in moment accordingly did turn walked towards parsonage together do certainly leave kent on saturday said yes if darcy doe not put off again be at disposal arranges business just a plea if not able to please in arrangement have at least great pleasure in power of choice know body who seems more to enjoy power of doing what like than mr darcy like to have own way very well replied colonel fitzwilliam so do be only that have better mean of having than many others because be rich many others be poor speak feelingly younger son know must be inured to self denial dependence in opinion younger son of earl can know very little of now seriously what have ever known of self denial dependence when have be prevented by want of money from going wherever chose procuring thing have fancy for be home question perhaps can not say have experienced many hardship of nature in matter of greater weight may suffer from want of money younger son can not marry where like unless where like woman of fortune think very often do habit of expence make too dependant there be not many in rank of life who can afford to marry without attention to money be thought elizabeth meant for coloured at idea recovering said in lively tone pray what be usual price of earl younger son unless elder brother be very sickly suppose must not ask above fifty thousand pound answered in same style subject dropped to interrupt silence might make fancy affected with what have passed soon afterwards said imagine cousin brought down with chiefly for sake of having somebody at disposal wonder doe not marry to secure lasting convenience of kind perhaps sister doe a well for present a be under sole care may do what like with said colonel fitzwilliam be advantage must divide with be joined with in guardianship of miss darcy be indeed pray what sort of guardian do make doe charge give much trouble young lady of age be sometimes little difficult to manage if have true darcy spirit may like to have own way a spoke observed looking at earnestly manner in immediately asked why supposed miss darcy likely to give uneasiness convinced that have somehow other got pretty near truth directly replied need not be frightened never heard harm of dare say be one of most tractable creature in world be very great favourite with lady of acquaintance mr hurst miss bingley think have heard say that know know little brother be pleasant gentleman like man be great friend of darcy oh yes said elizabeth drily mr darcy be uncommonly kind to mr bingley take prodigious deal of care of care of yes really believe darcy doe take care of in point where most want care from something that told in journey hither have reason to think bingley very much indebted to ought to beg pardon for have right to suppose that bingley be person meant be conjecture what be mean be circumstance darcy of course must not wish to be generally known because if be to get round to lady family must be unpleasant thing may depend upon not mentioning remember have not much reason for supposing to be bingley what told be merely that congratulated on having lately saved friend from inconvenience of most imprudent marriage without mentioning name other particular only suspected to be bingley from believing kind of young man to get into scrape of sort from knowing to have be together whole of last summer did mr darcy give reason for interference understood that there be very strong objection against lady what art did use to separate did not talk to of own art said fitzwilliam smiling only told what have now told elizabeth made answer walked on heart swelling with indignation after watching little fitzwilliam asked why be so thoughtful be thinking of what have be telling said cousin conduct doe not suit feeling why be to be judge be rather disposed to call interference officious see what right mr darcy have to decide on propriety of friend inclination why upon own judgment alone be to determine direct in what manner that friend be to be happy continued recollecting a know none of particular be not fair to condemn be not to be supposed that there be much affection in case be not unnatural surmise said fitzwilliam be lessening honour of cousin triumph very sadly be spoken jestingly appeared to so just picture of mr darcy that must not trust with answer therefore abruptly changing conversation talked on indifferent matter till reached parsonage there shut into own room a soon a visitor left must think without interruption of that have heard be not to be supposed that other people must be meant than with whom be connected there must not exist in world two men over whom mr darcy must have such boundless influence that have be concerned in measure taken to separate mr bingley jane have never doubted have always attributed to miss bingley principal design arrangement of if own vanity however did not mislead be cause pride caprice be cause of jane have suffered still continued to suffer have ruined for while hope of happiness for most affectionate generous heart in world one must say how lasting evil might have inflicted there be very strong objection against lady be colonel fitzwilliam word strong objection probably be having one uncle who be country attorney who be in business in london to jane exclaimed there must be possibility of objection loveliness goodness a be understanding excellent mind improved manner captivating must thing be urged against father who though with peculiarity have ability mr darcy need not disdain respectability will probably never reach when thought of mother indeed confidence gave way little must not allow that objection there have material weight with mr darcy whose pride be convinced must receive deeper wound from want of importance in friend connection than from want of sense be quite decided at last that have be partly governed by worst kind of pride partly by wish of retaining mr bingley for sister agitation tear subject occasioned brought on headache grew so much worse towards evening added to unwillingness to see mr darcy determined not to attend cousin to rosings where be engaged to drink tea mr collins seeing that be really unwell did not press to go a much a possible prevented husband from pressing mr collins must not conceal apprehension of lady catherine being rather displeased by staying at home chapter xi when be gone elizabeth a if intending to exasperate a much a possible against mr darcy chose for employment examination of letter jane have written to since being in kent contained actual complaint be there

before called late in evening might now come to enquire particularly after idea be soon banished spirit be very differently affected when to utter amazement saw mr darcy walk into room in hurried manner immediately began enquiry after health imputing visit to wish of hearing that be better answered with cold civility sat down for few moment then getting up walked about room elizabeth be surprised said not word after silence of several minute came towards in agitated manner thus began in vain have struggled will not do feeling will not be repressed must allow to tell how ardently admire love elizabeth astonishment be beyond expression stared coloured doubted be silent considered sufficient encouragement avowal of that felt have long felt for immediately followed spoke well there be feeling besides of heart to be detailed be not more eloquent on subject of tenderness than of pride sense of inferiority of being degradation of family obstacle judgment have always opposed to inclination be dwelt on with warmth seemed due to consequence be wounding be very unlikely to recommend suit in spite of deeply rooted dislike must not be insensible to compliment of such man affection though intention did not vary for instant be at first sorry for pain be to receive till roused to resentment by subsequent language lost compassion in anger tried however to compose to answer with patience when must have done concluded with representing to strength of attachment in spite of endeavour have found impossible to conquer with expressing hope that must now be rewarded by acceptance of hand a said must easily see that have doubt of favourable answer spoke of apprehension anxiety countenance expressed real security circumstance must only exasperate farther when ceased

must feel gratitude must now thank can not have never desired good opinion have certainly bestowed most unwillingly be sorry to have occasioned pain to one have be most unconsciously done however hope will be of short duration feeling tell have long prevented acknowledgment of regard can have little difficulty in overcoming after explanation mr darcy who be leaning against mantle piece with eye fixed on face seemed to catch word with le resentment than surprise complexion became pale with anger disturbance of mind be visible in feature be struggling for appearance of composure must not open lip till believed to have attained pause be to elizabeth feeling dreadful at length in voice of forced calmness said be reply be to have honour of expecting might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little endeavour at civility be thus rejected be of small importance might a well enquire replied why with so evident design of offending insulting chose to tell that liked against will against reason even against character be not excuse for incivility if be uncivil have other provocation know have have not own feeling decided against have be indifferent have even be favourable do think that consideration must tempt to accept man who have be mean of ruining perhaps for ever happiness of most beloved sister a pronounced word mr darcy changed colour emotion be short listened without attempting to interrupt while continued have reason in world to think ill of motive can excuse unjust ungenerous part acted there dare not can not deny that have be principal if not only mean of dividing from other of exposing one to censure of world for caprice instability other to derision for disappointed hope involving in misery of acutest kind paused saw with slight indignation that be listening with air proved wholly unmoved by feeling of remorse even looked at with smile of affected incredulity can deny that have done repeated with assumed tranquillity then replied have wish of denying did thing in power to separate friend from sister rejoice in success towards have be kinder than towards elizabeth disdained appearance of noticing civil reflection meaning did not escape be likely to conciliate be not merely affair continued on dislike be founded long before have taken place opinion of be decided character be unfolded in recital received many month ago from mr wickham on subject what can have to say in what imaginary act of friendship can here defend under what misrepresentation can here impose upon others take eager interest in gentleman concern said darcy in le tranquil tone with heightened colour who know what misfortune have be can help feeling interest in misfortune repeated darcy contemptuously yes misfortune have be great indeed of infliction cried elizabeth with energy have reduced to present state of poverty comparative poverty have withheld advantage must know to have be designed for have deprived best year of life of independence be le due

prevented forming serious design bitter accusation might have be suppressed have with greater policy concealed struggle flattered into belief of being impelled by unqualified unalloyed inclination by reason by reflection by thing disguise of sort be abhorrence be ashamed of feeling related be natural just must expect to rejoice in inferiority of connection to congratulate on hope of relation whose condition in life be so decidedly beneath own elizabeth felt growing more angry moment yet tried to utmost to speak with composure when said be mistaken mr darcy if suppose that mode of declaration affected in other way than a spared concern might have felt in refusing have behaved in more gentleman like manner saw start at said nothing continued must not have made offer of hand in possible way must have tempted to accept again astonishment be obvious looked at with expression of mingled incredulity mortification went on from very beginning from first moment may almost say of acquaintance with manner impressing with fullest belief of arrogance conceit selfish disdain of feeling of others be such a to form ground work of disapprobation on succeeding event have built so immoveable dislike have not known month before felt that be last man in world whom must ever be prevailed on to marry have said quite enough madam perfectly comprehend feeling have now only to be ashamed of what own have be forgive for having taken up so much of time accept best wish for health happiness with word hastily left room elizabeth heard next moment open front door quit house tumult of mind be now painfully great knew not how to support from actual weakness sat down cried for hour astonishment a reflected on what have passed be increased by review of that must receive offer of marriage from mr darcy that must have be in love with for so many month so much in love a to wish to marry in spite of objection have made prevent friend marrying sister must appear at least with equal force in own case be almost incredible be gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong affection pride abominable pride shameless avowal of what have done with respect to jane unpardonable assurance in acknowledging though must not justify unfeeling manner in have mentioned mr wickham cruelty towards whom have not attempted to deny soon overcame pity consideration of attachment have for moment excited continued in very agitating reflection till sound of lady catherine carriage made feel how unequal be to encounter charlotte observation hurried away to room chapter xii elizabeth awoke next morning to same thought meditation have at length closed eye must not yet recover from surprise of what have happened be impossible to think of thing else totally indisposed for employment resolved soon after breakfast to indulge in air exercise be proceeding directly to favourite walk when recollection of mr darcy sometimes coming there stopped instead of entering park turned up lane led farther from turnpike road park paling be still boundary on one side soon passed one of gate into ground after walking two three time along part of lane be tempted by pleasantness of morning to stop at gate look into park five week have now passed in kent have made great difference in country day be adding to verdure of early tree be on point of continuing walk when caught glimpse of gentleman within sort of grove edged park be moving way fearful of being mr darcy be directly retreating person who advanced be now near enough to see stepping forward with eagerness pronounced name have turned away on hearing called though in voice proved to be mr darcy moved again towards gate have by time reached also holding out letter instinctively took said with look of haughty composure have be walking in grove time in hope of meeting will do honour of reading that letter then with slight bow turned again into plantation be soon out of sight with expectation of pleasure with strongest curiosity elizabeth opened letter to still increasing wonder perceived envelope containing two sheet of letter paper written quite through in very close hand envelope be likewise full pursuing way along lane then began be dated from rosings at eight o'clock in morning be a follows be not alarmed madam on receiving letter by apprehension of containing repetition of sentiment renewal of offer be last night so disgusting to write without intention of paining humbling by dwelling on wish for happiness of can not be too soon forgotten effort formation perusal of letter must occasion must have be spared have not character required to be written read must therefore pardon freedom with demand attention feeling know will bestow unwillingly demand of justice two offence of very different nature by mean of equal magnitude last night laid to charge first mentioned be that regardless of sentiment of have detached mr bingley from sister other have in defiance of various claim in defiance of honour humanity ruined immediate prosperity blasted prospect of mr wickham wilfully wantonly to have thrown off companion of youth acknowledged favourite of father young man who have scarcely other dependence than on patronage who have be brought up to expect exertion must be depravity to separation of two young person whose affection must be growth of only few week must bear comparison from severity of blame be last night so liberally bestowed respecting circumstance will hope to be in future secured when following account of action motif have be read if in explanation of be due to myself be under necessity of relating feeling may be offensive to can only say that be sorry necessity must be obeyed farther apology must be absurd have not be long in hertfordshire before saw in common with others bingley preferred eldest sister to other young woman in country be not till evening of dance at netherfield have apprehension of feeling serious attachment have often seen in love before at ball while have honour of dancing with be first made acquainted by sir william lucas accidental information that bingley attention to sister have given rise to general expectation of marriage spoke of a certain event of time alone must be undecided from moment observed friend behaviour attentively must then perceive that partiality for miss bennet be beyond what have ever witnessed in sister also watched look manner be open cheerful engaging a ever without symptom of peculiar regard remained convinced from evening scrutiny that though received attention with pleasure did not invite by participation of sentiment if have not be mistaken here must have be in error superior knowledge of sister must make latter probable if be so if have be misled by such error to inflict pain on resentment have not be unreasonable will not scruple to assert that serenity of sister countenance air be such a might have given most acute observer conviction that however amiable temper heart be not likely to be easily touched that be desirous of believing indifferent be certain will venture to say that investigation decision be not usually influenced by hope fear did not believe to be indifferent because wished believed on impartial conviction a truly a wished in reason objection to marriage be not merely last night acknowledged to have required utmost force of passion to put aside in own case want of connection must not be so great evil to friend a to there be other cause of repugnance cause though still existing existing to equal degree in instance have endeavoured to forget because be not immediately before cause must be stated though briefly situation of mother family though objectionable be nothing in comparison of total want of propriety so frequently so almost uniformly betrayed by by three younger sister occasionally even by father pardon pain to offend amidst concern for defect of nearest relation displeasure at representation of let give consolation to consider to have conducted yourselves so a to avoid share of like censure be praise le generally bestowed on eldest sister than be honourable to sense disposition of will only say farther that from what passed that evening opinion of party be confirmed inducement heightened must have led before to preserve friend from what esteemed most unhappy connection left netherfield for london on day following a be certain remember with design of soon returning part acted be now to be explained sister uneasiness have be equally excited with own coincidence of feeling be soon discovered alike sensible that time be to be lost in detaching brother shortly resolved on joining directly in london accordingly went there readily engaged in office of pointing out to friend certain evil of such choice described enforced earnestly however remonstrance might have staggered delayed determination suppose that must ultimately have prevented marriage have not be seconded by assurance hesitated not in giving of sister indifference have before believed to return affection with sincere if not with equal regard bingley have great natural modesty with stronger dependence on judgment than on own to convince therefore that have deceived be very difficult point to persuade against returning into hertfordshire when conviction have be given be scarcely work of moment can not blame for having done thus much there be one part of conduct in whole affair on reflect with satisfaction be that condescended to adopt measure of art so far a to conceal from sister being in town knew a be known to miss bingley brother be even yet ignorant of that might have met without ill consequence be perhaps probable regard did not appear to enough extinguished for to see without danger perhaps concealment disguise be beneath be done however be done for best on subject have nothing more to say other apology to offer if have wounded sister feeling be unknowingly done though motif governed may to very naturally appear insufficient have not yet learnt to condemn with respect to other more weighty accusation of having injured mr wickham can only refute by laying before whole of connection with family of what have particularly accused be ignorant of truth of what will relate can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity mr wickham be son of very respectable man who have for many year management of pemberley estate whose good conduct in discharge of trust naturally inclined father to be of service to on george wickham who be god son kindness be therefore liberally bestowed father supported at school afterwards at cambridge most important assistance a own father always poor from extravagance of wife must have be unable to give gentleman education father be not only fond of young man society whose manner be always engaging have also highest opinion of hoping church must be profession intended to provide for in a for myself be many many year since first began to think of in very different manner vicious propensity want of principle be careful to guard from knowledge of best friend must not escape observation of young man of nearly same age with who have opportunity of seeing in unguarded moment mr darcy must not have here again will give pain to what degree only can tell may be sentiment mr wickham have created suspicion of nature will not prevent from unfolding real character add even motive excellent father died about five year ago attachment to mr wickham be to last so steady that in will particularly recommended to to promote advancement in best manner that profession might allow if took order desired that valuable family living might be a soon a soon a became vacant there be also legacy of one thousand pound own father did not long survive mine within year from event mr wickham wrote to inform that having finally resolved against taking order hoped must not think unreasonable for to expect more immediate pecuniary advantage in lieu of preferment by must not be benefited have intention added of studying law must be aware that interest of one thousand pound must be very insufficient support therein rather wished than believed to be sincere at rate be perfectly ready to accede to proposal knew that mr wickham ought not to be clergyman business be therefore soon settled resigned claim to assistance in church be possible that must ever be in situation to receive accepted in return three thousand pound connection between seemed now dissolved thought too ill of to invite to pemberley admit society in town in town believe chiefly lived studying law be mere pretence being now free from restraint life be life of idleness dissipation for about three year heard little of on decease of incumbent of living have be designed

for refusing to comply with entreaty for resisting repetition of resentment be in proportion to distress of circumstance be doubtless a violent in abuse of to others a in reproach to myself after period appearance of acquaintance be dropt how lived not last summer be again most painfully obtruded on notice must now mention circumstance must wish to forget obligation le than present must induce to unfold to human being having said thus much feel doubt of secrecy sister who be more than ten year junior be left to guardianship of mother nephew colonel fitzwilliam about year ago be taken from school establishment formed for in london last summer went with lady who presided over to ramsgate thither also went mr wickham undoubtedly by design for there proved to have be prior acquaintance between mr younge in whose character be most unhappily deceived by connivance aid so far recommended to georgiana whose affectionate heart retained strong impression of kindness to a child that be persuaded to believe in love to consent to elopement be then fifteen must be excuse after stating imprudence be happy to add owed knowledge of to herself joined unexpectedly day two before intended elopement then georgiana unable to support idea of grieving offending brother whom almost looked up to a father acknowledged whole to may imagine what felt how acted regard for sister credit feeling prevented public exposure wrote to mr wickham who left place immediately mr younge be of course removed from charge mr wickham chief object be unquestionably sister fortune be thirty thousand pound can not help supposing that hope of revenging on be strong inducement revenge must have be complete indeed madam be faithful narrative of event in have be concerned together if absolutely reject a false will hope acquit henceforth of cruelty towards mr wickham know not in what manner under what form of falsehood have imposed on success be not perhaps to be wondered at ignorant a previously be of thing concerning detection must not be in power suspicion certainly not in inclination may possibly wonder why be not told last night be not then master enough of to know what must ought to be revealed for truth of thing here related can appeal more particularly to testimony of colonel fitzwilliam who from near relationship constant intimacy still more a one of executor of father will have be unavoidably acquainted with particular of transaction if abhorrence of must make assertion valueless can not be prevented by same cause from confiding in cousin that there may be possibility of consulting will endeavour to find opportunity of putting letter in hand in course of morning will only add god bless fitzwilliam darcy chapter xiii if elizabeth when mr darcy gave letter did not expect to contain renewal of offer have formed expectation at of content such a be may be well supposed how eagerly went through what contrariety of emotion excited feeling a read be scarcely to be defined with amazement did first understand that believed apology to be in power steadfastly be persuaded that must have explanation to give just sense of shame must not conceal with strong prejudice against thing might say began account of what have happened at netherfield read with eagerness hardly left power of comprehension from impatience of knowing what next sentence might bring be incapable of attending to sense of one before eye belief of sister insensibility instantly resolved to be false account of real worst objection to match made too angry to have wish of doing justice expressed regret for what have done satisfied style be not penitent haughty be pride insolence when subject be succeeded by account of mr wickham when read with somewhat clearer attention relation of event if true must overthrow cherished opinion of worth bore so alarming affinity to own history of feeling be yet more acutely painful more difficult of definition astonishment apprehension even horror oppressed wished to discredit entirely repeatedly exclaiming must be false can not be must be grossest falsehood when have gone through whole letter though scarcely knowing thing of last page two put hastily away protesting that must not regard that must never look in again in perturbed state of mind with thought must rest on nothing walked on must not do in minute letter be unfolded again collecting a well a must again began mortifying perusal of related to wickham commanded so far a to examine meaning of sentence account of connection with pemberley family be exactly what have related kindness of late mr darcy though have not before known extent agreed equally well with own word so far recital confirmed other when came to will difference be great what wickham have said of living be fresh in memory a recalled very word be impossible not to feel that there be gross duplicity on one side other for few moment flattered that wish did not err when read re read with closest attention particular immediately following of wickham resigning pretension to living of receiving in lieu so considerable sum a three thousand pound again be forced to hesitate put down letter weighed circumstance with what meant to be impartiality deliberated on probability of statement with little success on side be only assertion again read on line proved more clearly that affair have believed impossible that contrivance must so represent a to render mr darcy conduct in le than infamous be capable of turn must make entirely blameless throughout whole extravagance general profligacy scrupled not to lay to mr wickham charge exceedingly shocked more so a must bring proof of injustice have never heard of before entrance into shire militia in have engaged at persuasion of young man who on

felt wish of enquiring countenance voice manner have established at once in possession of virtue tried to recollect instance of goodness distinguished trait of integrity benevolence might rescue from attack of mr darcy at least by predominance of virtue atone for casual error under must endeavour to class what mr darcy have described a idleness vice of many year continuance such recollection befriended must see instantly before in charm of air address must remember more substantial good than general approbation of neighbourhood regard social power have gained in mess after pausing on point considerable while once more continued to read ala story followed of design on miss darcy received confirmation from what have passed between colonel fitzwilliam only morning before at last be referred for truth of particular to colonel fitzwilliam from whom have previously received information of near concern in cousin affair whose character have reason to question at one time have almost resolved on applying to idea be checked by awkwardness of application at length wholly banished by conviction that mr darcy must never have hazarded proposal if have not be well assured of cousin corroboration perfectly remembered thing have passed in conversation between wickham in first evening at mr philip many of expression be still fresh in memory be now struck with impropriety of such communication to stranger wondered have escaped before saw indelicacy of putting forward a have done inconsistency of profession with conduct remembered that have boasted of having fear of seeing mr darcy mr darcy might leave country that must stand ground yet have avoided netherfield very next week remembered also that till netherfield family have quitted country have told story to one that after removal have be where discussed that have then reserve scruple in sinking mr darcy character though have assured respect for father must always prevent exposing son how differently did thing now

what wickham represented so gross violation of thing right must hardly have be concealed from world friendship between person capable of such amiable man a mr bingley be incomprehensible grew absolutely ashamed of herself of darcy wickham must think without feeling that have be blind partial prejudiced absurd how despicably have acted cried who have prided on discernment who have valued on

where be concerned till moment never knew from to jane from jane to bingley thought be in line soon brought to recollection that mr darcy explanation there have appeared very insufficient read again widely different be effect of second perusal how must deny credit to assertion in one instance have be obliged to give in other declared to have be totally unsuspicious of sister attachment must not help remembering what charlotte opinion have always be neither must deny justice of description of jane felt that jane feeling though fervent be little displayed that there be constant complacency in air manner not often united with great sensibility when came to that part of letter in family be mentioned in term of such mortifying yet merited reproach sense of shame be severe justice of charge

wish of appearing cheerful a usual resolution of repressing such reflection a must make unfit for conversation be immediately told that two gentleman from rosings have called during absence mr darcy only for few minute to take leave that colonel fitzwilliam have be sitting with at least hour hoping for return almost resolving to walk after till must be found elizabeth must just affect concern in missing really rejoiced at colonel fitzwilliam be no longer object must think only of letter chapter xiv two gentleman left rosings next morning mr collins having be in waiting near lodge to make parting obeisance be able to bring home pleasing intelligence of appearing in very good health in a tolerable spirit a must be expected after melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings to rosings then hastened to console lady catherine daughter on return brought back with great satisfaction message from ladyship importing that felt so dull a to make very desirous of having to dine with

bennet seemed out of spirit immediately accounting for by supposing that did not like to go home again so soon added if be case must write to mother to beg that may stay little longer mr collins will be very glad of company be sure be much obliged to ladyship for kind invitation replied elizabeth be not in power to accept must be in town next saturday why at rate will have be here only six week

have heard ten mile off to mary very gravely replied far be from dear sister to depreciate such pleasure must doubtless be congenial with generality of female mind confess must have charm for must infinitely prefer book of answer lydia heard not word seldom listened to body for more than minute never attended to mary at in afternoon lydia be urgent with rest of girl to walk to meryton see how body went on elizabeth steadily opposed scheme must not be said that miss bennet must not be at home half day before be in pursuit of officer there be reason too for opposition dreaded seeing wickham again be resolved to avoid a long a possible comfort to of regiment approaching removal be indeed beyond expression in fortnight be to go once gone hoped there must be nothing more to plague on account have not be many hour at home before found that brighton scheme of lydia have given hint at inn be under frequent discussion between parent elizabeth saw directly that father have not smallest intention of yielding answer be at same time so vague equivocal that mother though often disheartened have never yet despaired of succeeding at last chapter xvii elizabeth impatience to acquaint jane with what have happened must no longer be overcome at length resolving to suppress particular in sister be concerned preparing to be surprised related to next morning chief of scene between mr darcy miss bennet astonishment be soon lessened by strong sisterly partiality made admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural surprise be shortly lost in other feeling be sorry that mr darcy must have delivered sentiment in manner so little suited to recommend still more be grieved for unhappiness sister refusal must have given being so sure of succeeding be wrong said certainly ought not to have appeared consider how much must increase disappointment indeed replied be heartily sorry for have other feeling will probably soon drive away regard for blame however for refusing blame oh blame for having spoken so warmly of wickham know that be wrong in saying what did will know when have told what happened very next day then spoke of letter repeating whole of content a far a concerned george wickham what stroke be for poor jane who must willingly have gone through world without believing that so much wickedness existed in whole race of mankind a be here collected in one individual be darcy vindication though grateful to feeling capable of consoling for such discovery most earnestly did labour to prove probability of error seek to clear one without involving other will not do said elizabeth never will be able to make of good for thing take choice must be satisfied with only one there be such quantity of merit between just enough to make one good sort of man of late have be shifting about pretty much for part be inclined to believe mr darcy will do a chuse be time however before smile must be extorted from jane know when have be more shocked said wickham so very bad be almost past belief poor mr darcy dear lizzy only consider what must have suffered disappointment with knowledge of ill opinion too having to relate thing of sister be really too distressing be sure must feel so oh regret compassion be done away by seeing so full of know will do such ample justice be growing moment more unconcerned indifferent profusion make saving if lament over much longer heart will be a light a feather poor wickham there be such expression of goodness in countenance openness gentleness in manner there certainly be great mismanagement in education of two young men one have got goodness other appearance of never thought mr darcy so deficient in appearance of a used to do yet meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided dislike to without reason be such spur to one genius opening for wit to have dislike of kind one may be continually abusive without saying thing just one can not be always laughing at man without now then stumbling on something witty lizzy when first read that letter be sure must not treat matter a do now indeed must not be uncomfortable enough be very uncomfortable may say unhappy with one to speak to of what felt jane to comfort say have not be so very weak vain nonsensical a knew have oh how wanted how unfortunate that must have used such very strong expression in speaking of wickham to mr darcy for now do appear wholly undeserved certainly misfortune of speaking with bitterness be most natural consequence of prejudice have be encouraging there be one point on want advice want to be told whether ought ought not to make acquaintance in general understand wickham character miss bennet paused little then replied surely there can be occasion for exposing so dreadfully what be own opinion that ought not to be attempted mr darcy have not authorised to make communication public on contrary particular relative to sister be meant to be kept a much a possible to myself if endeavour to undeceive people a to rest of conduct who will believe general prejudice against mr darcy be so violent that must be death of good people in meryton to attempt to place in amiable light be not equal to will soon be gone therefore will not signify to anybody here what really be sometime hence will be found out then may laugh at stupidity in not knowing before at present will say nothing about be quite right to have error made public might ruin for ever be now perhaps sorry for what have done anxious to re establish character must not make desperate tumult of elizabeth mind be allayed by conversation have got rid of two of secret have weighed on for fortnight be certain of willing listener in jane whenever might wish to talk again of there be still something lurking behind of prudence forbad disclosure dared not relate other half of mr darcy letter explain to sister how sincerely have be valued by friend here be knowledge in one must partake be sensible that nothing le than perfect understanding between party must justify in throwing off last incumbrance of mystery then said if very improbable event must ever take place will merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in much more agreeable manner liberty of communication can not be mine till have lost value be now on being settled at home at leisure to observe real state of sister spirit jane be not happy still cherished very tender affection for bingley having never even fancied in love before regard have warmth of first attachment from age disposition greater steadiness than first attachment often boast so fervently did value remembrance prefer to other man that good sense attention to feeling of friend be requisite to check indulgence of regret must have be injurious to own health tranquillity well lizzy said mr bennet one day what be opinion now of sad business of jane for part be determined never to speak of again to anybody told sister philip so other day can not find out that jane saw thing of in london well be very undeserving young man suppose there be least chance in world of ever getting now there be talk of coming to netherfield again in summer have enquired of body too who be likely to know believe that will ever live at netherfield more oh well be just a chooses nobody want to come though will always say that used daughter extremely ill if be must not have put up with well comfort be be sure jane will die of broken heart then will be sorry for what have done a elizabeth must not receive comfort from such expectation made answer well lizzy continued mother soon afterwards so collins live very comfortable do well well only hope will last what sort of table do keep charlotte be excellent manager dare say if be half a sharp a mother be saving enough there be nothing extravagant in housekeeping dare say nothing at great deal of good management depend upon yes yes will take care not to outrun income will never be distressed for money well much good may do so suppose often talk of having longbourn when father be dead look upon quite a own dare say whenever happens be subject must not mention before must have be strange if have make doubt often talk of between well if can be

young lady in neighbourhood be drooping apace dejection be almost universal elder miss bennet alone be still able to eat drink sleep pursue usual course of employment very frequently be reproached for insensibility by kitty lydia whose own misery be extreme who must not comprehend such hard heartedness in of family good heaven what be to become of be to do must often exclaim in bitterness of woe how can be smiling so lizzy affectionate mother shared grief remembered what have endured on similar occasion five twenty year ago be sure said cried for two day together when colonel millar regiment went away thought must have broke heart be sure will break mine said lydia if one must go to brighton observed mr bennet oh yes if one must go to brighton papa be so disagreeable little sea bathing must set up for ever aunt philip be sure must do great deal of good added kitty such be kind of lamentation resounding perpetually through longbourn house elizabeth tried to be diverted by sense of pleasure be lost in shame felt anew justice of mr darcy objection never have before be so much disposed to pardon interference in view of friend gloom of lydia prospect be shortly cleared away for received invitation from mr forster wife of colonel of regiment to accompany to brighton invaluable friend be very young woman very lately married resemblance in good humour good spirit have recommended lydia to other out of three month acquaintance have be intimate two rapture of lydia on occasion adoration of mr forster delight of mr bennet mortification of kitty be scarcely to be described wholly inattentive to sister feeling lydia flew about house in restless ecstacy calling for one congratulation laughing talking with more violence than ever whilst luckless kitty continued in parlour repining at fate in term a unreasonable a accent be peevish can not see why mr forster must not ask a well a lydia said though be not particular friend have just a much right to be asked a have more too for be two year older in vain did elizabeth attempt to make reasonable jane to make resigned a for elizabeth invitation be so far from exciting in same feeling a in mother lydia that considered a death warrant of possibility of common sense for latter detestable a such step must make be known must not help secretly advising father not to let go represented to impropriety of lydia general behaviour little advantage must derive from friendship of such woman a mr forster probability of being yet more imprudent with companion at brighton where temptation must be greater than at home heard attentively then said lydia will never be easy till have exposed in public place other can never expect to do with so little expense inconvenience to family a under present circumstance if be aware said elizabeth of very great disadvantage to must arise from public notice of lydia unguarded imprudent manner nay have already arisen from be sure must judge differently in affair already arisen repeated mr bennet what have frightened away of lover poor little lizzy be cast down such squeamish youth a can not bear to be connected with little absurdity be not worth regret come let see list of pitiful fellow who have be kept aloof by lydia folly indeed be mistaken have such injury to resent be not of peculiar of general evil be now complaining importance respectability in world must be affected by wild volatility assurance disdain of restraint mark lydia character excuse for must speak plainly if dear father will not take trouble of checking exuberant spirit of teaching that present pursuit be not to be business of life will soon be beyond reach of amendment character will be fixed will at sixteen be most determined flirt that ever made herself family ridiculous flirt too in worst meanest degree of flirtation without attraction beyond youth tolerable person from ignorance emptiness of mind wholly unable to ward off portion of universal contempt rage for admiration will excite in danger kitty be also comprehended will follow wherever lydia lead vain ignorant idle absolutely uncontrouled oh dear father can suppose possible that will not be censured despised wherever be known that sister will not be often involved in disgrace mr bennet saw that whole heart be in subject affectionately taking hand said in reply make uneasy love wherever jane be known must be respected valued will not appear to le advantage for having couple of may say three very silly sister will have peace at longbourn if lydia doe not go to brighton let go then colonel forster be sensible man will keep out of real mischief be luckily too poor to be object of prey to body at brighton will be of le importance even a common flirt than have be here officer will find woman better worth notice let hope therefore being there may teach own insignificance at rate can not grow many degree worse without authorizing to lock up for rest of life with answer elizabeth be forced to be content own opinion continued same left disappointed sorry be not in nature however to increase vexation by dwelling on be confident of having performed duty to fret over unavoidable evil augment by anxiety be part of disposition have lydia mother known substance of conference with father indignation must hardly have found expression in united volubility in lydia imagination visit to brighton

in very gentleness have first delighted affectation sameness to disgust weary in present behaviour to herself moreover have fresh source of displeasure for inclination soon testified of renewing attention have marked early part of acquaintance must only serve after what have since passed to provoke lost concern for in finding thus selected a object of such idle frivolous gallantry while steadily repressed must not feel reproof contained in believing that however long for cause attention have be withdrawn vanity must be gratified preference secured at time by renewal on very last day of regiment remaining in meryton dined with others of officer at longbourn so little be elizabeth disposed to part from in good humour that on making enquiry a to manner in time have passed at hunsford mentioned colonel fitzwilliam mr darcy having spent three week at rosings asked if be acquainted with former looked surprised displeased alarmed with moment recollection returning smile

that be at rosings nearly three week saw frequently yes almost day manner be very different from cousin yes very different think mr darcy improves on acquaintance indeed cried wickham with look did not escape pray may ask checking added in gayer tone be in address that improves have deigned to add ought of civility to ordinary style for dare not hope continued in lower more serious tone that be improved in essential oh said elizabeth in essential believe be very much what ever be while spoke wickham looked a if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over word to distrust meaning there be something in countenance made listen with apprehensive anxious attention while added when said that improved on acquaintance did not mean that mind manner be in state of improvement that from knowing better disposition be better understood wickham alarm now appeared in heightened complexion agitated look for few minute be silent till shaking off embarrassment turned to again said in gentlest of accent who so well know feeling towards mr darcy will readily comprehend how sincerely must rejoice that be wise enough to assume even appearance of what be right pride in direction may be of service

from such a be given elizabeth however have never be blind to impropriety of father behaviour a husband have always seen with pain respecting ability grateful for affectionate treatment of endeavoured to forget what must not overlook to banish from thought that continual breach of conjugal obligation decorum in exposing wife to contempt of own child be so highly reprehensible have never felt so strongly a now disadvantage must attend child of so unsuitable marriage ever be so fully aware of evil arising from so ill judged direction of talent talent rightly used might at least have preserved respectability of daughter even if incapable of enlarging mind of wife when elizabeth have rejoiced over wickham departure found little other cause for satisfaction in loss of regiment party abroad be le varied than before at home have mother sister whose constant repinings at dulness of thing around threw real gloom over domestic circle though kitty might in time regain natural degree of sense

expected have be only ten minute sooner must have be beyond reach of discrimination for be plain that be that moment arrived that moment alighted from horse carriage blushed again again over perverseness of meeting behaviour so strikingly altered what must mean that must even speak to be amazing to speak with such civility to enquire after family never in life have seen manner so little dignified never have spoken with such gentleness a on unexpected meeting what contrast did offer to last address in rosing park when put letter into hand knew not what to think how to account for have

be not like ease whether have felt more of pain of pleasure in seeing must not tell certainly have not seen with composure at length however remark of companion on absence of mind roused felt necessity of appearing more like entered wood bidding adieu to river for while ascended of higher ground whence in spot where opening of tree gave eye power to wander be many charming view of valley opposite hill with long range of wood overspreading many occasionally part of stream mr gardiner expressed wish of going round whole park feared might be beyond walk with triumphant smile be told that be ten mile round settled matter pursued accustomed circuit brought again after time in descent among hanging wood to edge of water in one of narrowest part crossed by simple bridge in character with general air of scene be spot le adorned than have yet visited valley here contracted into glen allowed room only for stream narrow walk amidst rough coppice wood bordered elizabeth longed to explore winding when have crossed bridge perceived distance from house mr gardiner who be not great walker must go farther thought only of returning to carriage a quickly a possible niece be therefore obliged to submit took way towards house on opposite side of river in nearest direction progress be slow for mr gardiner though seldom able to indulge taste be very fond of fishing be so much engaged in watching occasional appearance of trout in water talking to man about that advanced little whilst wandering on in slow manner be again surprised elizabeth astonishment be quite equal to what have be at first by sight of mr darcy approaching at great distance walk being here le sheltered than on other side allowed to see before met elizabeth however astonished be at least more prepared for interview than before resolved to appear to speak with calmness if really intended to meet for few moment indeed felt that must probably strike into other path idea lasted while turning in walk concealed from view turning past be immediately before with glance saw that have lost none of recent civility to imitate politeness began a met to admire beauty of place have not got beyond word delightful charming when unlucky recollection obtruded fancied that praise of pemberley from might be mischievously construed colour changed said more mr gardiner be standing little behind on pausing asked if must do honour of introducing to friend be stroke of civility for be quite unprepared must hardly suppress smile at being now seeking acquaintance of of very people against whom pride have revolted in offer to herself what will be surprise thought when know who be take now for people of fashion introduction however be immediately made a named relationship to herself stole sly look at to see how bore be not without expectation of decamping a fast a must from such disgraceful companion that be surprised by connexion be evident sustained however with fortitude so far from going away turned back with entered into conversation with mr gardiner elizabeth must not be pleased must not triumph be consoling that must know have relation for whom there be need to blush listened most attentively to passed between gloried in expression sentence of uncle marked intelligence taste good manner conversation soon turned upon fishing heard mr darcy invite with greatest civility to fish there a often a chose while continued in neighbourhood offering at same time to supply with fishing tackle pointing out part of stream where there be usually most sport mr gardiner who be walking arm in arm with elizabeth gave look expressive of wonder elizabeth said nothing gratified exceedingly compliment must be for astonishment however be extreme continually be repeating why be so altered from what can proceed can not be for can not be for sake that manner be thus softened reproof at hunsford must not work such change a be impossible that must still love after walking time in way two lady in front two gentleman behind on resuming place after descending to brink of river for better inspection of curious water plant there chanced to be little alteration originated in mr gardiner who fatigued by exercise of morning found elizabeth arm inadequate to support consequently preferred husband mr darcy took place by niece walked on together after short silence lady first spoke wished to know that have be assured of absence before came to place accordingly began by observing that arrival have be very unexpected for housekeeper added informed that must certainly not be here till to morrow indeed before left bakewell understood that be not immediately expected in country acknowledged truth of said that business with steward have occasioned coming forward few hour before rest of party with whom have be travelling will join early to morrow continued among be who will claim acquaintance with mr bingley sister elizabeth answered only by slight bow thought be instantly driven back to time when mr bingley name have be last mentioned between if might judge from complexion mind be not very differently engaged there be also one other person in party continued after pause who more particularly wish to be known to will allow do ask too much to introduce sister to acquaintance during stay at surprise of such application be great indeed be too great for to know in what manner acceded to immediately felt that desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with must be work of brother without looking farther be satisfactory be gratifying to know that resentment have not made think really ill of now walked on in silence of deep in thought elizabeth be not comfortable that be impossible be flattered pleased wish of introducing sister to be compliment of highest kind soon outstripped others when have reached carriage mr mr gardiner be quarter of mile behind then asked to walk into house declared not tired stood together on lawn at time much might have be said silence be very awkward wanted to talk there seemed embargo on subject at last recollected that have be travelling talked of matlock dove dale with great perseverance yet time aunt moved slowly patience idea be nearly worn out before tete tete be over on mr mr gardiner coming up be pressed to go into house take refreshment be declined parted on side with utmost politeness mr darcy handed lady into carriage when drove off elizabeth saw walking slowly towards house observation of uncle aunt now began of pronounced to be infinitely superior to thing have expected be perfectly well behaved polite unassuming said uncle there be something little stately in to be sure replied aunt be confined to air be not unbecoming can now say with housekeeper though people may call proud have seen nothing of be never more surprised than by behaviour to be more than civil be really attentive there be necessity for such attention acquaintance with elizabeth be very trifling to be sure lizzy said aunt be not so handsome a wickham rather have not wickham countenance for feature be perfectly good how came to tell that be so disagreeable elizabeth excused a well a must said that have liked better when met in kent than before that have never seen so pleasant a morning perhaps may be little whimsical in civility replied uncle great men often be therefore will not take at word about fishing a might change mind day warn off ground elizabeth felt that have entirely mistaken character said nothing from what have seen of continued mr gardiner really must not have thought that must have behaved in so cruel way by body a have done by poor wickham have not ill natured look on contrary there be something pleasing about mouth when speaks there be something of dignity in countenance must not give one unfavourable idea of heart to be sure good lady who shewed house did give most flaming character must hardly help laughing aloud sometimes be liberal master suppose that in eye of servant comprehends virtue elizabeth here felt called on to say something in vindication of behaviour to wickham therefore gave to understand in a guarded manner a must that by what have heard from relation in kent action be capable of very different construction that character be by mean so faulty wickham so amiable a have be considered in hertfordshire in confirmation of related particular of pecuniary transaction in have be connected without actually naming authority stating to be such a might be relied on mr gardiner be surprised concerned a be now approaching scene of former pleasure idea gave way to charm of recollection be too much engaged in pointing out to husband interesting spot in environs to think of thing else fatigued a have be by morning walk have sooner dined than set off again in quest of former acquaintance evening be spent in satisfaction of intercourse renewed after many year discontinuance occurrence of day be too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for of new friend must hing think think with wonder of mr darcy civility above of wishing to be acquainted with sister chapter ii elizabeth have settled that mr darcy must bring sister to visit very day after reaching pemberley be consequently resolved not to be out of sight of inn whole of morning conclusion be false for on very morning after own arrival at lambton visitor came have be walking about place with of new friend be just returned to inn to dress for dining with same family when sound of carriage drew to window saw gentleman lady in curricle driving up street elizabeth immediately recognising livery guessed what meant imparted small degree of surprise to relation by acquainting with honour expected uncle aunt be amazement embarrassment of manner a spoke joined to circumstance many of circumstance of preceding day opened to new idea on business nothing have ever suggested before now felt that there be other way of accounting for such attention from such quarter than by supposing partiality for niece while newly born notion be passing in head perturbation of elizabeth feeling be moment increasing be quite amazed at own discomposure amongst other cause of disquiet dreaded lest partiality of brother must have said too much in favour more than commonly anxious to please naturally suspected that power of pleasing must fail retreated from window fearful of being seen a walked up down room endeavouring to compose saw such look of enquiring surprise in uncle aunt a made thing worse miss darcy brother appeared formidable introduction took place with astonishment did elizabeth see that new acquaintance be at least a much embarrassed a herself since being at lambton have heard that miss darcy be exceedingly proud observation of very few minute convinced that be only exceedingly shy found difficult to obtain even word from beyond monosyllable miss darcy be tall on larger scale than elizabeth though little more than sixteen figure be formed appearance womanly graceful be le handsome than brother there be sense good humour in face manner be perfectly unassuming gentle elizabeth who have expected to find in a acute unembarrassed observer a ever mr darcy have be be much relieved by discerning such different feeling have not be long together before darcy told that bingley be also coming to wait on have barely time to express satisfaction prepare for such visitor when bingley quick step be heard on stair in moment entered room elizabeth anger against have be long done away have still felt must hardly have stood ground against unaffected cordiality with expressed on seeing again enquired in friendly though general way after family looked spoke with same good humoured ease that have ever done to mr mr gardiner be scarcely le interesting personage than to herself have long wished to see whole party before indeed excited lively attention suspicion have just arisen of mr darcy niece directed observation towards with earnest though guarded enquiry soon drew from enquiry full conviction that one of at least knew what be to love of lady sensation remained little in doubt that gentleman be overflowing with admiration be evident enough elizabeth on side have much to do wanted to ascertain feeling of of visitor wanted to compose own to make agreeable to in latter object where feared most to fail be most sure of success for to whom endeavoured to give pleasure be prepossessed in favour bingley be ready georgiana be eager darcy determined to be pleased in seeing bingley thought naturally flew to sister oh how ardently did long to know whether of be directed in like manner sometimes must fancy that talked le than on former occasion once twice pleased with notion that a looked at be trying to trace resemblance though might be imaginary must not be deceived a to behaviour to miss darcy who have be set up a rival of jane look appeared on side that spoke particular regard nothing occurred between must justify hope of sister on point be soon satisfied two three little circumstance occurred ere parted in anxious interpretation denoted recollection of jane not untinctured by tenderness wish of saying more might lead to mention of have dared observed to at moment when others be talking together in tone have something of real regret that be very long time since have have pleasure of seeing before must reply added be above eight month have not met since th of november when be dancing together at netherfield elizabeth be pleased to find memory so exact afterwards took occasion to ask when unattended to by of rest whether sister be at longbourn there be not much in question in preceding remark there be look manner gave meaning be not often that must turn eye on mr darcy whenever did catch glimpse saw expression of general complaisance in that said heard accent so far removed from hauteur disdain of companion a convinced that improvement of manner have yesterday witnessed however temporary existence might prove have at least outlived one day when saw thus seeking acquaintance courting good opinion of people with whom intercourse few month ago must have be disgrace when saw thus civil not only to herself to very relation whom have openly disdained recollected last lively scene in hunsford parsonage difference change be so great struck so forcibly on mind that must hardly restrain astonishment from being visible never even in company of dear friend at netherfield dignified relation at rosings have seen so desirous to please so free from self consequence unbending reserve a now when importance must result from success of endeavour when even acquaintance of to whom attention be addressed must draw down ridicule censure of lady of netherfield rosings visitor staid with above hour when arose to depart mr darcy called on sister to join in expressing wish of seeing mr mr gardiner miss bennet to dinner at pemberley before left country miss darcy though with diffidence marked little in habit of giving invitation readily obeyed mr gardiner looked at niece desirous of knowing how whom invitation most concerned felt disposed a to acceptance elizabeth have turned away head presuming however that studied avoidance spoke rather momentary embarrassment than dislike of proposal seeing in husband who be fond of society perfect willingness to accept ventured to engage for attendance day after next be fixed on bingley expressed great pleasure in certainty of seeing elizabeth again having still great deal to say to many enquiry to make after hertfordshire friend elizabeth construing into wish of hearing speak of sister be pleased on account a well a others found when visitor left capable of considering last half hour with satisfaction though while be passing enjoyment of have be little eager to be alone fearful of enquiry hint from uncle aunt staid with only long enough to hear favourable opinion of bingley then hurried away to dress have reason to fear mr mr gardiner curiosity be not wish to force communication be evident that be much better acquainted with mr darcy than have before idea of be evident that be very much in love with saw much to interest nothing to justify enquiry of mr darcy be now matter of anxiety to think well a far a acquaintance reached there be fault to find must not be untouched by politeness have drawn character from own feeling servant report without reference to other account circle in hertfordshire to be known must not have recognised for mr darcy there be now interest however in believing housekeeper soon became sensible that authority of servant who have known since be four year old whose own manner indicated respectability be not to be hastily rejected neither have thing occurred in intelligence of lambton friend must materially lessen weight have nothing to accuse of pride pride probably have if not must certainly be imputed by inhabitant of small market town where family did not visit be acknowledged however that be liberal man did much good among poor with respect to wickham traveller soon found that be not held there in much estimation for though chief of concern with son of patron be imperfectly understood be yet well known fact that on quitting derbyshire have left many debt behind mr darcy afterwards discharged a for elizabeth thought be at pemberley evening more than last evening though a passed seemed long be not long enough to determine feeling towards one in mansion lay awake two whole hour endeavouring to make out certainly did not hate hatred have vanished long ago have almost a long be ashamed of ever feeling dislike against must be so called respect created by conviction of valuable quality though at first unwillingly admitted have for time ceased to be repugnant to feeling be now heightened into somewhat of friendlier nature by testimony so highly in favour bringing forward disposition in so amiable light yesterday have produced above above respect esteem there be motive within of good will must not be overlooked be gratitude gratitude not merely for having once loved for loving still well enough to forgive petulance acrimony of manner in rejecting unjust accusation accompanying rejection who have be persuaded must avoid a greatest enemy seemed on accidental meeting most eager to preserve acquaintance without indelicate display of regard peculiarity of manner where two self only be concerned be soliciting good opinion of friend bent on making known to sister change in man of so much pride excited not only astonishment gratitude for to love ardent love must be attributed a such impression on be of sort to be encouraged a by mean unpleasing though must not be exactly defined respected esteemed be grateful to felt real interest in welfare only wanted to know how far wished that welfare to depend upon how far must be for happiness of that must employ power fancy told still possessed of bringing on renewal of address have be settled in evening between aunt niece that striking civility a miss darcy in coming to on very day of arrival at pemberley for have reached only to late breakfast ought to be imitated though must not be equalled by exertion of politeness on side consequently that must be highly expedient to wait on at following morning be therefore to go elizabeth be pleased though when asked reason have very little to say in reply mr gardiner left soon after breakfast fishing scheme have be renewed day before positive engagement made of meeting of gentleman at pemberley by noon chapter iii convinced a elizabeth now be that miss bingley dislike of have originated in jealousy must not help feeling how very unwelcome appearance at pemberley must be to be curious to know with how much civility on lady side acquaintance must now be renewed on reaching house be shewn through hall into saloon whose northern aspect rendered delightful for summer window opening to ground admitted most refreshing view of high woody hill behind house of beautiful oak spanish chesnuts be scattered over intermediate lawn in room be received by miss darcy who be sitting there with mr hurst miss bingley lady with whom lived in london georgiana reception of be very civil attended with embarrassment though proceeding from shyness fear of doing wrong must easily give to who felt inferior belief of being proud reserved mr gardiner niece however did justice pitied by mr hurst miss bingley be noticed only by curtsey on being seated pause awkward a such pause must always be succeeded for few moment be first broken by mr annesley genteel agreeable looking woman whose endeavour to introduce kind of discourse proved to be more truly well bred than of others between mr gardiner with occasional help from elizabeth conversation be carried on miss darcy looked a if wished for courage enough to join in sometimes did venture short sentence when there be least danger of being heard elizabeth soon saw that be closely watched by miss bingley that must not speak word especially to miss darcy without calling attention observation must not have prevented from trying to talk to latter have not be seated at inconvenient distance be not sorry to be spared necessity of saying much own thought be employing expected moment that of gentleman must enter room wished feared that master of house might be amongst whether wished feared most must scarcely determine after sitting in manner quarter of hour without hearing miss bingley voice elizabeth be roused by receiving from cold enquiry after health of family answered with equal indifference brevity other said more next variation visit afforded be produced by entrance of servant with cold meat cake variety of finest fruit in season did not take place till after many significant look smile from mr annesley to miss darcy have be given to remind her of post there be now employment for whole party for though must not talk must eat beautiful pyramid of grape nectarine peach soon collected round table while thus engaged elizabeth have fair opportunity of deciding whether most feared wished for appearance of mr darcy by feeling prevailed on entering room then though moment before have believed wish to predominate began to regret that came have be time with mr gardiner who with two three other gentleman from house be engaged by river have left only on learning that lady of family intended visit to georgiana that morning sooner did appear than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy unembarrassed resolution more necessary to be made perhaps not more easily kept because saw that suspicion of whole party be awakened against that there be scarcely eye did not watch behaviour when first came into room in countenance be attentive curiosity so strongly marked a in miss bingley in spite of smile overspread face whenever spoke to one of object for jealousy have not yet made desperate attention to mr darcy be by mean over miss darcy on brother entrance exerted much more to talk elizabeth saw that be anxious for sister to get acquainted forwarded a much a possible attempt at conversation on side miss bingley saw likewise in imprudence of anger took first opportunity of saying with sneering civility pray miss eliza be not shire militia removed from meryton must be great loss to family in darcy presence dared not mention wickham name elizabeth instantly comprehended that be uppermost in thought various recollection connected with gave moment distress exerting vigorously to repel ill natured attack presently answered question in tolerably disengaged tone while spoke involuntary glance shewed darcy with heightened complexion earnestly looking at sister overcome with confusion unable to lift up eye have miss bingley known what pain be then giving beloved friend undoubtedly must have refrained from hint have merely intended to discompose elizabeth by bringing forward idea of man to whom believed partial to make betray sensibility might injure in darcy opinion perhaps to remind latter of folly absurdity by part of family be connected with corp not syllable have ever reached her of miss darcy meditated elopement to creature have be revealed where secresy be possible except to elizabeth from bingley connection brother be particularly anxious to conceal from very wish elizabeth have long ago attributed to of becoming hereafter own have certainly formed plan without meaning that must affect endeavour to separate from miss bennet be probable that might add something to lively concern for welfare of friend elizabeth collected behaviour however soon quieted emotion a miss bingley vexed disappointed dared not approach nearer to wickham georgiana also recovered in time though not enough to be able to speak more brother whose eye feared to meet scarcely recollected interest in affair very circumstance have be designed to turn thought from elizabeth seemed to have fixed on more more cheerfully visit did not continue long after question answer above mentioned while mr darcy be attending to carriage miss bingley be venting feeling in criticism on elizabeth person behaviour dress georgiana must not join brother recommendation be enough to ensure favour judgment must not err have spoken in such term of elizabeth a to leave georgiana without power of finding otherwise than lovely amiable when darcy returned to saloon miss bingley must not help repeating to part of what have be saying to sister how very ill eliza bennet look morning mr darcy cried never in life saw one so much altered a be since winter be grown so brown coarse louisa be agreeing that must not have known again however little mr darcy might have liked address contented with coolly replying that perceived other alteration than being rather tanned miraculous consequence of travelling in summer for own part rejoined must confess that never must see beauty in face be too thin complexion have brilliancy feature be not at handsome nose want character there be nothing marked in line teeth be tolerable not out of common way a for eye have sometimes be called so fine never must perceive thing extraordinary in have sharp shrewish look like at in air altogether there be self sufficiency without fashion be intolerable persuaded a miss bingley be that darcy admired elizabeth be not best method of recommending angry people be not always wise in seeing at last look somewhat nettled have success expected be resolutely silent however from determination of making speak continued remember when first knew in hertfordshire how amazed be to find that be reputed beauty particularly recollect saying one night after have be dining at netherfield behe beauty must a soon call mother wit afterwards seemed to improve on believe thought rather pretty at one time replied darcy who must contain no longer be only when first knew for be many month since have considered a one of handsomest woman of acquaintance then went away miss bingley be left to satisfaction of having forced to say what gave one pain mr gardiner elizabeth talked of have occurred during visit a returned except what have particularly interested look behaviour of body have seen be discussed except of person who have mostly engaged attention talked of sister friend house fruit of thing yet elizabeth be longing to know what mr gardiner thought of mr gardiner must have be highly gratified by niece beginning subject chapter iv elizabeth have be good deal disappointed in not finding letter from jane on first arrival at lambton disappointment have be renewed on of morning have now be spent there on third repining be over sister justified by receipt of two letter from at once on one of be marked that have be missent elsewhere

alarm set off from b intending to trace route did trace easily to clapham farther for on entering place removed into hackney coach dismissed chaise brought from epsom be known after be that be seen to continue london road know not what to think after making possible enquiry on side london colonel f came on into hertfordshire anxiously renewing at turnpike at inn in barnet hatfield without success such people have be seen to pas through with kindest concern came on to longbourn broke apprehension to in manner most creditable to heart be sincerely grieved for mr f one can throw blame on distress dear lizzy be very great father mother believe worst can not think so ill of many circumstance might make more eligible for to be married privately in town than to pursue first plan even if must form design against young woman of lydia connection be not likely can suppose so lost to thing impossible grieve to find however that colonel f be not disposed to depend upon marriage shook head when expressed hope said feared w be not man to be trusted poor mother be really ill keep room must exert must be better be not to be expected a to father never in life saw so affected poor kitty have anger for having concealed attachment a be matter of confidence one can not wonder be truly glad dearest lizzy that have be spared something of distressing scene now a first shock be over will own long for return be not so selfish however a to press for if inconvenient adieu take up pen again to do what have just told must not circumstance be such that can not help earnestly begging to come here a soon a possible know dear uncle aunt so well that be not afraid of requesting though have still something more to ask of former father be going to london with colonel forster instantly to try to discover what mean to do be sure know not excessive distress will not allow to pursue measure in best safest way colonel forster be obliged to be at brighton again to morrow evening in such exigence uncle advice assistance must be thing in world will immediately comprehend what must feel rely upon goodness oh where where be uncle cried elizabeth darting from seat a finished letter in eagerness to follow without losing moment of time so precious a reached door be opened by servant mr darcy appeared pale face impetuous manner made start before must recover enough to speak in whose mind idea be superseded by lydia situation hastily exclaimed beg pardon must leave must find mr gardiner moment on business can not be delayed have not instant to lose good god what be matter cried with more feeling than politeness then recollecting will not detain minute let let servant go after mr mr gardiner be not well enough can not go elizabeth hesitated knee trembled under felt how little must be gained by attempting to pursue calling back servant therefore commissioned though in so breathless accent a made almost unintelligible to fetch master mistress home instantly on quitting room sat down unable to support looking so miserably ill that be impossible for darcy to leave to refrain from saying in tone of gentleness commiseration let call maid be there nothing must take to give present relief glass of wine will get one be very ill thank replied endeavouring to recover there be nothing matter with be quite well be only distressed by dreadful news have just received from longbourn burst into tear a alluded to for few minute must not speak word darcy in wretched suspense must only say something indistinctly of concern observe in compassionate silence at length spoke again have just have letter from jane with such dreadful news can not be concealed from one youngest sister have left friend have eloped have thrown into power of of mr wickham be gone off together from brighton know too well to doubt rest have money connection nothing can tempt to be lost for ever darcy be fixed in astonishment when consider added in yet more agitated voice might have prevented who knew what be have explained part of only part of what learnt to own family have character be known must not have happened be all too late now be grieved indeed cried darcy grieved shocked be certain absolutely certain oh yes left brighton together on sunday night be traced almost to london not beyond be certainly not gone to scotland have be done have be attempted to recover father be gone to london jane have written to beg uncle immediate assistance will be off hope in hour nothing can be done know very well that nothing can be done how be such man to be worked on how be even to be discovered have not smallest hope be way horrible darcy shook head in silent acquiesence when eye be opened to real character oh have known what ought what dared to do knew not be afraid of doing too much wretched wretched mistake darcy made answer seemed scarcely to hear be walking up down room in earnest meditation brow contracted air gloomy elizabeth soon observed instantly understood power be sinking thing must sink under proof of family weakness assurance of deepest disgrace must neither wonder condemn belief of self conquest brought nothing consolatory to bosom afforded palliation of distress be on contrary exactly calculated to make understand own wish never have so honestly felt that must have loved a now when love must be vain though must intrude must not engross lydia humiliation misery be bringing on soon swallowed up private care covering face with handkerchief elizabeth be soon lost to thing else after pause of several minute be only recalled to sense of situation by voice of companion who in manner though spoke compassion spoke likewise restraint said be afraid have be long desiring absence have thing to plead in excuse of stay real though unavailing concern must to heaven that thing must be said done on part might offer consolation to such distress will not torment with vain wish may seem purposely to ask for thanks unfortunate affair will fear prevent sister having pleasure of seeing at pemberley to day oh yes be so kind a to apologize for to miss darcy say that urgent business call home immediately conceal unhappy truth a long a be possible know can not be long readily assured of secrecy again expressed sorrow for distress wished happier conclusion than there be at present reason to hope leaving compliment for relation with only one serious parting look went away a quitted room elizabeth felt how improbable be that must ever see other again on such term of cordiality a have marked several meeting in derbyshire a threw retrospective glance over whole of acquaintance so full of contradiction variety sighed at perverseness of feeling must now have promoted continuance must formerly have rejoiced in termination if gratitude esteem be good foundation of affection elizabeth change of sentiment will be improbable faulty if otherwise if regard springing from such source be unreasonable unnatural in comparison of what be so often described a arising on first interview with object even before two word have be exchanged nothing can be said in defence except have given somewhat of trial to latter method in partiality for wickham that ill success might perhaps authorise to seek other le interesting mode of attachment be that a may saw go with regret in early example of what lydia infamy must produce found additional anguish a reflected on wretched business never since reading jane second letter have entertained hope of wickham meaning to marry one jane thought must flatter with expectation surprise be least of feeling on developement while content of first letter remained on mind be surprise astonishment that wickham must marry girl whom be impossible must marry for money how lydia must ever have attached have appeared incomprehensible now be too natural for such attachment a might have sufficient charm though did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in elopement without intention of marriage have difficulty in believing that virtue understanding must preserve from falling easy prey have never perceived while regiment be in hertfordshire that lydia have partiality for be convinced that lydia have wanted only encouragement to attach to body sometimes one officer sometimes have be favourite a attention raised in opinion affection have be continually fluctuating never without object mischief of neglect mistaken indulgence towards girl oh how acutely did now feel be wild to be at home to hear to see to be upon spot to share with jane in care must now fall wholly upon in family so deranged father absent mother incapable of exertion requiring constant attendance though almost persuaded that nothing must be done for lydia uncle interference seemed of utmost importance till entered room misery of impatience be severe mr mr gardiner have hurried back in alarm supposing by servant account that niece be taken suddenly ill satisfying instantly on head eagerly communicated cause of summons reading two letter aloud dwelling on postscript of last with trembling energy though lydia have never be favourite with mr mr gardiner must not be deeply affected not lydia only be concerned in after first exclamation of surprise horror mr gardiner readily promised assistance in power elizabeth though expecting le thanked with tear of gratitude three being actuated by one spirit thing relating to journey be speedily settled be to be off a soon a possible what be to be done about pemberley cried mr gardiner john told mr darcy be here when sent for be so yes told must not be able to keep engagement be settled be settled repeated other a ran into room to prepare be upon such term a for to disclose real truth oh knew how be wish be vain at best must serve only to amuse in hurry confusion of following hour have elizabeth be at leisure to be idle must have remained certain that employment be impossible to one so wretched a herself have share of business a well a aunt amongst rest there be note to be written to friend in lambton with false excuse for sudden departure hour however saw whole completed mr gardiner meanwhile having settled account at inn nothing remained to be done to go elizabeth after misery of morning found in shorter space of time than must have supposed seated in carriage on road to longbourn chapter v have be thinking over again elizabeth said uncle a drove from town really upon serious consideration be much more inclined than be to judge a eldest sister doe of matter appears to so very unlikely that young man must form design against girl who be by mean unprotected friendless who be actually staying in colonel family that be strongly inclined to hope best must expect that friend must not step forward must expect to be noticed again by regiment after such affront to colonel forster temptation be not adequate to risk do really think so cried elizabeth brightening up for moment upon word said mr gardiner begin to be of uncle opinion be really too great violation of decency honour interest for to be guilty of can not think so very ill of wickham can lizzy so wholly give up a to believe capable of not perhaps of neglecting own interest of other neglect can believe capable if indeed must be so dare not hope why must not go on to scotland if have be case in first place replied mr gardiner there be absolute proof that be not gone to scotland oh removing from chaise into hackney coach be such presumption besides trace of be to be found on barnet road well then supposing to be in london may be there though for purpose of concealment for more exceptionable purpose be not likely that money must be very abundant on side might strike that must be more economically though le expeditiously married in london than in scotland why secrecy why fear of detection why must marriage be private oh be not likely most particular friend see by jane account be persuaded of never intending to marry wickham will never marry woman without money can not afford what claim have lydia what attraction have beyond youth health good humour must make for sake forego chance of benefiting by marrying well a to what restraint apprehension of disgrace in corp might throw on dishonourable elopement with be not able to judge for know nothing of effect step might produce a to other objection be afraid will hardly hold good lydia have brother to step forward might imagine from father behaviour from indolence little attention have ever seemed to give to what be going forward in family that must do a little think a little about a father must do in matter can think that lydia be so lost to thing love of a to consent to live with on other term than marriage doe seem be most shocking indeed replied elizabeth with tear in

comfort to in hour of freedom other aunt also visited frequently always a said with design of cheering heartening up though a never came without reporting fresh instance of wickham extravagance irregularity seldom went away without leaving more dispirited than found meryton seemed striving to blacken man who three month before have be almost angel of light be declared to be in debt to tradesman in place intrigue honoured with title of seduction have be extended into tradesman family body declared that be wickedest young man in world body began to find out that have always distrusted appearance of goodness elizabeth though did not credit above half of what be said believed enough to make former assurance of sister ruin still more certain even jane who believed still le

must be likely to know in what part of town have now concealed if there be one one must apply to with probability of gaining such clue a that might be of essential consequence at present have nothing to guide colonel forster will dare say do thing in power to satisfy on head on second thought perhaps lizzy must tell relation have now living better than other person be at loss to understand from whence deference for authority proceeded be not in power to give information of so satisfactory nature a compliment deserved have never heard of having have relation except father mother of whom have be dead many year be possible however that of companion in shire might be able to give more information though be not very sanguine in expecting application be something to look forward to day at

distress must be of bitterest kind because proceeding from cause time can remove argument will be wanting on part can alleviate so severe misfortune may comfort under circumstance must be of others most afflicting to parent mind death of daughter must have be blessing in comparison of be more to be lamented because there be reason to suppose a dear charlotte informs that licentiousness of behaviour in daughter have proceeded from faulty degree of indulgence though at same time for consolation of mr bennet be inclined to think that own disposition must be naturally bad must not be guilty of such enormity at so early age howsoever may be be grievously to be pitied in opinion be not only joined by mr collins likewise by lady catherine daughter to whom have related affair agree with in apprehending that false step in one daughter will be injurious to fortune of others for who a lady catherine condescendingly say will connect with family consideration lead moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on certain event of last november for have be otherwise must have be involved in sorrow disgrace let advise then dear sir to console a much a possible to throw off unworthy

nature to send be not known that wickham have single relation with whom kept up connection be certain that have near one living former acquaintance have be numerous since have be in militia did not appear that be on term of particular friendship with of there be one therefore who must be pointed out a likely to give news of in wretched state of own finance there be very powerful motive for secrecy in addition to fear of discovery by lydia relation for have just transpired that have left gaming debt behind to very considerable amount colonel forster believed that more than thousand pound must be necessary to clear expences at brighton owed good deal in town debt of honour be still more formidable mr gardiner did not attempt to conceal particular from longbourn family jane heard with horror gamester cried be wholly unexpected have not idea of mr gardiner added in letter that might expect to see father at home on following day be saturday rendered spiritless by ill success of endeavour have yielded to brother in law intreaty that must return to family leave to to do occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing pursuit when mr bennet be told of did not express so

expectation mr gardiner have formed of being followed by letter from have ended in nothing elizabeth have received none since return must come from pemberley present unhappy state of family rendered other excuse for lowness of spirit unnecessary nothing therefore must be fairly conjectured from though elizabeth who be by time tolerably well acquainted with own feeling be perfectly aware that have known nothing of darcy must have borne dread of lydia infamy somewhat better must have spared thought one sleepless night out of two when mr bennet arrived have appearance of usual philosophic composure said a little a have ever be in habit of saying made mention of business have taken away be time before daughter have courage to speak of be not till afternoon when joined at tea that elizabeth ventured to introduce subject then on briefly expressing sorrow for what must have endured replied say nothing of who must suffer have be own doing ought to feel must not be too severe upon

to what have feared only two hour ago felt advantage of what have gained chapter viii mr bennet have very often wished before period of life that instead of spending whole income have laid by annual sum for better provision of child of wife if survived now wished more than ever have done duty in respect lydia need not have be indebted to uncle for whatever of honour credit must now be purchased for satisfaction of prevailing on one of most worthless young men in great britain to be husband might then have rested in proper place be seriously concerned that cause of so little advantage to one

love of independence have alone prevented exceeding income five thousand pound be settled by marriage article on mr bennet child in what proportion must be divided amongst latter depended on will of parent be one point with regard to lydia at least be now to be settled mr bennet must have hesitation in acceding to proposal before in term of grateful acknowledgment for kindness of brother though expressed most concisely then delivered on paper perfect approbation of be done willingness to fulfil engagement have be made for have never before supposed must wickham be prevailed on to marry daughter must be done with so little inconvenience to a by present arrangement must scarcely be ten pound year loser by hundred be to be paid for what with board pocket allowance continual present in money passed to through mother hand lydia expences have be very little within sum that must be done with such trifling exertion on side too be very welcome surprise for chief wish at present be to have a little trouble in business a possible when first transport of rage have produced activity in seeking be over naturally returned to former indolence letter be soon dispatched for though dilatory in undertaking business be quick in execution begged to know farther particular of what be indebted to brother be too angry with lydia to send message to good news quickly spread through house with proportionate speed through neighbourhood be borne in latter with decent philosophy to be sure must have be more for advantage of conversation have miss lydia bennet come upon town a happiest alternative be secluded from world in distant farm house there be much to be talked of in marrying good natured wish for well doing have proceeded before from spiteful old lady in meryton lost little of spirit in change of circumstance because with such husband misery be considered certain be fortnight since mr bennet have be down stair on happy day again took seat at head of table in spirit oppressively high sentiment of shame gave damp to triumph marriage of daughter have be first object of wish since jane be sixteen be now on point of accomplishment thought word ran wholly on attendant of elegant nuptials fine muslin new carriage servant be busily searching through neighbourhood for proper situation for daughter without knowing considering what income might be rejected many a deficient in size importance haye park might do said if gouldings must quit great house at stoke if drawing room be larger ashworth be too far off must not bear to have ten mile from a for purvis

understanding into one house in neighbourhood will never have admittance will not encourage impudence of by receiving at longbourn long dispute followed declaration mr bennet be firm soon led to mr bennet found with amazement horror that husband must not advance guinea to buy clothes for daughter protested that must receive from mark of affection on occasion mr bennet must hardly comprehend that anger must be carried to point of inconceivable resentment a to refuse daughter privilege without marriage must scarcely seem valid exceeded that must believe possible be more alive to disgrace want of new clothes must reflect on daughter nuptials than to sense of shame at eloping living with fortnight before took place elizabeth be now most heartily sorry that have from distress of moment be led to make mr darcy acquainted with fear for sister for since marriage must so shortly give proper termination to elopement might hope to conceal unfavourable beginning from who be not immediately on spot have fear of spreading farther through mean there be few people on whose secrecy must have more confidently depended at same time there be one whose knowledge of sister frailty must have mortified so much not however from fear of disadvantage from individually to herself for at rate there seemed gulf impassable between have lydia marriage be concluded on most honourable term be not to be supposed that mr darcy must connect with family where to other objection must now be added alliance relationship of nearest kind with man whom so justly scorned from such connection must not wonder that must shrink wish of procuring regard have assured herself of feeling in derbyshire must not in rational expectation survive blow a be humbled be grieved repented though hardly knew of what became jealous of esteem when must no longer hope to be benefited by wanted to hear of when there seemed least chance of gaining intelligence be convinced that must have be happy with when be no longer likely must meet what triumph for a often thought must know that proposal have proudly spurned only four month ago must now have be gladly gratefully received be a generous doubted not a most generous

union must have be to advantage of by ease liveliness mind might have be softened manner improved from judgment information knowledge of world must have received benefit of greater importance such happy marriage must now teach admiring multitude what connubial felicity really be union of different tendency precluding possibility of other be soon to be formed in family how wickham lydia be to be supported in tolerable independence must not imagine how little of permanent happiness must belong to couple who be only brought together because passion be stronger than virtue must easily conjecture mr gardiner soon wrote again to brother to mr bennet acknowledgment briefly replied with assurance of eagerness to promote welfare of of family concluded with intreaties that subject might never be mentioned to again principal purport of letter be to inform that mr wickham have resolved on quitting militia be greatly wish that must do so added a soon a marriage be fixed on think will agree with

end of fortnight one mr bennet regretted that stay must be so short made most of time by visiting about with daughter having very frequent party at home party be acceptable to to avoid family circle be even more desirable to such a did think than such a did not wickham affection for lydia be just what elizabeth have expected to find not equal to lydia for have scarcely needed present observation to be satisfied from reason of thing elopement have be brought on by strength of love rather than by must have wondered why without violently caring for chose to elope with at have not felt certain that flight be rendered necessary by distress of circumstance if be case be not young man to resist opportunity of having companion lydia be exceedingly fond of be dear wickham on occasion one be to be put in competition with did thing best in world be sure must kill more bird on first of september than body else in country one morning soon after arrival a be sitting with two elder sister said to elizabeth lizzy never gave account of wedding believe be not by when told mamma others about be not curious to hear how be managed really replied elizabeth think there can not be too little said on subject la be so strange must tell how went off be married know at st clement because wickham lodging be in parish be settled that must all be there by eleven o'clock uncle aunt be to go together others be to meet at church well monday morning came be in such fuss be so afraid know that something must happen to put off then must have gone quite distracted there be aunt time be dressing preaching talking away just a if be reading sermon however did not hear above one word in ten for be thinking may suppose of dear wickham longed to know whether must be married in blue coat well so breakfasted at ten a usual thought must never be over for by bye be to understand that uncle aunt be horrid unpleasant time be with if will believe did not once put foot out of door though be there fortnight not one party scheme thing to be sure london be rather thin however little theatre be open well so just a carriage came to door uncle be called away upon business to horrid man mr stone then know when once get together there be end of be so frightened did not know what to do for uncle be to give away if be beyond hour must not be married day luckily came back again in ten minute time then set out however recollected afterwards that if have be prevented going wedding need not be put off for mr darcy might have done a well mr darcy repeated elizabeth in utter amazement oh yes be to come there with wickham know gracious quite forgot ought not to have said word about promised so faithfully what will wickham say be to be such secret if be to be secret said jane say not word on subject may depend upon seeking further oh certainly said though burning with curiosity will ask question thank said lydia for if did must certainly tell then wickham must be angry on such encouragement to ask elizabeth be forced to put out of power by running away to live in ignorance on point be impossible at least be impossible not to try for information mr darcy have be at sister wedding be exactly scene exactly among people where have apparently least to do least temptation to go conjecture a to meaning of rapid wild hurried into brain be satisfied with none best pleased a placing conduct in noblest light seemed most improbable must not bear such suspense hastily seizing sheet of paper wrote short letter to aunt to request explanation of what lydia have dropt if be compatible with secrecy have be intended may readily comprehend added what curiosity must be to know how person unconnected with of comparatively speaking stranger to family must have be amongst at time pray write instantly let understand unless be for very cogent reason to remain in secrecy lydia seems to think necessary then must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance not that will though added to herself a finished letter dear aunt if tell in honourable manner will certainly be reduced to trick stratagem to find out jane delicate sense of honour must not allow to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia have let fall elizabeth be glad of till appeared whether inquiry must receive satisfaction have rather be without confidante chapter x elizabeth have satisfaction of receiving answer to letter a soon a possibly must be sooner in possession of than hurrying into little copse where be least likely to be interrupted sat down on one of bench prepared to be happy for length of letter convinced that did not contain denial gracechurch street sept dear niece have just received letter will devote whole morning to answering a foresee that little writing will not comprise what have to tell must confess surprised by application did not expect from think angry however for only mean to let know have not imagined such enquiry to be necessary on side if choose to understand forgive impertinence uncle be a much surprised a be nothing belief of being party concerned must have allowed to act a have done if be really innocent ignorant must be more explicit on very day of coming home from longbourn uncle have most unexpected visitor mr darcy called be shut up with several hour be over before arrived so curiosity be not so dreadfully racked a seems to have be came to tell mr gardiner that have found out where sister mr wickham be that have seen talked with wickham repeatedly lydia once from what can collect left derbyshire only one day after ourselves came to town with resolution of hunting for motive professed be conviction of being owing to that wickham worthlessness have not be so well known a to make impossible for young woman of character to love confide in generously imputed whole to mistaken pride confessed that have before thought beneath to lay private action open to world character be to speak for called therefore duty to step forward endeavour to remedy evil have be brought on by if have motive be sure must never disgrace have be day in town before be able to discover have something to direct search be more than have consciousness of be reason for resolving to follow there be lady seems mr younge who be time ago governess to miss darcy be dismissed from charge on cause of disapprobation though did not say what then took large house in edward street have since maintained by letting lodging mr younge be knew intimately acquainted with wickham went to for intelligence of a soon a got to town be two three day before must get from what wanted must not betray trust suppose without bribery corruption for really did know where friend be to be found wickham indeed have gone to on first arrival in london have be able to receive into house must have taken up abode with at length however kind friend procured wished for direction be in street saw wickham afterwards insisted on seeing lydia first object with acknowledged have be to persuade to quit present disgraceful situation return to friend a soon a must be prevailed on to receive offering assistance a far a must go found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where be cared for none of friend wanted help of must not hear of leaving wickham be sure must be married time other did not much signify when since such be feeling only remained thought to secure expedite marriage in very first conversation with wickham easily learnt have never be design confessed obliged to leave regiment on account of debt of honour be very pressing scrupled not to lay ill consequence of lydia flight on own folly alone meant to resign commission immediately a to future situation must conjecture very little about must go somewhere did not know where knew must have nothing to live on mr darcy asked why have not married sister at once though mr bennet be not imagined to be very rich must have be able to do something for situation must have be benefited by marriage found in reply to question that wickham still cherished hope of more effectually making fortune by marriage in other country under such circumstance however be not likely to be proof against temptation of immediate relief met several time for there be much to be discussed wickham of course wanted more than must get at length be reduced to be reasonable thing being settled between mr darcy next step be to make uncle acquainted with first called in gracechurch street evening before came home mr gardiner must not be seen mr darcy found on further enquiry that father be still with must quit town next morning did not judge father to be person whom must so properly consult a uncle therefore readily postponed seeing till after departure of former did not leave name till next day be only known that gentleman have called on business on saturday came again father be gone uncle at home a said before have great deal of talk together met again on sunday then saw too be not settled before monday a soon a be express be sent off to longbourn visitor be very obstinate fancy lizzy that obstinacy be real defect of character after have be accused of many fault at different time be true one nothing be to be done that did not do though be sure speak to be thanked therefore say nothing about uncle must most readily have settled whole battled together for long time be more than gentleman lady concerned in deserved at last uncle be forced to yield instead of being allowed to be of use to niece be forced to put up with only having probable credit of went sorely against grain really believe letter morning gave great pleasure because required explanation must rob of borrowed feather give praise where be due lizzy must go farther than jane at most know pretty well suppose what have be done for young people debt be to be paid amounting believe to considerably more than thousand pound thousand in addition to own settled upon commission purchased reason why be to be done by alone be such a have given above be owing to to reserve want of proper consideration that wickham character have be so misunderstood consequently that have be received noticed a be perhaps there be truth in though doubt whether reserve anybody reserve can be answerable for event in spite of fine talking dear lizzy may rest perfectly assured that uncle must never have yielded if have not given credit for interest in affair when be resolved on returned again to friend who be still staying at pemberley be agreed that must be in london once more when wedding took place money matter be then to receive last finish believe have now told thing be relation tell be to give great surprise hope at least will not afford displeasure lydia came to wickham have constant admission to house be exactly what have be when knew in hertfordshire must not tell how little be satisfied with behaviour while staid with if have not perceived by jane letter last wednesday that conduct on coming home be exactly of piece with therefore what now tell can give fresh pain talked to repeatedly in most serious manner representing to wickedness of what have done unhappiness have brought on family if heard be by good luck for be sure did not listen be sometimes quite provoked then recollected dear elizabeth jane for sake have patience with mr darcy be punctual in return a lydia informed attended wedding dined with next day be to leave town again on wednesday thursday will be very angry with dear lizzy if take opportunity of saying what be never bold enough to say before how much like behaviour to have in respect be a pleasing a when be in derbyshire understanding opinion please want nothing little more liveliness that if marry prudently wife may teach thought very sly hardly ever mentioned name slyness seems fashion pray forgive if have be very presuming at least punish so far a to exclude from p will never be quite happy till have be round park low phaeton with nice little pair of pony must be very thing must write more child have be wanting half hour very sincerely m gardiner content of letter threw elizabeth into flutter of spirit in be difficult to determine whether pleasure pain bore greatest share vague unsettled suspicion uncertainty have produced of what mr darcy might have be doing to forward sister match have feared to encourage a exertion of goodness too great to be probable at same time dreaded to be just from pain of obligation be proved beyond greatest extent to be true have followed purposely to town have taken on trouble mortification attendant on research in supplication have be necessary to woman whom must abominate despise where be reduced to meet frequently meet reason with persuade finally bribe man whom always most wished to avoid whose very name be punishment to to pronounce have done for girl whom must neither regard esteem heart did whisper that have done for be hope shortly checked by other consideration soon felt that even vanity be insufficient when required to depend on affection for for woman who have already refused a able to overcome sentiment so natural a abhorrence against relationship with wickham brother in law of wickham kind of pride must revolt from connection have to be sure done much be ashamed to think how much have given reason for interference asked extraordinary stretch of belief be reasonable that must feel have be wrong have liberality have mean of exercising though must not place a principal inducement must perhaps believe that remaining partiality for might assist endeavour in cause where peace of mind must be materially concerned be painful exceedingly painful to know that be under obligation to person who must never receive return owed restoration of lydia character thing to oh how heartily did grieve over ungracious sensation have ever encouraged saucy speech have ever directed towards for be humbled be proud of proud that in cause of compassion honour have be able to get better of read over aunt commendation of again again be hardly enough pleased be even sensible of pleasure though mixed with regret on finding how steadfastly uncle have be persuaded that affection confidence subsisted between mr darcy be roused from seat reflection by one approach before must strike into path be overtaken by wickham be afraid interrupt solitary ramble dear sister said a joined certainly do replied

be strangely misrepresented certainly replied biting lip elizabeth hoped have silenced soon afterwards said be surprised to see darcy in town last month passed other several time wonder what can be doing there perhaps preparing for marriage with miss de bourgh said elizabeth must be something particular to take there at time of year undoubtedly did see while be at lambton thought understood from gardiner that have introduced to sister do like very much have heard indeed that be uncommonly improved within year two when last saw be not very promising be very glad liked hope will turn out well dare say will have got over most trying age did go by village of kympton recollect that did mention because be living ought to have have most delightful place excellent parsonage house must have suited in respect how must have liked making sermon exceedingly well must have considered a part of duty exertion must soon have be nothing one ought not to repine to be sure must have be thing for quiet retirement of life must have answered idea of happiness be not to be did ever hear darcy mention circumstance when be in kent have heard from authority thought a good that be left conditionally only at will of present patron have yes there be something in told so from first may remember did hear too that there be time when sermon making be not so palatable to a seems to be at present that actually declared resolution of never taking order that business have be compromised accordingly did be not wholly without foundation may remember what told on point when first talked of be now almost at door of house for have walked fast to get rid of unwilling for sister sake to provoke only said in reply with good humoured smile come mr wickham be brother sister know let quarrel about past in future hope will be always of one mind held out hand kissed with affectionate gallantry though hardly knew how to look entered house chapter xi mr wickham be so perfectly satisfied with conversation that never again distressed provoked dear sister elizabeth by introducing subject of be pleased to find that have said enough to keep quiet day of lydia departure soon came mr bennet be forced to submit to separation a husband by mean entered into scheme of going to newcastle be likely to continue at least twelvemonth oh dear lydia cried when will meet again oh lord know not two three year perhaps write to very often dear a often a can know married woman have never much time for writing sister may write to will have nothing else to do mr wickham adieu be much more affectionate than wife smiled looked handsome said many pretty thing be a fine fellow said mr bennet a soon a be out of house a ever saw simper smirk make love to be prodigiously proud of defy even sir william lucas to produce more valuable son in law loss of daughter made mr bennet very dull for several day often think said that there be nothing so bad a parting with one friend one seems so forlorn without be consequence see madam of marrying daughter said elizabeth must make better satisfied that other four be single be such thing lydia doe not leave because be married only because husband regiment happens to be so far off if have be nearer must not have gone so soon spiritless condition event threw into be shortly relieved mind opened again to agitation of hope by article of news then began to be in circulation housekeeper at netherfield have received order to prepare for arrival of master who be coming down in day two to shoot there for several week mr bennet be quite in fidget looked at jane smiled shook head by turn well well so mr bingley be coming down sister for mr philip first brought news well so much better not that care about though be nothing to know be sure never want to see again however be very welcome to come to netherfield if like who know what may happen be nothing to know sister agreed long ago never to mention word about so be quite certain be coming may depend

going to butcher told on purpose to order in meat on wednesday have got three couple of duck just fit to be killed miss bennet have not be able to hear of coming without changing colour be many month since have mentioned name to elizabeth now a soon a be alone together said saw look at to day lizzy when aunt told of present report know appeared distressed imagine be from silly cause be only confused for moment because felt must be looked at do assure that news doe not affect with pleasure pain be glad of one thing that come alone because will see le of not that be afraid of dread other people remark elizabeth did not know what to make of have not seen in derbyshire might have supposed capable of coming there with other view than what be acknowledged still thought partial to jane wavered a to greater probability of coming there with friend permission being bold enough to come without yet be hard sometimes thought that poor man can not come to house have legally hired without raising speculation will leave to in spite of what sister declared really believed to be feeling in expectation of arrival elizabeth must easily perceive that spirit be affected by be more disturbed more unequal than have often seen subject have be so warmly canvassed between parent about twelvemonth ago be now brought forward again a soon a ever mr bingley come dear said mr bennet will wait on of course forced into visiting last year promised if went to see must marry one of daughter ended in nothing will not be sent on fool errand again wife represented to how absolutely necessary attention must be from neighbouring gentleman on returning to netherfield 't be etiquette despise said if want society let seek know where live will not spend hour in running after neighbour time go away come back again well know be that will be abominably rude if wait on however sha prevent asking to dine here be determined must have mr long gouldings soon will make thirteen with ourselves so there will be just room at table for consoled by resolution be better able to bear husband incivility though be very mortifying to know that neighbour might see mr bingley in consequence of before did a day of arrival drew near begin to be sorry that come at said jane to sister must be nothing must see with perfect indifference can hardly bear to hear thus perpetually talked of mother mean well doe not know one can know how much suffer from what say happy will be when stay at netherfield be over wish must say thing to comfort replied elizabeth be wholly out of power must feel usual satisfaction of preaching patience to sufferer be denied because have always so much mr bingley arrived mr bennet through assistance of servant contrived to have earliest tidings of that period of anxiety fretfulness on side might be a long a must counted day must intervene before invitation must be sent hopeless of seeing before on third morning after arrival in hertfordshire saw from dressing room window enter paddock ride towards house daughter be eagerly called to partake of joy jane resolutely kept place at table elizabeth to satisfy mother went to window looked saw mr darcy with sat down again by sister there be gentleman with mamma said kitty who can be acquaintance other dear suppose be sure know la replied kitty look just like man used to be with before mr what be name that tall proud man good gracious mr darcy so doe vow well friend of mr bingley will always be welcome here to be sure else must say that hate very sight of jane looked at elizabeth with surprise concern knew little of meeting in derbyshire therefore felt for awkwardness must attend sister in seeing almost for first time after receiving explanatory letter sister be uncomfortable enough felt for other of course for mother talked on of dislike of mr darcy resolution to be civil to only a mr bingley friend without being heard by of elizabeth have source of uneasiness must not be suspected by jane to whom have never yet have courage to shew mr gardiner letter to relate own change of sentiment towards to jane must be only man whose proposal have refused whose merit have undervalued to own more extensive information be person to whom whole family be indebted for first of benefit whom regarded with interest if not quite so tender at least a reasonable just a what jane felt for bingley astonishment at coming at coming to netherfield to longbourn voluntarily seeking again be almost equal to what have known on first witnessing altered behaviour in derbyshire colour have be driven from face returned for minute with additional glow smile of delight added lustre to eye a thought for space of time that affection wish must still be unshaken must not be secure let first see how behaves said will then be early enough for expectation sat intently at work striving to be composed without daring to lift up eye till anxious curiosity carried to face of sister a servant be approaching door jane looked little paler than usual more sedate than elizabeth have expected on gentleman appearing colour increased yet received with tolerable ease with propriety of behaviour equally free from symptom of resentment unnecessary complaisance elizabeth said a little to a civility must allow sat down again to work with eagerness did not often command have ventured only one glance at darcy looked serious a usual thought more a have be used to look in hertfordshire than a have seen at pemberley perhaps must not in mother presence be what be before uncle aunt be painful not improbable conjecture bingley have likewise seen for instant in short period saw looking pleased embarrassed be received by mr bennet with degree of civility made two daughter ashamed especially when contrasted with cold ceremonious politeness of curtsey address to friend elizabeth particularly who knew that mother owed to latter preservation of favourite daughter from irremediable infamy be hurt distressed to most painful degree by distinction so ill applied darcy after enquiring of how mr mr gardiner did question must not answer without confusion said scarcely thing be not seated by perhaps be reason of silence have not be so in derbyshire there have talked to friend when must not to herself now several minute elapsed without bringing sound of voice when occasionally unable to resist impulse of curiosity raised eye to face a often found looking at jane a at herself frequently on object ground more thoughtfulness le anxiety to please than when last met be plainly expressed be disappointed angry with for being so must expect to be otherwise said yet why did come be in humour for conversation with one to have hardly courage to speak enquired after sister must do more be long time mr bingley since went away said mr bennet readily agreed to began to be afraid must never come back again people did say meant to quit place entirely at michaelmas however hope be not true great many change have happened in neighbourhood since went away miss lucas be married settled one of own daughter suppose have heard of indeed must have seen in paper be in time courier know though be not put in a ought to be be only said 'lately george wickham esq to miss lydia bennet without there being syllable said of father place where lived thing be brother gardiner drawing up too wonder how came to make such awkward business of did see bingley replied that did made congratulation elizabeth dared not lift up eye how mr darcy looked therefore must not tell be delightful thing to be sure to have daughter well married continued mother at same time mr bingley be very hard to have taken way from be gone down to newcastle place quite northward seems there be to stay know how long regiment be there for suppose have heard of leaving shire of being gone into regular thank heaven have friend though perhaps not so many a deserves elizabeth who knew to be levelled at mr darcy be in such misery of shame that must hardly keep seat drew from however exertion of speaking nothing else have so effectually done before asked bingley whether meant to make stay in country at present few week believed when have killed own bird mr bingley said mother beg will come here shoot a many a please on mr bennet manor be sure will be vastly happy to oblige will save best of covies for elizabeth misery increased at such unnecessary such officious attention be same fair prospect to arise at present a have flattered year ago thing be persuaded must be hastening to same vexatious conclusion at instant felt that year of happiness must not make jane amends for moment of such painful confusion first wish of heart said to be never more to be in company with of society can afford pleasure will atone for such wretchedness a let never see one other again yet misery for year of happiness be to offer compensation received soon afterwards material relief from observing how much beauty of sister re kindled admiration of former lover when first came in have spoken to little five minute seemed to be giving more of attention found a handsome a have be last year a good natured a unaffected though not quite so chatty jane be anxious that difference must be perceived in at be really persuaded that talked a much a ever mind be so busily engaged that did not always know when be silent when gentleman rose to go away mr bennet be mindful of intended civility be invited engaged to dine at longbourn in few day time be quite visit in debt mr bingley added for when went to town last winter promised to take family dinner with a soon a returned have not forgot see assure be very much disappointed that did not come back keep engagement bingley looked little silly at reflection said something of concern at having be prevented by business then went away mr bennet have be strongly inclined to ask to stay dine there day though always kept very good table did not think thing le than two course must be good enough for man on whom have such anxious design satisfy appetite pride of one who have ten thousand year chapter xii a soon a be gone elizabeth walked out to recover spirit in other word to dwell without interruption on subject must deaden more mr darcy behaviour astonished vexed why if came only to be silent grave indifferent said did come at must settle in way gave pleasure must be still amiable still pleasing to uncle aunt when be in town why not to if fear why come hither if no longer care for why silent teazing teazing man will think more about resolution be for short time involuntarily kept by approach of sister who joined with cheerful look shewed better satisfied with visitor than elizabeth now said that first meeting be over feel perfectly easy know own strength will never be embarrassed again by coming be glad dines here on tuesday will then be publicly seen that on side meet only a common indifferent acquaintance yes very indifferent indeed said elizabeth laughingly oh jane take care dear lizzy can not think so weak a to be in danger now think be in very great danger of making a much in love with a ever did not see gentleman again till tuesday mr bennet in meanwhile be giving way to happy scheme good humour common politeness of bingley in hour visit have revived on tuesday there be large party assembled at longbourn two who be most anxiously expected to credit of punctuality a sportsman be in very good time when repaired to dining room elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley must take place in former party have belonged to by sister prudent mother occupied by same idea forbore to invite to sit by on entering room seemed to hesitate jane happened to look round happened to smile be decided placed by elizabeth with triumphant sensation looked towards friend bore with noble indifference must have imagined that bingley have received sanction to be happy have not seen eye likewise turned towards mr darcy with expression of half laughing alarm behaviour to sister be such during dinner time a shewed admiration of though more guarded than formerly persuaded elizabeth that if left wholly to jane happiness own must be speedily secured though dared not depend upon consequence yet received pleasure from observing behaviour gave animation that spirit must boast for be in cheerful humour mr darcy be almost a far from a table must divide be on one side of mother knew how little such situation must give pleasure to make appear to advantage be not near enough to hear of discourse must see how seldom spoke to other how formal cold be manner whenever did mother ungraciousness made sense of what owed more painful to elizabeth mind must at time have given thing to be privileged to tell that kindness be unknown unfelt by whole of family be in hope that evening must afford opportunity of bringing together that whole of visit must not pas away without enabling to enter into something more of conversation than mere ceremonious salutation attending entrance anxious uneasy period passed in drawing room before gentleman came be wearisome dull to degree almost made uncivil looked forward to entrance a point on chance of pleasure for evening must depend if doe not come to then said will give up for ever gentleman came thought looked a if must have answered hope ala lady have crowded round table where miss bennet be making tea elizabeth pouring out coffee in so close confederacy that there be not single vacancy near must admit of chair on gentleman approaching one of girl moved closer to than ever said in whisper men sha come part be determined want none of do darcy have walked away to part of room followed with eye envied one to whom spoke have scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee then be enraged against for being so silly man who have once be refused how must ever be foolish enough to expect renewal of love be there one among sex who must not protest against weakness a second proposal to same woman there be indignity so abhorrent to feeling be little revived however by bringing back coffee cup seized opportunity of saying be sister at pemberley still yes will remain there till christmas quite alone have friend left mr annesley be with others have be gone on to scarborough three week must think of nothing more to say if wished to converse with might have better success stood by however for minute in silence at last on young lady whispering to elizabeth again walked away when tea thing be removed card table placed lady rose elizabeth be then hoping to be soon joined by when view be overthrown by seeing fall victim to mother rapacity for whist player in few moment after seated with rest of party now lost expectation of pleasure be confined for evening at different table have nothing to hope that eye be so often turned towards side of room a to make play a unsuccessfully a mr bennet have designed to keep two netherfield gentleman to supper carriage be unluckily ordered before of others have opportunity of detaining well girl said a soon a be left to what say to day think thing have passed off uncommonly well assure dinner be a well dressed a ever saw venison be roasted to turn everybody said never saw so fat haunch soup be fifty time better than what have at lucas last week even mr darcy acknowledged that partridge be remarkably well done suppose have two three french cook at least dear jane never saw look in greater beauty mr long said so too for asked whether did not what do think said besides 'ah mr bennet will have at netherfield at last did indeed do think mr long be a good creature a ever lived niece be very pretty behaved girl not at handsome like prodigiously mr bennet in short be in very great spirit have seen enough of bingley behaviour to jane to be convinced that must get at last expectation of advantage to family when in happy humour be so far beyond reason that be quite disappointed at not seeing there again next day to make proposal have be very agreeable day said miss bennet to elizabeth party seemed so well selected so suitable one with other hope may often meet again elizabeth smiled lizzy must not do so must not suspect mortifies assure have now learnt to enjoy conversation a agreeable sensible young man without having wish beyond be perfectly satisfied from what manner now be that never have design of engaging affection be only that be blessed with greater sweetness of address stronger desire of generally pleasing than other man be very cruel said sister will not let smile be provoking to moment how hard be in case to be believed how impossible in others why must wish to persuade that feel more than acknowledge be question hardly know how to answer love to instruct though can teach only what

speech said elizabeth that ever heard utter good girl must vex indeed to see again dupe of miss bingley pretended regard must believe lizzy that when went to town last november really loved nothing

confinement of such intrusion walk away with into shrubbery set off conjecture of remaining three continued though with little satisfaction till door be thrown open visitor entered be lady catherine de bourgh be of course intending to be surprised astonishment be beyond expectation on part of mr bennet kitty though be perfectly unknown to even inferior to what elizabeth felt entered room with air more than usually ungracious made other reply to elizabeth salutation than slight inclination of head sat down without saying word elizabeth have mentioned name to mother on ladyship entrance though request of introduction have be made mr bennet amazement though flattered by having guest of such high importance received with utmost politeness after sitting for moment in silence said very stiffly to elizabeth hope be well miss bennet lady suppose be mother elizabeth replied very concisely that be that suppose be one of sister yes madam said mr bennet delighted to speak to lady catherine be youngest girl one youngest of be lately married eldest be somewhere about ground walking with young man who believe will soon become part of family have very small park here returned lady catherine after short silence be nothing in comparison of rosings lady dare say assure be much larger than sir william lucas must be most inconvenient sitting room for evening in summer window be full west mr bennet assured that never sat there after dinner then added may take liberty of asking ladyship whether left mr mr collins well yes very well saw night before last elizabeth now expected that must produce letter for from charlotte a seemed only probable motive for calling letter appeared be completely puzzled mr bennet with great civility begged ladyship to take refreshment lady catherine very resolutely not very politely declined eating thing then rising up said to elizabeth miss bennet there seemed to be prettyish kind of little wilderness on one side of lawn must be glad to take turn in if will favour with company go dear cried mother shew ladyship about different walk think will be pleased with hermitage elizabeth obeyed running into own room for parasol attended noble guest down stair a passed through hall lady catherine opened door into dining parlour drawing room pronouncing after short survey to be decent looking room walked on carriage remained at door elizabeth saw that waiting woman be in proceeded in silence along gravel walk led to copse elizabeth be determined to make effort for conversation with woman who be now more than usually insolent disagreeable how must ever think like nephew said a looked in face a soon a entered copse lady catherine began in following manner can be at loss miss bennet to understand reason of journey own heart own conscience must tell why come elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment indeed be mistaken madam have not be at able to account for honour of seeing here miss bennet replied ladyship in angry tone ought to know be not to be trifled with however insincere may choose to be will not find so character have ever be celebrated for sincerity frankness in cause of such moment a will certainly not depart from report of most alarming nature reached two day ago be told that not only sister be on point of being most advantageously married that that miss elizabeth bennet must in likelihood be soon afterwards united to nephew own nephew mr darcy though know must be scandalous falsehood though must not injure so much a to suppose truth of possible instantly resolved on setting off for place might make sentiment known to if believed impossible to be true said elizabeth colouring with astonishment disdain wonder took trouble of coming so far what must ladyship propose by at once to insist upon having such report universally contradicted coming to longbourn to see family said elizabeth coolly will be rather confirmation of if indeed such report be in existence if do then pretend to be ignorant of have not be industriously circulated by yourselves do not know that report be spread abroad never heard that be can likewise declare that there be foundation for pretend to posse equal frankness with ladyship may ask question will not choose to answer be not to be borne miss bennet insist on being satisfied have have nephew made offer of marriage ladyship have declared to be impossible ought to be so must be so while retains use of reason art allurement may in moment of infatuation have made forget what owes to to family may have drawn in if have will be last person to confess miss bennet do know who be have not be accustomed to such language a be almost nearest relation have in world be entitled to know dearest concern be not entitled to know mine will such behaviour a ever induce to be explicit let be rightly understood match to have presumption to aspire can never take place never mr darcy be engaged to daughter now what have to say only that if be so can have reason to suppose will make offer to lady catherine hesitated for moment then replied engagement between be of peculiar kind from infancy have be intended for other be favourite wish of mother a well a of while in cradle planned union now at moment when wish of sister must be accomplished in marriage to be prevented by young woman of inferior birth of importance in world wholly unallied to family do pay regard to wish of friend to tacit engagement with miss de bourgh be lost to feeling of propriety delicacy have not heard say that from earliest hour be destined for cousin yes have heard before what be to if there be other objection to marrying nephew will certainly not be kept from by knowing that mother aunt wished to marry miss de bourgh did a much a must in planning marriage completion depended on others if mr darcy be neither by honour inclination confined to cousin why be not to make choice if be that choice why may not accept because honour decorum prudence nay interest forbid yes miss bennet interest for expect to be noticed by family friend if wilfully act against inclination of will be censured slighted despised by one connected with alliance will be disgrace name will never even be mentioned by of be heavy misfortune replied elizabeth wife of mr darcy must have such extraordinary source of happiness necessarily attached to situation that must upon whole have cause to repine obstinate headstrong girl be ashamed of be gratitude for attention to last spring be nothing due to on score let sit down be to understand miss bennet came here with determined resolution of carrying

not be if be sensible of own good must not wish to quit sphere in have be brought up in marrying nephew must not consider a quitting that sphere be gentleman be gentleman daughter so far be equal true be gentleman daughter who be mother who be uncle aunt imagine ignorant of condition whatever connection may be said elizabeth if nephew doe not object to can be nothing to tell once for be engaged to though elizabeth must not for mere purpose of obliging lady catherine have answered question must not say after moment deliberation be not lady catherine seemed pleased will promise never to enter into such engagement will make promise of kind miss bennet be shocked astonished expected to find more reasonable young woman deceive into belief will ever recede will not go away till have given assurance require certainly never will give be not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable ladyship want mr darcy to marry daughter must giving wished for promise make marriage at more probable supposing to be attached to must refusing to accept hand make wish to bestow on cousin allow to say lady catherine that argument with have supported extraordinary application have be a frivolous a application be ill judged have widely mistaken character if think can be worked on by such persuasion a how far nephew might approve of interference in affair can not tell have certainly no right to concern in mine must beg therefore to be importuned farther on subject not so hasty if please have by mean done to objection have already urged have still to add be stranger to particular of youngest sister infamous elopement know that young man marrying be patched up business at expence of father uncle be such girl to be nephew sister be husband be son of late father steward to be brother heaven earth of what be thinking be shade of pemberley to be thus polluted can now have nothing farther to say resentfully answered have insulted in possible method must beg to return to house rose a spoke lady catherine rose also turned back ladyship be highly incensed have regard then for honour credit of nephew unfeeling selfish girl do not consider that connection with must disgrace in eye of everybody lady catherine have nothing farther to say know sentiment be then resolved to have have said such thing be only resolved to act in manner will in own opinion constitute happiness without reference to to person so wholly unconnected with be well refuse then to oblige refuse to obey claim of duty honour gratitude be determined to ruin in opinion of friend make contempt of world duty honour gratitude replied elizabeth have possible claim on in present instance principle of must be violated by marriage with mr darcy with regard to resentment of family indignation of world if former be excited by marrying must not give one moment concern world in general must have too much sense to join in scorn be real opinion be final resolve very well will now know how to act imagine miss bennet that ambition will ever be gratified came to try hoped to find reasonable depend upon will carry point in manner lady catherine talked on till be at door of carriage when turning hastily round added take leave of miss bennet send compliment to mother deserve such attention be most seriously displeased elizabeth made answer without attempting to persuade ladyship to return into house walked quietly into heard carriage drive away a proceeded up stair mother impatiently met at door of dressing room to ask why lady catherine must not come in again rest did not choose said daughter must go be very fine looking woman calling here be prodigiously civil for only came suppose to tell collins be well be on road somewhere dare say so passing through meryton thought might a well call on suppose have nothing particular to say to lizzy elizabeth be forced to give into little falsehood here for to acknowledge substance of conversation be impossible chapter xv discomposure of spirit extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into must not be easily overcome must for many hour learn to think of le than incessantly lady catherine appeared have actually taken trouble of journey from rosings for sole purpose of breaking off supposed engagement with mr darcy be rational scheme to be sure from what report of engagement must originate elizabeth be at loss to imagine till recollected that being intimate friend of bingley being sister of jane be enough at time when expectation of one wedding made body eager for to supply idea have not forgotten to feel that marriage of sister must bring more frequently together neighbour at lucas lodge therefore for through communication with collins report concluded have reached lady catherine have only set that down a almost certain immediate have looked forward to a possible at future time in revolving lady catherine expression however must not help feeling uneasiness a to possible consequence of persisting in interference from what have said of resolution to prevent marriage occurred to elizabeth that must meditate application to nephew how might take similar representation of evil attached to connection with dared not pronounce knew not exact degree of affection for aunt dependence on judgment be natural to suppose that thought much higher of ladyship than must do be certain that in enumerating misery of marriage with one whose immediate connection be so unequal to own aunt must address on weakest side with notion of dignity must probably feel that argument to elizabeth have appeared weak ridiculous contained much good sense solid reasoning if have be wavering before a to what must do have often seemed likely advice intreaty of so near relation might settle doubt determine at once to be a happy a dignity unblemished must make in case must return more lady catherine might see in way through town engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way if therefore excuse for not keeping promise must come to friend within few day added will know how to understand will then give over expectation wish of constancy if be satisfied with only regretting when might have obtained affection hand will soon cease to regret at surprise of rest of family on hearing who visitor have be be very great obligingly satisfied with same kind of supposition have appeased mr bennet curiosity elizabeth be spared from much teazing on subject next morning a be going down stair be met by father who came out of library with letter in hand lizzy said be going to look for come into room followed thither curiosity to know what have to tell be heightened by supposition of being in manner connected with letter held suddenly struck that might be from lady catherine anticipated with dismay consequent explanation followed father to fire place sat down then said have received letter morning have astonished exceedingly a principally concern ought to know content did not know before have two daughter on brink of matrimony let congratulate on very important conquest colour now rushed into elizabeth cheek in instantaneous conviction of being letter from nephew instead of aunt be undetermined whether most to be pleased that explained at offended that letter be not rather addressed to herself when father continued look conscious young lady have great penetration in such matter a think may defy even sagacity to discover name of admirer letter be from mr collins from mr collins what can have to say something very much to purpose of course begin with congratulation on approaching nuptials of eldest daughter of seems have be told by of good natured gossiping lucas will not sport with impatience by reading what say on point what relates to be a follows having thus offered sincere congratulation of mr collins on happy event let now add short hint on subject of of have be advertised by same authority daughter elizabeth be presumed will not long bear name of bennet after elder sister have resigned chosen partner of fate may be reasonably looked up to a one of most illustrious personage in land can possibly guess lizzy who be meant by young gentleman be blessed in peculiar way with thing heart of mortal can most desire splendid property noble kindred extensive patronage yet in spite of temptation let warn cousin elizabeth yourself of what evil may incur by precipitate closure with gentleman proposal of course will be inclined to take immediate advantage of have idea lizzy who gentleman be now come out motive for cautioning be a follows have reason to imagine that aunt lady catherine de bourgh doe not look on match with friendly eye mr darcy see be man now lizzy think have surprised must lucas have pitched on man within circle of acquaintance whose name must have given lie more effectually to what related mr darcy who never look at woman to see blemish who probably never looked at in life be admirable elizabeth tried to join in father pleasantry must only force one most reluctant smile never have wit be directed in manner so little agreeable to be not diverted oh yes pray read on after mentioning likelihood of marriage to ladyship last night immediately with usual condescension expressed what felt on occasion when became apparent that on score of family objection on part of cousin must never give consent to what termed so disgraceful match thought duty to give speediest intelligence of to cousin that noble admirer may be aware of what be about not run hastily into marriage have not be properly sanctioned mr collins moreover add be truly rejoiced that cousin lydia sad business have be so well hushed up be only concerned that living together before marriage took place must be so generally known must not however neglect duty of station refrain from declaring amazement at hearing that received young couple into house a soon a be married be encouragement of vice have be rector of longbourn must very strenuously have opposed ought certainly to forgive a christian never to admit in sight allow name to be mentioned in hearing be notion of christian forgiveness rest of letter be only about dear charlotte situation expectation of young olive branch lizzy look a if did not enjoy be not going to be missish hope pretend to be affronted at idle report for what do live to make sport for neighbour laugh at in turn oh cried elizabeth be excessively diverted be so strange yes be what make amusing have fixed on other man must have be nothing perfect indifference pointed dislike make so delightfully absurd much a abominate writing must not give up mr collins correspondence for consideration nay when read letter of can not help giving preference even over wickham much a value impudence hypocrisy of son in law pray lizzy what said lady catherine about report did call to refuse consent to question daughter replied only with laugh a have be asked without least suspicion be not distressed by repeating elizabeth have never be more at loss to make feeling appear what be not be necessary to laugh when must rather have cried father have most cruelly mortified by what said of mr darcy indifference must hing wonder at want of penetration fear that perhaps instead of seeing too little might have fancied too much chapter xvi instead of receiving such letter of excuse from friend a elizabeth half expected mr bingley to do be able to bring darcy with to longbourn before many day have passed after lady catherine visit gentleman arrived early before mr bennet have time to tell of having seen aunt of daughter sat in momentary dread bingley who wanted to be alone with jane proposed walking out be agreed to mr bennet be not in habit of walking mary must never spare time remaining five set off together bingley jane however soon allowed others to outstrip lagged behind while elizabeth kitty darcy be to entertain other very little be said by kitty be too much afraid of to talk elizabeth be secretly forming desperate resolution perhaps might be doing same walked towards lucas because kitty wished to call upon maria a elizabeth saw occasion for making general concern when kitty left went boldly on with alone now be moment for resolution to be executed while courage be high immediately said mr darcy be very selfish creature for sake of giving relief to own feeling care not how much may be wounding can no longer help thanking for unexampled kindness to poor sister ever since have known have be most anxious to acknowledge to how gratefully feel be known to rest of family must not have merely own gratitude to express be sorry exceedingly sorry replied darcy in tone of surprise emotion that have ever be informed of what may in mistaken light have given uneasiness did not think mr gardiner be so little to be trusted must not blame aunt lydia thoughtlessness first betrayed to that have be concerned in matter of course must not rest till knew particular let thank again again in name of family for generous compassion induced to take so much trouble bear so many mortification for sake of discovering if will thank replied let be for alone that wish of giving happiness to might add force to other inducement led on will not attempt to deny family owe nothing much a respect believe thought only of elizabeth be too much embarrassed to say word after short pause companion added be too generous to trifle with if feeling be still what be last april tell so at once affection wish be unchanged one word from will silence on subject for ever elizabeth feeling more than common awkwardness anxiety of situation now forced to speak immediately though not very fluently gave to understand that sentiment have undergone so material change since period to alluded a to make receive with gratitude pleasure present assurance happiness reply produced be such a have probably never felt before expressed on occasion a sensibly a warmly a man violently in love can be supposed to do have elizabeth be able to encounter eye might have seen how well expression of heart felt delight diffused over face became though must not look must listen told of feeling in proving of what importance be to made affection moment more valuable walked on without knowing in what direction there be too much to be thought felt said for attention to other object soon learnt that be indebted for present good understanding to effort of aunt who did call on in return through london there relate journey to longbourn motive substance of conversation with elizabeth dwelling emphatically on expression of latter in ladyship apprehension peculiarly denoted perverseness assurance in belief that relation must assist endeavour to obtain that promise from nephew have refused to give unluckily for ladyship effect have be exactly contrariwise taught to hope said a have scarcely ever allowed to hope before knew enough of disposition to be certain that have be absolutely irrevocably decided against must have acknowledged to lady catherine frankly openly elizabeth coloured laughed a replied yes know enough of frankness to believe capable of after abusing so abominably to face must have scruple in abusing to relation what did say of did not deserve for though accusation be ill founded formed on mistaken premise behaviour to at time have merited severest reproof be unpardonable can not think of without abhorrence will not quarrel for greater share of blame annexed to evening said elizabeth conduct of if strictly examined will be irreproachable since then have hope improved in civility can not be so easily reconciled to myself recollection of what then said of conduct manner expression during whole of be now have be many month inexpressibly painful to reproof so well applied will never forget 'have behaved in more gentleman like manner be word know not can scarcely conceive how have tortured though be time confess before be reasonable enough to allow justice be certainly very far from expecting to make so strong impression have not smallest idea of being ever felt in such way can easily believe thought then devoid of proper feeling be sure did turn of countenance will never forget a said must not have addressed in possible way must induce to accept oh repeat what then said recollection will not do at assure have long be most heartily ashamed of darcy mentioned letter did said did soon make think better of did on reading give credit to content explained what effect on have be how gradually former prejudice have be removed knew said that what wrote must give pain be necessary hope have destroyed letter there be one part especially opening of must dread having power of reading again can remember expression might justly make hate letter will certainly be burnt if believe essential to preservation of regard though have reason to think opinion not entirely unalterable be not hope quite so easily changed a implies when wrote that letter replied darcy believed perfectly calm cool be since convinced that be written in dreadful bitterness of spirit letter perhaps began in bitterness did not end so adieu be charity think more of letter feeling of person who wrote person who received be now so widely different from what be then that unpleasant circumstance attending ought to be forgotten must learn of philosophy think only of past a remembrance give pleasure can not give credit for philosophy of kind retrospection must be so totally void of reproach that contentment arising from be not of philosophy what be much better of ignorance with be not so painful

to be selfish overbearing to care for none beyond own family circle to think meanly of rest of world to wish at least to think meanly of sense worth compared with own such be from eight to eight twenty such might still have be for dearest loveliest elizabeth what do not owe taught lesson hard indeed at first most advantageous by be properly humbled came to without doubt of reception shewed how insufficient be pretension to please woman worthy of being pleased have then persuaded must indeed have what will think of vanity believed to be wishing expecting address manner must have be in fault not intentionally assure never meant to deceive spirit might often lead wrong how must have hated after evening hate be angry perhaps at first anger soon began to take proper direction be almost afraid of asking what thought of when met at pemberley blamed for coming indeed felt nothing surprise surprise must not be greater than mine in being noticed by conscience told that deserved extraordinary politeness confess did not expect to receive more than due object then replied darcy be to shew by civility in power be not so mean a to resent past hoped to obtain forgiveness to lessen ill opinion by letting see that reproof have be attended to how soon other wish introduced can hardly tell believe in about hour after have seen then told of georgiana delight in acquaintance of disappointment at sudden interruption naturally leading to cause of interruption soon learnt that resolution of following from derbyshire in quest of sister have be formed before quitted inn that gravity thoughtfulness there have arisen from other struggle than what purpose must comprehend expressed gratitude again be too painful subject to to be dwelt on farther after walking several mile in leisurely manner too busy to know thing about found at last on examining watch that be time to be at home what must become of mr bingley jane be wonder introduced discussion of affair darcy be delighted with engagement friend have given earliest information of must ask whether be surprised said elizabeth not at when went away felt that must soon happen be to say have given permission guessed a much though exclaimed at term found that have be pretty much case on evening before going to london said made confession to believe ought to have made long ago told of have occurred to make former interference in affair absurd impertinent surprise be great have never have slightest suspicion told moreover believed mistaken in supposing a have done that sister be indifferent to a must easily perceive that attachment to be unabated felt doubt of happiness together elizabeth must not help smiling at easy manner of directing friend did speak from own observation said when told that sister loved merely from information last spring from former have narrowly observed during two visit have lately made here be convinced of affection assurance of suppose carried immediate conviction to did bingley be most unaffectedly modest diffidence have prevented depending on own judgment in so anxious case reliance on mine made thing easy be obliged to confess one thing for time not unjustly offended must not allow to conceal that sister have be in town three month last winter have known purposely kept from be angry anger be persuaded lasted no longer than remained in doubt of sister sentiment have heartily forgiven now elizabeth longed to observe mr bingley have be most delightful friend so easily guided that worth be invaluable checked remembered that have yet to learn to be laught at be rather too early to begin in anticipating happiness of bingley of course be to be inferior only to own continued conversation till reached house in hall parted chapter xvii dear lizzy where can have be walking to be question elizabeth received from jane a soon a entered room from others when sat down to table have only to say in reply that have wandered about till be beyond own knowledge coloured a spoke that thing else awakened suspicion of truth evening passed quietly unmarked by thing extraordinary acknowledged lover talked laughed unacknowledged be silent darcy be not of disposition in happiness overflow in mirth elizabeth agitated confused rather knew that be happy than felt to be so for besides immediate embarrassment there be other evil before anticipated what must be felt in family when situation became known be aware that one liked jane even feared that with others be dislike not fortune consequence might do away at night opened heart to jane though suspicion
