come flying from pulpit in such eager haste to shake hand with squire hand wife daughter into carriage moreover owe grudge for nearly shutting out of for in fact though be standing before face close beside carriage step waiting to get in must persist in putting up closing door till one of family stopped by calling out that governess be not in yet then without word of apology departed wishing good

returned from abroadyou cant think besides then will have opportunity of seeing beautiful mr weston again of hearing preach did hear preach be decidedly pleased with evangelical truth of doctrine a well a earnest simplicity of manner clearness force of style be truly refreshing to hear such sermon after being so long accustomed to dry prosy discourse of former curate still le edifying harangue of rector mr hatfield must come sailing up aisle rather sweeping along like whirlwind with rich silk gown flying behind rustling against pew door mount pulpit like conqueror ascending triumphal car then sinking on velvet cushion in attitude of studied grace remain in silent prostration for certain time then mutter over collect gabble through lord prayer rise draw off one bright lavender glove to give congregation benefit of sparkling ring lightly pas finger through well curled hair flourish cambric handkerchief recite very short passage perhaps mere phrase of scripture a head piece to discourse finally deliver composition a composition might be considered good though far too studied too artificial to be pleasing to proposition be well laid down argument logically conducted yet be sometimes hard to listen quietly throughout without slight demonstration of disapproval impatience favourite subject be church discipline rite ceremony apostolical succession duty of reverence obedience to clergy atrocious criminality of dissent absolute necessity of observing form of godliness reprehensible presumption of individual who attempted to think for in matter connected with religion to be guided by own interpretation of scripture occasionally to please wealthy parishioner necessity of deferential obedience from poor to richsupporting maxim exhortation throughout with quotation from father with whom appeared to be far better acquainted than with apostle evangelist whose importance seemed to consider at least equal to theirs now then gave sermon of different orderwhat must call very good one sunless severe representing deity a terrible taskmaster rather than benevolent father yet a listened felt inclined to think man be sincere in said must have changed view become decidedly religious gloomy austere yet still devout such illusion be usually dissipated on coming out of church by hearing voice in jocund colloquy with of melthams green perhaps murray probably laughing at own sermon hoping that have given rascally people something to think about perchance exulting in thought old betty holmes must now lay aside sinful indulgence of pipe have be daily solace for upwards of thirty year george higgins must be frightened out of sabbath evening walk thomas jackson must be sorely troubled in conscience shaken in sure certain hope of joyful resurrection at last day thus must not conclude that mr hatfield be one of who bind heavy burden grievous to be borne lay upon men shoulder while will not move with one of finger who make word of god of none effect by tradition teaching for doctrine commandment of men be well pleased to observe that new curate resembled a far a must see in none of particular well miss grey what do think of now said miss murray a took place in carriage after service no harm still replied harm repeated in amazement what do mean mean think worse of than did before worse must think not indeedquite contrary be not greatly improved oh yes very much indeed replied for have now discovered that be harry meltham meant not mr weston that gentleman have eagerly come forward to speak to young lady thing must hardly have ventured to do have mother be present have likewise politely handed into carriage have not attempted to shut out like mr hatfield of course have offered assistance must not have accepted if have a long a door remained open have stood smirking chatting with then lifted hat departed to own abode have scarcely noticed time companion however have be more observant a rolled along discussed between

order to enjoy bright sunshine balmy air in sociable walk home along with visitor captain somebody lieutenant somebody else couple of military fop miss murray who of course contrived to join party be highly agreeable to rosalie not finding equally suitable to taste presently fell back began to botanise entomologise along green bank budding hedge till company be considerably in advance of must hear sweet song of happy lark then spirit of misanthropy began to melt away beneath soft pure air genial sunshine sad thought of early childhood yearning for departed joy for brighter future lot arose

watchful anxious care be amazed horrified at mr murray heartlessness want of thought for real good of child by unheeded warning exhortation vainly strove to remedy evil miss murray only laughed at
