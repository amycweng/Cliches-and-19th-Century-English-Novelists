power of making out must turn loneliness disappointment into rich content for time at least before hard degrading experience have broken spring of youth replaced disinterested spontaneous pleasure be to be got from life play of imagination by sad sense of duty inexorable consciousness of moral religious mission anne bront wrote story for own amusement loved rascal created already in when first hear of gondals solala vernon material for quite other book be in poor anne mind be then teaching in family at thorpe green where branwell joined a tutor in where owing to event be still mystery seems

le tragic account of matter during stay at thorpe green writes on july have have very unpleasant undreamt of experience of human nature branwell have be tutor at thorpe green have much tribulation ill health hope will be better do better in future at end of paper say sadly forecasting coming year for part can not well be flatter older in mind than be now be language of disappointment anxiety hardly fit tragic story that mr gaskell believed that story be doubt elaboration of branwells diseased fancy during three year elapsed between dismissal from thorpe green death imagined guilty romance with employer wife for character imposed horrid story upon sister opium drink be sufficient explanation time need now be wasted upon unravelling sordid mystery vice of brother real imaginary have certain importance in literature because of effect produced upon sister there can be question that branwells opium madness bout of drunkenness at black bull violence at home free coarse talk perpetual boast of guilty secret influenced imagination of wholly pure inexperienced sister much of wuthering height of wildfell hall show branwells mark there be many passage in charlotte book also where who know history of parsonage can hear voice of sharp moral repulsion dismal moral questioning to branwells misconduct ruin gave rise brother fate be element in genius of emily charlotte be strong enough to assimilate may have done harm weakened in certain delicate sane perception be ultimately by strange alchemy of talent far more profitable than hurtful inasmuch a troubled water of soul brought near to more desperate reality of frail falln humankind anne be not strong enough gift be not vigorous enough to enable thus to transmute experience grief probability be that when left thorpe green in be already suffering from religious melancholy of charlotte discovered such piteous evidence among paper after death did not much affect writing of agnes grey be completed in reflected minor pain

book have not be written in vain if story have given more pain than pleasure to honest reader writer craves pardon for such be far from intention at same time can not promise to limit ambition to giving of innocent pleasure to production of perfect work of art time talent so spent must consider wasted misapplied god have given unpalatable truth to speak must speak measure of misconstruction abuse therefore book brought upon bore say sister a be custom to bear be unpleasant with mild steady patience be very sincere practical christian tinge of religious melancholy communicated sad shade to brief blameless life in spite of misconstruction abuse however wildfell hall seems to have attained more immediate success than anything else written by sister before except jane eyre went into second edition within very short time of publication messrs newby informed american publisher with whom be negotiating that be work of same hand have produced jane eyre superior to jane eyre wuthering

be rather truth of tract report there can be little doubt that many of page be close transcript from branwells conduct languageso far a anne slighter personality enabled to render brother temperament be more akin to emilys than to own same material might have be used by emily charlotte emily a know did make use of in wuthering height only after have passed through ineffable transformation that mysterious incommunicable heightening make give rank in literature subtle innate correspondence between eye brain between brain hand be present in emily charlotte absent in anne there be other account

english religious verse must always appeal to who love bronts because in language of christian faith submission record death of emily passionate affection sister bore so be brought back to point from started be not a writer of wildfell hall a sister of charlotte emily bront that anne bront escape oblivionas frail little one upon whom other two lavished tender protecting care who be witness of emilys death within few minute of own farewell to life bade charlotte take courage when thought turn to anne said charlotte many year earlier always see a patient persecuted strangermore lonely le gifted with power of making friend even than be later on however power of making friend seems to have belonged to anne in greater measure than to others gentleness conquered be not set apart a be by lonely self sufficing activity of great power christianity though sad timid be of kind around must understand made grim fight with suffering death a did emily emily be torn from life conscious panting reluctant to use charlotte own word anne suffering be mild mind generally serene at last thanked god that death be come come so gently when charlotte returned to desolate house at haworth emilys large

writing of shirley when passed away four year later have so turned year to account that not only all did loved have passed silently into keeping of fame mr gaskell touching delightful task be ready for anne le than charlotte emily be sure of england remembrance mary ward author preface to second edition while success of present work to have be greater than anticipated praise have elicited from few kind critic to have be greater than deserved must also admit that from other quarter have be censured with asperity be a little prepared to expect judgment a well a feeling assures be more bitter than just be scarcely province of author to refute argument of censor vindicate own production may be allowed to make here few observation with must have prefaced first edition have foreseen necessity of such precaution against misapprehension of who must read with prejudiced mind be content to judge by hasty glance object in writing following page be not simply to amuse reader be to gratify own taste yet to ingratiate with press public wished to tell truth for truth always conveys own moral to who be able to receive a priceless treasure too frequently hide at bottom of well need courage to dive for especially a doe so will be likely to incur more scorn obloquy for mud water into have ventured to plunge than thanks for jewel procures a in like manner who undertakes cleansing of careless bachelor apartment will be liable to more abuse for dust raise than commendation for clearance effect let not be imagined however that consider competent to reform error abuse of society only must fain contribute humble quota towards so good aim if can gain public ear at must rather whisper few wholesome truth therein than much soft nonsense a story of agnes grey be accused of extravagant over colouring in very part be carefully copied from life with most scrupulous avoidance of exaggeration so in present work find censured for depicting con amore with morbid love of coarse if not of brutal scene will venture to say have not be more painful for most fastidious of critic to read than be for to describe may have gone too far in case will be careful not to trouble reader in same way again when have to do with vice vicious character maintain be better to depict a really be than a must wish to appear to represent bad thing in least offensive light be doubtless most agreeable course for writer of fiction to pursue be most honest safest be better to reveal snare pitfall of life to young thoughtless traveller to cover with branch flower oh reader if there be le of delicate concealment of factsthis whispering peace peace when there be peace there must be le of sin misery to young of sex who be left to wring bitter knowledge from experience must not be understood to suppose that proceeding of unhappy scapegrace with few profligate companion have here introduced be specimen of common practice of societythe case be extreme one a trusted none must fail to perceive know such character do exist if have warned one rash youth from following in step prevented one thoughtless girl from falling into very natural error of heroine book have not be written in vain at same time if honest reader will have derived more pain than pleasure from perusal have closed last volume with disagreeable impression on mind humbly crave pardon for such be far from intention will endeavour to do better time for love to give innocent pleasure yet be understood will not limit ambition to thisor even to producing perfect work of art time talent so spent must consider wasted misapplied such humble talent a god have given will endeavour to put to greatest use if be able to amuse will try to benefit too when feel duty to speak unpalatable truth with help of god will speak though be to prejudice of name to detriment of reader immediate pleasure a well a own one word more have done respecting author identity must have to be distinctly understood that acton bell be currer elli bell therefore let not fault be attributed to a to whether name be real fictitious can not greatly signify to who know only by work a little must think can matter whether writer so designated be man woman a one two of critic profess to have discovered take imputation in good part a compliment to just delineation of female character though be bound to attribute much of severity of censor to suspicion make effort to refute because in own mind be satisfied that if book be good one be so whatever sex of author may be novel be must be written for men woman to read be at loss to conceive how man must permit to write anything must be really disgraceful to woman why woman must be censured for writing anything must be proper becoming for man july nd chapter must go back with to autumn of father a

from bright blue eyeswell surprise really gave credit for having more sensethe poor child will be veriest milksop that ever be sopped only think what man will make of if persist in think very excellent plan interrupted mr graham with imperturbable gravity by mean hope to save from one degrading vice at least wish must render incentive to other equally innoxious in case by such mean said will never render be that constitutes virtue mr graham be circumstance of being able willing to resist temptation that of having temptation to resistis strong man that overcomes great obstacle performs surprising achievement though by dint of great muscular exertion at risk of subsequent fatigue sits in chair day with nothing to do more laborious than stirring fire carrying food to mouth if must have son to walk honourably through world must not attempt to clear stone from path teach to walk firmly over themnot insist upon leading by hand let learn to go alone will lead by hand mr markham till have strength to go alone will clear a many stone from path a can teach to avoid restor walk firmly over a sayfor when have done utmost in way of clearance there will still be plenty left to exercise agility steadiness circumspection will ever haveit be very well to talk about noble resistance trial of virtue for fiftyor five hundred men have yielded to temptation show one have have

must saycriminal not only be making fool of boy be despising gift of providence teaching to trample under foot then entered more fully into question explained at large folly impiety of such proceeding mother heard with profoundest reverence even mr wilson vouchsafed to rest tongue for moment listen in silence while complacently sipped gin water mr lawrence sat with elbow on table carelessly playing with half empty wine glass covertly smiling to dont think mr millward suggested when at length that gentleman paused in discourse that when child may be naturally prone to intemperanceby fault of parent ancestor for instancesome precaution be advisable now be generally believed that mr lawrence father have shortened day by intemperance precaution may be temperance sir be one thing abstinence have heard that with person be moderationis almost impossible if abstinence be evil have doubted one will deny excess be greater parent have entirely prohibited child from tasting intoxicating liquor parent authority can not last for ever child be naturally prone to hanker after forbidden thing child in such case must be likely to have strong curiosity to taste try effect of what have be so lauded enjoyed by others so strictly forbidden to himselfwhich curiosity must generally be gratified on first convenient opportunity restraint once broken serious consequence might ensue dont pretend to be judge of such matter seems to that plan of mr graham a describe mr markham extraordinary a may be be not without advantage for here see child be delivered at once from temptation have secret curiosity hankering desire be a well acquainted with tempting liquor a ever wish to be be thoroughly disgusted with without having suffered from effect be right sir have not proven to how wrong ishow contrary to scripture to reason to teach child to look with contempt disgust upon blessing of providence instead of to use aright may consider laudanum blessing of providence sir replied mr lawrence smiling yet will allow most of have better abstain from even in moderation added must not desire to follow out simile too closelyin witness whereof finish glass take hope mr lawrence said mother pushing bottle towards politely declined pushing chair little away from table leant back towards mei be seated trifle behind on sofa beside eliza millwardand carelessly asked if knew mr graham have met once

passage where under pretence of helping on with shawl fear must plead guilty to snatching kiss behind father back while be enveloping throat chin in fold of mighty comforter ala in turning round there be mother close beside consequence be that sooner be guest departed than be doomed to very serious remonstrance unpleasantly checked galloping course of spirit made disagreeable close to evening dear

chapter v be about close of month that yielding at length to urgent importunity of rose accompanied in visit to wildfell hall to surprise be ushered into room where first object met eye be painter easel with table beside covered with roll of canvas bottle of oil varnish palette brush paint c leaning against wall be several sketch in various stage of progression few finished paintingsmostly of landscape figure must make welcome to studio said mr graham there be fire in sitting room to day be rather too cold to show into place with empty grate disengaging couple of chair from artistical lumber usurped bid be seated resumed place beside easelnot facing exactly now then glancing at picture upon while conversed giving occasional touch with brush a if found impossible to wean attention entirely from occupation to fix upon guest be view of wildfell hall a seen at early morning from field below rising in dark relief against sky of clear silvery blue with few red streak on horizon faithfully drawn coloured very elegantly artistically handled see heart be in work mr graham observed must beg to go on with for if suffer presence to interrupt will be constrained to regard a unwelcome intruder oh replied throwing brush on to table a if startled into politeness be not so beset with visitor can readily spare few minute to few do favour with company have almost completed painting said approaching to observe more closely surveying with greater degree of admiration delight than cared to express few more touch in foreground will finish must think why have called fernley manor cumberland instead of wildfell hall shire asked alluding to name have traced in small character at bottom of canvas immediately be sensible of having committed act of impertinence in so doing for coloured hesitated after moment pause with kind of desperate frankness replied because have friendsacquaintances at world from whom desire present abode to be concealed a might see picture might possibly recognise style in spite of false initial have put in corner take precaution to give false name to place also in order to put on wrong scent if must attempt to trace out by then dont intend to keep picture said anxious to say anything to change subject can not afford to paint for own amusement mamma sends picture to london said arthur somebody sell for there sends money in looking round upon other piece remarked pretty sketch of lindenhope from top of hill view of old hall basking in sunny haze of quiet summer afternoon simple striking little picture of child brooding with look of silent deep sorrowful regret over handful of withered flower with glimpse of dark low hill autumnal field behind dull beclouded sky above see there be sad dearth of subject observed fair artist took old hall once on moonlight night suppose must take again on snowy winter day then again on dark cloudy evening for really have nothing else to paint have be told that have fine view of sea somewhere in neighbourhood be trueand be within walking distance yes if dont object to walking four milesor nearly solittle short of eight mile there backand over somewhat rough fatiguing road in what direction doe lie described situation a well a must be entering upon explanation of various road lane field to be traversed in order to reach going straight on turning to right left when checked with oh stop dont tell now will forget word of direction before require will not think about going till next spring then perhaps may trouble at present have winter before suddenly paused with suppressed exclamation started up from seat saying excuse one moment hurried from room shut door behind curious to see what have startled so looked towards windowfor eye have be carelessly fixed upon moment beforeand just beheld skirt of man coat vanishing behind large holly bush that stood between window porch mamma friend said arthur rose looked at other dont know what to make of at whispered rose child looked at in grave surprise straightway began to talk to on indifferent matter while amused with looking at picture there be one in obscure corner have not before observed be little child seated on grass with lap full of flower tiny feature large blue eye smiling through shock of light brown curl shaken over forehead a bent above treasure bore sufficient resemblance to of young gentleman before to proclaim portrait of arthur graham in early infancy in taking up to bring to light discovered behind with face to wall ventured to take up too be portrait of gentleman in full prime of youthful manhoodhandsome enough not badly executed if done by same hand a others be evidently year before for there be far more careful minuteness of detail le of freshness of colouring freedom of handling that delighted surprised in nevertheless surveyed with considerable interest there be certain individuality in feature expression stamped at once successful likeness bright blue eye regarded spectator with kind of lurking drolleryyou almost expected to see wink lipsa little too voluptuously fullseemed ready to break into smile warmly tinted cheek be embellished with luxuriant growth of reddish whisker while bright chestnut hair clustering in abundant wavy curl trespassed too much upon forehead seemed to intimate that owner thereof be prouder of beauty than intellectas perhaps have reason to be yet looked fool have not have portrait in hand two minute before fair artist returned only one come about picture said in apology for abrupt departure told to wait fear will be considered act of impertinence said to presume to look at picture that artist have turned to wall may ask be act of very great impertinence sir therefore beg will ask nothing about for curiosity will not be gratified replied attempting to cover tartness of rebuke with smile must see by flushed cheek kindling eye that be seriously annoyed be only going to ask if have painted said sulkily resigning picture into hand for without grain of ceremony took from quickly restoring to dark corner with face to wall placed other against a before then turned to laughed be in humour for jesting carelessly turned to window stood looking out upon desolate garden leaving to talk to rose for minute two then telling sister be time to go shook hand with little gentleman coolly bowed to lady moved towards door having bid adieu to rose mr graham presented hand to saying with soft voice by mean disagreeable smilelet not sun go down upon wrath mr markham im sorry offended by abruptness when lady condescends to apologise there be keeping one anger of course so parted good friend for once time squeezed hand with cordial not spiteful pressure chapter vi during next four month did not enter mr graham house mine still lady continued to talk about still acquaintance continued though slowly to advance a for talk paid little attention to when related to fair hermit mean only information derived from be that one fine frosty day have ventured to take little boy a far a vicarage that unfortunately nobody be at home miss millward nevertheless have sat long time by account have found good deal to say to other parted with mutual desire to meet again mary liked child fond mamma like who can duly appreciate treasure sometimes saw not only when came to church when be out on hill with son whether taking long purpose like walk oron special fine daysleisurely rambling over moor bleak pasture land surrounding old hall with book in hand son gambolling about on of occasion when caught sight of in solitary walk ride while following agricultural pursuit generally contrived to meet overtake for rather liked to see mr graham to talk to decidedly liked to talk to little companion whom when once ice of shyness be fairly broken found to be very amiable intelligent entertaining little fellow soon became excellent friendshow much to gratification of mamma can not undertake to say suspected at first that be desirous of throwing cold water on growing intimacyto quench a be kindling flame of friendshipbut discovering at length in spite of prejudice against be perfectly harmless even well intentioned that between dog son derived great deal of pleasure from acquaintance that must not otherwise have known ceased to object even welcomed coming with smile a for arthur must shout welcome from afar run to meet fifty yard from mother side if happened to be on horseback be sure to get canter gallop if there be one of draught horse within available distance be treated to steady ride upon served turn almost a well mother must always follow trudge beside himnot so much believe to ensure safe conduct a to see instilled objectionable notion into infant mind for be ever on watch never must allow to be taken out of sight what pleased best of be to see romping racing with sancho while walked by sidenot fear for love of company though sometimes deluded with idea so much a for delight took in seeing son thus happily engaged in enjoyment of active sport so invigorating to tender frame yet so seldom exercised for want of playmate suited to year perhaps pleasure be sweetened not little by fact of being with instead of with therefore incapable of doing injury directly indirectly designedly otherwise small thanks to for same sometimes believe really have little gratification in conversing with one bright february morning during twenty minute stroll along moor laid aside usual asperity reserve fairly entered into conversation with discoursing with so much eloquence depth of thought feeling on subject happily coinciding with own idea looking so beautiful withal went home enchanted on way morally started to find thinking that after must perhaps be better to spend one day with such woman than with eliza millward then figuratively blushed for inconstancy on entering parlour found eliza there with rose one else surprise be not altogether so agreeable a ought to have be chatted together long time found rather frivolous even little insipid compared with more mature earnest mr graham ala for human constancy however thought ought not to marry eliza since mother so strongly object to ought not to delude girl with idea intended to do so now if mood continue will have le difficulty in emancipating affection from soft yet unrelenting sway though mr graham might be equally objectionable may be permitted like doctor to cure greater evil by le for will not fall seriously in love with young widow think with methats certainbut if find little pleasure in society may surely be allowed to seek if star of divinity be bright enough to dim lustre of elizas so much better scarcely can think thereafter seldom suffered fine day to pas without paying visit to wildfell about time new acquaintance usually left hermitage so frequently be baulked in expectation of interview so changeable be in time of coming forth in place of resort so transient be occasional glimpse be able to obtain that felt half inclined to think took a much pain to avoid company a to seek hers be too disagreeable supposition to be entertained moment after must conveniently be dismissed one calm clear afternoon however in march a be superintending rolling of meadow land repairing of hedge in valley saw mr graham down by brook with sketch book in hand absorbed in exercise of favourite art while arthur be putting on time with constructing dam breakwater in willow stony stream be rather in want of amusement so rare opportunity be not to be neglected so leaving meadow hedge quickly repaired to spot not before sancho who immediately upon perceiving young friend scoured at full gallop intervening space pounced upon with impetuous mirth precipitated child almost into middle of beck happily stone preserved from serious wetting while smoothness prevented being too much hurt to laugh at untoward event mr graham be studying distinctive character of different variety of tree in winter nakedness copying with spirited though delicate various ramification did not talk much stood watched progress of pencil be pleasure to behold so dexterously guided by fair graceful finger ere long dexterity became impaired began to hesitate to tremble slightly make false stroke then suddenly came to pause while owner laughingly raised face to mine told that sketch did not profit by superintendence then said ill talk to arthur till done must like to have ride mr markham if mamma will let said child what on boy think there horse in field replied pointing to where strong black mare be pulling roller arthur too far objected mother promised to bring safe back after turn two up down meadow when looked at eager face smiled let go be first time have even allowed to take so much a field length from side illustration enthroned upon monstrous steed solemnly proceeding up down wide steep field looked very incarnation of quiet gleeful satisfaction delight rolling however be soon completed when dismounted gallant horseman restored to mother seemed rather displeased at keeping so long have shut up sketch book be probably for minute impatiently waiting return be now high time to go home said must have bid good evening be not going to leave yet accompanied half way up hill became more sociable be beginning to be very happy on coming within sight of grim old hall stood still turned towards while spoke a if expecting must go further that conversation must end here must now take leave departas indeed be time to do for clear cold eve be fast declining sun have set gibbous

remember will have saidbut punish presumption by withdrawing friendship entirely from meor expect to atone for by being more distant than before said extending hand to take leave for be too much excited to remain well then let be a be replied frankly placing hand in mine while held there have much difficulty to refrain from pressing to lipsbut must be suicidal madness have be bold enough already premature offering have well nigh given death blow to hope be with agitated burning heart brain hurried homewards regardless of scorching noonday sunforgetful of everything have just

serious cogitation resolve chapter ix though affection might now be said to be fairly weaned from eliza millward did not yet entirely relinquish visit to vicarage because wanted a be to let down easy without raising much sorrow incurring much resentmentor making talk of parish besides if have wholly kept away vicar who looked upon visit a paid chiefly if not entirely to must have felt decidedly affronted by neglect when called there day after interview with mr graham happened to be from homea circumstance by mean so agreeable to now a have be on former occasion miss millward be there be true of course must be little better than nonentity however resolved to make visit short one to talk to eliza in brotherly friendly sort of way such a long acquaintance might warrant in assuming thought must neither give offence serve to encourage false hope be never custom to talk about mr graham to one else have not be seated three minute before brought that lady on to carpet in rather remarkable manner oh mr markham said with shocked expression voice subdued almost to whisper what do think of shocking report about mr grahamcan encourage to disbelieve what report ah now know slily smiled shook head know nothing about what in world do mean eliza oh dont ask mei cant explain took up cambric handkerchief have be beautifying with deep lace border began to be very busy what be miss millward what doe mean said appealing to sister who seemed to be absorbed in hemming of large coarse sheet dont know replied idle slander somebody have be inventing suppose never heard till eliza told other daybut if parish dinned in ear shouldnt believe word of iti know mr graham too well quite right miss millwardand so do iwhatever may be well observed eliza with gentle sigh well to have comfortable assurance regarding worth of love only wish may not find confidence misplaced raised face gave such look of sorrowful tenderness a might have melted heart within eye there lurked something did not like wondered how ever must have admired themher sister honest face small grey optic appeared far more agreeable be out of temper with eliza at moment for insinuation against mr graham be false be certain whether knew not said nothing more on subject however at time little on other for finding must not well recover equanimity presently rose took leave excusing under plea of business at farm to farm went not troubling mind one whit about possible truth of mysterious report only wondering what be by whom originated on what foundation raised how must most effectually be silenced disproved few day after have of quiet little party to usual company of friend neighbour have be invited mr graham among number must not now absent under plea of dark evening inclement weather greatly to relief came without must have found whole affair intolerable bore moment of arrival brought new life to house though might not neglect other guest for expect to engross much of attention conversation to myself alone anticipated evening of common enjoyment mr lawrence came too did not arrive till time after rest be assembled be curious to see how must comport to mr graham slight bow be that passed between on entrance having politely greeted other member of company seated quite aloof from young widow between mother rose did ever see such art whispered eliza who be nearest neighbour must not say be perfect stranger almost what then what then why cant pretend to be ignorant ignorant of what demanded so sharply that started replied oh hush dont speak so loud well tell then answered in lower tone what be mean hate enigma well know dont vouch for truth of itindeed far from itbut havent heard ive heard nothing except from must be wilfully deaf then for anyone will tell that will only anger by repeating see so have better hold tongue closed lip folded hand before with air of injured meekness if have wished not to anger must have held tongue from beginning else spoken out plainly honestly have to say turned aside face pulled out handkerchief rose went to window where stood for time evidently dissolved in tear be astounded provoked ashamednot so much of harshness a for childish weakness however one seemed to notice shortly after be summoned to tea table in part be customary to sit to table at tea time on occasion make meal of for dined early on taking seat have rose on one side of empty chair on other may sit by said soft voice at elbow if like be reply eliza slipped into vacant chair then looking up in face with half sad half playful smile whisperedyoure so stern gilbert handed down tea with slightly contemptuous smile said nothing for have nothing to say what have done to offend said more plaintively wish knew come take tea eliza dont be foolish responded handing sugar cream just then there arose slight commotion on other side of occasioned by miss wilson coming to negotiate exchange of seat with rose will be so good a to exchange place with miss markham said for dont like to sit by mr graham if mamma think proper to invite such person to house can not object to daughter keeping company with latter clause be added in sort of soliloquy when rose be gone be not polite enough to let pas will be so good a to tell what mean miss wilson said question startled little not much why mr markham replied coolly having quickly recovered possession surprise rather that mr markham must invite person a mr graham to house perhaps be not aware that lady character be considered scarcely respectable be not be therefore must oblige by explaining meaning little further be scarcely time place for such explanation think can hardly be so ignorant a pretendyou must know a well a do think do perhaps little better therefore if will inform what have heard imagined against will perhaps be able to set right can tell then who be husband if ever have indignation kept silent at time place must not trust to answer have never observed said eliza what striking likeness there be between child of hers whom demanded miss wilson with air of cold keen severity eliza be startled timidly spoken suggestion have be intended for ear alone oh beg pardon pleaded may be mistakenperhaps be mistaken accompanied word with sly glance of derision directed to from corner of disingenuous eye there need to ask pardon replied friend see one here at resembles child except mother when hear ill natured report miss eliza will thank be think will do well to refrain from repeating presume person allude to be mr lawrence think can assure that suspicion in respect be utterly misplaced if have particular connection with lady at one have right to assert at least have what can not be said of others sufficient sense of propriety to withhold from acknowledging anything more than bowing acquaintance in presence of respectable person be evidently surprised annoyed to find here go cried fergus who sat on other side of eliza be only individual who shared that side of table with go like brick mind dont leave one stone upon miss wilson drew up with look of freezing scorn said nothing eliza must have replied interrupted by saying a calmly a must though in tone betrayed doubt little of what felt withinwe have have enough of subject if can only speak to slander better let hold tongue think youd better observed fergus so doe good parson have be addressing company in richest vein while eyeing from time to time with look of stern distaste while sat there irreverently whispering muttering together once paused in middle of story sermon dont know fixed eye upon gilbert a much a to say when mr markham have done flirting with two lady will proceed what more be said at tea table can not tell how found patience to sit till meal be over remember however swallowed with difficulty remainder of tea be in cup ate nothing that first thing did be to stare at arthur graham who sat beside mother on opposite side of table second to stare at mr lawrence who sat below first struck that there be likeness on further contemplation concluded be only in imagination be true have more delicate feature smaller bone than commonly fall to lot of individual of rougher sex lawrence complexion be pale clear arthur delicately fair arthur tiny somewhat snubby nose must never become so long straight a mr lawrence outline of face though not full enough to be round too finely converging to small dimpled chin to be square must never be drawn out to long oval of others while child hair be evidently of lighter warmer tint than elder gentleman have ever be large clear blue eye though prematurely serious at time be utterly dissimilar to shy hazel eye of mr lawrence whence sensitive soul looked so distrustfully forth a ever ready to retire within from offence of too rude too uncongenial world wretch be to harbour detestable idea for moment did not know mr graham have not seen conversed with time after time be not certain that in intellect in purity elevation of soul be immeasurably superior to of detractor that be in fact noblest most adorable of sex have ever beheld even imagined to exist yes must say with mary millward sensible girl a be that if parish ay world must din horrible lie in ear must not believe for knew better than meantime brain be on fire with indignation heart seemed ready to burst from prison with conflicting passion regarded two fair neighbour with feeling of abhorrence loathing scarcely endeavoured to conceal be rallied from several quarter for abstraction ungallant neglect of lady cared little for cared about besides one grand subject of thought be to see cup travel up to tea tray not come down again thought mr millward never must cease telling that be tea drinker that be highly injurious to keep loading stomach with slop to exclusion of more wholesome sustenance so give time to finish fourth cup at length be over rose left table guest without word of apologyi must endure company no longer rushed out to cool brain in balmy evening air to compose

meddling old woman helen ive something to say to before go what be no not nowi dont know yet precisely what be how to say replied with more truth than wisdom then fearing lest must turn out of house began talking about indifferent matter in order to gain time meanwhile rachel came in to kindle fire be soon effected by thrusting red hot poker between bar of grate where fuel be already disposed for ignition honoured with of hard inhospitable look in departing little moved thereby went on talking setting chair for mr graham on one side of hearth one for on other ventured to sit down though half

nursery maid under direction to engaging one else besides save money since have made acquaintance with arthur affair have learnt to regard that a trifling recommendation for by own desire nearly whole of income of fortune be devoted for year to come to paying off of debt money contrives to squander away in london be incomprehensible to return to mr hargrave be standing with rachel beside water

have remonstrated with again again have frequently expressed surprise at conduct reminded of duty privilegesbut to purpose only enough mr hargrave ought to be aware that husband fault may be can only aggravate evil for to hear from stranger lip be then stranger said in sorrowful tone be nearest neighbour son godfather husband friend may not be yours also intimate acquaintance must precede real

moment care laughing at gleeful laughter delighting with delightwhen shadow suddenly eclipsed little space of sunshine on grass before looking up beheld walter hargrave standing gazing upon excuse mr huntingdon said be spell bound have power to come forward interrupt to withdraw from contemplation of such scene how vigorous little godson grows how merry be morning approached child stooped to take hand on seeing that caress be likely to produce tear lamentation instead of reciprocation of friendly demonstration prudently drew back what pleasure comfort little creature must be to mr huntingdon

for clear melodious voice whose tone thrilled through nerve exclaimed oh aunt here mr markham arthur friend stop richard there be such evidence of joyous though suppressed excitement in utterance of few wordsespecially that tremulous oh auntthat threw almost off guard carriage stopped immediately looked up met eye of pale grave elderly lady surveying from open window bowed so did then withdrew head while arthur screamed to footman to let out before functionary must descend from box hand be silently put forth from carriage window knew that hand though black glove concealed delicate whiteness

marriage observed arthur reading look with child mingled simplicity quickness of observation mamma looked grave mr maxwell shook head aunt maxwell be never going to leave off hers persisted naughty boy when saw that pertness be seriously displeasing painful to aunt went silently put arm round neck kissed cheek withdrew to recess of one of great bay window where quietly amused with dog while mr maxwell gravely discussed with interesting topic of weather season road considered presence very useful a check upon natural impulsesan antidote to emotion of tumultuous excitement must otherwise have carried away against reason will just then felt restraint almost intolerable have greatest difficulty in forcing to attend to remark answer with ordinary politeness for be sensible that helen be
