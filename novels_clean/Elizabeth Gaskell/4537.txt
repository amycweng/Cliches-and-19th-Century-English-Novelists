at sea beupposed to have perished in greenland sea behipwrecked in baltic 'drowned off coast of iceland ' there be strange sensation a if cold sea wind must bring with dim phantom of lost sailor who have died far from home from hallowed ground where father lay flight of step up to churchyard ended in small flat space on wooden seat be placed on particular sunday seat be filled by aged people breathless with unusual exertion of climbing must see church stair a be called from nearly part of town figure of numerous climber diminished by distance looked like busy ant hill long before bell

of home came in unusual number lack of pattern for sylvia thought be far otherwise more suitably occupied unwonted sternness solemnity visible on countenance of whom met awed affected did not speak in reply to molly remark on dress appearance of who struck felt a if speech jarred on annoyed almost to irritation yet molly have come way to monkshaven church in service deserved forbearance accordingly two mounted step alongside of many people few word be exchanged even at breathing place so often little centre of gossip looking over sea there be not sail to be seen seemed bared of life a if to be

seafaring idea prevalent through place have launched out into little originality there be wood work church have be stripped of most probably when neighbouring monastery have be destroyed there be large square pew lined with green baize with name of family of most flourishing ship owner painted white on door there be pew not so large not lined at for farmer shopkeeper of parish numerous heavy oaken bench by united effort of several men might be brought within earshot of pulpit be being removed into most convenient situation when molly sylvia entered church after two three whispered sentence took seat on one of vicar of monkshaven be kindly peaceable old man hating strife troubled water above everything be vehement tory in theory a became cloth in day have two bugbear to fear french dissenter be difficult to say of have worst opinion most intense dread perhaps hated dissenter most because came nearer in contact with than french besides french have excuse of being papist while dissenter might have belonged to church of england if have not be utterly depraved yet in practice dr wilson did not object to dine with mr fishburn who be personal friend follower of wesley then a doctor must say 'wesley be oxford man that make gentleman be ordained minister of church of england so grace can never depart from ' know what excuse must have alleged for sending vegetable to old ralph thompson rabid independent who have be given to abusing church vicar from dissenting pulpit a long a ever must mount stair however that inconsistency between dr wilson theory practice be not generally known in monkshaven so have nothing to do with dr wilson have have very difficult part to play still more difficult sermon to write during last week darley who have be killed be son of vicar gardener dr wilson sympathy a man have be all on bereaved father side then have received a oldest magistrate in neighbourhood letter from captain of aurora explanatory exculpatory darley have be resisting order of officer in majesty service what must become of due subordination loyalty interest of service chance of beating confounded french if such conduct a darley be to be encouraged poor darley be past evil effect of human encouragement now so vicar mumbled hastily over sermon on text 'in midst of life be in death ' might have done a well for baby cut off in convulsion fit a for strong man shot down with eager blood hot within by men a hot blooded a once when old doctor eye caught up turned straining gaze of father darley seeking with soul to find grain of holy comfort in chaff of word conscience smote have nothing to say must calm anger revenge with spiritual power breath of comforter to soothe repining into resignation again discord between law of man law of christ stood before gave up attempt to do more than be doing a beyond power though hearer went away a full of anger a have entered church with dull feeling of disappointment a to what have got there yet one felt anything kindly towards old vicar simple happy life led amongst for forty year open to men in daily course sweet tempered cordial way practical kindness made beloved by thought much cared much for admiration of talent respect for office be respect thought of be conceded to from old traditional hereditary association in looking back to last century appears curious to see how little ancestor have power of putting two thing together perceiving discord harmony thus produced be because be farther off from time have consequently greater range of vision will descendant have wonder about such a have about inconsistency of forefather surprise at blindness that perceive that holding such such opinion course of action must be so so that logical consequence of particular opinion must be conviction at present hold in abhorrence seems puzzling to look back on men such a vicar who almost held doctrine that king must do wrong yet be ever ready to talk of glorious revolution to abuse stuart for having entertained same doctrine tried to put in practice such discrepancy ran through good men life in day be well for that live at present time when everybody be logical consistent little discussion must be taken in place of dr wilson sermon of one must remember more than text hour after be delivered even doctor have recollection of word have uttered swept out of mind a having doffed

large family mother daughter hardly spoke at when sat down at last cheerful click of knitting needle made pleasant home sound in occasional snatch of slumber overcame mother sylvia must hear long rushing boom of wave down below rock for haytersbank gulley allowed sullen roar to come up so far inland might have be about eight o'clock though from monotonous course of evening seemed much later when sylvia heard father heavy step cranching down pebbly path more unusual heard voice talking to companion curious to see who must be with lively instinctive advance towards event might break monotony have begun to find somewhat dull sprang up to open door glance into gray darkness outside made suddenly timid drew back behind door a opened wide to admit father kinraid daniel robson came in

to be that daily concern of buying selling eating drinking whatsoever do be more tested by real practical standard of religion than be in day of grandfather sylvia mother be in advance of age listened with admiration to ingenious device acted a well a spoken lie be talked about a fine spirited thing yet if sylvia have attempted one tithe of deceit in day life must have half broken mother heart when

increased by tax upon a to make expensive sometimes unattainable luxury to working man government did more to demoralise popular sense of rectitude uprightness than heap of sermon must undo same

settled that must not be settled until saw molly again so by strong gulping effort resolutely determined to think more about only about marvel have told might think little about when sat at night spinning in silence by household fire when went out in gloaming to call cattle home to be milked sauntered back behind patient slow gaited creature at time on future summer day when a in past took

before turned again homeward bound chapter x refractory pupil sylvia be still full of specksioneer story when hepburn came up to give next lesson prospect of little sensible commendation for writing whole page full of flourishing 'abednegos have lost slight charm have ever possessed be much more inclined to try elicit sympathy in interest in peril adventure of northern sea than to bend control mind to right formation of letter unwisely enough endeavoured to repeat one of narrative that have heard from kinraid when found that hepburn if indeed did not look upon whole a silly invention considered only a interruption to real business in hand to must try to listen a patiently a must in hope of sylvia applying diligently to copy book when have cleared mind contracted pretty lip a if to

charred wood on aunt dresser have asked aunt leave before beginning what sylvia called 'dirty work ' by by even became little interested in starting from great black spot called monkshaven in shaping of land sea around one centre sylvia held round chin in palm of hand supporting elbow on dresser looking down at progress of rough drawing in general now then glancing up at with sudden inquiry all along be not so much absorbed in teaching a to be unconscious of sweet proximity be in best mood towards neither mutinous saucy be striving with might to retain interest speaking better than ever have done before such brightness did love call forth understanding what must care to hear to know when in middle of attempt at explaining cause of long polar day of have heard from childhood felt that attention be no longer that discord have come in between mind that have passed out of power certainty of intuition lasted for instant have time to wonder to speculate a to what have affected so adversely to wish before door opened kinraid came in then hepburn knew that must have heard coming footstep recognized angrily stiffened up into coldness of demeanour almost to surprise sylvia greeting to new comer be a cold a own stood rather behind so perhaps did not see hand kinraid stretched out towards for did not place own little palm in a have done to philip hour ago hardly spoke began to pore over rough black map a if seized with strong geographical curiosity determined to impress philip lesson deep on memory still philip be dismayed by seeing warm welcome kinraid received from master of house who came in from back premise almost at same time a specksioneer entered at front hepburn be uneasy too at finding kinraid take seat by fireside like one accustomed to way of house pipe be soon produced philip disliked smoking possibly kinraid did so too took pipe at rate lighted though hardly used at kept talking to farmer robson on sea affair have conversation pretty much to philip sat gloomily by sylvia aunt be silent old robson smoked long clay pipe from time to time taking out of mouth to spit into bright copper spittoon to shake white ash out of bowl before replaced must give short laugh of relishing interest in kinraid conversation now then put in remark sylvia perched sideways on end of dresser made pretence to sew philip must see how often paused in work to listen by by aunt spoke to kept up little side conversation more because bell robson felt that nephew own flesh blood be put out than for special interest of felt in what be saying perhaps also of disliked showing that have great faith in story kinraid be telling mr robson at rate knew so little a to be afraid of believing too much philip be sitting on side of fire be nearest to window to sylvia opposite to specksioneer at length turned to cousin said in low voice suppose ca go on with spell at geography till that fellow gone ' colour came into sylvia cheek at word fellow ' only replied with careless air be one a think enough be a good a feast have have enough of geography one night thank kindly same philip took refuge in offended silence be maliciously pleased when aunt made so much noise with preparation for supper a quite to prevent sound of sailor word from reaching sylvia ear saw that be glad to perceive that effort to reach remainder of story be baulked nettled determined not to let have malicious triumph still more to put stop to attempt at private conversation began to sing to herself a sat at work till suddenly seized with desire to help mother dexterously slipped down from seat passed hepburn be on knee toasting cake right in front of fire just close to father kinraid now noise hepburn have so rejoiced in proved foe must not hear little merry speech darted backwards forward a specksioneer tried to take toasting fork out of sylvia hand 'how come that sailor chap here ' asked hepburn of aunt none fit to be where sylvia be 'nay dunnot know said 'the corneys made acquaint first master be quite fain of company 'and do like too aunt ' asked hepburn almost wistfully have followed mr robson into dairy on pretence of helping `` m none

what must did not recover temper evening be uncomfortable put out not enjoying yet must not go be determined to assert greater intimacy in house by outstaying kinraid at length latter got up to go before went must need bend over sylvia say something to in so low tone philip must not hear seized with sudden fit of diligence never looked up from sewing only nodded head by way of reply at last took departure after many little delay many quick return to suspicious philip seemed only pretence for taking stolen glance at sylvia a soon a be decidedly gone folded up work declared that be so much tired that must go to bed there then mother too have be dozing for last half hour be only too glad to see sign that might betake to natural place of slumber glass philip ' said farmer robson hepburn refused offer rather abruptly drew near to sylvia instead wanted to make speak to saw that wished to avoid took up readiest pretext be unwise one a proved for deprived of chance of occasionally obtaining undivided attention think care much for learning geography sylvie ' 'not much to night ' said making pretence to yawn yet looking timidly up at countenance of displeasure 'nor at time ' said with growing anger 'nor for kind of learning did bring book last time came meaning to teach many thing now will just trouble for book put on yon shelf by bible have mind that must bring to that at rate must have pleasure of receiving out of hand sylvia did not reply went took down book with languid indifferent air 'and so wo learn more geography ' said hepburn something in tone struck looked up in face there be mark of stern offence upon countenance yet in there be also air of wistful regret sadness that touched 'yo be niver angry with philip sooner than vex yo ' will try learn only be just stupid mun be such trouble to ' hepburn must fain have snatched at half proposal that lesson must be continued be too stubborn proud to say anything turned away from sweet pleading face without word to wrap up book in piece of paper knew that be standing quite still by side though made a if did not perceive when have done abruptly wished 'good night ' took leave there be tear in sylvia eye although feeling in heart be rather one of relief have made fair offer have be treated with silent contempt few day afterwards father came in from monkshaven market dropped out among other piece of news that have met kinraid who be bound for own home at cullercoats have desired respect to mr robson daughter have bid robson say that must have come up to haytersbank to wish good by that a be pressed for time hoped must excuse robson did not think while to give long message of mere politeness indeed a did not relate to business be only sent to woman robson forgot about pretty nearly a soon a be uttered so sylvia went about fretting for one two day at hero apparent carelessness of who have at rate treated more like friend than acquaintance of only few week standing then anger quenching incipient regard went about daily business pretty much a though have never be have gone away out of sight into thick mist of unseen life from have emerged gone away without word might never see again still there be chance of seeing when came to marry molly corney perhaps must be bridesmaid then what pleasant merry time wedding day must be corneys be such kind people in family there never seemed to be check restraint by own mother hedged round then there came overwhelming self reproaching burst of love for 'own mother ' humiliation before slightest wish a penance for moment unspoken treason thus sylvia be led to request cousin philip to resume lesson in so meek manner that slowly graciously acceded to request be yearning to fulfil time during ensuing winter went on in monotonous regularity at haytersbank farm for many week hepburn came went thought sylvia wonderfully improved in docility sobriety perhaps also noticed improvement in appearance for be at age when girl change rapidly generally for better sylvia shot up into tall young woman eye deepened in colour face increased in expression sort of consciousness of unusual good look gave slight tinge of coquettish shyness with few stranger whom ever saw philip hailed interest in geography a sign of improvement have brought back book of map to farm there sat on many evening teaching cousin who have strange fancy respecting place about wished to learn be coolly indifferent to very existence of other town country sea far more famous in story be occasionally wilful at time very contemptuous a to superior knowledge of instructor in spite of philip went regularly on appointed evening to haytersbank through keen black east wind driving snow slushing thaw for liked dearly to sit little behind with arm on back of chair stooping over outspread map with eye must have seen good deal fixed on one spot in map not northumberland where kinraid be spending winter wild northern sea about have told such wonder one day towards spring saw molly corney coming towards farm companion have not met for many week for molly have be from home visiting relation in north sylvia opened door stood smiling shivering on threshold glad to

leaving ironing coming to door though mother tried to look a if thought nonsense must hardly keep down smile shone out of eye a put hand on sylvia shoulder with fond sense of proprietorship in what be being praised 'oh be ' persisted molly be grown quite beauty sin ' saw if tell so men will ' 'be quiet wi ' thee ' said sylvia more than half offended turning away in huff at open barefaced admiration

have thought of kind saw with quick eye not unaccustomed to woman that coming so unexpectedly have fluttered sylvia anxious to make quite at ease with not unwilling to conciliate kester addressed next speech to with same kind of air of interest in old man pursuit that young man of different class sometimes put on when talking to chaperone of pretty girl in ball room 'that be handsome beast yo have

how old master have then appeared to have taken to at time sylvia have seemed to kester too little removed from child to have art part in kinraid visit now however case be different kester in sphere

old fashioned machinery kinraid stood between kester door into dairy through sylvia have vanished with milk half wished to conciliate kester by helping seemed also attracted by force annihilated will to follow wherever went kester read mind alone let alone said 'pigs ' vittle take noan such dainty carryin a milk may set down ' niver spill drop be noan fit for t ' serve swine yo ' other mester

long since philip have tasted freshness of early air on shore in country a employment at shop detained in monkshaven till evening a turned down quay staithes on north side of river towards shore met fresh sea breeze blowing right in face be impossible not to feel bright elastic with knapsack slung over shoulder be prepared for good stretch towards hartlepool whence coach must take to newcastle before night for seven eight mile level sand be a short far more agreeable road than up down land way philip walked on pretty briskly unconsciously enjoying sunny landscape before crisp curling wave rushing almost up to foot on right hand then swishing back over fine small pebble into great swelling sea to left be cliff rising one behind having deep gully here there between with long green slope upward from land then sudden fall of brown red soil rock deepening to yet greater richness of colour at base towards blue ocean before loud monotonous murmur of advancing receding water lulled into dreaminess sunny look of everything tinged day dream with hope so trudged merrily over first mile so not obstacle to measured pace on hard level pavement not creature to be seen since have left little gathering of bare legged urchin dabbling in sea pool near monkshaven care of land be shut out by glorious barrier of rock before there be great mass have be detached by action of weather lay half embedded in sand draperied over by heavy pendent olive green seaweed wave be nearer at point advancing sea came up with mighty distant length of roar here there smooth swell be lashed by fret against unseen rock into white breaker otherwise wave came up from german ocean upon english shore with long steady roll might have taken first impetus far away in haunt of sea serpent on coast of 'norroway over foam ' air be soft a may right overhead sky be blue deadened into gray near sea line flock of seagull hovered about edge of wave slowly rising turning white under plumage to glimmer in sunlight a philip approached whole scene be so peaceful so soothing that dispelled care fear too well founded in fact have weighed down on heart during dark hour of past night there be haytersbank gully opening down green entrance among warm brown base of cliff below in sheltered brushwood among last year withered leaf primrose might be found half thought of gathering sylvia posy of rushing up to farm to make little farewell peace offering on looking at watch put thought of such action out of head be above hour later than have supposed must make haste on to hartlepool just a be approaching gully man came dashing down ran out way upon sand with very force of descent then turned to left took direction of hartlepool hundred yard so in advance of philip never stayed to look round went swiftly steadily on way by peculiar lurch in walk by everything philip knew be specksioneer kinraid now road up haytersbank gully led to farm nowhere else still one wishing to descend to shore might do so by first going up to robsons house skirting wall till came to little slender path down to shore by farm by very house door must of necessity pas philip slackened pace keeping under shadow of rock by by kinraid walking on sunlight open sand turned round looked long earnestly towards haytersbank gully hepburn paused when paused a intently a looked at object above so intently did hepburn look at need to ascertain by sight towards whom look thought be directed took off hat waved touching one part of a if with particular meaning when turned away at last hepburn heaved heavy sigh crept yet more into cold dank shadow of cliff step be now heavy task sad heart tired weary after while climbed up few foot so a to mingle form yet more completely with stone rock around stumbling over uneven often jagged point slipping on sea weed plunging into little pool of water left by ebbing tide in natural basin yet kept eye fixed a if in fascination on kinraid made way almost alongside of last hour have pinched hepburn feature into something of wan haggardness must wear when must first be lying still for ever now two men be drawing near creek about eight mile from monkshaven creek be formed by beck small stream came flowing down from moor took way to sea between widening rock melting of snow running of flooded water spring above made beck in early spring time deep wide hepburn knew that here must take path leading inland to narrow foot bridge about quarter of mile up stream indeed from point owing to jutting out of rock land path be shortest way lay by water side at angle right below cliff to hepburn step be leading knew that on long level field path might easily be seen by one following nay if followed one at short distance for be full of turning resolved late a be to sit down for while till kinraid be far enough in advance for to escape being seen came up to last rock behind must be concealed seven eight foot above stream stood looked cautiously for specksioneer up by rushing stream looked then right below 'it be god providence ' murmured 'it be god providence ' crouched down where have be standing covered face with hand tried to deafen a well a to blind that might neither hear see anything of coming event of inhabitant of monkshaven at day well understood betokening sign kinraid have taken larger angle of sand before turning up towards bridge came along now nearing rock by time be sufficiently buoyant to whistle to steeled philip heart to what be coming to hear rival whistling 'weel may keel row ' so soon after parting with instant kinraid turned corner of cliff ambush be upon four man of war men sprang on strove to pinion 'in king name ' cried with rough triumphant jeer boat be moored not dozen yard above be sent by tender of frigate lying off hartlepool for fresh water tender be at anchor just beyond jutting rock in face knew that fisherman be in habit of going to from net by side of creek prize a active strong evidently superior sailor be what have not hoped for endeavour to secure be in proportion to value of prize although taken by surprise attacked by so many kinraid did not lose wit wrenched free cry out loud 'avast be protected whaler claim

difficult to foretell result yet kinraid made desperate effort to free wasted breath in word fought a men said 'like very devil ' hepburn heard loud pant of breath great thud dull struggle of limb on sand growling curse of who thought to have managed affair more easily sudden cry of one wounded not kinraid knew kinraid must have borne pain in silence at moment wrestling swearing infuriated strife then strange silence hepburn sickened at heart be then rival dead have left bright world lost life love for instant hepburn felt guilty of death said to have never wished dead yet in struggle have kept aloof now might be too late for ever philip must not bear suspense looked stealthily round corner of rock behind have be hidden saw that have overpowered kinraid too exhausted to speak be binding hand foot to carry to boat kinraid lay a still a hedgehog rolled when pushed suffered to be dragged without resistance motion strong colour brought into face while fighting be gone now countenance be

going on be watchful vivid fierce a of wild cat brought to bay seeking in desperate quickened brain for mode of escape not yet visible in probability never to become visible to hopeless creature in supreme agony without motion of head be perceiving taking in everything while lay bound at bottom of boat sailor sat by side who have be hurt by blow from man held head in hand moaning now then revenged by kick at prostrate specksioneer till even comrade stopped cursing swearing at prisoner for trouble have given to cry shame on comrade kinraid never spoke shrank from outstretched foot one of captor with successful insolence of victory ventured to jeer on supposed reason for vehement hopeless resistance might have said yet more insolent thing kick might have hit harder kinraid did not hear heed soul be beating against bar of inflexible circumstance reviewing in one terrible instant of time what have be what might have be be yet while thought thus stabbed be still mechanically looking out for chance moved head little so a to turn towards haytersbank where sylvia must be quickly if sadly going about simple daily work then quick eye caught hepburn face blanched with excitement rather than fear watching eagerly from behind rock where have sat breathless during affray impressment of rival here lad ' shouted specksioneer a soon a saw philip heaving writhing body while with so much vigour that sailor started away from work be engaged in about boat held down once more a if afraid must break strong rope that held like withe of green flax bound man have such notion in head mighty wish be to call hepburn near that might send message by to sylvia 'come here hepburn ' cried again falling back time so weak exhausted that man of war men became sympathetic

venture on capture a well a specksioneer might be done thought even though there be powerful captive aboard boat to manage too running eye over philip figure decided that tall stooping fellow be never cut out for sailor that must get small thanks if captured to pay for possible risk of losing other else mere fact of being landsman be of a little consequence to press gang a protecting paper kinraid

not speak for minute two sailor who have begun to take into favour be agog with curiosity to hear message to sweetheart believed be going to send hepburn perception quickened with vehement agitation of soul be aware of feeling of theirs increased rage against kinraid who have exposed idea of sylvia to be subject of ribald whisper specksioneer cared little what others said thought about maiden whom yet saw before closed eyelid a stood watching from haytersbank gully waving hand handkerchief in one passionate farewell do yo want wi ' asked hepburn at last in gloomy tone if must have helped must have kept silence till kinraid spoke first must no longer endure sailor nudge wink jest among 'tell sylvia ' said kinraid 'there be smart name for sweetheart exclaimed one of men kinraid went

sylvia at very time when carter have stung into fresh anger by allusion to possibility of specksioneer 'running after other girl for for instant hepburn have be touched by contrast of circumstance kinraid hour two ago kinraid banished man for in day impressed sailor might linger out year on foreign station far from loved who time remained ignorant of cruel fate hepburn began to wonder what have said how much of promise have made to deliver last passionate word of kinraid must not recollect how much how little have said knew have spoken hoarsely low almost at same time a carter have uttered loud joke doubted if kinraid have caught word then dread inner creature who lurks in of heart arose said 'it be a well promise given be fetter to giver promise be not given when have not be received ' at sudden impulse turned again towards shore when have crossed bridge almost ran towards verge of land then threw down on soft fine turf grew on margin of cliff overhanging sea commanding extent of

stiffened limb shouldered knapsack prepared to walk on to hartlepool a swiftly a must chapter xix important mission philip be too late for coach have hoped to go by there be that left at night reached newcastle in forenoon so that by loss of night sleep might overtake lost time restless miserable must not stop in hartlepool longer than to get hasty food at inn from coach started acquainted with name of town through must pas inn at must stop left word that coachman be to be on look out for pick up at one of place be thoroughly worn out before happened too much tired to gain sleep in coach when reached newcastle went to engage passage in next london bound smack then directed step to robinson in side to make inquiry must think of respecting plough uncle wanted to know about so be pretty late in afternoon indeed almost evening before arrived at small inn on quay side where intended to sleep be rough kind of place frequented principally by sailor have be recommended to by daniel robson who have known well in former day accommodation in be however clean homely people keeping be respectable enough in way still hepburn be rather repelled by appearance of sailor who sate drinking in bar asked in low voice if there be not room woman stared in surprise only shook head hepburn went to separate table away from roaring fire on cold march evening be great attraction called for food drink then seeing that other men be eyeing with sociable idea of speaking to asked for pen ink paper with intention of defeating purpose by pre occupation on part when paper came new pen unused thickened ink hesitated long before began to write at last slowly put down word honoured uncle ' there be pause meal be brought hastily swallowed even while be eating kept occasionally touching up letter of word when have drunk glass of ale began again to write fluently time for be giving account of plough then came long stop be weighing in own mind what must say about kinraid once thought for second of writing to sylvia telling how much might treasure up lover word like grain of gold while be lighter than dust in meaning to philip mind word such a specksioneer used a counter to beguile lead astray silly woman be for to prove constancy by action chance of giving such proof be infinitesimal in philip estimation must latter mention bare fact of kinraid impressment to robson must have be natural course of thing remembering that last time philip have seen either be in other company twenty time put pen to paper with intention of relating briefly event have befallen kinraid a often stopped a though first word must be irrevocable while thus sate pen in hand thinking wiser than conscience looking on beyond next step bade take into indefinite future caught fragment of sailor talk at other end of room made listen to word be speaking of very kinraid thought of whom filled own mind like actual presence in rough careless way spoke of specksioneer with admiration enough for power a sailor harpooner from that passed on to jesting mention of power amongst woman one two girl name be spoken of in connection with hepburn silently added annie coulson sylvia robson to list cheek turned paler a did so long after have done speaking about kinraid after have paid shot gone away sate in same attitude thinking bitter thought people of house prepared for bed silent guest took heed of mute sign at length landlord spoke to started gathered wit together with effort prepared to retire with rest before did so signed directed letter to uncle leaving still open however in case sudden feeling must prompt to add postscript landlord volunteered information that letter guest have be writing must be posted early next morning if be going south a mail in direction only left newcastle other day night long hepburn wearied with passionate tossings prompted by stinging recollection towards morning fell into dead sound sleep be roused by hasty knocking at door be broad full daylight have overslept smack be leaving by early tide be even now summoned on board dressed wafered letter rushed with to neighbouring post office without caring to touch breakfast for paid embarked once on board experienced relief always be to undecided man generally be at first to one who have be paltering with duty when circumstance decide for in first case be pleasant to be relieved from burden of decision in second responsibility seems to be shifted on to impersonal event so philip sailed out of mouth of tyne on to great open sea must be week before smack reached london even if pursued tolerably straight course have to keep sharp look out after possible impressment of crew be not until after many dodge adventure at end of fortnight from time of leaving monkshaven philip found safely housed in london ready to begin delicate piece of work be given to do felt fully capable of unravelling clue to information deciding on value of knowledge so gained during leisure of voyage have wisely determined to communicate everything learnt about dickinson in short step took in matter by letter to employer thus mind in out of lodging might have appeared to have be fully occupied with concern of others there be time when miserable luxury of dwelling upon own affair be when lay down in bed till fell into restless sleep when point to step tended in walk be ascertained then gave up to memory regret often deepened into despair seldom be cheered by hope grew so impatient of ignorance in be kept for in day of heavy postage correspondence might have have on mere monkshaven intelligence be very limited a to affair at haytersbank that cut out advertisement respecting new kind of plough from newspaper lay in chop house where usually dined rising early next morning employed time thus gained in going round to shop where new plough be sold that night wrote letter to daniel robson with long account of merit of implement have day seen with sick heart hesitating hand wound up with message of regard to aunt to sylvia expression of regard dared not make a warm a wished consequently fell below usual mark attained by such message must have appeared to one who cared to think about a cold formal when letter be despatched hepburn began to wonder what have hoped for in writing knew that daniel must write rather that must make strange hieroglyphic meaning of puzzled others often pen ink sign be seldom employed by robson never so far a philip knew for purpose of letter writing still craved so for news of sylvia even for sight of paper have seen perhaps touched that thought trouble about plough to say nothing of one twopence postage have prepaid in order to make sure of letter reception in frugal household at haytersbank well lost for mere chance of uncle caring enough for intelligence to write in reply even to get friend to write answer for in such case perhaps philip might see name mentioned in way even though be only that sent duty to post office be dumb letter came from daniel robson philip heard be true from employer pretty frequently on business felt sure must have named if ill have befallen uncle family for knew of relationship of intimacy there generally ended formal letter with a formal summary of monkshaven news there be never mention of robsons that of be well did not soothe philip impatient curiosity have never confided attachment to cousin to one be not way sometimes thought that if coulson have not taken present appointment to confidential piece of employment so ill must have written to asked to go up to haytersbank farm let know how be time be transacting affair on have be sent with great skill indeed in several way be quietly laying foundation for enlarging business in monkshaven naturally grave quiet slow to speak impressed who saw with idea of greater age experience than really possessed indeed who encountered in london thought be absorbed in business of money making yet before time came when must wind up affair return to monkshaven must have given possessed for letter from uncle telling something about sylvia for still hoped to hear from robson although knew that hoped against reason often convince ourselves by good argument that what wish for need never have be expected then at end of reasoning find that might have saved trouble for wish be untouched be a strong enemy to peace of mind a ever hepburn baulked hope be mordecai sitting in haman gate success in errand to london well doing in worldly affair be tasteless gave pleasure because of blank void of intelligence concerning sylvia yet came back with letter from foster in pocket curt yet expressive of deep gratitude for discreet service in london at time in fact if philip life have be ordered differently to what be might have given man not unworthy pleasure to remember that without penny of own simply by diligence honesty faithful quick sightedness a to interest of master have risen to hold promise of being successor to be ranked by a trusted friend a newcastle smack neared shore on voyage home hepburn looked wistfully out for faint gray outline of monkshaven priory against sky well known cliff a if mass of inanimate stone must tell news of sylvia in street of shield just after landing encountered neighbour of robsons acquaintance of own by honest man be welcomed a great traveller be welcomed on return from long voyage with many hearty good shake of hand much repetition of kind wish offer to treat to drink yet from insurmountable feeling philip avoided mention of family who be principal bond between honest farmer did not know why must not bear shock of first hearing name in open street in rough public house thus shrank from intelligence craved to hear thus knew more about robsons when returned to monkshaven than have done on day when have last seen of course first task there be to give long viva voce account of london proceeding to two brother foster who considering that have heard result of everything by letter seemed to take insatiable interest in detail must hardly tell why even when released from foster parlour be unwilling to go to haytersbank farm be late be true on may evening even country people keep up till eight nine o'clock perhaps be because hepburn be still in travel stained dress having gone straight to shop on arrival in monkshaven perhaps be because if went night for short half hour intervening before bed time must have excuse for paying longer visit on following evening at rate proceeded straight to alice rose a soon a have finished interview with employer hester coulson have given welcome home in shop have however left hour two before yet gave fresh greeting almost one in surprise be blended when came to lodging even alice seemed gratified by spending first evening with a if have thought might have be otherwise weary though be exerted to talk to relate what have done seen in london a far a must without breaking confidence with employer be something to see pleasure gave to auditor although there be several mixed feeling in mind to produce expression of gratified coulson be sorry for former ungenerous reception of news that philip be going to london hester mother secretly began to feel a if evening be like more happy evening of old before robsons came to haytersbank farm who know what faint delicious hope resemblance may not have suggested while philip restless excited feeling that must not sleep be glad to pas away waking hour must intervene before to morrow night at time tried to make talk of what have happened in monkshaven during absence have gone on in eventless manner a far a must gather if knew of anything affecting robsons avoided speaking of to indeed how little likely be ever to have heard name while be away chapter xx loved lost philip walked towards robsons farm like man in dream who have everything around according to wish yet be conscious of secret mysterious inevitable drawback to enjoyment hepburn did not care to think must not realize what drawback need not have be mysterious in case be may evening be glorious in light shadow crimson sun warmed up chilly northern air to semblance of pleasant heat spring sight sound be about lamb be bleating out gentle weariness before sank to rest by side of mother linnet be chirping in bush of golden gorse grew out of stone wall lark be singing good night in cloudless sky before dropped down to nest in tender green wheat spoke of brooding peace philip heart be not at peace yet be going to proclaim good fortune master have that day publicly announced that coulson be to be successor have now arrived at longed for point in business when have resolved to openly speak of love to sylvia might openly strive to gain love ala fulfilment of wish of have lagged sadly behind be placed a far a must even in most sanguine moment have hoped to be a regarded business sylvia be a far from attainment a ever nay farther still great obstacle be removed in kinraid impressment philip took upon to decide that with man a specksioneer absence be equivalent to faithless forgetfulness thought that have just ground for decision in account have heard of kinraid behaviour to annie coulson to other nameless young girl successor in fickle heart in ribald talk of sailor in newcastle public house must be well for sylvia if must forget a quickly to promote oblivion name of lover must never be brought up either in praise blame philip must be patient enduring time watching over labouring to win reluctant love there be saw a stood at top of little hill path leading down to robsons door be out of door in garden at distance from house sloped up bank on opposite side of gully much too far off to be spoken to not too far off to be gazed at by eye caressed movement how well philip knew that garden placed long ago by tenant of farm on southern slope walled in with rough moorland stone planted with berry bush for use southernwood sweet briar for sweetness of smell when robsons have first come to haytersbank sylvia be scarcely more than pretty child how well remembered helping with arrangement of garden laying out few spare penny in hen chicken daisy at one time in flower seed at again in rose tree in pot knew how unaccustomed hand have laboured with spade at forming little primitive bridge over beck in hollow before winter stream must make too deep for fording

that of course must be hopeless in esteem sophistry vanished fear of detection awakened philip to sense of guilt besides found out that in spite of idle talk careless slander must not help believing that kinraid be in terrible earnest when uttered passionate word entreated that might be borne to sylvia instinct told philip that if specksioneer have only flirted with too many yet for sylvia robson love be true vehement then philip tried to convince that from be said of previous character kinraid be not capable of enduring constant attachment with such poor opiate to conscience a must obtain from notion philip be obliged to remain content until day two after first intelligence of presence of three ship learned with trouble pain that name be megoera bellerophon hanover then began to

slumber fell upon be hardly roused by bell softly kissing weather beaten cheek saying low 'god bless thee man thou be allays for be down put upon ' murmured monosyllabic reply unheard by wife who stole away to undress noiselessly laid down on side of bed a gently a stiffened limb must permit be late in rising next morning kester be long since up at work among cattle before saw house door open to admit fresh chill morning air even then sylvia brushed softly went about almost on tip toe when porridge be ready kester be called in to breakfast took sitting at dresser with family large wooden platter stood in middle have bowl of same material filled with milk way be for one to dip pewter spoon into central dish convey a much a little a liked at time of hot porridge into pure fresh milk to day bell told kester to help at once to take bowl up to master room keep company for daniel be in bed resting from weariness bemoaning painful bruise whenever thought of mind be still so much occupied with affair of previous night bell judged rightly that new listener must give ease to body a well a to mind proposal of kester carrying up breakfast have be received by daniel with satisfaction so kester went up slowly carrying over full basin tenderly seated on step leading down into bed room for level have not be calculated when old house be built facing master who half sitting up in blue check bed not unwillingly began relation again to kester listened so attentively that spoon be often arrested in progress from basin to mouth open ready to receive while gazed with unwinking eye at daniel narrating exploit after daniel have fought battle o'er again to auditor within reach found seclusion of chamber rather oppressive without even usual week day noise below so after dinner though far from well came down wandered about stable field nearest to house consulting with kester a to crop manure for most part now then breaking out into episodical chuckle over part of last night proceeding kester enjoyed day even more than master for have bruise to remind that although hero be also flesh blood when returned to house found philip there for be already dusk be kester usual sunday plan to withdraw to bed at a early hour a must manage to sleep often in winter before six now be too full of interest in what philip might have to tell of monkshaven news to forego sabbath privilege of spending evening sitting on chair at end of dresser behind door philip be a close to sylvia a must possibly get without giving offence when came in manner be listless civil have lost active feeling towards made positively distasteful have called out girlish irritation impertinence now be rather glad to see than otherwise brought change into heavy monotony of life monotony so peaceful until have be stirred by passion out of content with small daily event have now become burdensome recurrence insensibly to herself be becoming dependent on timid devotion constant attention lover like once so attracted in spite of judgment by liveliness piquancy now doted on languor thought silence more sweet than word have only just arrived when master man came in have be to afternoon chapel none of have thought of going to distant church worship with be only occasional duty day mind have be too full of event of night before daniel sate heavily down in accustomed chair three cornered arm chair in fireside corner one thought of anybody else ever occupying on occasion whatever in minute two interrupted philip word of greeting inquiry by breaking out into story of rescue of last night to mute surprise of sylvia only one who noticed philip face instead of expressing admiration pleasant wonder lengthened into dismay once twice began to interrupt stopped a if must consider word again kester be never tired of hearing master talk by long living together understood fold of other mind small expression have much significance to bell too sate thankful that husband must have done such deed only sylvia be made uneasy by philip face manner when daniel have ended there be great silence instead of question compliment looked to receive became testy turning to bell said bey nephew look a though be thinking more on t little profit have made on pin ' bob than a if be heeding how honest men be saved from being haled out to yon tender carried out o ' sight o wife little 'uns for iver wife little 'uns may go t ' workhouse clem for aught care philip went very red then more sallow than usual have not be thinking of charley kinraid of quite thing while daniel have told story last speech of old man brought up remembrance be always quick do what must to smother strangle did not speak for moment two then said 'to day have not be like sabbath in monkshaven t rioter a folk

said ' think 'd done abeost enough last neet men be not to be stopped wi ' straw when blood be up still be hard line to call out t ' sojers even if be militia so what seven hatched in dark entry have ta'en lord to put stop to 't ' continued chuckling little more faintly time philip went on still graver than before boldly continuing to say what knew must be discordant to family loved so well ' must have ' telled yo about thought on just a bit o ' news 'd niver thought on thing a uncle there having be in be main sorry to hear on be ' 'why said sylvia breathlessly 'it niver thing to be sorry on be

seemed a if lost in thought then said `` m vexed to plague yo ' 'd best say have got mind there be vast o folk at chapel speaking about last night doings morning work how a set afoot be assured o ' being clapt int prison tried for when heered uncle say a be one like ran through for say a t ' justice will be on t government side mad for vengeance ' for instant there be dead silence woman looked at other with blank eye a if be a yet unable to take in new idea that conduct have seemed to subject for such just pride must be regarded by one a deserving of punishment retribution daniel spoke before have recovered from amazement ' be noane sorry for what did ' 'd do again to neet if need be so theere for thee thou may tell t ' justice fra ' that reckon did righter a letten poor felly be carried off ' t ' very midst o ' t town be called justice for ' perhaps philip have better have held tongue believed in danger be anxious to impress upon uncle in order that knowing what be to be apprehended latter might take pain to avert went on 'but be making coil about randyvowse being destroyed daniel have taken down pipe from shelf in chimney corner be stuffing tobacco into bowl went on pretending to do little while after be filled for to tell truth be beginning to feel uncomfortable at new view of conduct presented to still be not going to let appear so lifting up head with indifferent air lighted pipe blew into took out examined a something be wrong about until be put to right be unable to attend to anything else while faithful three who hung upon well being gazing breathless at proceeding anxious for reply ' said at length 'it be good job be brenned down for such harbour for vermin never seed t ' rat ran across t ' yard by hunders thousand ' be man property a

ascertained what be legal peril overhanging rioter how far uncle have be recognized daniel went on puffing angrily kester sighed audibly then be sorry have done so began to whistle bell full of new fear yet desirous to bring present into kind of harmony said will have ' be loss to john thing burnt trampled on mebbe desarved one be kind o ' tender feeling to one table chair special if one have t

will warrant if come about wi ' paper asking for feyther name to make up for what hobbs have lost by t fire feyther will be for giving summut ' said sylvia 'thou know nought about ' said daniel 'hold thy tongue next time till thou axed to speak wench ' sharp irritated way of speaking be so new to sylvia that tear sprang to eye lip quivered philip saw yearned over plunged headlong into other subject to try divert attention from daniel be too ill at ease to talk much bell be obliged to try keep up semblance of conversation with occasional word two from kester who seemed instinctively to fall into way of thinking to endeavour to keep dark thought in background sylvia stole off to bed more concerned at father angry way of speaking than at idea of being amenable to law for what have done one be sharp present evil other something distant unlikely yet dim terror of latter evil hung over once upstairs threw on bed sobbed philip heard where sate near bottom of short steep staircase at sob cord of love round heart seemed tightened felt a if must there then do something to console instead sat on talking of nothing conversation in daniel joined with somewhat of surliness while bell grave anxious kept wistfully looking from one to other desirous of gleaning further information on subject have begun to trouble mind hoped chance must give opportunity of privately questioning philip seemed to be equally husband wish to thwart such intention of hers remained in house place till after philip have left although be evidently so much fatigued a to give very distinct though unintentional hint to visitor to be gone at house door be locked on philip then daniel prepared to go to bed kester have left for loft above shippen more than hour before bell have still to rake fire then must follow husband upstairs a be scraping up ash heard intermixed with noise be making sound of one rapping gently at window in then frame of mind started little on looking round saw kester face pressed against glass reassured softly opened door there stood in dusk outer air distinct against gray darkness beyond in hand something presently perceived be pitchfork whispered ' have watched t ' maister t bed ' now 'd be greatly beholden to yo ' if yo let just lay down ' t house place 'd warrant niver constable ' monkshaven must get sight o ' t maister below t ' keep ward ' bell shivered little 'nay kester said patting hand kindly on shoulder 'there nought for t ' fear thy master be not one for t ' hurt nobody dunnot think can harm for setting yon poor chap free a t ' gang catched

seemed to have got over irritability be unusually kind tender to wife daughter especially striving by silent little deed to make up for sharp word have said night before to latter a if by common consent allusion to saturday night proceeding be avoided spoke of day work before of crop to be sown of cattle of market one be conscious of wish to know more distinctly what be chance of danger to judge from philip word hung over falling upon cutting off from place for coming day bell longed to send kester down into monkshaven a sort of spy to see how land lay dared not manifest anxiety to husband must not see kester alone wished that have told to go to town when have have to herself in house place night before now seemed a though daniel be resolved not to part from a though have forgotten that peril have be anticipated sylvia mother in like manner clung together not speaking of fear yet knowing that be ever present in other mind so thing went on till twelve o'clock dinner time if at time that morning have have courage to speak together on thought be engrossing mind be possible that mean might have be found to avert calamity be coming towards with swift foot among uneducated partially educated nay even weakly educated feeling exists prompted futile experiment of well known ostrich imagine that by closing own eye to apprehended evil avert expression of fear be supposed to accelerate coming of cause yet on other hand shrink from acknowledging long continuance of blessing in idea that when unusual happiness be spoken about disappears so although perpetual complaint of past present grievance sorrow be most common among class shrink from embodying apprehension for future in word a if then took shape drew near four sate down to dinner not one of be inclined to eat food be scarcely touched on plate yet be trying to make talk among a usual seemed a though dared not let be silent when sylvia sitting opposite to window saw philip at top of brow running rapidly towards farm have be so full of anticipation of kind of misfortune morning that felt now a if be very precursive circumstance have be expecting stood up turning quite white pointing with finger said 'there be ' one at table stood up too instant afterwards philip breathless be in room gasped out 'they be coming warrant be out must go hoped be gone ' help ' said bell sate suddenly

note at time of sylvia one vivid look of unspoken thanks yet remembered afterwards ' will dang dead ' said kester rushing to door for saw what others did not that chance of escape be over constable be already at top of little field path not twenty yard off 'hide hide ' cried bell wringing hand in terror for indeed knew that flight must now be impossible daniel be heavy rheumatic moreover have be pretty severely bruised on unlucky night philip without word pushed daniel before upstairs feeling that own presence at haytersbank farm at hour of day must be betrayal have just time to shut up in

indeed looked upon with jealous eye on many account have favoured charley kinraid a lover of sylvia though have idea of truth though believed in drowning of specksioneer a much a one yet year have elapsed since kinraid supposed death be very short while to middle aged man who forgot how slowly time pass with young must often have scolded sylvia if poor girl have be whit le heavy at heart than be for letting philip come so much about come though be on father business for darkness of common dread drew together occasionally to comparative exclusion of bell kester latter perceived resented kester even allowed to go so far a to wonder what philip must want with money to seemed unaccountable once twice ugly thought crossed mind that shop conducted by young men be often not so profitable a when guided by older head of coin poured into philip keeping might have destination than defence of master poor philip be spending own more than own money one ever knew a have bound down friendly banker to secrecy once only kester ventured to speak to sylvia on subject of philip have followed cousin to field just in front of house just outside porch to ask question dared not put in mother presence bell indeed in anxiety usually absorbed question when philip came stood after philip have bid good by hardly thinking about at looking unconsciously after a ascended brow at top have turned to take last glance at place love inhabited seeing have waved hat in gratified farewell meanwhile be roused from far other thought than of of now acknowledged love by motion against sky be turning

for homely expression now applied to bell behe will never be t same woman again afternoon have cried to sleep in chair after philip departure have not heard sylvia sweeping passage through kitchen hour afterwards be startled up by kester abrupt entry 'where be sylvie ' asked ' know said bell looking scared a if be ready to cry 'it news about ' said standing up supporting on stick be now

took daniel from home placed in peril of death philip be glad that extremity of danger never having be hinted to bell travelling forty mile being most unusual exertion at time to person of class idea of going to see husband at york have never suggested to bell mind increasing feebleness made seem step only to be taken in case of fatal extreme necessity such be conclusion that sylvia have come to be knowledge of made sylvia strangle own daily longing to see father not that hope be stronger than fear philip never told cause for despondency be young like father must not understand how fearful

went to bed at night bell said thing seemed a though morning feeling have be temporary a if be referring decision to period of husband return 'when father come home ' seemed sort of burden at beginning end of sentence reliance on certain coming back to be almost a great trial to sylvia a absence of hope have be in morning that instinct told that mother be becoming incapable of argument must have asked why view be so essentially changed in so few hour inability of reason in poor bell made sylvia feel very desolate monday passed over how of knew for spoke of what be filling thought of before be light on tuesday morning bell be astir 'it very early mother ' said weary sleepy sylvia dreading returning consciousness 'ay lass ' said bell in brisk cheerful tone will maybe be home to night bee bound to have thing ready for ' 'anyhow ' said sylvia sitting up in bed 'he must come home to night ' lass thou doe know how quick man come home to wife child will be ready at rate ' hurried about in way sylvia wondered to see till at length fancied that perhaps mother did so to drive away thought place be cleaned there be scarce time allowed for breakfast till at last long before mid day work be done two sat down to spinning wheel sylvia spirit sank lower lower at speech of mother from whose mind fear seemed to have disappeared leaving only strange restless kind of excitement 'it time for t ' potato said bell after wool have snapped many time from uneven tread ' said sylvia 'it just gone ten 'em on ' said bell without attending to full meaning of daughter word will maybe hasten t ' day on if get dinner done betimes 'but kester be in t ' far acre field will not be home till noon ' seemed to settle matter for while then bell pushed wheel away began searching for hood cloak sylvia

dissatisfied yet unable to explain what did want only knowing that there be something lacked yet fain must have have a marriage day drew near sylvia care seemed to be for mother anxiety be regarding appurtenance of home be leaving in vain philip tried to interest in detail of improvement contrivance in new home to be going to take did not tell idea of house behind shop be associated in mind with two time of discomfort misery first time have gone into parlour about philip spoke so much be at time of press gang riot when have fainted from terror excitement second be on night of misery when mother have gone in to monkshaven to bid father farewell before be taken to york in room on night have first learnt something of fatal peril in stood must not show bright shy curiosity about future dwelling be common enough with girl who be going to be married must do be to restrain from sighing listen patiently when talked on subject in time saw that shrank from so held peace planned worked for in silence smiling to a looked on completed arrangement for pleasure comfort knowing well that happiness be involved in what fragment of peace material comfort might remain to mother wedding day drew near apace be philip plan that after have be married in kirk moorside church sylvia cousin love wife must go for day to robin hood bay returning in evening to house behind shop in market place there be to find bell robson installed in future home for haytersbank farm be to be given up to new tenant on very day of wedding sylvia must not be married sooner said that must stay there till very last have said with such determination that philip have desisted from urgency at once have told that must be settled for mother comfort during few hour absence otherwise sylvia must not have gone at told must ask hester who be always so good kind who never yet have said nay to go to church with a bridesmaid for sylvia must give thought care to anything mother that must leave at haytersbank a returned from church must manage mr robson removal must do do do everything such friendly confidence have philip in hester willingness tender skill sylvia acquiesced at length philip took upon to speak to hester on subject 'hester said one day when be preparing to go home after shop be closed 'must yo mind stopping bit must like to show yo ' place now be done up have favour to ask on yo ' besides be so happy did not see shiver over hesitated just moment before answered `` ll stay if thou wish philip be judge o fashion such like ' 'thou'rt judge o comfort be what have be aiming at be niver so

part so come along hester tell if there be aught more can put in for sylvie ' might not have be very appropriate text such a be word must ask of thee turn not thou away ' seemed only source of strength must have enabled to go patiently through next half hour a be unselfishly brought mind to bear upon subject admired thought decided upon that a one by one philip showed alteration improvement never be such quiet little bit of unconscious unrecognized heroism really ended by such conquest of self that must absolutely sympathize with proud expectant lover have quenched envy of beloved in sympathy with delight imagined sylvia must experience when discovered proof of philip fond consideration care be great strain on heart that source of life when hester returned into parlour after deliberate survey of house felt a weary depressed in bodily strength a if have gone through illness of many day sate down on nearest chair felt a though never must rise again philip joyous content stood near talking 'and hester ' said beylvie have given message for thee say thou must be bridesmaid will have none other can not ' said hester with sudden sharpness yes yo ' must must be like wedding if thou be there why have looked upon thee a sister iver since came to lodge with thy mother hester shook head did duty require not to turn away from asking too philip saw reluctance by intuition rather than reason knew that what must not do for gaiety pleasure must consent to if by so doing must render service to so went on 'besides sylvie have planned to go for wedding jaunt to

on point of urging afresh to go with to church something in eye brought thought across mind a transitory a breath pass over looking glass desisted from entreaty put away thought a piece of vain coxcombry insulting to hester passed rapidly on to careful direction rendered necessary by compliance with latter part of request coupling sylvia name with perpetually so that hester looked upon a happy girl a eager in planning detail of marriage a though heavy shameful sorrow have passed over head not many month ago hester did not see sylvia white dreamy resolute face answered solemn question of marriage service in voice did not seem own hester be not with to notice heavy abstraction made bride a if unconscious of husband loving word then start smile reply with sad gentleness of tone hester duty lay in conveying poor widow down from haytersbank to new home in monkshaven for hester assistance thoughtfulness be dreary painful piece of work poor old woman cry like child with bewilderment at confused bustle in spite of sylvia careful forethought must not be avoided on final day when mother have to be carried away from homestead over have so long presided be a nothing to distress overwhelmed poor bell robson when entered philip house parlour whole place so associated with keen agony have undergone there that stab of memory penetrated through deadened sens brought back to misery in vain hester tried to console by telling fact of sylvia marriage with philip in form of word occurred to bell only remembered husband fate filled up poor wandering mind coloured everything insomuch sylvia not being at hand to reply to mother cry for latter imagined that child a well a husband be in danger of trial death refused to be comforted by endeavour of patient sympathizing hester in pause of mr robson sob hester heard welcome sound of wheel of returning shandry bearing bride bridegroom home stopped at door instant sylvia white a sheet at sound of mother wailing have caught while yet at distance with quick ear of love came running in mother feebly rose tottered towards fell into arm saying 'oh sylvie sylvie take home away from cruel place hester must not be touched with

sequence of event in terrible dream after have roused with fight struggle from feverish slumber be generally sitting up in bed when found conscious heart beating wildly with conviction of kinraid living presence somewhere near in darkness occasionally sylvia be disturbed by agitation must question about dream having like most of class at time great faith in prophetic interpretation philip never gave truth in reply after though did not acknowledge even to long desired happiness be not so delicious perfect a have anticipated many have felt same in first year of married life faithful patient nature still work on striving to gain love capable of steady love while be gift not given to for many week after wedding kester never came near chance word two from sylvia showed philip that

at philip be so strange that be even strangest thing of for kester to appear where everything else be so altered philip have to put up with good deal of crabbed behaviour on part of latter before must induce kester to promise to come down into town see sylvia in new home somehow visit when paid be failure at least seemed so at time though probably broke ice of restraint be forming over familiar intercourse between kester sylvia old servant be daunted by seeing sylvia in strange place stood sleeking hair down furtively looking about instead of seating on chair sylvia have so eagerly brought

conversation became so broken up from desire of other two to attend reply a best must to fragmentary disjointed talk that kester took leave before long falling a did so into formal unnaturally respectful manner have adopted on first coming in sylvia ran after brought back from door think of thy going away kester without bit drink nay come back wi ' thee taste wine cake ' kester stood at door half shy half pleased while sylvia in glow hurry of young housekeeper hospitality sought for decanter of wine wine glass in corner cupboard hastily cut immense wedge of cake crammed into hand in spite of remonstrance then poured out overflowing glass of wine kester must far rather have gone without a knew manner too well to suppose that might taste without having gone through preliminary

pas did name fact that have heard old man come in just a have intended going into parlour for tea have kept away a thought sylvia kester must most enjoy interview undisturbed sylvia felt a if husband silence be unsympathizing shut up feeling be just beginning to expand towards sank again into listless state of indifference from nothing reference to former day present consideration for mother must rouse hester be almost surprised at sylvia evident liking for by slow degree hester be learning to love woman whose position a philip wife must have envied so keenly have not be so truly good pious sylvia seemed a though have given hester whole affection at once hester must not understand while be touched melted by trust implied for one thing sylvia remembered regretted harsh treatment of hester rainy stormy night on latter have come to haytersbank to seek mother bring into monkshaven to see imprisoned father husband sylvia have be struck with hester patient endurance of rudeness rudeness be conscious that must have immediately vehemently resented sylvia did not understand how totally different character from hers might immediately forgive anger must not forget because hester have be so meek at time sylvia who knew how passing transitory be own anger thought that be forgotten while hester believed that word must not have uttered except under deep provocation meant much more than did admired wondered at sylvia for having so entirely conquered anger against again two different woman be divergently affected by extreme fondness bell have shown towards hester ever since sylvia wedding day sylvia who have always received more love from others than knew what to do with most entire faith in own supremacy in mother heart though at time hester must do certain thing more to poor old woman satisfaction hester who have craved for affection have be withheld from have from that one circumstance become distrustful of own power of inspiring regard while exaggerated delight of being beloved feared lest sylvia must become jealous of mother open display of great attachment occasional preference for hester thought never entered sylvia mind be more thankful than knew how to express towards one who made mother happy a have be already said contributing to bell robson pleasure earned philip more of wife smile than anything else sylvia threw whole heart into word caress lavished on hester whenever poor mr robson spoke of goodness kindness of latter hester attributed more virtue to sweet word deed of gratitude than deserved did not imply in sylvia victory over evil temptation a must have done in hester seemed to be sylvia fate to captivate more people than cared to like back again turned head of john jeremiah foster who must hardly congratulate philip enough on choice of wife have be prepared to be critical on one who have interfered with favourite project of marriage between philip hester though full of compassion for cruelty of daniel robson fate be too completely men of business not to have apprehension that connection of philip hepburn with daughter of man who be hanged might injure shop over name appeared possible propriety demanded that must pay attention to bride of former shopman present successor very first visitor whom sylvia have received after marriage have be john jeremiah foster in sabbath day clothes found in parlour so familiar to of clear starching mother cap have to be got up in particular fashion that sylvia be afraid of dictating to phoebe be little disturbed at visitor discovering at employment be on own ground that gave self possession welcomed two old men so sweetly modestly looked so pretty feminine besides so notable in handiwork that conquered prejudice at one blow first thought on leaving shop be how to do honour by inviting to supper party at jeremiah foster house sylvia be dismayed when be bidden to wedding feast philip have to use authority though tenderly to make consent to go at have be to merry country party like corneys to bright haymaking romp in open air never to set stately party at friend house must fain have made attendance on mother excuse philip knew must not listen to such plea applied to hester in dilemma asking to remain with mr robson while sylvia went out visiting hester have willingly nay eagerly consented be much more to taste than going out so philip sylvia set out arm in arm down bridge street across bridge then clambered up hill on way gave direction asked for about behaviour a bride most honoured guest altogether succeeded against intention will in frightening so completely a to grandeur importance of occasion necessity of remembering certain set rule making certain set speech attending to when right time came that if one so naturally graceful must have be awkward sylvia must have be so that night a be sate pale weary looking on very edge of chair uttered formal word philip have told be appropriate to occasion heartily wished safe at home in bed yet left one unanimous impression on company when went away namely that be prettiest best behaved woman have ever seen that philip hepburn have done well in choosing felon daughter though might be host have followed into lobby to help philip in cloaking putting on patten be full of old fashioned compliment good wish one speech of theirs came up to memory in future year sylvia hepburn ' said jeremiah `` ve known thy husband long say what thou hast done well in choosing if ever neglect ill us thee come to will give sound lecture on conduct mind be thy friend from day forrards ready to take thy part against ' philip smiled a if day must never come when must neglect ill use darling sylvia smiled little without much attending to caring for word be detaining tired a be john jeremiah chuckled over joke word came up again in after day a word idly spoken sometimes do before end of first year philip have learnt to be jealous of wife new love for hester to latter sylvia gave free confidence on many thing philip fancied withheld from suspicion crossed mind from time to time sylvia might speak of former lover to hester must be not unnatural thought if did so believing to be dead idea irritated be entirely mistaken however sylvia with apparent frankness kept deep sorrow to herself never mentioned father name though be continually present to mind did speak of kinraid to human being though for sake voice softened when by chance spoke to passing sailor for sake eye lingered on such men longer than on others trying to discover in something of old familiar gait partly for dead sake partly because of freedom of outlook freshness of air be glad occasionally to escape from comfortable imprisonment of 'parlour ' close street around market place to mount cliff sit on turf gazing abroad over

towards little bella though idea of number of elect be growing narrower narrower day must have be to exclude innocent little child that stroked wrinkled cheek so softly night in return for blessing from few must be saved nay for child sake relented towards mother strove to have sylvia rescued from many castaway with fervent prayer a phrased 'wrestling with lord alice have sort of instinct that little child so tenderly loved by so fondly loving mother whose ewe lamb be must not be even in heaven without yearning for creature have loved best on earth old woman believed that be principal reason for prayer for sylvia unconsciously to herself alice rose be touched by filial attention constantly received from young mother whom believed to be foredoomed to condemnation sylvia rarely went to church chapel did read bible for though spoke little of ignorance must fain for child sake have remedied now be too late have lost what little fluency of reading have ever have must only make out word with much spelling difficulty so taking bible in hand must have be mere form though of alice rose knew nothing one knew much of what be passing in sylvia did not know sometimes in night must waken cry with terrible sense of desolation one who loved whom have loved have vanished out of life one child who lay in arm warm soft then jeremiah foster word came upon word that have taken for cursing at time must so gladly have have clue by to penetrate darkness of unknown region from whence blessing cursing came to know if have indeed done something must cause sin to be visited on soft sweet innocent darling if one must teach to read if one must explain to hard word heard in church chapel so that might find out meaning of sin godliness word have only passed over surface of mind till

for not using mean of grace that be not in power to avail herself of hester sylvia must fain have loved for uniform gentleness patience with around seemed so cold in unruffled undemonstrative behaviour moreover sylvia felt that hester blamed perpetual silence regarding philip absence without knowing how bitter cause sylvia have for casting off only person who seemed to have pity upon be kester pity be shown in look rather than word for when came to see did from time to time by kind of mutual tacit consent spoke little of former day be still lodging with sister widow dobson working at odd job of took into country for week at time on return to monkshaven be sure to come see little bella indeed when employment be in immediate neighbourhood of town never allowed week to pas away without visit there be not much conversation between sylvia at such time skimmed over surface of small event in took interest only now then sudden glance checked speech told that there be deep not forgotten although be never mentioned twice sylvia below breath have asked kester just a be holding door open for departure if anything have ever be heard of kinraid since one night visit to monkshaven time there be interval of month between inquiry answer have be simply to one else must sylvia ever have named name indeed have not chance have wished ever so much of asking question about

anything that be very pretty in low voice then quickly left shop much to coulson displeasure afternoon be unusually quiet depressed alice rose sitting helpless in chair watched with keen eye at length after one of sylvia deep unconscious sigh old woman spoke 'it religion a must comfort thee child a be done many one afore thee 'how ' said sylvia looking up startled to find object of notice 'how '

confirmed by alice who have scruple in using past experience of own of daughter of one life a instrument to prove vanity of setting heart on anything earthly knowledge unsuspected before sank deep into sylvia thought gave strange interest in hester poor hester whose life have so crossed blighted even by very blighting of own gave hester own former passionate feeling for kinraid wondered how must have felt towards one who have come between wiled love away when remembered hester unfailing sweetness kindness towards from very first must better bear comparative coldness of present behaviour

detained hester in room for fear lest mr brunton must repeat inquiry a to how happened that philip have gone away presence of third person seemed a though must be little restraint upon inquisitive molly who repeatedly bore down upon same question till nearly drove sylvia distracted between astonishment at news of kinraid marriage wish to be alone quiet so a to realize full meaning of piece of intelligence desire to retain hester in conversation effort to prevent molly recurrence to circumstance of philip disappearance longing more vehement minute for visitor to go away leave in peace became so disturbed with thought feeling that hardly knew what be saying assented dissented to speech without there being reason truth in word mr brunton have arranged to remain with sylvia while horse rested have compunction about length of visit expected to be asked to tea a sylvia found out at last felt must be worst of a alice rose be not one to tolerate coarse careless talk of such woman a mr brunton without uplifting voice in many testimony against sylvia sate holding hester gown tight in order to prevent leaving room trying to arrange little plan so too much discordance must not arise to surface just then door opened little bella came in from kitchen in pretty sturdy dignity of two year old alice following with careful step protecting outstretched arm slow smile softening sternness of grave face for child be unconscious darling of household eye softened into love a looked on made straight for mother with something grasped in little dimpled fist way across room seemed to have become suddenly aware of presence of stranger stopped short fixing serious eye full on mr brunton a if to take in appearance nay a if to penetrate down into very real self then stretching out disengaged hand baby spoke out word have be hovering about mother lip for hour past 'do away ' said bella decisively 'what perfect love ' said mr brunton half in real admiration half in patronage a spoke got up went towards child a if to take up away do away cried bella in shrill affright at movement ' said sylvia behe shy doe know stranger mr brunton have grasped struggling kicking child by time reward for be vehement little slap in face 'yo naughty little spoilt thing ' said setting bella down in hurry ' deserve good whipping yo ' do if yo be mine yo must have ' sylvia have need to stand up for baby who have run to arm be soothing with sobbing on mother breast for alice took up defence child said a plain a word must say go away if thou wouldst follow thine own will instead of heeding wish thou mun put up with wilfulness of old adam of seems to thee hast getten thy share at thirty a well a little bella at two ' said mr brunton now fairly affronted 'thirty why sylvia yo know be two year older than yo ' speak to woman tell a be only four twenty thirty indeed be four twenty ' said sylvia in pacificatory tone be twenty thirty forty be alike to ' said alice ' meant harm meant for t ' say a angry word to child bespoke to be one of foolish know not who be what age may be ' be old friend of mine ' said sylvia behe mr brunton now when knowed be molly corney 'ay yo ' be sylvia

away seven year will soon be past fro ' t time went off yo will only be six twenty then there will be chance of better husband for yo ' after so keep up yo ' r heart sylvia ' molly brunton have put a much venom a knew how into speech meaning a vengeful payment for supposition of being thirty even more than for reproof for angry word about child thought that alice rose must be aunt to philip from serious cast of countenance be remarkable in rather exulted in allusion to happier second marriage for sylvia with have concluded speech roused alice however a effectually a if have be really blood relation to philip for different reason be not slow to detect intentional offensiveness to herself in have be said be indignant at sylvia for suffering word spoken to pas unanswered in truth be too much in keeping with molly brunton character to make a much impression on sylvia a did on stranger besides felt a if le reply molly received le likely must be that must go on in same strain so coaxed chattered to child behaved like little coward in trying to draw out of conversation while at same time listening attentively 'as for sylvia hepburn a be sylvia robson know mind ' said alice in grim indignation humbling now trust pray be light minded full of vanity when philip married might have ' be lift towards salvation in one way pleased lord to work in different way mun wear sackcloth ash in

face to slight one a be fitter for who have loved a apple of eye be a be suffering for inasmuch a be wanderer from home outcast from wife child ' to surprise of molly word of reply be cut short even when be on lip by sylvia pale fire eyed excited with philip child on one arm other stretched out said 'noane can tell noane know one will speak judgment philip acted cruel wrong by have said word to hissel ' be noane going to make plaint to others only a know must judge be not fitting be not ' almost sobbing go on wi ' talk like afore ' two for hester who be aware that presence have only be desired by sylvia a check to unpleasant tete tete conversation have slipped back to business a soon a mother came in two looked with surprise at sylvia word whole manner belonged to phase of character seldom came uppermost have not be perceived by of before alice rose though astonished rather approved of sylvia speech showed that have more serious thought feeling on subject than old woman have given credit for general silence respecting husband disappearance have led alice to think that be too childish to have received deep impression from event molly brunton gave vent to opinion on sylvia speech in following word toighty tell tale lass if yo ' treated steady philip to many such look ' speech a yo'n given now be easy t see why took off why sylvia niver saw in yo ' when yo ' be girl yo be grown into regular little vixen theere wheere yo stand ' indeed did look defiant with swift colour flushing cheek to crimson on return fire in eye not yet died away at molly jesting word sank back into usual look manner only saying quietly 'it for noane to say whether be vixen not a doe know th ' past thing a be buried in heart can not hold a friend a go on talking on husband before very face what be know what be reckon know now will go hurry tea for yo will be needing molly ' last clause of speech be meant to make peace molly be in twenty mind a to whether must accept olive branch not temper however be of obtuse kind be not easily ruffled mind stagnant in enjoyed excitement from without appetite be invariably good so stayed in spite of inevitable tete tete with alice latter however refused to be drawn into conversation again replying to mr brunton speech with curt yes when indeed replied at when be gathered at tea sylvia be quite calm again rather paler than usual very attentive subduced in behaviour to alice must evidently fain have be silent a molly be own especial guest must not be so endeavour went towards steering conversation away from awkward point of four let alone little bella be thankful when market cart drew up at shop door be to take mr brunton back to sister house when be fairly off alice rose opened mouth in strong condemnation winding up with 'and if aught in word gave thee cause for offence sylvia be because heart rose within at kind of talk thee have be having about philip evil light minded counsel to thee about waiting seven year then wedding ' hard a word may seem when repeated there be something of nearer approach to apology in mr rose manner than sylvia have ever seen in before be silent for few moment then said ' have ' often thought of

question remonstrance from alice sylvia turned deaf ear averted face from hester sad wistful look only when be parting for night at top of little staircase turned putting arm round hester neck laid head on neck whispered 'poor hester poor poor hester if yo ' have be married together what deal o ' sorrow must have ' be spared to ' hester pushed away a finished word looked searchingly into face

bella to hester willing care know ' said pretty young lady joyously think knew husband be mr kinraid ' sob of surprise rose to sylvia lip choked down however tried to conceal emotion might feel in placing chair for visitor trying to make feel welcome although if truth must be told sylvia be wondering time why visitor came how soon must go 'you knew captain kinraid did not ' said young lady with

day dinner when twelve bedesman met in large quaint hall warden came in college cap gown to say long latin grace wound up with something very like prayer for soul of sir simon bray took time to get reply to ship letter in time when one must exactly say where fleet might be found before dr pennington have received excellent character of stephen freeman son gladly sent in answer to father inquiry philip have become restless uneasy in midst of peace comfort sitting alone over fire in long winter evening scene of past life rose before childhood aunt robson care of first going to foster shop in

indignation till almost brought out of extreme sympathy with sylvia to believe that be indeed wretch have considered to be forgot own excuse for having acted a have done though excuse have at one time seemed to to wear garb of reason after long thought bitter memory came wonder what be sylvia doing now where be what be child like child a well a hers then remembered poor footsore wife little girl carried in arm be just age of bella wished have noticed that child more that clear vision of might rise up when wanted to picture bella one night have gone round mill wheel circle of idea till be weary to very marrow of bone to shake off monotonous impression rose to look for book amongst old tattered volume hoping that might find something must sufficiently lay hold of to change current of

paynim in own country be away for seven long year when came back own wife phillis countess in castle did not know poor travel worn hermit who came daily to seek dole of bread at hand along with many beggar much poor at last when lay dying in cave in rock sent for by secret sign known to twain came with great speed for knew be lord who have sent for have many sweet holy word together before gave up ghost head lying on bosom old story known to most people from childhood be new fresh to philip did not quite believe in truth of because fictitious nature of history of of other champion of

hopeless eye from time to time with sight of child small pension of sixpence day must keep from absolute want of necessary so very day went to warden told thought of giving up share in bequest of sir simon bray relinquishment have never occurred before in warden experience be very much inclined to be offended ' must say that for man not to be satisfied a bedesman of st sepulchre argues very wrong state of mind very ungrateful heart ' `` m sure sir be not from ingratitude for can hardly feel thankful to to sir simon to madam young lady comrade in hospital niver expect to be either so

time will serve right if be mind one can be chosen twice to be bedesman of st sepulchre ' warden turned away philip uneasy at staying disheartened at leaving went to make few preparation for setting out once more on journey northward have to give notice of change of residence to local distributor of pension one two farewell have to be taken with more than usual sadness at necessity for philip under name of stephen freeman have attached of older bedesman good deal to from unselfishness willingness to read to to render many little service perhaps a much a anything by habitual silence made convenient recipient of garrulousness so before time for departure came have opportunity of one more interview with warden of more friendly character than in gave up bedesmanship so far be well philip turned back upon st sepulchre with sore heart partly healed by four month residence there be stronger too in body more capable of day after day walk be required of have saved money from allowance a
