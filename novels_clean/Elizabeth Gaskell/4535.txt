pretty clear that philip hepburn be 'after to philip kester have instinctive objection kind of natural antipathy such a have existed in age between dweller in town in country between agriculture trade so while kinraid sylvia kept up half tender half jesting conversation kester be making up slow persistent mind a to desirability of young man then present a husband for darling a much from being other

kester door into dairy through sylvia have vanished with milk half wished to conciliate kester by helping seemed also attracted by force annihilated will to follow wherever went kester read mind alone let alone said 'pigs ' vittle take noan such dainty carryin a milk may set down ' niver spill drop be noan fit for t ' serve swine yo ' other mester better help t ' teem t ' milk ' so kinraid followed light light into icy chill of dairy where bright polished tin can be quickly dimmed with warm sweet smelling milk that sylvia be emptying out into brown pan in haste to help charley took up one of pail that'n to be strained ' have ' cow hair in mother very particular can not abide hair ' so went over to awkward dairymaid before not before be aware of sweet proximity be adjusting happy awkward

must have found ready way of keeping cousin indeed most young woman warm paused before dared put arm round sylvia have something so shy wild in look manner very innocence of what word spoken by girl might lead to inspired with respect kept in check so contented with saying `` ll let yo ' go into t ' warm kitchen if yo will tell if yo think can ever forget yo ' again looked up at defiantly set red

mimicry of tone 'good by philip ' chapter xviii eddy in love current next morning shone bright clear if ever march morning did beguiling month be coming in like lamb with storm might go raging out be long since philip have tasted freshness of early air on shore in country a employment at shop detained in monkshaven till evening a turned down quay staithes on north side of river towards shore met fresh sea breeze blowing right in face be impossible not to feel bright elastic with knapsack slung over shoulder be prepared for good stretch towards hartlepool whence coach must take to newcastle before night for seven eight mile level sand be a short far more agreeable road than up down land way philip walked on pretty briskly unconsciously enjoying sunny landscape before crisp curling wave rushing almost up to foot on right hand then swishing back over fine small pebble into great swelling sea to left be cliff rising one behind having deep gully here there between with long green slope upward from land then sudden fall of brown red soil rock deepening to yet greater richness of colour at base towards blue ocean before loud monotonous murmur of advancing receding water lulled into dreaminess sunny look of everything tinged day dream with hope so trudged merrily over first mile so not obstacle to measured pace on hard level pavement not creature to be seen since have left little gathering of bare legged urchin dabbling in sea pool near monkshaven care of land be shut out by glorious barrier of rock before there be great mass have be detached by action of weather lay half embedded in sand draperied over by heavy pendent olive green seaweed wave be nearer at point advancing sea came up with mighty distant length of roar here there smooth swell be lashed by fret against unseen rock into white breaker otherwise wave came up from german ocean upon english shore with long steady roll might have taken first impetus far away in haunt of sea serpent on coast of 'norroway over foam ' air be soft a may right overhead sky be blue deadened into gray near sea line flock of seagull hovered about edge of wave slowly rising turning white under plumage to glimmer in sunlight a philip approached whole scene be so peaceful so soothing that dispelled care fear too well founded in fact have weighed down on heart during dark hour of past night there be haytersbank gully opening down green entrance among warm brown base of cliff below in sheltered brushwood among last year withered leaf primrose might be found half thought of gathering sylvia posy of rushing up to farm to make little farewell peace offering on looking at watch put thought of such action out of head be above hour later than have supposed must make haste on to hartlepool just a be approaching gully man came dashing down ran out way upon sand with very force of descent then turned to left took direction of hartlepool hundred yard so in advance of philip never stayed to look round went swiftly steadily on way by peculiar lurch in walk by everything philip knew be specksioneer kinraid now road up haytersbank gully led to farm nowhere else still one wishing to descend to shore might do so by first going up to robsons house skirting wall till came to little slender path down to shore by farm by very house door must of necessity pas philip slackened pace keeping under shadow of rock by by kinraid walking on sunlight open sand turned round looked long earnestly towards haytersbank gully hepburn paused when paused a intently a looked at object above so intently did hepburn look at need to ascertain by sight towards whom look thought be directed took off hat waved touching one part of a if with particular meaning when turned away at last hepburn heaved heavy sigh crept yet more into cold dank shadow of cliff step be now heavy task sad heart tired weary after while climbed up few foot so a to mingle form yet more completely with stone rock around stumbling over uneven often jagged point slipping on sea weed plunging into little pool of water left by ebbing tide in natural basin yet kept eye fixed a if in fascination on kinraid made way almost alongside of last hour have pinched hepburn feature into something of wan haggardness must wear when must first be lying still for ever now two men be drawing near creek about eight mile from monkshaven creek be formed by beck small stream came flowing down from moor took way to sea between widening rock melting of snow running of flooded water spring above made beck in early spring time deep wide hepburn knew that here must take path leading inland to narrow foot bridge about quarter of mile up stream indeed from point owing to jutting out of rock land path be shortest way lay by water side at angle right below cliff to hepburn step be leading knew that on long level field path might easily be seen by one following nay if followed one at short distance for be full of turning resolved late a be to sit down for while till kinraid be far enough in advance for to escape being seen came up to last rock behind must be concealed seven eight foot above stream stood looked cautiously for specksioneer up by rushing stream looked then right below 'it be god providence ' murmured 'it be god providence ' crouched down where have be standing covered face with hand tried to deafen a well a to blind that might neither hear see anything of coming event of inhabitant of monkshaven at day well understood betokening sign kinraid have taken larger angle of sand before turning up towards bridge came along now nearing rock by time be sufficiently buoyant to whistle to steeled philip heart to what be coming to hear rival whistling 'weel may keel row ' so soon after parting with instant kinraid turned corner of cliff ambush be upon four man of war men sprang on strove to pinion 'in king name ' cried with rough triumphant jeer boat be moored not dozen yard above be sent by tender of frigate lying off hartlepool for fresh water tender be at anchor just beyond jutting rock in face knew that fisherman be in habit of going to from net by side of creek prize a active strong evidently superior sailor be what have not hoped for endeavour to secure be in proportion to value of prize although taken by surprise attacked by so many kinraid did not lose wit wrenched free cry out loud 'avast be protected whaler claim

difficult to foretell result yet kinraid made desperate effort to free wasted breath in word fought a men said 'like very devil ' hepburn heard loud pant of breath great thud dull struggle of limb on sand growling curse of who thought to have managed affair more easily sudden cry of one wounded not kinraid knew kinraid must have borne pain in silence at moment wrestling swearing infuriated strife then strange silence hepburn sickened at heart be then rival dead have left bright world lost life love for instant hepburn felt guilty of death said to have never wished dead yet in struggle have kept aloof now might be too late for ever philip must not bear suspense looked stealthily round corner of rock behind have be hidden saw that have overpowered kinraid too exhausted to speak be binding

supreme agony without motion of head be perceiving taking in everything while lay bound at bottom of boat sailor sat by side who have be hurt by blow from man held head in hand moaning now then revenged by kick at prostrate specksioneer till even comrade stopped cursing swearing at prisoner for trouble have given to cry shame on comrade kinraid never spoke shrank from outstretched foot one of captor with successful insolence of victory ventured to jeer on supposed reason for vehement hopeless resistance might have said yet more insolent thing kick might have hit harder kinraid did not hear heed soul be beating against bar of inflexible circumstance reviewing in one terrible instant of time what have be what might have be be yet while thought thus stabbed be still mechanically looking out for chance moved head little so a to turn towards haytersbank where sylvia must be quickly if sadly going about simple daily work then quick eye caught hepburn face blanched with excitement rather than fear watching eagerly from behind rock where have sat breathless during affray impressment of rival here lad ' shouted specksioneer a soon a saw philip heaving writhing body

not speak for minute two sailor who have begun to take into favour be agog with curiosity to hear message to sweetheart believed be going to send hepburn perception quickened with vehement agitation of soul be aware of feeling of theirs increased rage against kinraid who have exposed idea of sylvia to be subject of ribald whisper specksioneer cared little what others said thought about maiden

writing to sylvia telling how much might treasure up lover word like grain of gold while be lighter than dust in meaning to philip mind word such a specksioneer used a counter to beguile lead astray silly woman be for to prove constancy by action chance of giving such proof be infinitesimal in philip estimation must latter mention bare fact of kinraid impressment to robson must have be natural

experienced relief always be to undecided man generally be at first to one who have be paltering with duty when circumstance decide for in first case be pleasant to be relieved from burden of decision in second responsibility seems to be shifted on to impersonal event so philip sailed out of mouth of tyne on to great open sea must be week before smack reached london even if pursued tolerably straight course have to keep sharp look out after possible impressment of crew be not until after many dodge adventure at end of fortnight from time of leaving monkshaven philip found safely housed in london ready to begin delicate piece of work be given to do felt fully capable of unravelling clue to information deciding on value of knowledge so gained during leisure of voyage have wisely determined to communicate everything learnt about dickinson in short step took in matter by letter to employer thus mind in out of lodging might have appeared to have be fully occupied with concern of others there be time when miserable luxury of dwelling upon own affair be when lay down in bed till fell into restless sleep when point to step tended in walk be ascertained then gave up to memory regret often deepened into despair seldom be cheered by hope grew so impatient of ignorance in be kept for in day of heavy postage correspondence might have have on mere monkshaven intelligence be very limited a to affair at haytersbank that cut out advertisement respecting new kind of plough from newspaper lay in chop house where usually dined rising early next morning employed time thus gained in going round to shop where new plough be sold that night wrote letter to daniel robson with long account of merit of implement have day seen with sick heart hesitating hand wound up with message of regard to aunt to sylvia expression of regard dared not make a warm a wished consequently fell below usual mark attained by such message must have appeared to one who cared to think about a cold formal when letter be despatched hepburn began to wonder what have hoped for in writing knew that daniel must write rather that must make strange hieroglyphic meaning of puzzled others often pen ink sign be seldom employed by robson never so far a philip knew for purpose of letter writing still craved so for news of sylvia even for sight of paper have seen perhaps touched that thought trouble about plough to say nothing of one twopence postage have prepaid in order to make sure of letter reception in frugal household at haytersbank well lost for mere chance of uncle caring enough for intelligence to write in reply even to get friend to write answer for in such case perhaps philip might see name mentioned in way even though be only that sent duty to post office be dumb letter came from daniel robson philip heard be true from employer pretty frequently on business felt sure must have named if ill have befallen uncle family for knew of relationship of intimacy there generally ended formal letter with a formal summary of monkshaven news there be never mention of robsons that of be well did not soothe philip impatient curiosity have never confided attachment to cousin to one be not way sometimes thought that if coulson have not taken present appointment to confidential piece of employment so ill must have written to asked to go up to haytersbank farm let know how be time be transacting affair on have be sent with great skill indeed in several way be quietly laying foundation for enlarging business in monkshaven naturally grave quiet slow to speak impressed who saw with idea of greater age experience than really possessed indeed who encountered in london thought be absorbed in business of money making yet before time came when must wind up affair return to monkshaven must have given possessed for letter from uncle telling something about sylvia for still hoped to hear from robson although knew that hoped against reason often convince ourselves by good argument that what wish for need never have be expected then at end of reasoning find that might have saved trouble for wish be untouched be a strong enemy to peace of mind a ever hepburn baulked hope be mordecai sitting in haman gate success in errand to london well doing in worldly affair be tasteless gave pleasure because of blank void of intelligence concerning sylvia yet came back with letter from foster in pocket curt yet expressive of deep gratitude for discreet service in london at time in fact if philip life have be ordered differently to what be might have given man not unworthy pleasure to remember that without penny of own simply by diligence honesty faithful quick sightedness a to interest of master have risen to hold promise of being successor to be ranked by a trusted friend a newcastle smack neared shore on voyage home hepburn looked wistfully out for faint gray outline of monkshaven priory against sky well known cliff a if mass of inanimate stone must tell news of sylvia in street of shield just after landing encountered neighbour of robsons acquaintance of own by honest man be welcomed a great traveller be welcomed on return from long voyage with many hearty good shake of hand much repetition of kind wish offer to treat to drink yet from insurmountable feeling philip avoided mention of family who be principal bond between honest farmer did not know why must not bear shock of first hearing name in open street in rough public house thus shrank from intelligence craved to hear thus knew more about robsons when returned to monkshaven than have done on day when have last seen of course first task there be to give long viva voce account of london proceeding to two brother foster who considering that have heard result of everything by letter seemed to take insatiable interest in detail must hardly tell why even when released from foster parlour be unwilling to go to haytersbank farm be late be true on may evening even country people keep up till eight nine o'clock perhaps be because hepburn be still in travel stained dress having gone straight to shop on arrival in monkshaven perhaps be because if went night for short half hour intervening before bed time must have excuse for paying longer visit on following evening at rate proceeded straight to alice rose a soon a have finished interview with employer hester coulson have given welcome home in shop have however left hour two before yet gave fresh greeting almost one in surprise be blended when came to lodging even alice seemed gratified by spending first evening with a if have thought might have be otherwise weary though be exerted to talk to relate what have done seen in london a far a must without breaking confidence with employer be something to see pleasure gave to auditor although there be several mixed feeling in mind to produce expression of gratified coulson be sorry for former ungenerous reception of news that philip be going to london hester mother secretly began to feel a if evening be like more happy evening of old before robsons came to haytersbank farm who know what faint delicious hope resemblance may not have suggested while philip restless excited feeling that must not sleep be glad to pas away waking hour must intervene before to morrow night at time tried to make talk of what have happened in monkshaven during absence have gone on in eventless manner a far a must gather if knew of anything affecting robsons avoided speaking of to indeed how little likely be ever to have heard name while be away chapter xx loved lost philip walked towards robsons farm like man in dream who have everything around according to wish yet be conscious of secret mysterious inevitable drawback to enjoyment hepburn did not care to think must not realize what drawback need not have be mysterious in case be may evening be glorious in light shadow crimson sun warmed up chilly northern air to semblance of pleasant heat spring sight sound

be placed a far a must even in most sanguine moment have hoped to be a regarded business sylvia be a far from attainment a ever nay farther still great obstacle be removed in kinraid impressment philip took upon to decide that with man a specksioneer absence be equivalent to faithless forgetfulness thought that have just ground for decision in account have heard of kinraid behaviour to annie coulson to other nameless young girl successor in fickle heart in ribald talk of sailor in newcastle public house must be well for sylvia if must forget a quickly to promote oblivion name of lover must never be brought up either in praise blame philip must be patient enduring time watching over labouring to win reluctant love there be saw a stood at top of little hill path leading down to robsons door be out of door in garden at distance from house sloped up bank on opposite side of gully much too far off to be spoken to not too far off to be gazed at by eye caressed movement how well philip knew that garden placed long ago by tenant of farm on southern slope walled in with rough moorland stone planted with berry bush for use southernwood sweet briar for sweetness of smell when robsons have first come to haytersbank sylvia be scarcely more than pretty child how well remembered helping with arrangement of garden laying out few spare penny in hen chicken daisy at one time in

did not hear soul have gone out to meet sylvia who entered with quiet slowness quite unlike former self face be wan white gray eye seemed larger full of dumb tearless sorrow came up to philip a if being there touched with surprise gave gentle greeting a if be familiar indifferent person whom have seen yesterday philip who have recollected quarrel have have about kinraid too very last time have met have expected trace of remembrance to linger in look speech to there be such sign great sorrow have wiped away anger almost memory mother looked at anxiously then said in same manner of forced

louder more talkative because like wife assumed cheerful manner before sylvia yet unlike wife have many secret regret over kinraid fate at first while merely fact of disappearance be known daniel

strict search to be made for skilled protected specksioneer with success positive evidence in contradiction to daniel robson opinion only made cling to more until day when hat be found on shore with kinraid name written out large fair in inside tell tale bit of ribbon knotted in band then daniel by sudden revulsion gave up hope never entered mind that must have fallen off by accident now kinraid be dead drowned be bad job sooner must be forgotten better for party be well one knew how far have gone with sylvia especially now since bessy corney be cry eye out a if have be engaged to so daniel said nothing to wife about mischief have gone on in absence never spoke to sylvia about affair only be more than usually tender to in rough way thought morning noon night on what must do to give pleasure drive away recollection of ill starred love to night must have sit by while philip told story heavily answered question put to sylvia sat on stool by father knee holding one of hand in of hers presently laid down head upon philip saw sad eye looking into flickering fire light with long unwinking stare showing that thought be far distant must hardly go on with tale of what have seen what done be so full of pity for yet for pity have now resolved never to soothe with knowledge of what knew to deliver message sent by false lover felt like mother withholding something injurious from foolish wish of plaining child went away without breathing word of good fortune in business telling of such kind of good fortune seemed out of place night when thought of death loss of friend seemed to brood over household cast shadow there obscuring for time worldly thing so great piece of news came out in ordinary course of gossip told by monkshaven friend to robson next market day for month philip have be looking forward to sensation intelligence must produce in farm household a preliminary to laying good fortune at sylvia foot heard of away chance of making use of in manner have

to repent of encouragement have given to lover whose untimely end have so deeply affected only child that be more unwilling than ever that wife must know of length to affair have gone during absence even urged secrecy upon sylvia a personal favour unwilling to encounter silent blame openly affected to despise 'we will noane fret thy mother by lettin ' on how oft came went will may be be thinkin '

seemed a if blight hung over land people men dodged about daily business with hatred suspicion in eye many curse went over sea to three fatal ship lying motionless at anchor three mile off monkshaven when first philip have heard in shop that three men of war might be seen lying fell still on gray horizon heart sank scarcely dared to ask name for if one must be alcestis if kinraid must send word to sylvia if must say be living loving faithful if must come to pas that fact of undelivered message sent by lover through philip must reach sylvia ear what must be position of latter not merely in love that of course must be hopeless in esteem sophistry vanished fear of detection awakened philip to sense of guilt besides found out that in spite of idle talk careless slander must not help believing that kinraid be in terrible earnest when uttered passionate word entreated that might be borne to sylvia instinct told philip that if specksioneer have only flirted with too many yet for sylvia robson love be true vehement then philip tried to convince that from be said of previous character kinraid be not capable of enduring constant attachment with such poor opiate to conscience a must obtain from notion philip be obliged to remain content until day two after first intelligence of presence of three ship learned with trouble pain that name be megoera bellerophon hanover then began to perceive how unlikely be that alcestis must have be lingering on shore many month be doubtless gone far away by time have probably joined fleet on war station who must tell what have become of crew might have be in battle before now if so so previous fancy shrank to nothing rebuked for improbability with vanished self reproach yet there be time when popular attention seemed totally absorbed by dread of press gang when other subject be talked about hardly in fact thought about at such flow of panic philip have own private fear lest flash of light must come upon sylvia must suddenly see kinraid absence might be accounted for in way besides death when reasoned seemed unlikely man of war have be seen off coast if seen have never be spoken about at time of kinraid disappearance if have vanished winter time one must have be convinced that press gang have seized upon philip have never heard one breathe dreaded name of alcestis besides went on to think at farm be out of hearing of one

daniel narrating exploit after daniel have fought battle o'er again to auditor within reach found seclusion of chamber rather oppressive without even usual week day noise below so after dinner though far from well came down wandered about stable field nearest to house consulting with kester a to crop manure for most part now then breaking out into episodical chuckle over part of last night

chapel none of have thought of going to distant church worship with be only occasional duty day mind have be too full of event of night before daniel sate heavily down in accustomed chair three cornered arm chair in fireside corner one thought of anybody else ever occupying on occasion whatever in minute two interrupted philip word of greeting inquiry by breaking out into story of rescue of last night to mute surprise of sylvia only one who noticed philip face instead of expressing admiration pleasant wonder lengthened into dismay once twice began to interrupt stopped a if must consider word again kester be never tired of hearing master talk by long living together understood fold of other mind small expression have much significance to bell too sate thankful that husband must have done such deed only sylvia be made uneasy by philip face manner when daniel have ended there be great silence instead of question compliment looked to receive became testy turning to bell said bey

at other with blank eye a if be a yet unable to take in new idea that conduct have seemed to subject for such just pride must be regarded by one a deserving of punishment retribution daniel spoke before have recovered from amazement ' be noane sorry for what did ' 'd do again to neet if need be so theere for thee thou may tell t ' justice fra ' that reckon did righter a letten poor felly be

ascertained what be legal peril overhanging rioter how far uncle have be recognized daniel went on puffing angrily kester sighed audibly then be sorry have done so began to whistle bell full of new fear yet desirous to bring present into kind of harmony said will have ' be loss to john thing burnt trampled on mebbe desarved one be kind o ' tender feeling to one table chair special if one have t

thy tongue next time till thou axed to speak wench ' sharp irritated way of speaking be so new to sylvia that tear sprang to eye lip quivered philip saw yearned over plunged headlong into other subject to try divert attention from daniel be too ill at ease to talk much bell be obliged to try keep up semblance of conversation with occasional word two from kester who seemed instinctively to fall into way of thinking to endeavour to keep dark thought in background sylvia stole off to bed more concerned at father angry way of speaking than at idea of being amenable to law for what have done one be sharp present evil other something distant unlikely yet dim terror of latter evil hung over once upstairs threw on bed sobbed philip heard where sate near bottom of short steep staircase at sob cord of love round heart seemed tightened felt a if must there then do something to console instead sat on talking of nothing conversation in daniel joined with somewhat of surliness while bell grave anxious kept wistfully looking from one to other desirous of gleaning further information on subject have begun to trouble mind hoped chance must give opportunity of privately questioning philip seemed to be equally husband wish to thwart such intention of hers remained in house place till after philip have left although be evidently so much fatigued a to give very distinct though unintentional hint to visitor to be gone at house door be locked on philip then daniel prepared to go to bed kester have left for loft above shippen more than hour before bell have still to rake fire then must follow husband upstairs a be scraping up ash heard intermixed with noise be making sound of one rapping gently at window in then frame of mind started little on looking round saw kester face pressed against glass reassured softly opened door there stood in dusk outer air distinct against gray darkness beyond in hand something presently perceived be pitchfork whispered ' have watched t ' maister t bed ' now 'd be greatly beholden to yo ' if yo let just lay down ' t house place 'd warrant niver constable ' monkshaven must get sight o ' t maister below t ' keep ward ' bell shivered

seemed to have got over irritability be unusually kind tender to wife daughter especially striving by silent little deed to make up for sharp word have said night before to latter a if by common consent allusion to saturday night proceeding be avoided spoke of day work before of crop to be sown of cattle of market one be conscious of wish to know more distinctly what be chance of danger to judge from philip word hung over falling upon cutting off from place for coming day bell longed to send kester down into monkshaven a sort of spy to see how land lay dared not manifest anxiety to husband must not see kester alone wished that have told to go to town when have have to herself in house place night before now seemed a though daniel be resolved not to part from a though have

time if at time that morning have have courage to speak together on thought be engrossing mind be possible that mean might have be found to avert calamity be coming towards with swift foot among uneducated partially educated nay even weakly educated feeling exists prompted futile experiment of well known ostrich imagine that by closing own eye to apprehended evil avert expression of fear be supposed to accelerate coming of cause yet on other hand shrink from acknowledging long continuance of blessing in idea that when unusual happiness be spoken about disappears so although perpetual complaint of past present grievance sorrow be most common among class shrink from embodying apprehension for future in word a if then took shape drew near four sate down to dinner not one of be inclined to eat food be scarcely touched on plate yet be trying to make talk among a usual seemed a though dared not let be silent when sylvia sitting opposite to window saw philip at top of brow running rapidly towards farm have be so full of anticipation of kind of misfortune morning that felt now a if be very precursive circumstance have be expecting stood up turning quite white pointing

note at time of sylvia one vivid look of unspoken thanks yet remembered afterwards ' will dang dead ' said kester rushing to door for saw what others did not that chance of escape be over constable be already at top of little field path not twenty yard off 'hide hide ' cried bell wringing hand in terror for indeed knew that flight must now be impossible daniel be heavy rheumatic moreover have be pretty severely bruised on unlucky night philip without word pushed daniel before upstairs feeling that own presence at haytersbank farm at hour of day must be betrayal have just time to shut up in larger bed room before heard scuffle constable entry down stair 'they be in ' said philip a daniel squeezed under bed then held quite still philip a much concealed by scanty blue check curtain a must manage to be heard confusion of voice below hasty moving of chair banging of door further parley then woman scream shrill pitiful then step on stair screech spoiled ' sighed philip in one instant door be opened of hiders be conscious of presence of constable although at first latter stood motionless surveying apparently empty room with disappointment then in moment have rushed at philip leg exposed a be drew out with violence then let go beeaster hepburn ' said one in amaze immediately put two two together for in so small place a monkshaven one relationship connexion even liking be known motive

through own house place saw poor wife quivering shaking over with effort to keep back sign of emotion until be gone sylvia standing by mother arm round bell waist stroking poor shrunken finger worked so perpetually nervously in futile unconscious restlessness kester be in corner of room sullenly standing bell quaked from head to foot a husband came down stair prisoner opened lip several time with uneasy motion a if must fain say something knew not what sylvia passionate swollen lip beautiful defiant eye gave face quite new aspect looked helpless fury ' may kiss missus reckon ' said daniel coming to standstill a passed near 'oh dannel dannel ' cried opening arm wide to receive dannel man shook with cry laying head on shoulder a if be stay comfort 'come missus come missus ' said 'there

be heard in little farmhouse kitchen sobbing wailing of woman philip stood by silent thinking a well a must for keen sympathy with grief what have best be done next kester after growl at sylvia for having held back uplifted arm thought might have saved daniel by well considered blow on captor a entered house went back into shippen cell for meditation consolation where might hope to soothe before going out to afternoon work labour master have planned for very morning with strange foresight a kester thought for job be one must take two three day without needing further direction than have received by end of time thought that master must be at liberty again so so thought in ignorance inexperience although daniel be unreasoning hasty impulsive in word often thinking acting very foolishly yet somehow from quality in character from loyalty of nature in with whom have to deal in day life have made place position clear a arbiter law giver of household on decision a of husband father master perhaps superior nature waited so now that be gone have left in such strange new circumstance so suddenly seemed a though bell sylvia knew exactly what to do when grief be spent so much have household action plan be regulated by thought of meanwhile philip have slowly be arriving at conclusion that be more wanted at monkshaven to look after daniel interest to learn what be legal probability in consequence of old man arrest to arrange for family accordingly than standing still silent in haytersbank kitchen too full of fellow feeling heavy foreboding to comfort awkwardly unsympathetic in appearance from very aching of heart so when aunt with instinctive sense of regularity propriety began to put away scarcely tasted dinner sylvia blinded with cry convulsively sobbing be yet trying to help mother philip took hat brushing round round with sleeve of coat said think will just go back see how matter stand have more distinct plan in head than word implied depended on so many contingency of be ignorant that said only few word with silent resolution to see again that day dread of being compelled to express fear so far beyond theirs went off without saying anything more then sylvia lifted up voice with great cry somehow have expected to do something what did not know be gone be left without stay help 'hush thee hush thee ' said mother trembling over 'it for best lord know 'but niver thought 'd leave ' moaned sylvia half in mother arm thinking of philip mother took word a applied to daniel 'and 'd niver have ' left wench if must have ' stayed mother mother be

cheer console february afternoon passed away continuous rain closing in daylight even earlier than usual adding to dreariness with natural accompaniment of wailing wind coming with long sweep over moor making sobbing at window always sound like gasp of one in great agony meanwhile philip have hastened back to monkshaven have umbrella have to face driving rain for greater part of way be thankful to weather for kept men indoors wanted to meet one to have time to think mature plan town be so to speak in mourning rescue of sailor be distinctly popular movement subsequent violence have indeed gone much further than have be described after daniel left be in general considered a only kind of due punishment inflicted in wild justice on press gang abettor feeling of monkshaven people be therefore in decided opposition to vigorous step taken by county magistrate who in consequence of appeal from naval officer in charge of impressment service have called out militia from distant inland county stationed within few mile have thus summarily quenched riot be continuing on sunday morning after somewhat languid fashion greater part of destruction of property having be accomplished during previous night still there be little doubt that violence must have be renewed a evening drew on more desperate part of population enraged sailor have have sabbath leisure to brood over wrong to encourage other in passionate attempt at redress revenge so authority be quite justified in decided step have taken both in own estimation then now in ours looking back on affair in cold blood at time feeling ran strongly against mean of expressing in action being prevented men brooded sullenly in own house philip a representative of family head of be now suffering for deed in popular cause must have met with more sympathy ay more respect than imagined a went along street glancing from side to side fearful of meeting who must shy a relation of one who have be ignominiously taken to bridewell few hour before in spite of wincing of philip from observation remark never dreamed of acting otherwise than a became brave true friend did must have done from natural faithfulness constancy of disposition without special regard for sylvia knew service be needed in shop business have left at moment warning awaited unfinished at time must not bear torture of giving explanation alleging reason to languid intelligence slow sympathy of coulson went to office of mr donkin oldest established most respected attorney in monkshaven who have be employed to draw up law paper deed of partnership consequent on hepburn coulson succeeding to shop of john jeremiah foster brother mr donkin knew philip from circumstance indeed nearly one in monkshaven knew other if not enough to speak to at least enough to be acquainted with personal appearance reputation of most of whom met in street so happened that mr donkin have favourable opinion of philip perhaps for reason latter have shorter time to wait before obtained interview with head of house than many of client who came for purpose from town country for many mile round philip be ushered in mr donkin sate with spectacle pushed up on forehead ready to watch countenance listen to word afternoon mr hepburn 'good afternoon sir ' philip hesitated how to begin mr donkin became impatient tapped with finger of left hand on desk philip

hesitating knock replied to inquiry a to whether mr dawson be at home in negative adding after moment pause 'he will be at home in le than hour be only gone to make mr dawson will mr dawson of

kester even allowed to go so far a to wonder what philip must want with money to seemed unaccountable once twice ugly thought crossed mind that shop conducted by young men be often not so profitable a when guided by older head of coin poured into philip keeping might have destination than defence of master poor philip be spending own more than own money one ever knew a have bound down friendly banker to secrecy once only kester ventured to speak to sylvia on subject of philip have followed cousin to field just in front of house just outside porch to ask question dared not put in mother presence bell indeed in anxiety usually absorbed question when philip came stood after philip have bid good by hardly thinking about at looking unconsciously after a ascended brow at top have turned to take last glance at place love inhabited seeing have waved hat in gratified farewell meanwhile be roused from far other thought than of of now acknowledged love by motion against sky be turning

for homely expression now applied to bell behe will never be t same woman again afternoon have cried to sleep in chair after philip departure have not heard sylvia sweeping passage through kitchen hour afterwards be startled up by kester abrupt entry 'where be sylvie ' asked ' know said bell looking scared a if be ready to cry 'it news about ' said standing up supporting on stick be now

took daniel from home placed in peril of death philip be glad that extremity of danger never having be hinted to bell travelling forty mile being most unusual exertion at time to person of class idea

went to bed at night bell said thing seemed a though morning feeling have be temporary a if be referring decision to period of husband return 'when father come home ' seemed sort of burden at beginning end of sentence reliance on certain coming back to be almost a great trial to sylvia a absence of hope have be in morning that instinct told that mother be becoming incapable of argument must have asked why view be so essentially changed in so few hour inability of reason in poor bell made sylvia feel very desolate monday passed over how of knew for spoke of what be filling thought of before be light on tuesday morning bell be astir 'it very early mother ' said weary sleepy sylvia dreading returning consciousness 'ay lass ' said bell in brisk cheerful tone will maybe be home to

about in way sylvia wondered to see till at length fancied that perhaps mother did so to drive away thought place be cleaned there be scarce time allowed for breakfast till at last long before mid day work be done two sat down to spinning wheel sylvia spirit sank lower lower at speech of mother from whose mind fear seemed to have disappeared leaving only strange restless kind of excitement 'it time

promised to be must not have defined why be dissatisfied if have be compelled to account for feeling must probably have alleged a reason that sylvia manner be so unchanged by new position towards be quiet gentle shyer no brighter coyer no happier than have be for month before when joined at field gate heart be beating fast eye be beaming out love at approach blushed smiled seemed absorbed in thought of kind resisted silent effort to draw away from path leading to house turned face steadily homewards murmured soft word scarcely heard right in way be stone trough for fresh bubbling water issuing from roadside spring served for household purpose of haytersbank farm by be milk can glittering clean sylvia knew must have to stop for carry back home in readiness for evening milking at time during action resolved to say what be on mind be there sylvia spoke kester have be saying a how might have ' be 'well said philip sylvia sate down on edge of trough dipped hot little hand in water then went on quickly lifting beautiful eye to philip face with look of inquiry think a charley kinraid may have ' be took by t ' press gang ' be first time have named name of former lover to present one since day long ago now when have quarrelled about rosy colour flushed all over sweet trustful eye never flinched from steady unconscious gaze philip heart stopped beating literally a if have come to sudden precipice while have thought securely walking on sunny greensward went purple over from dismay dared not take eye away from sad earnest look of hers be thankful that mist came before drew veil before brain heard own voice saying word did not seem to have framed in own mind 'kester d d fool ' growled say there be mebbe one chance ' hundred ' said sylvia pleading a be for kester 'but oh philip think yo ' there be just one chance ' there be chance sure enough said philip in kind of fierce despair made reckless what said did 'there be chance suppose for iverything ' life a have not

sylvia sent up little sharp cry at word longed at sound to take in arm hush up a mother hush weeping child very longing having to be repressed only made more beside with guilt anxiety rage be quite still now sylvia looking sadly down into bubbling merry flowing water philip glaring at wishing that next word be spoken though might stab to heart did not speak at length unable to bear longer said 'thou set deal o ' store on man sylvie ' if man have be there at moment philip must have grappled with not let go hold till one other be dead sylvia caught of passionate meaning of gloomy miserable

not hear ' said wrenching out of philip clasping arm 'they may misca for iver will not believe 'em `` ll niver miscall one who be dead ' said philip new unconscious sign of strength of sylvia love for former lover only making more anxious to convince that be dead only rendering more keen at deceiving own conscience by repeating to lie long ere kinraid be in probability dead killed by chance of war tempestuous sea that even if not be a good a dead to so that word might be used in honest certainty a in one of meaning kinraid be dead for sure 'think yo that if be not dead must have ' written ere

towards affianced husband last motive for action depressed lover more than anything wanted old sylvia back again captious capricious wilful haughty merry charming ala that sylvia be gone for ever once especially power arising from cause be stopped entirely short be utterly of avail be on occasion of dick simpson mortal illness sylvia mother kept aloof from one have never be intimate with family corneys even friendship have considerably cooled since molly marriage most especially since kinraid supposed death when bessy corney sylvia have be a be rival mourner many people in monkshaven country round about held robson family in great respect although mr robson be accounted 'high ' poor little sylvia in heyday of beautiful youth high spirit have be spoken of a ' bit flighty ' set up lassie ' still when great sorrow fell upon there be plenty of friend to sympathize deeply with a daniel have suffered in popular cause there be even more who scarcely knowing personally be ready to give mark of respect friendly feeling in power bell sylvia be aware of former have lost perception of what be not immediately before latter shrank from encounter of kind with sore heart sensitive avoidance of everything must make subject of remark so poor afflicted people at haytersbank knew little of monkshaven news what little did come to ear came through dolly reid when returned from selling farm produce of week often indeed even then found sylvia too much absorbed in other care thought to listen to gossip so no one have ever named that simpson be supposed to be dying till philip began on subject one evening sylvia face suddenly flashed into glow life be dying be t ' earth be well rid on fellow sylvie be hard speech o ' thine ' said philip 'it give poor heart to ask favour of thee ' 'if be aught about simpson ' replied then interrupted 'but say on be ill mannered in for t ' interrupt yo '' must be sorry to see think sylvie can not get over way t ' folk met pelted when came back

to simpson found though still alive past understanding of word of human forgiveness philip have almost wished have not troubled irritated sylvia by urging dying man request performance of duty seemed now to have be useless office after performance of duty be never useless office though may not see consequence may be quite different to what expected calculated on in pause of active work when daylight be done evening shade came on sylvia have time to think heart grew sad soft in comparison to what have be when philip urgency have called out angry opposition thought of father sharp passion frequent forgiveness rather forgetfulness that have even be injured sylvia persistent enduring quality be derived from mother impulse from father be dead father whose example filled mind evening in soft tender twilight did not say to herself that must go tell simpson that forgave thought that if philip asked again that must do so when saw philip again told that simpson be dead passed on from what have reason to think must be unpleasant subject to thus never learnt how conduct might have be more gentle relenting than word word came up into memory at future time with full measure of miserable significance in general sylvia be gentle good enough philip wanted to be shy tender with be not spoke to pretty eye looking straight composedly at consulted like family friend that be met quietly in arrangement for time of marriage looked upon more a change of home a leaving of haytersbank a must affect mother than in more directly personal way philip be beginning to feel though not a

disported on steep tiled roof just opposite to attic window insensibly philip grew to know way one pretty soft little dove be somehow perpetually associated in mind with idea of cousin sylvia pigeon

on what must have become of mother if have have thee for friend need be noane ungrateful philip tho sometimes fancy thou'rt thinking be ' want yo ' to be grateful sylvie ' said poor philip dissatisfied yet unable to explain what did want only knowing that there be something lacked yet fain must have have a marriage day drew near sylvia care seemed to be for mother anxiety be regarding appurtenance of home be leaving in vain philip tried to interest in detail of improvement contrivance in new home to be going to take did not tell idea of house behind shop be associated in mind with two time of discomfort misery first time have gone into parlour about philip spoke so much be at time of press gang riot when have fainted from terror excitement second be on night of misery when mother have gone in to monkshaven to bid father farewell before be taken to york in room on night have first learnt something of fatal peril in stood must not show bright shy curiosity about future dwelling be common enough with girl who be going to be married must do be to restrain from sighing listen patiently when talked on subject in time saw that shrank from so held peace planned worked for in silence smiling to a looked on completed arrangement for pleasure comfort knowing well that happiness be involved in what fragment of peace material comfort might remain to mother wedding day drew near apace be philip plan that after have be married in kirk moorside church sylvia cousin love wife must go for day to robin hood bay returning in evening to house behind shop in market place there be to find bell robson installed in future home for haytersbank farm be to be given up to new tenant on very day of wedding sylvia must not be married sooner said that must stay there till very last have said with such determination that philip have desisted from urgency at once have told that must be settled for mother comfort during few hour absence otherwise sylvia must not have gone at told must ask hester who be always so good kind who never yet have said nay to go to church with a bridesmaid for sylvia must give thought care to anything mother that must leave at haytersbank a returned from church must manage mr robson removal must do do do everything such friendly confidence have philip in hester willingness tender skill sylvia acquiesced at length philip took upon to speak to hester on subject 'hester said one day when be preparing to go home after shop be closed 'must yo mind stopping bit must like to show yo ' place now be done up have favour to ask on yo ' besides be so happy did not see shiver over hesitated just moment before answered `` ll stay if thou wish philip be judge o fashion such like ' 'thou'rt judge o comfort be what have be aiming at be niver so

part so come along hester tell if there be aught more can put in for sylvie ' might not have be very appropriate text such a be word must ask of thee turn not thou away ' seemed only source of strength must have enabled to go patiently through next half hour a be unselfishly brought mind to bear upon subject admired thought decided upon that a one by one philip showed alteration improvement never be such quiet little bit of unconscious unrecognized heroism really ended by such conquest of self that must absolutely sympathize with proud expectant lover have quenched envy of beloved in sympathy with delight imagined sylvia must experience when discovered proof of philip fond consideration care be great strain on heart that source of life when hester returned into parlour after deliberate survey of house felt a weary depressed in bodily strength a if have gone through illness of many day sate down on nearest chair felt a though never must rise again philip joyous content stood near talking 'and hester ' said beylvie have given message for thee say thou must be bridesmaid will have none other can not ' said hester with sudden sharpness yes yo ' must must be like

on point of urging afresh to go with to church something in eye brought thought across mind a transitory a breath pass over looking glass desisted from entreaty put away thought a piece of vain

insomuch sylvia not being at hand to reply to mother cry for latter imagined that child a well a husband be in danger of trial death refused to be comforted by endeavour of patient sympathizing hester in pause of mr robson sob hester heard welcome sound of wheel of returning shandry bearing bride bridegroom home stopped at door instant sylvia white a sheet at sound of mother wailing have caught
