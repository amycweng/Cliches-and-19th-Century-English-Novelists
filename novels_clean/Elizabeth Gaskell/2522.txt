by way never refused yet daily mr wilkins be sinking from intellectually to sensually self indulgent man lay late in bed hated mr dunster for significant glance at office clock when announced to master that such such client have be waiting more than hour to keep appointment why did see dunster be sure must have done quite a well a mr wilkins sometimes replied partly with view of saying something pleasant to man whom disliked feared mr dunster always replied in meek matter of fact tone oh sir must like to talk over affair with subordinate time said speech of same kind idea came more more clearly into mr wilkins head of how pleasant must be to to take dunster into partnership thus throw responsibility of real work drudgery upon clerk shoulder importunate client who must make appointment at unseasonable hour must keep to might confide in partner though must not in clerk great objection to course be first foremost mr wilkins strong dislike to mr dunster repugnance to

gentleman from distant part of shire must ignore dunster existence a partner pertinaciously demanded to see mr wilkins on important business chapter v few day afterwards ellinor father bethought that same further communication ought to take place between daughter lover regarding approval of family of latter to young man engagement accordingly wrote very gentlemanly letter saying that of course trusted that ralph have informed father of engagement that mr corbet be well known to mr wilkins by reputation holding position did in shropshire that a mr wilkins did not pretend to be in same

goodnatured girl meant harm in repeating father word touched up be true by of dislike felt to intimate alliance proposed must make sister in law to daughter of upstart attorney not received in county always trying to push way into set above claiming connection with de wintons of castle who a well knew only laughed when be spoken of said be more rich in relation than be aware of not people papa must ever like to know might be family connection little speech told in way girl who uttered did not intend must mr corbet daughter set violently against foolish entanglement of ralph must not call engagement argued urged pleaded till squire anxious for peace at price always more under sway of people who be with however unreasonable might be than of absent even though have wisdom of solomon

communicated to a for ellinor trembled over with happiness summer for blossoming of flower ripening of fruit have not be known for year seemed to a if bountiful loving nature wanted to fill cup of ellinor joy to overflowing a if everything animate inanimate sympathised with happiness father be well apparently content miss monro be very kind dixon lameness be quite gone off only mr dunster came creeping about house on pretence of business seeking out father disturbing leisure with dust coloured parchment skinned careworn face seeming to disturb smooth current of daily life whenever saw ellinor made appearance at hamley assembly with le eclat than father lover expected beauty natural grace be admired by who must discriminate to greater number there be what called want of style want of elegance there certainly be not for figure be perfect though moved shyly moved well perhaps be not good place for correct appreciation of miss wilkins of old dowager thought piece of presumption in to be there at lady holster of day who remembered husband quarrel with mr wilkins looked away whenever ellinor came near resented opinion miss wilkins be descended from sir frank family one of oldest in county objection might have be made year ago to father a have be received did not know why miss wilkins be to be alluded to a out of place ellinor greatest enjoyment in evening be to hear father

purpose of watching ellinor pearl too be a handsome a in room child must have re set spray be old fashioned now let have to morrow to send up to hancock papa please have rather keep a be a mamma wore be touched in minute very well darling god bless for thinking of ordered set of sapphire instead for next assembly ball be not such a to intoxicate ellinor with success make in love with gaiety large party came from different country house in neighbourhood danced with other when have exhausted resource brought with have generally few dance to spare for friend of same standing with whom be most intimate ellinor came with father joined old card playing dowager by way of chaperone said dowager being under old business obligation to firm of wilkins son apologizing to acquaintance for own weak condescension to mr wilkins foible in wishing to introduce daughter into society above natural sphere be upon lady after have uttered such speech a one have just mentioned that lady holster have come down with pedigree of ellinor mother though old dowager have drawn back little discomfited at lady reply be not more attentive to ellinor in consequence allowed mr wilkins to bring in daughter place on crimson sofa beside spoke to occasionally in interval elapsed before rubber must be properly arranged in card room invited girl to accompany to sober amusement on ellinor declining preferring to remain with father dowager left with sweet smile on plump countenance approving conscience somewhere within portly frame assuring that have done must possibly have be expected from towards that good wilkins daughter ellinor stood by father watching dance thankful for occasional chance of dance while have be sitting by chaperone mr wilkins have made tour of room dropping out little fact of daughter being present wherever thought seed likely to bring forth fruit of partner came because liked mr wilkins asked ellinor because have done duty dance to own party might please so that usually have average of one invitation to three dance principally towards end of evening considering real beauty care father always took about appearance met with far le than due of admiration admiration did not care for partner did sometimes felt mortified when have to sit stand quiet during first part of evening if have not be for father wish must much rather have stayed at home nevertheless talked even to irresponsive old dowager fairly chatted to father when got beside because did not like to fancy that be not enjoying indeed have so much happiness in daily course of part of life that on looking back upon afterwards must not imagine anything brighter than have be delight of receiving lover letter anxious happiness of replying to always little bit fearful lest must not express herself love in precisely happy medium becoming maiden father love satisfaction in calm prosperity of whole household be delightful at time looking back upon be dreamlike occasionally mr corbet came down to see always slept on occasion at mr ness be at ford bank greater part of one day between two night that allowed for length of visit even short peep be not frequently taken be working hard at law fagging at nail arranging whole life so a best to promote end of ambition feeling delight in surpassing mastering fellow who started in race at same time read ellinor letter over over again nothing else beside law book perceived repressed love hidden away in subdued expression in communication with amused pleasure at attempt at concealment be glad that gaiety be not more gay be glad that be not too much admired although little indignant at want of taste on part of shire gentleman if other admirer have come prominently forward must have have to take more decided step to assert right than have hitherto done for have caused ellinor to express wish to father that engagement must not be too much talked about until nearer time when must be prudent for to marry thought that knowledge of only imprudently hasty step ever meant to take in life might go against character for wisdom if fact became known while be a yet only student mr wilkins wondered little acceded a always did to of ellinor request mr ness be confidant of course of lady maria connection heard of forgot again very soon a happened one else be sufficiently interested in ellinor to care to ascertain fact time mr ralph corbet maintained very quietly decided attitude towards own family be engaged to miss wilkins must say be felt sorry that disapproved of be not able to marry just at present before time for marriage arrived trusted that family must take more reasonable view of thing be willing to receive a wife with becoming respect affection be substance of what repeated in different form in reply to father angry letter at length invariable determination made way with father paternal thunderings be subdued to distant rumbling in sky presently inquiry be broached a to how much fortune miss wilkins must have how much down on marriage what be eventual probability now be point mr ralph corbet wished to be informed upon have not thought much about in making engagement have be too young too much in love only child of wealthy attorney ought to have something considerable allowance so a to enable young couple to start housekeeping in moderately good part of town must be advantage to in profession so replied to father adroitly suggesting that letter containing certain modification of inquiry have be rather roughly put in mr corbet last must be sent to in order that might ascertain from mr wilkins what be ellinor prospect a regarded fortune desired letter came not in such form that must pas on to mr wilkins preferred to make quotation even quotation be little altered dressed before sent on gist of letter to mr wilkins be stated that hoped soon to be in position to offer ellinor home that anticipated steady progress in profession consequently in income that contingency might arise a father suggested must deprive of power of earning livelihood perhaps when might be more required than must be at first that be true that after mother death small estate in shropshire must come to a second son of course ellinor must receive benefit of property secured to legally a mr wilkins thought best that being matter for after discussion at present father be anxious a might be seen from extract to ascertain whether mr wilkins must secure from contingency of having son widow possible child thrown upon hand by giving ellinor dowry if so be gently insinuated what must be amount of same when mr wilkins received letter startled out of happy day dream liked ralph corbet whole connection quite well enough to give consent to engagement sometimes even be glad to think that ellinor future be assured that must have protector friend after be dead gone did not want to assume responsibility so soon have not distinctly contemplated marriage a event likely to happen before death must not understand how own life must go on without indeed why ralph corbet must not continue just a be at present came down to breakfast with letter in hand by ellinor blush a glanced at handwriting knew that have heard from lover by same post by tender caress caress given a if to make up for pain prospect of leaving be sure to cause be certain that be aware of content of letter yet put in pocket tried to forget did not merely from reluctance to complete arrangement might facilitate ellinor marriage there be further annoyance connected with affair money matter have be for time in involved state have be living beyond income even reckoning that a always did at highest point ever touched kept regular account reasoning with perhaps must rather say persuading that there be great occasion for regular account when have steady income arising from profession a well a interest of good sum of money left by father when living in own house near country town where provision be cheap expenditure for small family only one child must never amount to anything like incoming from above mentioned source servant horse choice wine rare fruit tree habit of purchasing book engraving may take fancy irrespective of price run away with money even though there be one child year two ago mr wilkins have be startled into system of exaggerated retrenchment retrenchment only lasted about six week by sudden bursting of bubble speculation in have invested part of father saving a soon a change in habit necessitated by new economy became irksome have comforted for relapse into former easy extravagance of living by remembering fact that ellinor be engaged to son of man of large property that though ralph be only second son yet mother estate must come to a mr ness have already mentioned on first hearing of engagement mr wilkins did not doubt that must easily make ellinor fitting allowance even pay down requisite dowry doing so must involve examination into real state of affair involved distasteful trouble have idea how much more than mere temporary annoyance must arise out of investigation until be made decided in own mind that must not speak to ellinor on subject of lover letter so for next few day be kept in suspense seeing little of father during short time be with be made aware that be nervously anxious to keep conversation engaged on general topic rather than on one have at heart a have already said mr corbet have written to by same post a on sent letter to father telling of content begging in sweet word lover know how to use to urge father to compliance for sake lover who be pining lonely in crowd of london since loved presence be not there did not care for money save a mean of hastening marriage indeed if there be only income fixed however small time for marriage fixed however distant must be patient did not want superfluity of wealth habit be simple a well knew money enough must be theirs in time from share of contingency certainty of finally possessing bromley ellinor delayed replying to letter until father must have spoken to on subject a perceived that avoided such conversation young girl heart failed began to blame for wishing to leave to reproach for being accessory to step made shun being alone with look distressed full of care a did now be usual struggle between father lover for possession of love instead of natural graceful resignation of parent to prescribed course of thing a usual be poor girl who bore suffering for fault of own although blamed for being cause of disturbance in previous order of affair ellinor have one to speak to confidentially father lover when be at issue must talk openly to so brooded over mr corbet unanswered letter father silence became pale dispirited once twice looked up suddenly caught father eye gazing upon with certain wistful anxiety instant saw pulled up a be must begin talking gaily about small topic of day at length mr corbet grew impatient at not hearing from mr wilkins ellinor wrote urgently to former making known to new proposal suggested to by father be that certain sum must be paid down by mr wilkins to be applied under management of trustee to improvement of bromley estate out of profit of other source in elder mr corbet hand heavy rate of interest must be paid on advance must secure income to young couple immediately considerably increase value of estate upon ellinor settlement be to be made term offered for laying down of ready money be so advantageous that mr wilkins be strongly tempted to accede to at once a ellinor pale cheek want of appetite have only that very morning smote upon conscience immediate transfer of ready money be a sacrifice soothing balm to self reproach laziness dislike to immediate unpleasantness of action have counterbalancing weakness in imprudence mr wilkins made rough calculation on piece of paper deed such test of accuracy being down at office discovered that must pay down sum required wrote letter agreeing to proposal before sealed called ellinor into study bade read what have be writing tell what thought of watched colour come rushing into white face lip quiver tremble even before letter be ended be in arm kissing

to read letter again think over in peace so at early hour wished miss monro good night went up into own room above drawing room overlooking flower garden shrubbery path to stable yard by father be sure to return went upstairs studied letter well tried to recall speech conduct on miserable evening a thought then not knowing what true misery be head ached put out candle went sat on window seat looking out into moonlit garden watching for father opened window partly to cool forehead partly to enable to call down softly when must see coming along by by door from stable yard into shrubbery clicked opened in moment saw mr wilkins moving through bush not alone mr dunster be with two be talking together in rather excited tone immediately lost to hearing however a entered mr wilkins study by outer door have be dining together somewhere probably at mr hanbury hamley brewer thought ellinor how provoking that must have come home with papa night of night two three time before mr dunster have called on mr wilkins in evening a ellinor knew be not quite aware of reason for such late visit have never put together two fact a cause consequence on such occasion father have be absent from office day that there might be necessary business for to transact urgency of be motive for mr dunster visit mr wilkins always seemed to be annoyed by coming at so late hour spoke of resenting intrusion upon leisure ellinor without consideration adopted father mode of speaking thinking on subject be rather more angry than be whenever obnoxious partner came on business in evening night be of night most ill purposed time so ellinor thought for tete tete with father however there be doubt in mind a to what have to do so late a be unwelcome visitor must not stop long then must go down have little confidence with father beg to see mr livingstone when came next morning dismiss a gently a might be sat on in window seat dreaming waking dream of future happiness kept losing in such thought became almost afraid of forgetting why sat there presently felt cold got up to fetch shawl in muffled resumed place seemed to growing very late moonlight be coming fuller fuller into garden blackness of shadow be more concentrated stronger surely mr dunster must not have gone away along dark shrubbery path so noiselessly what must have heard there be swell of voice coming up through window from father study angry voice be anger rose sympathetically a knew that father be being irritated there be sudden movement a of chair pushed hastily aside then mysterious unaccountable noise heavy sudden then slight movement a of chair again then profound stillness ellinor leaned head against side of window to listen more intently for mysterious instinct made sick faint sound no noise only by by heard what have heard at such time of intent listening beating of pulse of heart then whirling rush of blood through head how long did last never knew by by heard father hurried footstep in bedroom next to hers when ran thither to speak to ask be amiss if anything have be if might come to now about mr livingstone letter found that have gone down again to study almost at same moment heard little private outer door of room open one went out then there be hurried footstep along shrubbery path thought of course that be mr dunster leaving house went back for mr livingstone letter having found passed through father room to private staircase thinking that if went by more regular way must have run risk of disturbing miss monro perhaps of being questioned in morning even in passing down remote staircase trod softly for fear of being overheard when entered room full light of candle dazzled for instant coming out of darkness be flaring wildly in draught came in through open door by outer air be admitted for moment there seemed one in room then saw with strange sick horror leg of one lying on carpet behind table a if compelled even while shrank from doing went round to see who be that lay there so still motionless a never to stir at sudden coming be mr dunster head propped on chair cushion eye open staring distended there be strong smell of brandy hartshorn in room smell so powerful a not to be neutralized by free current of night air blew through two open door ellinor must not have told whether be reason instinct that made act a did during awful night in thinking of afterwards with shuddering avoidance of haunting memory must come overshadow during many many year of life grew to believe that powerful smell of spilt brandy absolutely intoxicated unconscious rechabite in practice something gave presence of mind courage not own though learnt to think afterwards that have acted unwisely if not wrongly wickedly yet marvelled in recalling time how must have then behaved a did first of lifted up from fascinated gaze at dead man went to staircase door by have entered study shut softly then went back looked again took brandy bottle knelt down tried to pour into mouth found must not do then wetted handkerchief with spirit moistened lip to purpose for a have said before man be dead killed by rupture of vessel of brain how occasioned must tell by by of course ellinor little care effort produced effect father have tried before vain endeavour to bring back precious breath of life poor girl must not bear look of open eye softly tenderly tried to close although unconscious that in so doing be rendering pious office of beloved hand to dead man be sitting by body on floor when heard step coming with rushing yet cautious tread through shrubbery have fear although might be tread of robber murderer awfulness of hour raised above common fear though did not go through usual process of reasoning by feel assured that foot be coming so softly swiftly along be same have heard leaving room in like manner only quarter of hour before father entered started back almost upsetting one behind by recoil on seeing daughter in motionless attitude by dead man god ellinor what have brought here said almost fiercely answered a one stupefied know be dead hush hush child can not be helped raised eye to solemn pitying awe stricken face behind father countenance of dixon be dead asked of man stepped forward respectfully pushing master on one side a did so bent down over corpse looked listened then reaching candle off table signed mr wilkins to close door mr

fancied that to conceal body be must be required have not looked forward to long weary course of small lie to be done said involved in one mistaken action yet while father word made soul revolt appearance melted heart a caught half turned away from looking straight at miss monro at anything materially visible hollow sunken eye seemed to ellinor to have vision of dead man before cheek be livid worn healthy colouring gained by year of hearty out door exercise be gone into wanness of age hair even to ellinor seemed greyer for past night of wretchedness stooped looked dreamily earthward where formerly have stood erect needed pity called forth by such observation to quench ellinor passionate contempt for course on father be embarked when heard repeat word to servant who came with broth fletcher go to mr jackson inquire if mr dunster be come home yet want to speak to to lying dead where have be laid killed by man who now asked for presence ellinor shut eye lay back in despair

gone off with one know how much out of trust of firm before only child fell ill to tell truth looked burnt scared with affliction have startled look said a if never must tell after such experience from side awful proof of uncertainty of earth must appear terrible phantom of unforeseen dread rich poor town country sympathised with rich cared not to press claim business at time only wondered in superficial talk after dinner how such good fellow a wilkins must ever have be deceived by man like dunster even sir frank holster lady forgot old quarrel came to inquire after ellinor sent hothouse fruit by bushel mr corbet behaved a anxious lover must do wrote daily to miss monro to beg for most minute bulletin procured everything in town that doctor even fancied might be of service came down a

night before when window door stood open to admit least breath stirred sultry july air servant on velvet tiptoe have stolen up to ellinor open door have beckoned out of chamber of sleeper ever watchful nurse miss monro gentleman want be word housemaid dared to say so close to bedroom softly softly miss monro stepped down stair into drawing room there saw mr livingstone did not know have

reproachfully at if even nightingale sang owl hooted in tree outside open window yet who paused to say outside mr wilkins chamber door father room have not be in bed for six night till to night pray make noise to waken on into deep stillness of hushed room where one clear ray of hidden lamp light shot athwart door where watcher breathing softly sat beside bed where ellinor dark head lay motionless on white pillow face almost a white form almost a still might have heard pin fall after while moved to withdraw miss monro jealous of sound followed with step more heavy because be taken with so much care down stair back into drawing room by bed candle flaring in draught saw that there be glittering mark of wet tear on cheek felt a said afterwards sorry for young man yet urged to go

to ask about might not like not poor creature be not likely to care to hear anything long while never roused at mr corbet name mr corbet said livingstone below breath turned went away time for good ellinor recovered knew be recovering when day after day felt involuntary strength appetite return body seemed stronger than will for must have induced to creep into grave shut eye for ever on world so full of trouble lay for most part with eye closed very still quiet thought with intensity of one who seek for lost peace can not find began to see that if in mad impulse of mad nightmare of horror have strengthened other dared to be frank open confessing great fault greater disaster greater woe in first instance be hardly crime future course though sad sorrowful must have be simple straightforward one to tread be not for to undo what be done to reveal error shame of father only turning anew to god in solemn quiet watch of night made covenant that in conduct own personal individual life must act loyally truthfully a for future terrible chance involved in must leave in hand if indeed here came in tempter must watch over one whose life hereafter must seem based upon lie only plea offered standing afar off be lie be said done over be not for own sake can filial piety be so overcome by right of justice truth a to demand of must reveal father guilt father severe sharp punishment began knew why suffered what made young strength falter tremble what made life seem nigh about to be quenched in death yet must not take sorrow care in natural manner be obliged to think how word deed must be construed fancied that people be watching with suspicious eye when nothing be further from thought for once let public of place be possessed by idea be more difficult to dislodge than one imago who have not tried if mr wilkins have gone into hamley market place proclaimed guilty of manslaughter of mr dunster nay if have detailed circumstance people must have exclaimed poor man be crazed by discovery of unworthiness of man trusted so wonder be such thing to have done to have defrauded partner to extent then have made off to america for many small circumstance stop to detail here went far to prove a know unfounded supposition mr wilkins who be known from handsome boyhood through comely manhood up to present time by people in hamley be object of sympathy respect to one who saw a passed by old lorn haggard before time through evil conduct of one london bred who be a hard unlovely stranger to popular mind of little country town mr wilkins own servant liked working of temptation be such a must understand if have be hot tempered have also be generous must rather say careless lavish with money now that be cheated impoverished by partner delinquency thought wonder that drank long deep in solitary evening passed at home be not that be without invitation one came forward to testify respect for by asking to house have probably never be so universally popular since father death a said did not care to go into society while daughter be so ill have spirit for company if one have cared to observe conduct at home to draw conclusion from must have noticed anxious a be about ellinor rather avoided than sought presence now that consciousness memory be restored did ask for wish for presence of be burden to other oh sad woeful night of may overshadowing coming summer month with gloom bitter remorse chapter viii still youth prevailed over ellinor got well a have said even when must fain have died afternoon came when left room miss monro must gladly have made festival of recovery have have conveyed into unused drawing room ellinor begged that might be taken into library into schoolroom anywhere thought not looking on side of house on flower garden have

connected with dunster disappearance be glad that mr ness joining gave leisure to consider little end of reflection be that next day monday went into town artfully learnt must hear about mr dunster character mode of going on with still more skill extracted popular opinion a to embarrassed nature of mr wilkins affair embarrassment be generally attributed to dunster disappearance with good large sum belonging to firm in possession mr corbet thought otherwise have accustomed to seek out baser motif for men conduct to call result of research wisdom imagined that dunster have be well paid by mr wilkins for disappearance be easy way of accounting for derangement of account loss of money arose in fact from mr wilkins extravagance of habit growing intemperance on monday afternoon said to ellinor mr ness interrupted yesterday in very interesting conversation do remember love ellinor reddened kept head still more intently bent over sketch be making yes recollect have be thinking about still think ought to tell lover that such disgrace hung over mean over family with whom be going to connect of course only effect must be to make stand by still more for frankness oh ralph might perhaps be something ought not to tell came of silence of course there might be sort of case unless knew more must not pretend to judge be said rather more coolly have desired effect ellinor laid down

ellinor unspoken secret severing like phantom have given word that must make further inquiry from indeed thought must well enough make out outline of past event still there be too much left to conjecture for mind not to be always busy on subject felt inclined to probe mr wilkins in after dinner conversation in host be frank lax enough on many subject once touch on name of dunster mr wilkins sank into kind of suspicious depression of spirit talking little with evident caution from time to time shooting furtive glance at interlocutor face ellinor be resolutely impervious to attempt of to bring conversation with back to subject more more engrossed ralph corbet mind have done duty a understood have received assurance be only too glad to believe fondly with tender faith of heart came to

family on head began in honest blustering way in tete tetes after dinner to hope that ralph be thinking better than to run head into confounded hamley attorney noose ralph gravely required mr corbet to explain meaning professed not to understand so worded when squire have with much perplexity put into plain term of hoping that son be thinking of breaking off engagement to miss wilkins ralph

terribly ralph be silent unsympathising trying to nerve up to be disagreeable finding difficult in face of such sweet trust do remember conversation last autumn ellinor began at length head sunk be near garden seat quietly sat down without speaking about disgrace then fancied hung over answer doe still hang over yes whispered with heavy sigh father know of course yes again in same tone then silence think be doing harm at length ralph went on decidedly be afraid be said in low tone wish must tell what be said little impatiently might be able to help about must not replied ellinor be sorry to very heart to tell did did not want help be past wanted to know if thought that person situated a be be justified in marrying one ignorant of what might happen what do hope trust never will if know what be alluding to in mysterious way must see see love be in position of ignorant man whom think said must not feel right to marry why tell straight out what be must not help irritation betraying in tone manner of speaking bent little forward looked full into face a though to pierce to very heart truth of then said a quietly a have ever spoken in life wish to break off engagement reddened grew indignant in moment what nonsense just because ask question make remark think illness must have made fanciful ellinor surely nothing said deserves such interpretation on contrary have not shown sincerity depth of affection to by clinging to through through everything be going to say through wearying opposition of family stopped short for knew that very fact of mother opposition have only made more determined to have own way in first instance even now did not intend to let out what have concealed up to time that friend regretted imprudent engagement ellinor sat silently gazing out upon meadow seeing nothing then put hand into quite trust ralph be wrong to doubt be afraid have grown fanciful silly be rather put to for right word for have precisely divined dim thought that have overshadowed mind when have looked so intently at caressed reassured with fond word a incoherent a lover word generally be by by sauntered homewards when reached house ellinor left flew up to see how father be when ralph went into own room be vexed with for what have said for what have not said mental look out be not satisfactory mr wilkins be in good humour with world in general at dinner time need little in such case to condense turn lowering temper into one particular direction a long a ellinor miss monro stayed in dining room sort of moody peace have be kept up lady talking incessantly to other about trivial nothing of daily life with instinctive consciousness that if did not chatter on something must be said by one of gentleman must be distasteful to other a soon a ralph have shut door behind mr wilkins went to sideboard took out bottle have not previously made appearance have little cognac asked with assumption of carelessness a poured out wine glassful be capital thing for headache nasty lowering weather have given racking headache day be sorry for said ralph for wanted particularly to speak to about business about marriage in fact well speak away be a clear headed a man if be what mean ralph bowed little contemptuously what wanted to say be that be anxious to have thing arranged for marriage in august ellinor be so much better now in fact so strong that think may reckon upon standing change to london life pretty well mr wilkins stared at rather blankly did not immediately speak of course may have deed drawn up in a by previous arrangement advance certain portion of ellinor fortune for purpose therein to be assigned a settled last year when hoped to have be married in august thought flitted through mr wilkins confused brain that must find impossible to produce thousand required without having recourse to money lender who be already making difficulty charging usurious interest for advance have lately made unwisely tried to obtain diminution in sum have originally proposed to give ellinor unwisely because might have read ralph character better than to suppose must easily consent to diminution without good sufficient reason being given without promise of compensating advantage in future for present sacrifice asked from perhaps mr wilkins dulled a be by wine thought must allege good sufficient reason for said must not be hard upon ralph that promise be made before before exactly knew state of affair before dunster disappearance in fact said mr corbet fixing steady penetrating eye on mr wilkins countenance yes exactly before dunster mumbled out mr wilkins red confused not finishing sentence by way said ralph for with careful carelessness of manner thought must extract something of real nature of impending disgrace from companion in state in then be if only knew more about danger must guard against guard others perhaps by way have ever heard anything of dunster since went off to america be thought be startled beyond power of self control by instantaneous change in mr wilkins question produced started up mr wilkins white shaking trying to say something unable to form sensible sentence good god sir what be matter said ralph alarmed at sign of physical suffering mr wilkins sat down repelled nearer approach without speaking be nothing only headache shoot through at time look at sir in way be very unpleasant to find man eye perpetually fixed upon beg pardon said ralph coldly short lived sympathy thus repulsed giving way to curiosity waited for minute two without daring to renew conversation at point where have stopped whether interrupted by bodily mental discomfort on part of companion be not quite sure while hesitated how to begin again on subject mr wilkins pulled bottle of brandy to filled glass again tossing off spirit a if have be water then tried to look mr corbet full in face with stare a pertinacious a must make very different from keen observant gaze be trying to read through what be talking about said ralph at length with most natural air in world just a if have really be forgetful of half discussed subject of interest of what 'd d d deal better hold tongue about growled out mr wilkins in surly thick voice sir said ralph starting to foot with real passion at being so addressed by wilkins attorney yes continued latter will manage own affair allow of meddling questioning said so once before be not minded bad came of now say again if be to come here put impertinent question stare at a have be doing half hour past why sooner leave house better ralph half turned to take at word go at once then gave ellinor chance a worded in thought be in spirit of conciliation that said have taken too much of stuff sir know what be saying if did must leave house at once never to return think so do said mr wilkins trying to stand up look dignified sober say sir that if ever venture again to talk look a have done to night why sir will ring bell have shown door by servant so now be warned fine fellow sat down laughing foolish tipsy laugh of triumph in minute arm be held firmly gently by ralph listen mr wilkins said in low hoarse voice will never have to say to twice what have said to night henceforward be a stranger to other a to ellinor tone softened little sighed in spite of think must have be happy believe engagement be formed when be too young to know own mind must have done duty kept to word sir have severed connection between by insolence to night to be turned out of house by servant corbet of westley who must not submit to such threat from peer of realm let be ever so drunk be out of room almost out of house before have spoken last word mr wilkins sat still first fiercely angry then astonished lastly dismayed into sobriety corbet corbet ralph called in vain then got up went to door opened looked into fully lighted hall be so quiet there that must hear quiet voice of woman in drawing room talking together thought for moment went to hat stand missed ralph low crowned straw hat then sat down once more in dining room endeavoured to make out exactly what have passed must not believe that mr corbet have come to enduring final resolution to break off engagement have almost reasoned back into former state of indignation at impertinence injury when ellinor came in pale hurried anxious papa what doe mean said putting open note into hand took up glass hand shook so that must hardly read note be from parsonage to ellinor only three line sent by mr ness servant who have come to fetch mr corbet thing have written three line with consideration for ellinor even when

doing be afraid said something long ago about possible disgrace pushed away stood up looked at with eye dilated half in fear half in fierceness of animal at bay did not heed that abrupt movement have almost thrown prostrate on ground ellinor oh darling father listen said creeping to knee clasping with hand said a if be possible case of one else last august immediately applied asked if be over disgrace shame forget word used hung what must say anything anything to put off scent god help be lost man betrayed by child ellinor let go knee covered face one stabbed at poor heart in minute so

recognised that be only baseless vision used to put disappointment of hope down to ellinor unvaried calmness of demeanour might be taken for coldness of disposition to steady refusal to allow miss monro to invite canon livingstone to small tea be in habit of occasionally giving yet persevered in call about once fortnight came must sit hour more looking covertly at watch a if a miss monro shrewdly observed to herself did not go away at last because wished to do so because ought sometimes ellinor be present sometimes be away in latter case miss monro thought must detect certain wistful

where be for so many morning have wakened up in strange place that took several minute before must make out geographical whereabouts of heavy blue moreen curtain print of lord lieutenant of county on wall handsome ponderous mahogany furniture stuffed up room a soon a full memory came into mind started up did go to bed again although saw by watch on dressing table that be not yet six o'clock dressed with dainty completeness so habitual to that have become unconscious habit then instinct be irrepressible put on bonnet shawl went down past servant on knee cleaning doorstep out into fresh open air so found way down high street to hellingford castle building in court of assize be held prison in dixon lay condemned to die almost knew must not see yet seemed like amends to conscience for

desire a to see condemned prisoner be treated by a wish that people might have did have people a far removed from circle of circumstance a inhabitant of moon of course met with same reply little more abruptly given a if man be from birth bound to know obvious regulation went out past porter now fully clothed be sorry for disappointment must not help saying with slight tone of exultation well see be right ma'be walked a nearly round castle a ever must looking up at few high barred window must see wondering in what part of building dixon be confined then went into adjoining churchyard sitting down upon tombstone gazed idly at view spread below view be considered a lion of place to be shown to stranger by inhabitant of hellingford ellinor did not see however only saw blackness of fatal night hurried work lantern glancing to fro only heard hard breathing of who be engaged upon unwonted labour few hoarse muttered word swaying of branch to fro at once church clock above struck eight then pealed out for distant labourer to cease work for time such be old custom of place ellinor rose up made way back to mr johnson house in high street room felt close confined in awaited interview with mr johnson who have sent down apology for having overslept at last made appearance in hurried half awakened state in consequence of late hospitality of night before be so sorry gave so much
