woman thought travelled in one circle be that master miller have told on account to let man into place during absence that did not know if must not think two woman a bad yet that a be not men one must say have disobeyed for be shame to let dog be out such night a amante with ready wit told to let one know that have taken shelter there that night that then master must not blame while be thus enjoining secrecy a wisest course with view to far other people than miller be hastily helping to take off wet clothes spreading a well a brown mantle have covered before great stove warmed room with effectual heat that old woman failing vitality required time poor creature be discussing with a to whether have disobeyed order in kind of garrulous way that made fear much for capability of retaining anything secret if be questioned by by wandered away to unnecessary revelation of master whereabouts gone to help in search for landlord sieur de poissy who lived at chateau just above who have not returned from chase day before so intendant imagined might have met with accident have summoned neighbour to beat forest hill side told much besides giving to understand that must fain meet with place a housekeeper where there be more servant le to do a life here be very lonely dull especially since master son have gone away gone to war then took supper be evidently apportioned out to with sparing hand a even if idea have come into head have not enough to offer fortunately warmth be that required that thanks to amante care be returning to chilled body after supper old woman grew drowsy seemed uncomfortable at idea of going to sleep leaving still in house indeed gave pretty broad hint a to propriety of going once more out into bleak stormy night begged to be allowed to stay under shelter of kind at last bright idea came over bade mount by ladder to kind of loft went half over lofty mill kitchen in be sitting obeyed what else must do found in spacious floor without safeguard wall boarding railing to keep from falling over into kitchen in case went too near edge be in fact store room garret for household there be bedding piled up box chest mill sack winter store of apple nut bundle of old clothes broken furniture many other thing sooner be up there than old woman dragged ladder by have ascended away with chuckle a if be now secure that must do mischief sat down again once more to doze await master return pulled out bedding gladly laid down in dried clothes in warmth hoping to have sleep so much needed to refresh prepare for next day must not sleep be aware from breathing that amante be equally wakeful must see through crevice between board formed flooring into kitchen below very partially lighted by common lamp that hung against wall near stove on opposite side to on be portion iii far on in night there be voice outside reached in hiding place angry knocking at door saw through chink old woman rouse up to go open for master who came in evidently half drunk to sick horror be followed by lefebvre apparently a sober wily a ever be talking together a came in disputing about something miller stopped conversation to swear at old woman for having fallen asleep with tipsy anger even with blow drove poor old creature out of kitchen to bed then lefebvre went on talking about sieur de poissy disappearance seemed that lefebvre have be out day along with other of husband men ostensibly assisting in search in probability trying to blind sieur de poissy follower by putting on wrong scent also fancied from one two of lefebvre sly question combining hidden purpose of discovering although miller be tenant vassal to sieur de poissy seemed to to be much more in league with people of m de la tourelle be evidently aware in part of life lefebvre others led although again suppose knew imagined one half of crime also think be seriously interested in discovering fate of master little suspecting lefebvre of murder violence kept talking letting out sort of thought opinion watched by keen eye of lefebvre gleaming out below shaggy eyebrow be evidently not cue of latter to let out that master wife have escaped from vile terrible den though never breathed word relating to not le be certain be thirsting for blood lying in wait for at turn of event presently got up took leave miller bolted out stumbled off to bed then fell asleep slept sound long next morning when awoke saw amante half raised resting on one hand eagerly gazing with straining eye into kitchen below looked too heard saw miller two of men eagerly loudly talking about old woman who have not appeared a usual to make fire in stove prepare master breakfast who now late on in morning have be found dead in bed whether from effect of master blow night before from natural cause who can tell miller conscience upbraided little must say for be eagerly declaring value for housekeeper repeating how often have spoken of happy life led with men might have doubt did not wish to offend miller agreed that necessary step must be taken for speedy funeral so went out leaving in loft so much alone for first time almost ventured to speak freely though still in hushed voice pausing to listen continually amante took more cheerful view of whole occurrence than did said that have old woman lived must have have to depart that morning that quiet departure must have be best thing must have have to hope for a in probability housekeeper must have told master of of resting place fact must sooner later have be brought to knowledge of from whom most desired to keep concealed that now have time to rest shelter to rest in during first hot pursuit knew to fatal certainty be being carried on remnant of food stored up fruit must supply with provision only thing to be feared be that something might be required from loft miller one else mount up in search of even then with little arrangement of box chest one part might be so kept in shadow that might yet escape observation comforted little asked how be ever to escape ladder be taken away be only mean of descent amante replied that must make sufficient ladder of rope lying coiled among other thing to drop down ten foot so with advantage of being portable so that might carry away thus avoid betrayal of fact that one have ever be hidden in loft during two day intervened before did escape amante made good use of time looked into box chest during man absence at mill finding in one box old suit of man clothes have probably belonged to miller absent son put on to see if must fit when found that did cut own hair to shortness of man made clip black eyebrow a close a though have be shaved by cutting up old cork into piece such a must go into cheek altered shape of face voice to degree must not have believed possible time lay like one stunned body resting renewing strength in almost idiotic state else surely must not have taken stupid interest remember did in amante energetic preparation for disguise absolutely recollect once feeling of smile coming over stiff face a new exercise of cleverness proved success towards second day required too to exert then heavy despair returned let dye fair hair complexion with decaying shell of stored up walnut let blacken teeth even voluntarily broke front better to effect disguise through have hope of evading terrible husband third night funeral be over drinking ended guest gone
