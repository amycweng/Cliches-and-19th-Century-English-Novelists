asking went on visiting whenever other engagement permitted mr holdsworth being in case a in kind indulgent friend did new acquaintance oust from strong regard admiration have room in heart for be happy to say a far a can remember kept praising to other in manner if have be older man living more amongst people of world must have thought unwise a well a little ridiculous be unwise certainly a be almost sure to cause disappointment if ever did become acquainted perhaps be ridiculous though think of thought so at time minister used to listen to account of mr holdsworths many accomplishment various adventure in travel with truest interest most kindly good faith mr holdsworth in return liked to hear about visit to farm description of cousin life thereliked mean a much a liked anything be merely narrative without leading to action so went to farm certainly on average once month during autumn course of life there be so peaceful quiet can only remember one small event be one think took more notice of than one else phillis left off wearing pinafore have always be so obnoxious to know why be banished on one of visit found replaced by pretty linen apron in morning black silk one in afternoon blue cotton gown became brown stuff one a winter drew on sound like book once read in migration from blue bed to brown be spoken of a great family event towards christmas dear father came to

sunday clothes plain sensible face full of hard line mark of toil thoughthis hand blackened beyond power of soap water by year of labour in foundry speaking strong northern dialect while mr holdsworth have long soft drawl in voice a many of southerner have be reckoned in eltham to give although most of father leisure time be occupied with conversation about business have mentioned felt that ought not to leave eltham without going to pay respect to relation who have be so kind to son so ran up on engine along incomplete line a far a heathbridge went by invitation to spend day at farm be odd yet pleasant to to perceive how two men having led up to point such totally dissimilar life seemed to come together by instinct after one quiet straight look into others face father be thin wiry man of five foot seven minister be broad shouldered fresh coloured man of six foot one be of great talker in generalperhaps minister most sobut spoke much to other father went into field with minister think see now with hand behind back listening intently to explanation of tillage different process of farming occasionally taking up implement a if unconsciously examining with critical eye now then asking question must see be considered a pertinent by companion then returned to look at cattle housed bedded in expectation of snow storm hanging black on western horizon father learned point of cow with a much attention a if meant to turn farmer have little book that used for mechanical memoranda measurement in pocket took out to write down straight back small muzzle deep barrel know not what else under head cow be very critical on turnip cutting machine clumsiness of first incited to talk when went into house sate thinking quiet for bit while phillis mother made last preparation for tea with

twice before for do what must be completely unable even to understand pleasure husband daughter took in intellectual pursuit much le to care in least herself for pursuit be thus unavoidably thrown out of of interest have once twice thought be little jealous of own child a fitter companion for husband than be fancied minister be aware of feeling for have noticed occasional sudden change of subject tenderness of appeal in voice a spoke to always made look contented peaceful again think that phillis ever perceived little shadow in first place have such complete reverence for parent that listened to a if have be st peter st paul besides be always too much engrossed with matter in hand to think about other people manner look night must see though did not how much be winning on father asked few

other part of property be more attended to than most kitchen garden belonging to farm house there be border of flower along side of gravel walk there be old sheltering wall on north side covered with tolerably choice fruit tree there be slope down to fish pond at end where there be great strawberry bed raspberry bush rose bush grew wherever there be space seemed chance have be planted long row of pea stretched at right angle from main walk saw phillis stooping down among before saw a soon a heard cranching step on gravel stood up shading eye from sun recognized be quite still for moment then came slowly towards blushing little from evident shyness have never seen phillis shy before be mr holdsworth phillis said a soon a have shaken hand with glanced up at then looked down more flushed than ever at grand formality of taking hat off bowing such manner have never be seen at hope farm before father mother be out will be so sorry did not write paul a said must be fault said holdsworth understanding what meant a well a if have put more fully into word have not yet given up privilege of invalid one of be indecision last night when cousin asked at what time be to start really must not make up mind phillis seemed a if must not make up mind a to what to do with tried to help have finished getting pea taking hold of half filled basket be unconsciously holding in hand may stay help if must perhaps will tire sir added speaking now to holdsworth not bit said will carry back twenty year in life when used to gather pea in grandfather garden suppose may eat few a go along certainly sir if went to strawberry bed must find strawberry ripe paul can show where be be afraid distrust can assure know exact fulness at pea must be gathered take great care not to pluck when be unripe will not be turned off a unfit for work be style of half joking talk that phillis be not accustomed to looked for moment a if must have liked to defend from playful charge of distrust made against ended by not saying word plucked pea in busy silence for next five minute then holdsworth lifted up from between row said little wearily be afraid must strike work be not a strong a fancied phillis be full of penitence immediately did indeed look pale blamed for having allowed to help be very thoughtless of did not knowi thought perhaps really liked ought to have offered something to eat sir oh paul have gathered quite enough how stupid be to forget mr holdsworth have be ill in blushing hurry led way towards house went in moved heavy cushioned chair forward into holdsworth be only too glad to sink then with deft quiet speed brought in little tray wine water cake home made bread newly churned butter stood by in anxiety till after bite sup colour returned to mr holdsworths face must fain have made laughing apology for fright have given then phillis drew back from innocent show of care interest relapsed into cold shyness habitual to when be first thrown into company of stranger brought out last week county paper mr holdsworth have read five day ago then quietly withdrew then subsided into languor leaning back shutting eye a if must go to sleep stole into kitchen after phillis have made round of corner of house outside found sitting on horse mount with basket of pea basin into be shelling rover lay at foot snapping now then at fly went to tried to help somehow sweet crisp young pea found way more frequently into mouth than into basket while talked together in low tone fearful of being overheard through open casement of house place in holdsworth be resting dont think handsome

must not have a husband if there be not man in world must take deal to make think of hera father wish somehow did not like to say a wife love other dearly well be rather surprised at itnot at loving other in brother sister kind of waybut at finding so impossible to fall in love with beautiful woman woman beautiful woman have thought of phillis a comely awkward girl must not banish pinafore from mind eye when tried to picture to myself now turned a mr holdsworth have done to look at again out of window have just finished task be standing up back to holding basket basin in high in air out of rover reach who be giving vent to delight at probability of change of place by glad leap bark snatch at what imagined to be withheld prize at length grew tired of mutual play with feint of striking down rover do hush looked towards window where be standing a if to reassure that one have be disturbed by noise seeing coloured over hurried away with rover still curving in sinuous line about a

must hope youll find happy with im sure sir have phillis given something to eat drink wonder there deal in eating little often if one have to get strong after illness then began to question a to detail of indisposition in simple motherly way seemed at once to understand to enter into friendly relation with be not quite same in evening when minister came home men have always little natural

arrived there tiny leaf on tree be still silence of place be profound at first thought that be entirely deserted just a drew near door heard weak sweet voice begin to sing be cousin holman by in house place piping up hymn a knitted away in clouded light gave kindly welcome poured out small domestic news of fortnight past upon in return told about own people visit at home where be rest at length asked betty men be in field helping with last load of hay for minister said there must be rain before morning yes minister phillis mr holdsworth be there helping thought that must have done something perhaps be least fit for hay making of one somebody must stay at home take care of house there be so many tramp about if have not have something to do with railroad must have called navvy asked if minded being left alone a must like to go help having full glad permission to leave alone went off following direction through farmyard past cattle pond into ashfield beyond into higher field with two holly bush in middle arrived there there be betty with farming men cleared field heavily laden cart one man at top of great pile ready to catch fragrant hay others threw up to with pitchfork little heap of cast off clothes in corner of field for heat even at seven oclock be insufferable few can basket rover lying by panting keeping watch plenty of loud hearty cheerful talking minister phillis mr holdsworth betty saw first understanding who be be in search of came towards theyre out yonderagait wi thing o measter holdsworths so out yonder went out on to broad upland common full of red sand bank sweep hollow bordered by dark fir purple in coming shadow near at hand ablaze with flowering gorse a call in south furze bush seen against belt of distant tree appeared brilliantly golden on heath little way from field gate saw three counted head joined together in eager group over holdsworths theodolite be teaching minister practical art of surveying taking level be wanted to assist be quickly set to work to hold chain phillis be a intent a father have hardly time to greet so desirous be to hear answer to father question so went on dark cloud still gathering for perhaps five minute after arrival then came blinding lightning rumble quick following rattling peal of thunder right over head came sooner than expected sooner than have looked for rain delayed not came pouring down what be to do for shelter phillis have nothing on indoor thingsno bonnet shawl quick a darting lightning around holdsworth took off coat wrapped round neck shoulder almost without word hurried into such poor shelter a one of overhanging sand bank must give there be cowered down close together phillis innermost almost too tightly packed to free arm enough to divest herself of coat in turn tried to put lightly over holdsworths shoulder in doing so touched shirt oh how wet be cried in pitying dismay youve hardly got over fever oh mr holdsworth be so sorry turned head little smiling at if do catch cold be fault for having deluded into staying out here only murmured again be so sorry minister spoke now be regular downpour please god that hay be saved there be likelihood of ceasing have better go home at once send wrap umbrella will not be safe with yonder thunder lightning holdsworth offered to go instead of be resolved although perhaps must have be wiser if holdsworth wet a already be have kept in exercise a moved off phillis crept out must see on to storm swept heath part of holdsworths apparatus still remained exposed to rain before must have warning have rushed out of shelter collected various thing brought back in triumph to where crouched holdsworth have stood up uncertain whether to go to assistance not came running back long lovely hair floating dripping eye glad bright colour freshened to glow of health by exercise rain now miss holman thats what call wilful said holdsworth a gave to wont thank look be thanking time little bit of dampness annoyed because thought have got wet in service so be determined to make a uncomfortable a be be unchristian piece of revenge tone of badinage a french call must have be palpable enough to one accustomed to world phillis be not distressed rather bewildered unchristian have to very serious meaning be not word to be used lightly though did not exactly understand what wrong be that be accused of doing be evidently desirous to throw off imputation at first earnestness to disclaim unkind motif amused holdsworth while light continuance of joke perplexed still more at last said something gravely in too low tone for to hear made at once become silent called out blush after while minister came back moving mass of shawl cloak umbrella phillis kept very close to father side on return to farm appeared to to be shrinking away from holdsworth while have not slightest variation in manner from what usually be in graver mood kind protecting thoughtful towards of course there be great commotion about wet clothes name little event of evening now because wondered at time what have said in low voice to silence phillis so effectually because in thinking of intercourse by light of future event evening stand out with prominence have said that after removal to hornby communication with farm became almost of daily occurrence cousin holman be two who have least to do with intimacy after mr holdsworth regained health too often talked above head in intellectual matter too often in light bantering tone for to feel quite at ease with really believe that adopted latter tone in speaking to because did not know what to talk about to purely motherly woman whose intellect have never be cultivated whose loving heart be entirely occupied with husband child household affair perhaps little with concern of member of husband congregation because in way belonged to husband have noticed before have fleeting shadow of jealousy even of phillis when daughter husband appeared to have strong interest sympathy in thing be quite beyond comprehension have noticed in first acquaintance with say have admired delicate tact made minister on such occasion bring conversation back to such subject a on wife with practical experience of day life be authority while phillis devoted to father unconsciously followed lead totally unaware in filial reverence of motive for doing so to return to holdsworth minister have at more than one time spoken of to with slight distrust principally occasioned by suspicion that careless word be not always of soberness truth be more a protest against fascination younger man evidently exercised over elder one more a be to strengthen against yielding to fascinationthat minister spoke out to about failing of holdsworths a appeared to in return holdsworth be subdued by minister uprightness goodness delighted with clear intellecthis strong healthy craving after further knowledge never met two men who took more thorough pleasure relish in others society to phillis relation continued that of elder brother directed study into new path patiently drew out expression of many of thought perplexity unformed theoriesscarcely ever now falling into vein of banter be so slow to understand one dayharvest timehe have be drawing on loose piece of paper sketching ear of corn sketching cart drawn by bullock laden with time talking with phillis cousin holman putting in not

must be pleasanter to than to find at home at cousin for day two then so be fixed that be to meet in hornby chapel on christmas day be to accompany home after service if possible to stay over next day be not able to get to chapel till late on appointed day so took seat near door in considerable shame although really be not fault when service be ended went stood in porch to await coming out of cousin worthy people belonging to congregation clustered into group just where stood exchanged good wish of season have just begun to snow occasioned little delay fell into further conversation be not attending to what be not meant for to hear till caught name of phillis holman then listened where be harm never saw one so changed asked mr holman be phillis well just said have be having cold have pulled down did not seem to think anything of have best take care of said one of oldest of good lady phillis come of family a be not long lived mother sister lydia green own aunt a be died of decline just when be about lass age ill omened talk be broken in upon by coming out of minister wife daughter consequent interchange of christmas compliment have have shock felt heavy hearted anxious hardly up to making appropriate reply to kind greeting of relation looked askance at phillis have certainly grown taller slighter be thinner there be flush of colour on face deceived for time made think be looking a well a ever only saw paleness after have returned to farm have subsided into silence quiet grey eye looked hollow sad complexion be of dead white went about just a usual at least just a have done last time be there seemed to have ailment be inclined to think that cousin be right when have answered inquiry of good natured gossip told that phillis be suffering from consequence of bad cold nothing more have said be to stay over next day great deal of snow have come down not said though ground be covered deep with white fall minister be anxiously housing cattle preparing thing for long continuance of same kind of weather men be chopping wood sending wheat to mill to be ground before road must become impassable for cart horse cousin phillis have gone up stair to apple room to cover up fruit from frost have be out greater part of morning came in about hour before dinner to surprise knowing how have planned to be engaged found phillis sitting at dresser resting head on two hand reading seeming to read did not look up when came in murmured something about mother having sent down out of cold flashed across that be cry put down to little spirt of temper might have known better than to suspect gentle serene phillis of crossness poor girl stooped down began to stir build up fire appeared to have be neglected while head be down heard noise made pause listena sob unmistakable irrepressible sob started up phillis cried going towards with hand out to take hers for sympathy with sorrow whatever be be too quick for held hand out of grasp for fear of detaining a quickly passed out of house said dont paul can not bear passed still sobbing went out into keen open air stood still wondered what must have come to phillis most perfect harmony prevailed in family phillis especially good gentle a be be so beloved that if have found out that finger ached must have cast shadow over heart have done anything to vex be cry before came in went to look at bookone of unintelligible italian book must make head tail of saw pencil note on margin in holdsworths handwriting must be must be cause of white look weary eye wasted figure struggling sob idea came upon like flash of lightning on dark night making thing so clear can not forget afterwards when gloomy obscurity return be still standing with book in hand when heard cousin holmans footstep on stair a did not wish to speak to just then followed philliss example rushed out of house snow be lying on ground must track foot by mark have made must see where rover have joined followed on till came to great stack of wood in orchardit be built up against back wall of outbuildingsand recollected then how phillis have told that first day when strolled about together that underneath stack have be hermitage sanctuary when be child how used to bring book to study there work when be not wanted in house have now evidently gone back to quiet retreat of childhood forgetful of clue given by footmark on new fallen snow stack be built up very high through interstice of stick must see figure although did not at once perceive how must get to be sitting on log of wood rover by have laid cheek on rover head have arm round neck partly for pillow partly from instinctive craving for warmth on bitter cold day be making low moan like animal in pain perhaps more like sobbing of wind rover highly flattered by caress also perhaps touched by sympathy be flapping heavy tail against ground not otherwise moving hair until heard approach with quick erected ear then with short abrupt bark of distrust sprang up a if to leave mistress be immovably still for moment be not sure if what longed to do be wise yet must not bear to see sweet serenity of dear cousin life so disturbed by suffering thought must assuage rover ear be sharper than breathing be noiseless heard sprang out from under philliss restraining hand oh rover dont leave too plained out phillis said seeing by rover exit that entrance to where sate be to be found on other side of stack phillis come out have got cold already be not fit for to sit there on such day a know how displeased anxious must make sighed obeyed stooping little came out stood upright opposite to in lonely leafless orchard face looked so meek so sad felt a if ought to beg pardon for necessarily authoritative word sometimes feel house so close said used to sit under wood stack when be child be very kind of there be need to come after dont catch cold easily come with into cow house phillis have got something to say to cant stand cold if can think must have fain run away again fit of energy be spent followed unwillingly enough must see place to took be full of fragrant breath of cow be little warmer than outer air put inside stood in doorway thinking how must best begin at last plunged into must see that dont get cold for more reason than one if be ill holdsworth will be so anxious miserable out there by meant canada shot one penetrating look at then turned face away with slightly impatient movement if must have run away then must held mean of exit in own power in for penny in for pound thought went on rapidly anyhow talked so much about just before night after have be here knowand have given flower put hand up to hide face be listening nowlistening with ear have never spoken much about before sudden going away unlocked heart told how loved how hoped on return that might be wife dont said almost gasping out word have tried once twice before to speak voice have be choked now put hand backwards have quite turned away from felt for mine gave soft lingering pressure then put arm down on wooden division laid head on cried quiet tear did not understand at once feared lest have mistaken whole case only annoyed went up to oh phillis be so sorryi thought must perhaps have cared to hear did talk so feelingly a if did love so much somehow thought must give pleasure lifted up head looked at look eye glittering with tear a be expressed almost heavenly happiness tender mouth be curved with raptureher colour vivid blushing a if be afraid face expressed too much more than thankfulness to be essaying to speak hid again almost immediately so be all right then conjecture be well founded tried to remember something more to tell of what have said again stopped dont said still kept face covered hidden in minute added in very low voice please paul think must rather not hear more dont mean what havebut what be very much obligedonlyonly think must rather hear rest from when come back then cried little more in quite different way did not say more waited for by by turned towards menot meeting eye however putting hand in mine just a if be two child said have best go back nowi dont look a if have be cry do look a if have bad cold be answer made oh be quite well only cold good run will warm come along paul so ran hand in hand till just a be on threshold of house stopped paul please wont speak about again part iv when went over on easter day heard chapel gossip complimenting cousin holman on daughter blooming look quite forgetful of sinister prophecy three month before looked at phillis did not wonder at word have not seen since day after christmas day have left hope farm only few hour after have told news have quickened heart into renewed life vigour remembrance of conversation in cow house be vividly in mind a looked at when bright healthy appearance be remarked upon a eye met mine mutual recollection flashed intelligence from one to other turned away colour heightening a did so seemed to be shy of for first few hour after meeting felt rather vexed with for conscious avoidance of after long absence have stepped little out of usual line in telling what did not that have received charge of secrecy given even slightest promise to holdsworth must not repeat word have uneasy feeling sometimes when thought of what have done in excitement of seeing phillis so ill in so much trouble meant to have told holdsworth when wrote next to when have half finished letter before sate with pen in hand hesitating have more scruple in revealing what have found out guessed at of philliss secret than in repeating to spoken word did not think have right to say out to what believednamely that loved dearly have felt absence even to injury of health yet to explain what have done in telling how have spoken about last night must be necessary to give reason so have settled within to leave alone a have told must like to hear detail fuller particular more explicit declaration first from so must have pleasure of extracting delicious tender secret from maidenly lip must not betray guess surmise certain knowledge of state of heart have received two letter from after have settled to business be full of life energy in there have be message to family at hope farm of more than common regard slight distinct mention of phillis showing that stood single alone in memory letter have sent on to minister for be sure to care for even supposing have be unacquainted with writer because be so clever so picturesquely worded that brought a be whiff of foreign atmosphere into circumscribed life used to wonder what be trade business in minister must not have thriven mentally mean if have so happened that have be called into state must have made capital engineer know have fancy for sea like many other land locked men to whom great deep be mystery fascination read law book with relish once happening to borrow de lolme on british constitution such title talked about jurisprudence till be far beyond depth to return to holdsworths letter when minister sent back also wrote out list of question suggested by perusal be to pas on in answer to holdsworth until thought of suggesting direct correspondence between two be state of thing a regarded absent one when went to farm for easter visit when found phillis in state of shy reserve towards have named before thought be ungrateful for be not quite sure if have done wisely in having told what did have committed fault folly perhaps for sake here be le friend with than have even be before little estrangement only lasted few hour think that a soon a felt pretty sure of there being recurrence either by word look allusion to one subject be predominant in mind came back to old sisterly way with have much to tell of own familiar interest how rover have be ill how anxious have of be how after little discussion between father equally grieved by suffering of old dog have be remembered in household prayer how have begun to get better only very next day then must have led into conversation on right end of prayer on special providence know not what only jibbed like old cart horse refused to stir step in direction then talked about different brood of chicken showed hen be good mother told character of poultry with utmost good faith in good faith listened for believe there be good deal of truth in said then strolled on into wood beyond ash meadow of sought for early primrose fresh green crinkled leaf be not afraid of being alone with after first day never saw so lovely so happy think hardly knew why be so happy time can see now standing under budding branch of grey tree over tinge of green seemed to be deepening day after day sun bonnet fallen back on neck hand full of delicate wood flower quite unconscious of gaze intent on sweet mockery of bird in neighbouring bush tree have art of warbling replying to note of different bird knew song habit way more accurately than one else ever knew have often done at request spring before year really gurgled whistled warbled just a did out of very fulness joy of heart be more than ever very apple of father eye mother gave own share of love that of dead child who have died in infancy have heard cousin holman murmur after long dreamy look at phillis tell how like be growing to johnnie soothe with plaintive inarticulate sound many gentle shake of head for aching sense of loss must never get over in world old servant about place have dumb loyal attachment to child of land common to most agricultural labourer not often stirred into activity expression cousin phillis be like rose that have come to full bloom on sunny side of lonely house sheltered from storm have read in book of poetry maid whom there be none to praise very few to love somehow line always reminded of phillis yet be not true of never heard praised out of own household there be very few to love though one spoke out approbation always did right in parent eye out of natural simple goodness wisdom holdsworths name be never mentioned between when be alone have sent on letter to minister a have said more than once began to talk about absent friend when be smoking pipe after day work be done then phillis hung head little over work listened in silence miss more than thought for offence to paul said once company be like dram drinking be before knew perhaps spoke in spirit of judgment to men mind everything present strongly speak accordingly so did thought in vanity of censorship that be not true sober word must not have be if have used be so to man of class of perception thought of measure with have be meting to when brother robinson be here last thursday told that poor little quotation be making from georgics savoured of vain babbling profane heathenism went so far a to say that by learning other language than own be flying in face of lord purpose when have said at building of tower of babel that must confound language so that must not understand others speech a brother robinson be to so be to quick wit bright sens ready word of holdsworth first little cloud upon peace came in shape of letter from canada in there be two three sentence troubled more than ought to have done to judge merely from word employed be thisi must feel dreary enough in out of way place if be not for friendship have formed with french canadian of name of ventadour family be great resource to in long evening never heard such delicious vocal music a voice of ventadour boy girl in part song foreign element retained in character manner of living reminds of of happiest day of life lucille second daughter be curiously like phillis holman in vain said to myself that be probably likeness made take pleasure in society of ventadour family in vain told anxious fancy that nothing must be more natural than intimacy that there be sign of leading to consequence ought to disturb have presentiment be disturbed must not reason away dare say presentiment be rendered more persistent keen by doubt must force into mind a to whether have done well in repeating holdsworths word to phillis state of vivid happiness summer be markedly different to peaceful serenity of former day if in thoughtfulness at noticing caught eye blushed sparkled over guessing be remembering joint secret eye fell before mine a if must hardly bear to see revelation of bright glance yet considered again comforted by reflection that if change have be anything more than silly fancy father mother must have perceived went on in tranquil unconsciousness undisturbed peace change in own life be quickly approaching in july of year occupation on railway branch came to end line be completed be to leave shire to return to birmingham where there be niche already provided for in father prosperous business before left north be understood thing amongst be to go pay visit of week at hope farm father be a much pleased at plan a be dear family of cousin often spoke of thing to be done sight to be shown during visit want of wisdom in having told that thing under such ambiguous word concealed injudicious confidence have made to phillis be only drawback to anticipation of pleasure way of life be too simple at hope farm for coming to to make slightest disturbance knew room like son of house knew regular course of day be expected to fall into like one of family deep summer peace brooded over place warm golden air be filled with murmur of insect near at hand more distant sound of voice out in field clear faraway rumble of cart over stone paved lane mile away heat be too great for bird to be singing only now then one might hear wood pigeon in tree beyond ashfield cattle stood knee deep in pond flicking tail about to keep off fly minister stood in hay field without hat cravat coat waistcoat panting smiling phillis have be leading row of farm servant turning swathe of fragrant hay with measured movement went to endto hedge then throwing down rake came to with free sisterly welcome go paul said minister need hand to make use of sunshine to day whatsoever thine hand findeth to do do with thy might will be healthy change of work for thee lad find best rest in change of work so off went willing labourer following philliss lead be primitive distinction of rank boy who frightened sparrow off fruit be last in rear did not leave off till red sun be gone down behind fir tree bordering common then went home to supperprayersto bed bird singing far into night a heard through open window poultry beginning clatter cackle in earliest morning have carried what luggage immediately needed with from lodging rest be to be sent by carrier brought to farm betimes that morning along with brought letter two have arrived since have left be talking to cousin holmanabout mother way of making bread remember

anything a ive heard minister say so went on for time till became drowsy over knitting on sultry summer afternoon stole away for walk for wanted solitude in to think over thing ala to blame with poignant stab of remorse lounged lazily a soon a got to wood here there bubbling brawling brook circled round great stone root of old tree made pool otherwise coursed brightly over gravel stone stood by one of for more than hour indeed longer throwing bit of wood pebble into water wondering what must do to remedy present state of thing of course meditation be of use at length distant sound of horn employed to tell men far afield to leave off work warned that be six oclock time for to go home then caught waft of loud voiced singing of evening psalm a be crossing ashfield saw minister at distance talking to man must not hear what be saying saw impatient dissentient must not tell gesture on part of former who walked quickly away be apparently absorbed in thought for though passed within twenty yard of a path converged towards home took notice of passed evening in way be even worse than dinner time minister be silent depressed even irritable poor cousin holman be utterly perplexed by unusual frame of mind temper in husband be not well be suffering from extreme sultry heat made le talkative than usual phillis usually so reverently tender to parent so soft so gentle seemed now to take notice of unusual state of thing talked to meto one on indifferent subject regardless of father gravity of mother piteous look of bewilderment once eye fell upon hand concealed under table must see passionate convulsive manner in laced interlaced finger perpetually wringing together from time to time wringing till compressed flesh became perfectly white what must do talked with a saw wished grey eye have dark circle round strange kind of dark light in cheek be flushed lip be white wan wondered that others did not read sign a clearly a did perhaps did think from what came afterwards minister did poor cousin holman worshipped husband outward sign of uneasiness be more patent to simple heart than be daughter after while must bear no longer got up softly laying hand on broad stooping shoulder said what be matter minister have anything gone wrong started a if from dream phillis hung head caught breath in terror at answer feared looking round with sweeping glance turned broad wise face up to anxious wife forced smile took hand in reassuring manner be blaming dear have be overcome with anger afternoon scarcely knew what be doing turned away timothy cooper have killed ribstone pippin at corner of orchard gone piled quicklime for mortar for new stable wall against trunk of treestupid fellow killed tree outrightand loaded with apple ribstone pippin be so scarce said sympathetic cousin holman ay timothy be half wit have wife child have often put to sore with slothful way have laid before lord striven to bear with will not stand longer past patience have notice to find place wife wont talk more about took hand gently off shoulder touched with lip relapsed into silence a profound if not quite so morose in appearance a before must not tell why bit of talk between father mother seemed to take factitious spirit out of phillis did not speak now looked out of open casement at calm large moon slowly moving through twilight sky once thought eye be filling with tear if so shook off arose with alacrity when mother tired dispirited proposed to go to bed immediately after prayer said good night in separate way to minister who still sate at table with great bible open before not much looking up at of salutation returning kindly when last of be on point of leaving room said still scarcely looking up paul will oblige by staying here few minute must fain have talk with knew what be coming all in moment carefully shut to door put out candle sate down to fate seemed to find difficulty in beginning for if have not heard that wanted to speak to must never have guessed seemed so much absorbed in reading chapter to end suddenly lifted head up said be about friend of yours holdsworth paul have reason for thinking have played trick upon phillis saw that eye be blazing with fire of anger at bare idea that lost presence of mind only repeated played trick on phillis ay know what mean made love to courted made think that loved then gone away left put a will only give answer of kind anothera true answer meanand dont repeat word paul be shaking all over a said did not delay moment in answering believe that edward holdsworth ever played trick on phillis ever made love to never to knowledge made believe that loved stopped wanted to nerve up courage for confession yet wished to save secret of philliss love for holdsworth a much a must that secret have so striven to keep sacred safe have need of reflection before went on with what have to say began again before have quite arranged manner of speech be almost a if to himselfshe be only child little daughter be hardly out of childhood have thought to gather under wing for year to come mother must lay down life to keep from harm grief then raising voice looking at said something have gone wrong with child seemed to to date from time heard of marriage be hard to think that may know more of secret care sorrow than dobut perhaps do paul perhaps doonly if be not sin tell can do to make happy again tell will not do much good be afraid said will own how wrong did dont mean wrong in way of sin in way of judgment holdsworth told just before went that loved phillis hoped to make wife told there be out part in at least set lip tight together waited for word to come did not see face looked straight at wall opposite heard once begin to speak then turn over leaf in book before how awfully still that room be air outside how still be open window let in rustle of leaf twitter movement of birdsno sound whatever clock on stairsthe minister hard breathingwas to go on for ever impatient beyond bearing at deep quiet spoke again did for best a thought minister shut book to hastily stood up then saw how angry be for best do say be best be to go tell young girl what never told word of to parent who trusted like son of own began walking about up down room close under open window churning up bitter thought of to put such thought into child head continued to spoil peaceful maidenhood with talk about man love such love too spoke scornfully nowa love be ready for young woman oh misery in poor little daughter face to day at dinnerthe misery paul thought be one to be trustedyour father son too to go put such thought into child mind two talking together about man wishing to marry must not help remembering pinafore childish garment phillis wore so long a if parent be unaware of progress towards womanhood just in same way minister spoke thought of now a child whose innocent peace have spoiled by vain foolish talk knew that truth be different though must hardly have told now indeed never thought of trying to tell be far from mind to add one iota to sorrow have caused minister went on walking occasionally stopping to move thing on table article of furniture in sharp impatient meaningless way then began again so young so pure from world how must go talk to child raising hope exciting feelingsall to end thus best so even though saw poor piteous face look a did cant forgive paul be more than wrongit be wickedto go repeat that man word back be now to door in listening to low angry tone did not hear slowly open did see phillis standing just within room until turned round then stood still must have be half undressed have covered with dark winter cloak fell in long fold to white naked noiseless foot face be strangely pale eye heavy in black circle round came up to table very slowly leant hand upon saying mournfully father must not blame paul must not help hearing great deal of what be saying did tell perhaps must have be wiser not dear paul butoh dear oh dear be so sick with shame told out of kind heart because be so very unhappy at going away hung head leant more heavily than before on supporting hand dont understand said father be beginning to understand phillis did not answer till asked again must have struck now for cruelty then knew loved father said at length raising eye to minister face have ever spoken of love to paul say not never let fall eye drooped more than ever almost thought must fall must not have believed said in hard voice yet sighing moment have spoken dead silence for moment paul be unjust to deserved blame not said then again silence thought saw philliss white lip moving might have be flickering of candlelighta moth have flown in through open casement be fluttering round flame might have saved did not care to do so heart be too full of other thing at rate sound be heard for long endless minute then saidphillis did not make happy here have not loved enough did not seem to understand drift of question looked up a if bewildered beautiful eye dilated with painful tortured expression went on without noticing look on face did not see be sure yet must have left left home left father mother gone away with stranger wandering over world suffered too there be tone of pain in voice in uttered reproach probably father daughter be never so far apart in life so unsympathetic yet new terror came over be to turned for help shadow came over face tottered towards father falling down arm across knee moaning out father head head then slipped through quick enfolding arm lay on ground at foot will never forget sudden look of agony while live never raised up colour have strangely darkened be insensible ran through back kitchen to yard pump brought back water minister have on knee head against breast almost a though be sleeping child be trying to rise up with poor precious burden momentary terror have robbed strong man of strength sank back in chair with sobbing breath be not dead paul be whispered hoarse a came near too must not speak pointed to quivering of muscle round mouth just then cousin holman attracted by unwonted sound came down remember be surprised at time at presence of mind seemed to know so much better what to do than minister in midst of sick affright blanched countenance made tremble over think now that be recollection of what have gone before miserable thought possibly word have brought on attack might be that so unmanned minister carried upstairs while woman be putting to bed still unconscious still slightly convulsed slipped out saddled one of horse rode a fast a heavy trotting beast must go to hornby to find doctor there bring back be out might be detained whole night remember saying god help a sate on horse under window through apprentice head have appeared to answer furious tug at night bell be good natured fellow said may be home in hour there knowing daresay will ill send out to hope farm directly come in good looking young woman holmans daughter thats ill isnt yes must be pity if be to go shes only child isnt ill get up smoke pipe in surgery ready for governor coming home might go to sleep if went to bed again thank youre good fellow rode back almost a quickly a came be brain fever doctor said so when came in early summer morning believe have come to know nature of illness in night watch have gone before a to hope of ultimate recovery even evil prophecy of probable end cautious doctor must be entrapped into gave direction promised to come again so soon that one thing showed opinion of gravity of case by god mercy recovered be long weary time first according to previously made plan be to have gone home at beginning of august such idea be put aside now without word being spoken really think be necessary in house especially necessary to minister at time father be last man in world under such circumstance to expect home say think be necessary in house person have almost said creature for dumb beast seemed to know love phillis about place went grieving sad a though cloud be over sun did work striving to steer clear of temptation to eye service in fulfilment of trust reposed in by minister for day after phillis have be taken ill have called men employed on farm into empty barn there have entreated prayer for only child then there have told of present incapacity for thought about other thing in world little daughter lying nigh unto death have asked to go on with daily labour a best must without direction so a say honest men did work to best of ability slouched along with sad careful face coming one by one in dim morning to ask news of sorrow overshadowed house receiving bettys intelligence always rather darkened by passing through mind with slow shake of head dull wistfulness of sympathy poor fellow be hardly fit to be trusted with hasty message here poor service came in one time be to ride hard to sir william bentincks petition for ice out of ice house to put on philliss head be to eltham must go by train horse anyhow bid doctor there come for consultation for fresh symptom have appeared mr brown of hornby considered unfavourable many hour have sate on window seat half way up stair close by old clock listening in hot stillness of house for sound in sick room minister met often spoke together seldom looked so oldso old shared nursing with wife strength be needed seemed to be given to in day required one else about child office about be sacred to even betty only went into room for most necessary purpose once saw phillis through open door pretty golden hair have be cut off long before head be covered with wet cloth be moving backwards forward on pillow with weary never ending motion poor eye shut trying in old accustomed way to croon out hymn tune perpetually breaking up into moan of pain mother sate by tearless changing cloth upon head with patient solicitude did not see minister at first there be in dark corner down upon knee hand clasped together in passionate prayer then door shut saw more one day be wanted have to summon brother robinson minister hearing of trial have come to see told upon stair landing in whisper be strangely troubled will want to lay bare heart can not do paul stay with mean well a for spiritual help at timeit be god only god only who can give so went in with be two minister from neighbourhood older than ebenezer holman evidently inferior to in education worldly position thought looked at a if be intruder remembering minister word held ground took up one of poor philliss book of must not read word to have ostensible occupation presently be asked to engage in prayer knelt down brother robinson leading quoting largely a remember from book of job seemed to take for text if text be ever taken for prayer behold thou hast instructed many now be come upon thee thou faintest toucheth thee thou art troubled when others rose up minister continued for minute on knee then too got up stood facing for moment before sate down in conclave after pause robinson began grieve for brother holman for trouble be great must fain have remember be a light set on hill congregation be looking at with watchful eye have be talking a came along on two duty required of in strait brother hodgson have resolved to exhort on two point first god have given opportunity of showing forth example of resignation poor mr holman visibly winced at word must fancy how have tossed aside such brotherly preaching in happier moment now whole system be unstrung resignation seemed term presupposed that dreaded misery of losing phillis be inevitable good stupid mr robinson went on hear on side that there be scarce hope of child recovery may be well to bring to mind of abraham how be willing to kill only child when lord commanded take example by brother holman let hear say lord giveth lord taketh away blessed be name of lord there be pause of expectancy verily believe minister tried to feel must not heart of flesh be too strong heart of stone have not will say to god when give strengthwhen day come spoke at last other two looked at other shook head think reluctance to answer a wished be not quite unexpected minister went on there be yet said a if to god have given great heart for hoping will not look forward beyond hour then turning more to themand speaking louder added brother god will strengthen when time come when such resignation a speak of be needed till then can not feel what feel will not express using word a if be charm be getting chafed must see have rather put out by speech of after short time more shake of head robinson began again secondly must have listen to voice of rod ask for what sin trial have be laid upon whether may not have be too much given up to farm cattle whether world learning have not puffed up to vain conceit neglect of thing of god whether have not made idol of daughter can not answeri will not answer exclaimed minister sin confess to god if be scarlet be so in sight added humbly hold with christ that affliction be not sent by god in wrath a penalty for sin be that orthodox brother robinson asked third minister in deferential tone of inquiry despite minister injunction not to leave thought matter be getting so serious that little homely interruption must be more to purpose than continued presence went round to kitchen to ask for bettys help od rot em said theyre always coming at ill convenient time have such hearty appetite theyll make nothing of what must have served master since poor lass have be ill ive bit of cold beef in th house ill do ham egg ll rout em from worrying minister theyre deal quieter after theyve have victual last time a old robinson came be very reprehensible upon master learning couldnt compass to save life so neednt have be afeard of temptation used word long enough to have knocked body down after missus have given fill of victual hed have good ale pipe spoke just like other man must crack joke with visit be only break in long weary day night mean that
