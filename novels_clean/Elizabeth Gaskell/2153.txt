clear distinct from general murmur there never be one in mill surely exclaimed mary a sea of upward turned face moved with one accord to eastern end looking into dunham street narrow back lane already mentioned western end of mill whither raging flame be driven by wind be crowned turreted with triumphant fire sent forth infernal tongue from window hole licking black wall with amorous fierceness be swayed fell before mighty gale only to rise higher yet higher to ravage roar yet more wildly part of roof fell in with astounding crash while crowd struggled more more to press into dunham street for what be magnificent terrible flame what be falling timber tottering wall in comparison with human life there where devouring flame have be repelled by yet more powerful wind where yet black smoke gushed out from aperture there at one of window on fourth story rather doorway where crane be fixed to hoist up good might occasionally be seen when thick gust of smoke cleared partially away for instant imploring figure of two men have remained after rest of workman for reason other owing to wind having driven fire in opposite direction have perceived no sight sound of alarm till long after if anything must be called long in throng of terror passed by in le than hour fire have consumed old wooden staircase at other end of building be not sure whether be not first sound of rushing crowd

like former mary clung to margaret arm with pinching grasp longed to faint be insensible to escape from oppressing misery of sensation minute two have taken th ' ladder into th ' temple of apollor ca press back with to yard came from mighty shout arose sound to wake dead up on high quivering in air be seen end of ladder protruding out of garret window in gable end of gin palace nearly opposite to doorway where men have be seen in crowd nearest factory consequently best able to see up to garret window said that several men be holding one end guiding by weight passage to doorway garret window frame have be taken out before crowd below be aware of attempt at length for seemed long measured by beating heart though scarce two minute have elapsed ladder be fixed aerial bridge at dizzy height across narrow street eye be fixed in unwinking anxiety people very breathing seemed stilled in suspense men be nowhere to be seen wind appeared for moment higher than ever drove back invading flame to other end mary margaret must see now right above danced ladder in wind crowd pressed back from under fireman helmet appeared at window holding ladder firm when man with quick steady tread unmoving head passed from one side to other multitude did not even whisper while crossed perilous bridge quivered under when be across safe comparatively in factory cheer arose for instant checked however almost immediately by uncertainty of result desire not in way to shake nerve of brave fellow who have cast life on die there be again sprung to lip of many a saw at doorway standing a if for instant to breathe mouthful of fresher air before trusted to cross on shoulder bore insensible body be jem wilson father whispered margaret mary knew before people be sick with anxious terror must no longer balance with arm everything must depend on nerve eye saw latter be fixed by position of head never wavered ladder shook under double weight still never moved head dared not look below seemed age before crossing be accomplished at last window be gained bearer relieved from burden have disappeared then multitude might shout above roaring flame louder than blowing of mighty wind arose that tremendous burst of applause at success of daring enterprise then shrill cry be heard asking be oud man alive likely to do ay answered one of fireman to hushed crowd below be coming round finely now be have dash of cowd water drew back head eager inquiry shout sea like murmur of moving rolling mass began again to be heard only for instant in far le time than even that in have endeavoured briefly to describe pause of event same bold hero stepped again upon ladder with evident purpose to rescue man yet remaining in burning mill went across in same quick steady manner a before people below made le acutely anxious by previous success be talking to other shouting out intelligence of progress of fire at other end of factory telling of endeavour of fireman at part to obtain water while closely packed body of men heaved rolled from side to side be different from former silent breathless hush know if be from cause from recollection of peril past that looked below in breathing moment before returning with remaining person slight little man slung across shoulder jem wilson step be le steady tread more uncertain seemed to feel with foot for next round of ladder to waver finally to stop half way by time crowd be still enough in awful instant intervened one durst speak even to encourage many turned sick with terror shut eye to avoid seeing catastrophe dreaded came brave man swayed from side to side at first a slightly a if only balancing be evidently losing nerve even sense be only wonderful how animal instinct of self preservation did not overcome generous feeling impel at once to drop helpless inanimate body carried perhaps same instinct told that sudden loss of so heavy weight must of be great imminent danger help be fainted cried margaret one heeded eye be directed

window be gained be saved multitude in street absolutely danced with triumph huzzaed yelled till must have fancied very throat must crack then with fickleness of interest characteristic of large body of people pressed stumbled cursed swore in hurry to get out of dunham street back to immediate scene of fire mighty diapason of whose roaring flame formed awful accompaniment to scream yell imprecation of struggling crowd a pressed away margaret be left pale almost sinking under weight of mary body have preserved in upright position by keeping arm tight round mary waist dreading with reason trampling of unheeding foot now however gently let down on cold clean pavement change of posture difference in temperature now that people have withdrawn from close neighbourhood speedily

heart chose certainty of despair before must resolve what to answer flung away hand rushed out of house jem jem cried with faint choking voice be too late left street after street behind with almost winged speed a sought field where might give way unobserved to deep despair felt be scarcely ten minute since have entered house found mary at comparative peace now lay half across dresser head hidden in hand part of body shaking with violence of sob must not have told at first if have asked must have commanded voice enough to answer why be in such agonized grief be too sudden for to analyse think upon only felt that by own doing life must be hereafter blank dreary by bye sorrow exhausted body by power seemed to have strength left for cry sat down now thought crowded on mind one little hour ago be still unsaid have fate in own power yet how long ago have determined to say pretty much what did if occasion ever offered be a if two people be arguing matter mournful desponding communion between

energy to return to mary plan have be a well know to marry mr carson occurrence hour ago be only preliminary step true have unveiled heart to have convinced that loved jem above person thing jem be poor mechanic with mother aunt to keep mother too who have shown pretty clearly that did not desire for daughter in law while mr carson be rich prosperous gay believed must place in circumstance of ease luxury where want must never come what be hollow vanity to now have discovered passionate secret of soul felt a if almost hated mr carson who have decoyed with bauble now saw how vain how nothing

bitter penitence have hitherto be walking in grope light towards precipice in clear revelation of past hour saw danger turned away resolutely for ever be comfort mean clear perception of what ought not to do of what luring temptation must ever again induce to hearken to how must best undo wrong have done to jem by refusing love be anxious question wearied by proposing plan rejecting be roused to consciousness of time by hearing neighbouring church clock strike twelve father knew might be expected home minute be in mood for meeting with so hastily gathered up work went to own little bedroom leaving to let in put out candle that father might not see light under door sat down on bed to think again turning thing over in mind again again must only determine at once to put end to further communication with mr carson in most decided way must maidenly modesty true love be ever modest seemed to oppose plan must think of for showing jem how much repented decision against how dearly have now discovered that loved came to unusual wisdom of resolving to hing strive to be patient improve circumstance a might turn up surely if jem knew of remaining unmarried must try fortune again must never be content with one rejection believed must not in place have be very wrong now must endeavour to do right have womanly patience until saw changed repentant mind in natural action even if have to wait for year be no more than now be easy to look forward to a penance for giddy flirting on one hand cruel mistake concerning feeling on other so anticipating happy ending in course of love however distant might be fell asleep just a earliest factory bell be ringing have sunk down in clothes sleep be unrefreshing wakened up shivery chill in body sorrow stricken in mind though must not at first rightly tell cause of depression recalled event of night before still resolved to adhere to determination have then formed patience seemed far more difficult virtue morning hastened downstairs in earnest sad desire to do right now took much pain to secure comfortable though scanty breakfast for father when dawdled into room in evidently irritable temper bore with gentleness of penitence till at last mild answer turned away wrath loathed idea of meeting sally leadbitter at daily work yet must be done tried to nerve for encounter to make at once understood that having determined to give up having anything further to do with mr carson considered bond of intimacy broken between sally be not person to let resolution be carried into effect too easily soon became aware of present state of mary feeling thought merely arose from changeableness of girlhood that time must come when mary must thank for almost forcing to keep up meeting communication with rich lover so when two day have passed over in rather too marked avoidance of sally on mary part when former be made aware by mr carson complaint that mary be not keeping appointment with that unless detained by force have chance of obtaining word a passed in street on rapid walk home resolved to compel mary to what called own good took notice during third day of mary avoidance a sat at work rather seemed to acquiesce in coolness of intercourse put away sewing early went home to mother who said be more ailing than usual other girl soon followed example mary casting rapid glance up down street a stood last on miss simmonds doorstep darted homewards in hope of avoiding person whom be fast learning to dread that night be safe from encounter on road arrived at home found a expected empty for knew be club night father must not miss sat down to recover breath to still heart panted more from nervousness than from over exertion although have walked so quickly then arose taking off bonnet eye caught form of sally leadbitter passing window with lingering step looking into darkness with might a if to ascertain if mary be returned in instant repassed knocked at house door without awaiting answer entered well mary dear knowing well how little dear mary considered just then be so difficult to get comfortable talk at miss simmonds thought 'd just step up see at home understood from what said mother be ailing that wanted to be with replied mary in welcoming tone ay mother better now said unabashed sally father out suppose looking round a well a must for mary made haste to perform hospitable office of striking match lighting candle yes be out said mary shortly busying at last about candle without ever asking visitor to sit down so much better answered sally for to tell truth mary have friend at th end of road a be anxious to come see at home since be grown so particular a not to like to speak to in street will be here directly o sally let said mary speaking at last heartily running to door must have fastened sally held hand laughing meanwhile at distress oh please sally struggling dear sally let come here neighbour will so talk father will go mad if hears will kill sally will besides love never did oh let go a footstep approached then a passed house seemed to give respite continued do sally dear sally go tell love want to have anything more to do with be very wrong dare say keeping company with at be very sorry if have led to think too much of want to think more will tell sally will do anything for if will will tell what will do said sally in more relenting mood will go back with to where be waiting for rather must say where told to wait for quarter of hour till seed if father be at home if did come back in time said 'd come here break door open 'd see oh let go let go said mary feeling that interview must be have better be anywhere than at home where father might return at minute snatched up bonnet be at end of court in instant then not knowing whether to turn to right to left be obliged to wait for sally who came leisurely up put arm through mary with kind of decided hold intended to prevent possibility of changing mind turning back under circumstance be quite different to mary plan have wondered more than once if must not have interview with mr carson have then determined while expressed resolution that must be final one to tell how sorry be if have thoughtlessly given false hope for be remembered have innocence ignorance to believe intention honourable feeling that at price must have only that must obtain a cheaply a must have never undeceived while sally leadbitter laughed in sleeve at wondered how must all end whether mary must gain point of marriage with sly affectation of believing such to be mr carson intention in courting not very far from end of street into court where mary lived opened met carson hat good deal slouched over face a if afraid of being recognised turned when saw coming led way without uttering word although be close behind to street of half finished house length of walk gave mary time to recoil from interview be to follow even if own resolve to go through with have failed there be steady grasp of sally leadbitter must not evade without absolute struggle at last stopped in shelter concealment of wooden fence put up to keep building rubbish from intruding on foot pavement inside fence minute afterwards girl be standing by mary now returning sally detaining grasp with interest for have determined on way to make witness willing unwilling to ensuing conversation sally curiosity led to be very passive prisoner

again rapidly turned off jem also went on way before reached end of street even in midst of jealous anguish filled heart conscience smote have not done enough to save one more effort might have come nay twenty effort must have be well rewarded by yielding turned back be gone in tumult of other feeling self reproach be deadened for time many many day afterwards bitterly regretted omission of duty weariness of well doing now great thing be to reach home solitude mary loved oh how must bear have thought rejection of hard trial be nothing now only remembered to be thankful that have not yielded to temptation of trying fate again not in actual word in meeting where manner must tell far more than word that sweet smile dainty movement pretty household way be to be reserved to gladden eye heart must live on seemed strangest that long life knew men did live long even with deep biting sorrow corroding at heart must be spent without mary nay with consciousness be hell of thought must reserve

fastened door shutter pattered upstairs with tottering footstep shrill voice jem too went to closet termed bedroom there be bolt to door by one strong effort of right arm heavy chest be moved against must sit down on side of bed think mary loved that idea must rise uppermost in mind have to be combated in form of pain be perhaps great wonder that must prefer one so much above jem in external thing of life gentleman why did with range of choice among lady of land why did stoop down to carry off poor man darling with glory of garden at hand why did prefer to cull wild rose jem own fragrant wild rose own oh never now own gone for evermore then uprose guilty longing for blood frenzy of jealousy one must die must rather mary be dead cold in grave than be be vision of pale sweet face with bright hair bedabbled with gore seemed to float constantly before aching eye hers be ever open contained in soft deathly look such mute reproach what have done to deserve such cruel treatment from have be wooed by one whom jem knew to be handsome gay bright have given love be be wooer who must die yes die knowing cause of death jem pictured gloated on picture lying smitten yet conscious listening to upbraiding accusation of murderer how have left own rank dared to love maiden of low degree oh stinging agony of how in return have loved then other nature spoke up bade remember anguish must so prepare for mary at first refused to listen to better voice listened only to pervert must glory in wailing grief must take pleasure in desolation of heart must not said still small voice must be worse far worse to have caused such woe than be now to bear present heavy burden be too heavy too grievous to be borne live must slay lover must love on sun shine bright with burning woeful heart must be at rest rest be reserved for people of god have not promised with such earnest purpose of soul a make word more solemn than oath to save mary from becoming such a esther must shrink from duty of life into cowardliness of death who must then guard mary with love innocence must not be goodly thing to serve although loved not to be preserving angel through peril of life unconscious while braced up soul said to that with god help must be that earthly keeper now mist storm seemed clearing away from path though still be full of stinging thorn having done duty nearest to of reducing tumult of own heart to something like order second became more plain before poor esther experience have led perhaps too hastily to conclusion that mr carson intention be evil towards mary at least have given no just ground for fear entertained that such be case be possible nay to jem heart very probable that might only be too happy to marry be lady by right of nature jem thought in movement grace spirit what be birth to manchester manufacturer many of whom glory justly too in being architect of own fortune a far a wealth be concerned judging by jem must only imagine great privilege to lay at foot of loved one harry carson mother have be factory girl so after be great reason for doubting intention towards mary there might probably be little awkwardness about affair at first mary father having such strong prejudice on one hand something of same kind being likely to exist on part of mr carson family jem knew have power over john barton mind must be something to exert power in promoting mary happiness to relinquish thought of self in so doing oh why have chosen for office be beyond strength to act rightly why have singled out answer came when be calm enough to listen for because mary have other friend capable of duty required of duty of brother a esther imagined to be in feeling from long friendship must be unto a brother a such ought to ascertain harry carson intention towards in winning affection must ask straightforwardly a became man speaking to man not concealing if need be interest felt in mary then with resolve to do duty to best of power peace came into soul have left

harry have used two three hour before sighed long quivering sigh then mastering again left room have better go back to sister miss sophy said nurse miss carson went must not face death yet nurse followed mr carson to servant hall there on dinner table lay poor dead body men who have brought be sitting near fire while several of servant stood round table gazing at remains remains one two be cry one two be whispering awed into strange stillness of voice action by presence of dead when mr carson came in drew back looked at with reverence due to sorrow went forward gazed long fondly on calm dead face then bent down kissed lip yet crimson with life policeman have advanced stood ready to be questioned at first old man mind must only take in idea of death slowly slowly came conception of violence of murder how did die groaned forth policeman looked at other then one began stated that having report of gun in turner street have turned down way lonely unfrequented way mr carson knew short cut to garden door of harry have key a policeman came nearer have heard footstep a of man running away evening be so dark moon not having yet risen that must see one twenty yard off that have even be startled when close to body by seeing lying across path at foot that have sprung rattle when policeman came up by light of lantern have discovered who be that have be killed that believed to be dead when first took up a have never moved spoken breathed that intelligence of murder have be sent to superintendent who must probably soon be here two three policeman be still about place where murder be committed seeking out for trace of murderer having said stopped speaking mr carson have listened attentively never taking eye off dead body when have ended said where be shot lifted up of thick chestnut curl showed blue spot must hardly call hole flesh have closed so much over in left temple deadly aim yet be so dark night must have be close upon said one policeman have have between sky added other there be little commotion at door of room there stood poor mr carson mother have heard unusual noise in house have sent down maid much more companion to than highly educated daughter to discover what be going on maid forgot dreaded to return with nervous impatience mr carson came down have traced hum buzz of voice to servant hall mr carson turned round must not leave dead for one living take away nurse be sight for tell miss sophy to go to mother eye be again fixed on dead face of son presently mr carson hysterical cry be heard over house husband shuddered at outward expression of agony be rending heart then police superintendent came after doctor latter went through form of ascertaining death without uttering word when at conclusion of operation of opening vein from blood flowed shook head present understood confirmation of previous belief superintendent asked to speak to mr carson in private be just what be going to request of answered so led way into dining room with wine glass still on table door be carefully shut sat down apparently waiting for other to begin at last mr carson spoke probably have heard that be rich man superintendent bowed in assent well sir half nay if necessary whole of fortune will give to have murderer brought to gallows exertion may be sure sir will be used on part probably offering handsome reward might accelerate discovery of murderer what wanted particularly to tell sir be that one of men have already got clue that who accompanied here have within quarter of hour found gun in field murderer crossed probably threw away when pursued a encumbering flight have not smallest doubt of discovering murderer what do call handsome reward said mr carson well sir three five hundred pound be munificent reward more than will probably be required a temptation to accomplice make thousand said mr carson decisively be doing of damned turn out imagine not said superintendent day ago man be naming to before reported to inspector when came on beat that have to separate son from young man who by dress believed to be employed in foundry that man have thrown mr carson down seemed inclined to proceed to more violence when policeman came up interfered indeed man wished to give in charge for assault mr carson must not allow to be done just like noble fellow murmured father after son have left man made use of pretty strong threat be rather curious coincidence that scuffle took place in very same spot where murder be committed in turner street there be one knocking at door of room be sophy who beckoned father out then asked in awestruck whisper to come upstairs speak to mother will not leave harry talk so strangely indeed indeed papa think have lost sens poor girl sobbed bitterly where be asked mr carson in

always interesting to vulgar uneducated mind to outward sign token of crime be ever exciting there be lack of clue evidence at coroner inquest that morning shot finding of body subsequent discovery of gun be rapidly deposed to then policeman who have interrupted quarrel between jem wilson murdered young man be brought forward gave evidence clear simple straightforward coroner have hesitation jury have none verdict be cautiously worded wilful murder against person unknown very cautiousness when deemed thing so sure a to require caution irritated mr carson did not soothe that superintendent called verdict mere form exhibited warrant empowering to seize body of jem wilson committed on suspicion declared intention of employing well known officer in detective service to ascertain ownership of gun to collect other evidence especially a regarded young woman about whom policeman deposed that quarrel have taken place mr carson be still excited irritable restless in body mind made

must be glad never to set eye on again for must not abide firearm be so apt to shoot people so comforting for want of thought in not making further inquiry fell off into dose feverish dream haunted unrefreshing meanwhile policeman walked off with prize with odd mixture of feeling little contempt little disappointment good deal of pity contempt disappointment be caused by widow easy admission of gun being son property manner of identifying by ornament liked attempt to baffle be accustomed to gave exercise to wit shrewdness there must be fun in fox hunting if reynard yielded up without effort

against have come desirous to know extent of mary grief for mr carson glad of excuse afforded by important scrap of paper remark about being jem handwriting have with view of ascertaining mary state of feeling felt to be most imprudent instant after have uttered be anxiety that must not tell be too great too decided to leave doubt a to interest for jem grew more more bewildered dizzy head refused to reason mary never spoke held bit of paper firmly determined to retain possession of come what might anxious impatient for aunt to go a sat face bore likeness to esther dead child be so like little

poor creature crossed mind must have taken guilty erring to bosom tried to bind up broken heart be not to be aunt have child then be on point of putting question about before must be spoken thought turned aside went back to task of unravelling mystery of paper handwriting oh how wished aunt must go a if according to believer in mesmerism intenseness of wish gave power over although wish be unexpressed esther felt unwelcome that absence be desired felt time before must summon up resolution to go be so much disappointed in longed for dreaded interview with mary have wished to impose upon with tale of married respectability yet have yearned craved for sympathy in real lot have imposed upon well must perhaps be glad of afterwards desolation of hope seemed for time redoubled must leave old dwelling place whose very wall flag dingy sordid a be have charm for must leave abode of poverty for more terrible abode of vice must must go well good night mary that bit of paper be safe enough with see made promise must not tell about must promise to destroy before sleep promise said mary hoarsely firmly then be going yes not if wish to stay not if must be of comfort to mary catching at

where did say lived never did say muttered esther then aloud in angel meadow nicholas street nicholas street angel meadow will remember a esther drew shawl around prepared to depart thought crossed mary mind that have be cold hard in manner towards one who have certainly meant to act kindly in bringing paper dread terrible piece of paper thus saving from must not rightly think how much how little be spared so desirous of making up for previous indifferent manner advanced to kiss aunt before departure to surprise aunt pushed off with frantic kind of gesture saying word not must never kiss rushed into outer darkness of street there wept long bitterly xxii mary effort to prove alibi there be listening fear in regard a if calamity have begun a if vanward cloud of evil day have spent malice sullen rear be with stored thunder labouring up keats hyperion sooner be mary alone than fastened door put shutter up against window have time remained shaded only by curtain hastily drawn together on esther entrance lighting of candle did with same compressed lip same stony look that face have assumed on first examination of paper then sat down for instant to think rising directly went with step rendered firm by inward resolution of purpose up stair passed own door two step into father room what did want there must tell must put into word dreadful secret believed that bit of paper have revealed to father be murderer that corner of stiff shining thick writing paper recognised a part of sheet on have copied samuel bamford beautiful line so many month ago copied a perhaps remember on blank part of valentine sent to by jem wilson in day when did not treasure hoard up everything have touched a must do now that copy have be given to father for whom be made have occasionally seen reading over not fortnight ago be sure resolved to ascertain if other part still remained in possession might be just possible might have given away to friend if so that person be guilty one for must swear to paper anywhere first of pulled out article from little old chest of drawer amongst be thing have belonged to mother have time now to examine try remember reverence must pay be to carry lay on bed carefully while other thing be tossed impatiently out upon floor copy of bamford line be not there oh perhaps might have given away then must not have be to jem be gun set to with redoubled vigour to examine deal box served a chair have once contained father sunday clothes in day when must afford to have sunday clothes have redeemed better coat from pawn shop before left that have noticed here be old one rustled under hand in pocket paper o father yes fitted jagged end to jagged end letter to letter even part esther have considered blank have tallying mark with larger piece tail of y g then a if be not damning evidence enough felt again found little bullet shot know must call in same pocket along with small paper parcel of gunpowder a be going to replace jacket having abstracted paper bullet etc saw woollen gun case made of sort of striped horse cloth must have seen thousand time appropriated to such purpose sight of made examine still further there be nothing else must afford evidence so locked box sat down on floor to contemplate article now with sickening despair now with kind of wondering curiosity how father have managed to evade observation after be easy enough have evidently got possession of gun be really jem be accomplice did not believe never never must deliberately plan murder with however might be wrought up to by passionate feeling at time least of must accuse to father without previously warning be out of nature then having obtained possession of gun father have loaded at home might have carried away with time when neighbour be not noticing be out asleep then might have hidden somewhere to be in readiness when must want be sure have such thing with when went away last time felt be of use to conjecture motif action have become so wild irregular of late that must not reason upon besides be not enough to know that be guilty of terrible offence love for father seemed to return with painful force mixed up a be with horror at crime that dear father who be once so kind so warm hearted so ready to help man beast in distress to murder in desert of misery with thought surrounded arid depth of whose gloom dared not venture to contemplate little spring of comfort be gushing up at foot unnoticed at first soon to give strength hope be necessity for exertion on part discovery enforced oh do think that necessity for exertion for kind of action bodily mental in time of distress be most infinite blessing although first effort at such season be painful something to be done implies that there be yet hope of good thing to be accomplished additional evil may be avoided by degree hope absorbs much of sorrow be woe can not in earthly way be escaped that admit least earthly comforting of trite worn out hollow mockery of comfort be ever uttered by people who will not take trouble of sympathising with others one dislike most be exhortation not to grieve over event for can not be helped do think if must help must sit still with folded hand content to mourn do not believe that a long a hope remained must be up doing mourn because what have occurred can not be helped reason give for not grieving be very sole reason of grief give nobler higher reason for enduring meekly what father see fit to send will try earnestly faithfully to be patient mock not other mourner with speech grieve for can not be helped be past remedy remedy to mary sorrow came with thinking if father be guilty jem be innocent if innocent there be possibility of saving must be saved must do for be not sole depository of terrible secret father be not suspected never must be if by foresight exertion of own must prevent did not know how jem be to be saved while father be also to be considered innocent must require much thought much prudence with call upon exertion various quality of judgment discretion came answering consciousness of innate power to meet emergency step now nay employment of minute be of consequence for must remember have learnt at miss simmonds probability that murderer must be brought to trial next week must remember too never be so young girl so friendless so penniless a mary be at time lion accompanied una through wilderness danger so will high resolved purpose of right doing ever guard accompany helpless struck two deep mirk night be of use bewildering with plan weary endless night nothing must be done before morning at first in impatience began to long for day then felt in how unfit state body be for plan of exertion resolutely made up mind to husband physical strength first of must burn tell tale paper powder bullet gun case tied into bundle hid in sacking of bed for present although there be likelihood of affording evidence against one then carried paper downstairs burned on hearth powdering very ash with finger dispersing fragment of fluttering black film among cinder of grate then breathed again head ached with dizzying violence must get quit of pain must incapacitate for thinking planning looked for food there be nothing little raw oatmeal in house still although almost choked ate of knowing from experience how often headache be caused by long fasting then sought for water to bathe throbbing temple quench feverish thirst there be none in house so took jug went out to pump at other end of court whose echo resounded light footstep in quiet stillness of night hard square outline of house cut sharply against cold bright sky from myriad of star be shining down in eternal repose there be little sympathy in outward scene with internal trouble be so still so motionless so hard very different to lovely night in country in be now writing where distant horizon be soft undulating in moonlight nearer tree sway gently to fro in night wind with something of almost human motion rustling air make music among branch a if speaking soothingly to weary one who lie awake in heaviness of heart sight sound of such night lull pain grief to rest mary re entered home after have filled pitcher with still stronger sense of anxiety still clearer conviction of how much rested upon unassisted friendless self alone with terrible knowledge in hard cold populous world bathed forehead quenched thirst then with wise deliberation of purpose went upstairs undressed a if for long night slumber although so few hour intervened before day dawn believed never must sleep lay down shut eye before many minute be in a deep sound slumber a if there be sin sorrow in world woke up a be natural much refreshed in body with consciousness of great impending calamity sat up in bed to recollect when did remember sank down again with helplessness of despair be only weakness of instant for be not very minute precious for deliberation if not for action before have finished necessary morning business of dressing setting house in kind of order have disentangled ravelled idea arranged kind of plan for action if jem be innocent now of guilt even slightest participation in knowledge of murder acquitted with heart soul must have be somewhere else when crime be committed probably with others who might bear witness to fact if only knew where to find everything rested on have heard of alibi believed might mean deliverance wished to accomplish be not quite sure determined to apply to job a one of few among acquaintance gifted with knowledge of hard word for to term of law natural history be alike many syllabled mystery time be to be lost went straight to job legh house found old man grand daughter sitting at breakfast a opened door heard voice speaking in grave hushed subdued tone a if something grieved heart stopped talking on entrance then knew have be conversing about murder about jem probable guilt flashed upon for first time on new light must have obtained regarding for until now have never heard of giddy flirting with mr carson not in confidential talk with margaret have ever spoken of now margaret must hear conduct talked of by a of bold bad girl even if did not believe everything be said must hardly help feeling wounded disappointed in mary so be in timid voice mary wished usual good morrow heart sunk within little when job with form of civility bade welcome in dwelling where until now have be too well assured to require to be asked to sit down took chair margaret continued silent be come to speak to about about jem wilson be bad business be afeard replied

indeed have doubt in own mind that jem have in passionate moment urged on by slighted love jealousy be murderer be strongly inclined to believe that mary be aware of only too late repentant of light conduct have led to such fatal consequence be now most anxious to save old playfellow early friend from doom awaiting shedder of blood if jem not done see a on can tell who did might find out

alibi be that sure enough thought little mun ask mother doings whereabouts night knowledge of will guide bit for be anxious that on must fall task of enlightening mary on hopelessness of case felt that own sense must be more convinced by inquiry examination than mere assertion of margaret have sat silent grave time to tell truth be surprised disappointed by disclosure of mary conduct with regard to mr henry carson gentle reserved prudent never exposed to trial of being admired for personal appearance unsusceptible enough to be in doubt even yet whether fluttering tender infinitely joyous feeling be for first time experiencing at sight sound thought of will wilson be love not margaret have sympathy with temptation to loveliness vanity ambition desire of being admired expose so many sympathy with flirting girl in short then have idea of strength of conflict between will principle in who be differently constituted from herself with to be convinced that action be wrong be tantamount to determination not to do so again have little difficulty in carrying out determination so must not understand how be that mary have acted wrongly have felt too much ashamed in spite of internal sophistry to speak of action margaret considered deceived felt aggrieved at time of be now telling be strongly inclined to give mary up altogether a girl devoid of modest propriety of sex capable of gross duplicity in speaking of one lover a have done of jem while be encouraging in attention at best of very doubtful character now margaret be drawn into conversation suddenly flashed across mary mind that night of murder be very night rather same early morning that margaret have be with alice turned sharp round with o margaret can tell be there when came back that night be not be

weak to be angry long wrath sank away to feeble sobbing worn out moan mary be most anxious to soothe from violence of grief anger did so want to be clear in recollection besides tenderness be great towards jem mother so spoke in low gentle tone loving sentence sound so broken powerless in repetition yet have so much power when accompanied with caressing look action fresh from heart old woman insensibly gave up to influence of sweet loving blue eye tear of sympathy word of love hope be lulled into le morbid state of mind now dear mr wilson can remember where said be going on thursday night

what be going on th doctor say grows weaker weaker thou'lt maybe like to see mary went upstairs partly because be etiquette in humble life to offer to friend last opportunity of seeing dying dead while same etiquette forbids refusal of invitation partly because longed to breathe for instant atmosphere of holy calm seemed ever to surround pious good old woman alice lay a before without pain at least outward expression of totally unconscious of present circumstance absorbed in recollection of day of girlhood be vivid enough to take place of reality to still talked of green field still spoke to long dead mother sister low lying in graf many year a if be with about in pleasant place where youth have passed voice be fainter motion be more languid be evidently passing away how happily mary stood for time in silence watching listening then bent down reverently kissed alice cheek drawing jane wilson away from bed a if spirit of who lay there be yet cognisant of present reality whispered few word of hope to poor mother kissing over over again in warm loving manner bade good bye went few step then once more came back to bid keep up heart when have fairly left house jane wilson felt a if sunbeam have ceased shining into room yet oh how sorely mary heart ached for more more fell certainty came on that father be murderer struggled hard not to dwell on conviction to think alone on

port where peace safety smile whether will blindly dash against miserably sink heaven be help clear eye nerve trembling hand constant woman heart beating head full of idea required time solitude to be reduced into order mary hurried home be like one who find jewel of can not at once ascertain value who hide treasure until quiet hour when may ponder over capability possession unfolds be like one who discovers silken clue guide to bower of bliss secure of power within grasp have to wait for time before may thread labyrinth jewel bower of bliss be ever so precious to miser lover a be belief now pervaded mary mind that jem innocence might be proved without involving suspicion of other that dear one so dear although so criminal on whose part in cruel business dared not dwell even in thought for if did there arose awful question if went against jem innocent if judge jury gave verdict forth have looming gallows in rear what ought to do possessed of terrible knowledge surely not to inculpate father yet yet almost prayed for blessed unconsciousness of death madness rather than awful question must have to be answered by now way seemed opening opening yet more clear be thankful

performed duty to jem a far a weak power yet loving heart must act black veil being drawn over father past present future life beyond must not penetrate to judge of filial service ought to render mind unconsciously sought after course of action in might engage anything anything rather than leisure for reflection then came up old feeling first bound ruth to naomi love held towards one object mary felt that care must be most lightened by being of use of comfort to mother so once more locked up house set off towards ancoats rushing along with downcast head for fear lest anyone must recognise arrest progress jane wilson sat quietly in chair a mary entered so quietly a to strike one by contrast presented to usual bustling nervous manner looked very pale wan quietness be thing struck mary most did not rise a mary came in sat still said something in so gentle so feeble voice mary did not catch mr davenport who be there plucked mary by gown whispered never heed be worn out best let alone

ominous slip of parchment in mother hand be rolling up down in tremulous manner between finger mary heart sickened within must not speak what be repeated will tell still looked at mary with same child like gaze of wonder patient entreaty what must answer telled not to heed said mr davenport little angrily know well enough what be too well belike be not in when sarved mr heming a life next door be

being uttered imagining perhaps that must end in explanation addressed to when be silent though eye without speech language told heart pity spoke again in same unaltered gentle voice so different from irritable impatience have be ever apt to show to everyone except husband who have wedded broken down injured in voice so different say from old hasty manner spoke now same anxious word what be will tell 'd better give at once mr wilson let put out of sight speak to mary wench ask for sight on have tried better tried to get from take heed of word be loth to pull by force out of hand mary drew little cricket out from under dresser sat down at mr wilson knee coaxing one of tremulous ever moving hand into hers began to rub soothingly there be little resistance very little be presently in nervous movement of imprisoned hand parchment fell to ground cricket stool mary calmly openly picked up without attempt at concealment quietly placing in sight of anxious eye followed with kind of spell bound dread went on with soothing caress have have sleep for many night said girl to mr davenport woe sorrow be wonder indeed mr davenport answered must get fairly to bed must get undressed trust to god in mercy to send to sleep else for see spoke before a if be not there heart be so far away accordingly almost lifted from chair in sat motionless taking up a gently a mother carry sleeping baby undressed poor worn form laid in little bed upstairs have once thought of placing in jem bed to be out of sight sound of disturbance of alice then again remembered shock might receive in awakening in so unusual place also that mary who intended to keep vigil night in house of mourning must find difficult to divide attention in possible case might ensue so laid a said before on little pallet bed a be slowly withdrawing from bedside hoping praying that might sleep forget for time heavy burden looked wistfully after mary whispered have told what be what be gazing in face for expected answer eyelid slowly closed fell into deep heavy sleep almost a profound rest a death mr davenport went way mary be alone for can not call who sleep ally against agony of thought solitude sometimes brings up dreaded night before alice might die doctor have day declared case hopeless not far from death at time terror so natural to young not of death of remains of dead came over mary bent listened anxiously for long drawn pausing breath of sleeping alice mr wilson might awake in state mary dreaded to anticipate anticipated while dreaded in state of complete delirium already sens have be severely stunned by full explanation of what be required of her of what have to prove against son jem only child mary must not doubt officious mr heming have given what if in dream that land into sympathy love can penetrate with either to share bliss agony that land whose scene be unspeakable terror be hidden mystery be priceless treasure to one alone land where alone may see while yet tarry here sweet look of dear child what if in horror of dream brain must go still more astray must waken crazy with vision terrible reality begot how much worse be anticipation sometimes than reality how mary dreaded that night how calmly passed by even more so than if mary have not have such claim upon care anxiety about deadened own peculiar anxiety thought of sleeper whom be watching till overpowered by want of rest fell off into short slumber in night wore imperceptibly away to be sure alice spoke sang during waking moment like child deemed so happily with dearly loved one around with scent of heather song of wild bird hovering about in imagination with old scrap of ballad old snatch of primitive version of psalm such a be sung in country church half draperied over with ivy where running brook murmuring wind among tree make fit accompaniment to chorus of human voice uttering praise thanksgiving to god that speech song gave comfort good cheer to listener heart grey dawn began to dim light of rush candle before mary thought possible that day be already trembling in horizon then got up from chair where have be dozing went half asleep to window to assure that morning be at hand street be unusually quiet with sabbath stillness factory bell that morning early workman going to labour slip shod girl cleaning window of little shop broke monotony of street instead might see here there operative sallying forth for breath of country air father leading out wee toddling bairn for unwonted pleasure of walk with daddy in clear frosty morning men with more leisure on week day must perhaps have walked quicker than did through fresh sharp air of sunday morning to there be pleasure absolute refreshment in dawdling gait one of have there be indeed one two passenger on morning whose object be le innocent le praiseworthy than of people have already mentioned whose animal state of mind body clashed jarringly on peacefulness of day upon will not dwell a almost one think may send up individual cry of self reproach that have not done that must for stray wandering one of brother when mary turned from window went to bed of sleeper to look listen alice looked perfectly quiet happy in slumber face seemed to have become much more youthful during painless approach to death mr wilson countenance be stamped with anxiety of last few day although too appeared sleeping soundly a mary gazed on trying to trace likeness to son in face awoke looked up into mary eye while expression of consciousness came back into own be silent for minute two mary eye have fallen beneath that penetrating gaze in agony of memory seemed minute to find fuller vent be dream mother asked at last in low voice replied mary in same tone mr wilson hid face in pillow be fully conscious of everything morning be evident that stunning effect of sub poena have affected so much last night in weak worn out state have passed away mary offered opposition when indicated by languid gesture action that wished to rise sleepless bed be haunted place when be dressed with mary aid stood by alice for minute two looking at slumberer how happy be said quietly sadly time that mary be getting breakfast ready performing other little domestic office must think of to add to comfort of jem mother mr wilson sat still in arm chair watching silently old irritation of temper manner seemed to have suddenly disappeared perhaps be too depressed in body mind to show mary told have be done with regard to mr bridgnorth own plan for seeking out will hope concealed a well a must all doubt fear must arise unbidden to mr wilson listened without much remark with deep interest perfect comprehension when mary ceased sighed said o wench be mother yet do so little can do so little that be what fret seem like child a see mammy ill moan cry little heart out yet doe nought to help think sense have left at once ca even find strength to cry like little child hereupon broke into feeble wail of self reproach that outward show of misery be not greater a if cry tear loud spoken word must have told of such pang at heart a look that thin piping altered voice think of mary what be enduring picture to yourself for can not tell army of thought met clashed in brain then imagine effort cost to be calm quiet even in faint way cheerful smiling at time after while began to stir about in own mind for mean of sparing poor mother trial of appearing a witness in matter of gun have made allusion to summons morning mary almost thought must have forgotten surely mean might be found to prevent that additional sorrow must see job about nay if necessary must see mr bridgnorth with truth compelling power for indeed have so struggled triumphed though sadly bleeding victor at heart over two last day have so concealed agony hidden inward woe bewilderment that began to take confidence to have faith in own power of meeting one with passably fair show might be rending life beneath cloak of deception accordingly a soon a mr davenport came in after morning church to ask after two lone woman have heard report mary have to give so much better a regarded mr wilson than what have feared night before must have be a soon a kind hearted grateful woman came in mary telling purpose went off to fetch doctor who attended alice be shaking after morning round happy in anticipation of sunday dinner be good tempered man who found difficult to keep down jovial easiness even by bed of sickness death have mischosen profession for be delight to see one around in full enjoyment of life however subdued face to proper expression of sympathy befitting doctor listening to patient patient friend mary sad pale anxious face might be taken for one other well girl what brings here said a entered surgery not on own account hope wanted to come see alice wilson then thought must maybe take look at mr wilson bustled on hat coat followed mary instantly after shaking head over alice a if be mournful thing for one so pure good so true although so humble christian to be nearing desired haven muttering accustomed word intended to destroy hope prepare anticipation went in compliance with mary look to ask usual question of mr wilson who sat passively in arm chair answered question submitted to examination how do think asked mary eagerly why began perceiving that be desired to take one side in answer unable to find out whether listener be anxious for favourable verdict otherwise thinking most probable that must desire former continued be weak certainly natural result of shock a arrest of son must be for understand james wilson who murdered mr carson be son sad thing to have reprobate in family say 'who murdered sir said mary indignantly be only taken up on suspicion many have doubt of innocence who know sir ah well well doctor have seldom time to read newspaper dare say be not very correct in story dare say be innocent be sure have right to say otherwise only word slip out indeed young woman see

reader of newspaper utterly unaware of peculiar reason there might be for so apparently unfeeling wish why did not tell so sooner might certainly do harm in weak state there be always risk attending

done dinner waiting time to be sure ca go must be madness to think of if evidence must have done good must have be different thing come to for certificate time be to say if lawyer advises second lawyer take counsel with learned profession have have have laughing at own joke departed leaving mary accusing herself of stupidity in having imagined that one be a well acquainted with fact concerning trial a be for indeed have never doubted that doctor must have be aware of purpose of poor mr wilson journey to liverpool presently went to job ever ready mr davenport keeping watch over two old woman told fear plan proceeding to surprise shook head doubtfully may have awkward look if keep back lawyer be up to trick be trick said mary be so poorly be last night so at least to day be

have never thanked for kind interest in behalf now absence made feel most lonely even little mushroom friend of hour growth boat threaded way through maze of larger vessel surrounded shore bumping against one kept off by oar from going right against overshadowed by third until at length be fairly out on broad river away from shore sight sound of land being heard in distance then came sort of pause wind tide be against two men labour a must made little way once mary in impatience have risen up to obtain better view of progress have made men have roughly told to sit down immediately have dropped on seat like chidden child although impatience be still at heart now grew sure be turning off from straight course have hitherto kept on cheshire side of river whither have gone to avoid force of current after short time must not help naming conviction a kind of nightmare dread belief came over that everything animate inanimate be in league against one sole aim object of overtaking will answered gruffly saw boatman whom knew be desirous of obtaining service a steersman so might row with greater effect knew what be about so sat silent with clenched hand while parley went on explanation be given favour asked granted be sickening time with nervous fear have be rowing long long time day seemed at least yet liverpool appeared still close at hand mary began almost to wonder that men be not a much disheartened a be when wind have be hitherto against dropped thin cloud began to gather over sky shutting out sun casting chilly gloom over everything there be not breath of air yet be colder than when soft violence of westerly wind have be felt men renewed effort boat gave bound forward at pull of oar water be glassy motionless reflecting tint by tint of indian ink sky above mary shivered heart sank within still now evidently be making progress then steersman pointed to rippling line on river only little way off men disturbed mary who be watching ship lay in what appeared to open sea to get at sail gave little start rose patience grief perhaps silence have begun to win upon men yon second to norrard be john cropper wind right now sail will soon carry alongside of have forgotten perhaps did not like to remind mary that same wind now bore little craft along with easy rapid motion must also be favourable to john cropper a looked with straining eye a if to measure decreasing distance separated from saw sail unfurled flap in breeze till catching right point bellied forth into white roundness ship began to plunge heave a if be living creature impatient to be off be heaving anchor said one of boatman to other a faint musical cry of sailor came floating over water still separated full of spirit of chase though a yet ignorant of mary motif men sprung to hoist sail be fully a much a boat must bear in keen gusty east wind be now blowing bent laboured ploughed creaked upbraidingly a if tasked beyond strength sped along with gallant swiftness drew nearer heard distant ahoy more clearly ceased anchor be up ship be away mary stood up steadying by mast stretched out arm imploring flying vessel to stay course by mute action while tear streamed down cheek men caught up oar hoisted in air shouted to arrest attention be seen by men aboard larger craft be too busy with confusion prevalent in outward bound vessel to pay much attention there be coil of rope seaman chest to be stumbled over at turn there be animal not properly secured roaming bewildered about deck adding pitiful lowings bleatings to aggregate of noise there be carcase not cut up looking like corps of sheep pig rather than like mutton pork there be sailor running here there everywhere having have time to fall into method with mind divided between thought of land people have left present duty on board ship while captain strove hard to procure kind of order by hasty command given in loud impatient voice to right left starboard larboard cabin steerage a paced deck with chafed step vexed at one two little mistake on part of mate suffering from pain of separation from wife child showing suffering only by outward irritation heard hail from shabby little river boat be striving to overtake winged ship for men fearing that a ship be now fairly over bar must only increase distance between being now within shouting range have asked of mary more particular desire throat be dry musical sound have gone out of voice in loud harsh whisper told men errand of life death hailed ship be come for one william wilson who be wanted to prove alibi in liverpool assize court to morrow james wilson be to be tried for murder done on thursday night when be with william wilson anything more missis asked boatman of mary in lower voice taking hand down from mouth say be mary barton oh ship be going on oh for love of heaven ask to stop boatman be angry at little regard paid to summons called out again repeating message with name of young woman who sent interlarding with sailor oath ship flew along away boat struggled after must see captain take speaking trumpet oh ala heard word swore dreadful oath called disgraceful name said must not stop ship for one must part with single hand whoever swung for word came in unpitying clearness with trumpet sound mary sat down looking like one who prays in death agony for eye be turned up to heaven where mercy dwelleth while blue lip quivered though sound came then bowed head hid in hand hark yon sailor hail looked up heart stopped beating to listen william wilson stood a near stern of vessel a must get unable to obtain trumpet from angry captain made tube of own hand so help god mary barton will come back in pilot boat time enough to save life of innocent what doe say asked mary wildly a voice died away in increasing distance while boatman cheered in kindled sympathy with passenger what doe say repeated tell must not hear have heard with ear brain refused to recognise sense repeated speech three speaking at once with many comment while mary looked at then at vessel far away rightly know about said sorrowfully what be pilot boat told gathered meaning out of sailor slang enveloped there be hope still although so slight faint how far doe pilot go with ship to different distance said pilot must go a far a holyhead for chance of homeward bound vessel others only took ship over bank captain be more cautious than others pilot have different way wind be against homeward bound vessel so perhaps pilot aboard john cropper must not care to go far out how soon must come back there be three boatman three opinion varying from twelve hour to two day nay man who gave vote for longest time on having judgment disputed grew stubborn doubled time thought might be end of week before pilot boat came home began disputing urging reason mary tried to understand independently of nautical language veil seemed drawn over mind have clear perception of anything passed very word seemed not own beyond power of control for found speaking quite differently to what meant one by one hope have fallen away left desolate though chance yet remained must no longer hope felt certain too must fade vanish sank into kind of stupor outward object harmonised with despair gloomy leaden sky deep dark water below of still heavier shade of colour cold flat yellow shore in distance ray lightened up nipping cutting wind shivered with depression of mind body sail be taken down of course on return to liverpool progress made rowing tacking be very slow men talked together disputing about pilot at first then about matter of local importance in mary must have taken interest at time gradually became drowsy irrepressibly so indeed for in spite of jerking effort to keep awake sank away to bottom of boat there lay crouched on rough heap of sail rope tackle of various kind measured beat of water against side of boat musical boom of more distant wave be more lulling than silence slept sound once opened eye heavily dimly saw old grey rough boatman who have stood out most obstinately for full fare covering with thick pea jacket have taken off on purpose be doing tenderly in way before must rouse up to thank have dropped off to sleep again at last in dusk of evening arrived at landing place from have started hour before men spoke to mary though mechanically replied did not stir so at length be obliged to shake

lodged must not name street everything have passed away did not signify better be lost than found sat down quietly on top step of landing gazed down into dark dank water below once twice spectral thought loomed among shadow of brain wonder whether beneath that cold dismal surface there must not be rest from trouble of earth must not hold idea before for two consecutive moment forgot what thought about before must act upon so continued sitting motionless without looking up regarding in way insult to be subjected through darkening light old boatman have watched interested in in spite of

intense love woe deprecating dread of answer suddenly resolution be taken present be everything future that vast shroud be maddening to think upon now might own fault now might even own love now when beloved stood thus abhorred of men there must be feminine shame to stand between avowal so also turned towards judge partly to mark that answer be not given to monkeyfied man who questioned likewise

who must first be in court in order to see darling then when sob became irrepressible have to be led out into open air sat there weeping on step of court house who must have taken charge of mary on release from witness box know if mr sturgis boatman wife have not be there brought by interest in mary towards whom now pressed in order to urge to leave scene of trial said mary to proposition must be here must watch that hang know must oh will not hang never fear besides wind have changed be in favour come away be so hot first white then red be sure be ill just come away oh know about anything

to case for prosecution be now being wound up counsel for prisoner have avoided much cross examination reserving to right of calling witness forward again for have received so little such vague instruction understood so much depended on evidence of one who be not forthcoming that in fact have little hope of establishing anything like show of defence contented with watching case lying in wait

childhood youth mr carson have be accustomed to poverty be honest decent poverty not grinding squalid misery have remarked in part of john barton house contrasted strangely with pompous sumptuousness

difficulty to be anticipated in preserving secret must be obviated if must induce mother to fall into plan have named to mary of emigrating to canada reason rendered secrecy desirable related to domestic happiness hoped for with mother irritable temper must hardly expect that allusion to crime of john barton must be for ever restrained from passing lip knew deep trial such reference must be to mary accordingly resolved a soon a possible in morning to go to job beseech silence trusted that secrecy in quarter even if knowledge have be extended to margaret might be easily secured what must be mr carson course be there mean by might be persuaded to spare john barton memory be roused up from train of thought by mother more irritated tone of voice jem be saying thou mightst just a well

like man under affliction bowed low in return to then suddenly came forward shook by hand thus without word more parted there be stage in contemplation endurance of great sorrow endow men with same earnestness clearness of thought that in of old took form of prophecy to who have large capability of loving suffering united with great power of firm endurance there come time in woe when be lifted out of contemplation of individual case into searching inquiry into nature of calamity remedy if remedy there be may prevent recurrence to others a well a to hence beautiful noble effort be from time to time brought to light a being continuously made by who have once hung on cross of agony in order that others may not suffer a have done one of grandest end sorrow can accomplish sufferer wrestling with god messenger until blessing be left behind not for one alone for generation took time before stern nature of mr carson be compelled to recognition of secret of comfort same sternness prevented reaping benefit in public estimation from action performed for character be more easily changed than habit manner originally formed by character to dying day mr carson be considered hard cold by who
