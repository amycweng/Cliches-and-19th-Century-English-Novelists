county be human after suffered like apprentice from same cause that affected morning be disposed to find fault with everything everybody seemed to have risen with determination of putting world that contained world at least to right before night abuse negligence have long passed unreproved winked at be to day to be dragged to light sharply reprimanded nothing le than perfection must satisfy mr mason at such time have idea of justice too be not divinely beautiful true idea be something more resembling grocer tea dealer idea of equal right little over indulgence last night be to be balanced by good deal of over severity to day manner of rectifying previous error fully satisfied conscience ruth be not inclined for capable of much extra exertion must have tasked power to have pleased

so offered to clear workroom for will find directly ma'be answered one of girl oh be well aware of miss hilton custom of shuffling off duty upon one who can be induced to relieve replied mr mason ruth reddened tear sprang to eye be so conscious of falsity of accusation that rebuked for being moved by raising head gave proud look round a if in appeal to companion where be skirt of lady farnham dress flounce not put on be surprised may ask to whom work be entrusted yesterday inquired mr mason fixing eye on ruth be to have done made mistake have to undo be very sorry might have guessed certainly there be little difficulty to be sure in discovering when work have be neglected spoilt into whose hand have fallen such be speech fell to ruth share on day of day when be least fitted to bear with equanimity in afternoon be necessary for mr mason to go few mile into country left injunction order direction prohibition without end at last be gone in relief of absence ruth laid arm on table burying head began to cry aloud with weak unchecked sob cry miss hilton ruthie never mind old dragon how will bear on for five year if spirit up not to care straw for what say be of mode of comfort sympathy administered by young workwomen jenny with wiser insight into grievance remedy said suppose ruth go out instead of fanny barton to do errand fresh air will do good know dislike cold east wind while ruth say enjoys frost snow kind of shivery weather fanny barton be great sleepy looking girl huddling over fire one so willing a to relinquish walk on bleak afternoon when east wind blew keenly down street drying up very snow there be temptation to come abroad for who be not absolutely obliged to leave warm room indeed dusk hour showed that be usual tea time for humble inhabitant of part of town through ruth have to pas on shopping expedition a came to high ground just above river where street sloped rapidly down to bridge saw flat country beyond covered with snow making black dome of cloud laden sky appear yet blacker a if winter night have never fairly gone away have hovered on edge of world through short bleak day down by bridge where there be little shelving bank used a landing place for pleasure boat must float on willow stream child be playing defying cold one of have got large washing tub with use of broken oar kept steering pushing hither thither in little creek much to admiration of companion who stood gravely looking on immovable in attentive observation of hero although face be blue with cold hand crammed deep into pocket with faint hope of finding warmth there perhaps feared that if unpacked from lumpy attitude began to move about cruel wind must find way into cranny of tattered dress be huddled up still with eye intent on embryo sailor at last one little man envious of reputation that playfellow be acquiring by daring called out will set thee craddy tom thou dar' go over yon black line in water out into real river of course challenge be not to be refused tom paddled away towards dark line beyond river swept with smooth steady current ruth child in year stood at top of declivity watching adventurer a unconscious of danger a group of child below at playfellow success broke through calm gravity of observation into boisterous mark of applause clapping hand stamping impatient little foot shouting well done tom thou hast done rarely tom stood in childish dignity for moment facing admirer then in instant washing tub boat be whirled round lost balance fell out boat be carried away slowly surely by strong full river eternally moved onwards to sea child shrieked aloud with terror ruth flew down to little bay far into willow water before felt how useless such action be that sensible plan must have be to seek for efficient help hardly have thought struck when louder sharper than sullen roar of stream be ceaselessly unrelentingly flowing on came splash of horse galloping through water in be standing past like lightning down in stream swimming along with current stooping rider outstretched grasping arm little life redeemed child saved to who loved ruth stood dizzy sick with emotion while took place when rider turned swimming horse slowly breasted up river to landing place recognised a mr bellingham of night before carried unconscious child across horse body hung in so lifeless manner that ruth believed be dead eye be suddenly blinded with tear waded back to beach to point towards mr bellingham be directing horse be dead asked stretching out arm to receive little fellow for instinctively felt that position in hung be not most conducive to returning consciousness if indeed must ever return think not answered mr bellingham a gave child to before springing off horse be brother do know who be look said ruth who have sat

tenderly towards mean little cottage indicated by neighbour old crippled woman be coming out of door shaking over with agitation dear heart said be last of be gone afore nonsense said mr bellingham boy be alive likely to live old woman be helpless hopeless insisted on believing that grandson be dead dead must have be if have not be for ruth one two of more sensible neighbour who under mr bellingham direction bustled about did be necessary until animation be restored what confounded time people be in fetching doctor said mr bellingham to ruth between whom sort of silent understanding have sprung up from circumstance of having be only two besides mere child who have witnessed accident also only two to whom certain degree of cultivation have given power of understanding other thought even other word take so much to knock idea into such stupid people head stood gaping asking doctor be to go for a if signified whether be brown smith so long a have wit about have more time to

quite forgotten in interest of afternoon event whole thought bent upon rightly understanding following out wish for little boy welfare until now have be first object in own mind at moment strong perception of ruth exceeding beauty came again upon almost lost sense of what be saying be so startled into admiration night before have not seen eye now looked straight innocently full at grave earnest deep when instinctively read change in expression of countenance dropped large white veiling lid thought face be lovelier still irresistible impulse seized to arrange matter so that might see

voice for now that conversation no longer related to boy felt shy restrained held out hand to shake hers just a gave to old grandmother came tottering up to ask question interruption jarred upon made once more keenly alive to closeness of air squalor dirt by be surrounded good woman said to nelly brownson must not keep place little neater cleaner be more fit for pig than human being air in room be quite offensive dirt filth be really disgraceful by time be mounted bowing to ruth rode away then old woman wrath broke out who may be that know better manner than to come into poor woman house to

stupidity truth be that afternoon adventure filled mind only figure of tom who be now safe likely to do well be receding into background that of mr bellingham becoming more prominent than have be spirited natural action of galloping into water to save child be magnified by ruth into most heroic deed of daring interest about boy be tender thoughtful benevolence in eye careless liberality of money be fine generosity for forgot that generosity implies degree of self denial be gratified too by power of dispensing comfort have entrusted to be busy with alnaschar vision of wise expenditure when necessity of opening mr mason house door summoned back into actual present life dread of immediate scolding for time however be spared spared for such reason that must have be thankful for blame in preference to impunity during absence jenny difficulty of breathing have suddenly become worse girl have on own responsibility put to bed be standing round in dismay when mr mason return home only

day of happiness in return spoke of own childhood not so golden in reality a ruth more dazzling when recounted with story of beautiful cream coloured arabian pony old picture gallery in house avenue terrace fountain in garden for ruth to paint with vividness of imagination a scenery background for figure be growing by slow degree most prominent in thought must not be supposed that be effected at once though intermediate stage have be passed over on sunday mr bellingham only spoke to to receive information about panel did come to st nicholas next yet following sunday third walked by side little way seeing annoyance left then wished for back again found day very dreary wondered why strange undefined feeling have made imagine be doing wrong in walking alongside of one so kind good a mr

likely never must notice again for knew have be very rude with short answer be very provoking that have behaved so rudely must be sixteen in month be still childish awkward thus lectured after parting with mr bellingham consequence be that on following sunday be ten time a blushing conscious mr bellingham thought ten time more beautiful than ever suggested that instead of going straight home through high street must take round by leasowes at first declined then suddenly wondering questioning why refused thing be a far a reason knowledge knowledge went so innocent be certainly so tempting pleasant agreed to go round when be once in meadow skirted town forgot doubt awkwardness nay almost forgot presence of mr bellingham in delight at new tender beauty of early spring day in february among last year brown ruin heaped together by wind in hedgerow found fresh green crinkled leaf pale star like flower of primrose here there golden celandine made brilliant side of little brook that full of water in february fill dyke bubbled along by side of path sun be low in horizon once when came to higher part of leasowes ruth burst into exclamation of delight at evening glory of mellow light be in sky behind purple distance while brown leafless wood in foreground derived almost metallic lustre from golden mist haze of sunset be three quarter of mile round by meadow somehow took hour to walk ruth turned to thank mr bellingham for kindness in taking home by beautiful way look of admiration at glowing animated face made suddenly silent hardly wishing good bye quickly entered house with beating happy agitated heart how strange be thought that evening must feel a if charming afternoon walk be somehow not exactly wrong yet a if be not right why can be be not defrauding mr mason of of time that know must be wrong be left to go where like on sunday have be to church so ca be because have missed doing duty if have gone walk with jenny wonder whether must have felt a do now there

innocent good for be not conscious a yet that mr bellingham presence have added charm to ramble when might have become aware of a week after week sunday after sunday loitering ramble after loitering ramble succeeded other be too much absorbed with one set of thought to have much inclination for self questioning tell everything ruth a must to brother let help if can in difficulty said to one afternoon really did try to understand to realise how insignificant paltry person like mason dressmaker must be object of dread regarded a person having authority by ruth flamed up with indignation when by way of impressing with mr mason power consequence ruth spoke of instance of effect of employer displeasure declared mother must never have gown made again by such tyrant mr brownrigg that must prevent acquaintance from going to such cruel dressmaker till ruth be alarmed at threatened consequence of one sided account pleaded for mr mason a earnestly a if young man menace of description be likely to be literally fulfilled indeed sir have be very wrong if please sir be so angry be often very good to be only sometimes go into passion be very provoking dare say know be for one have often to undo work ca think how spoil anything particularly silk to be unpicked mr mason have to bear blame oh be sorry said anything about speak to mother about pray sir mr mason think so much of mr

so again will not answer for will take care not tell again sir said ruth in low voice nay ruth be not going to have secret from be remember promise to consider a brother go on telling everything happens to pray can not think how much interest take in interest can quite fancy that charming home at milham told about last sunday can almost fancy mr mason workroom surely be proof either of strength of imagination of power of description ruth smiled be indeed sir workroom must be so different to anything ever saw think must have passed through milham often on way to lowford then think be stretch of fancy to have so clear idea a have of milham grange on left hand of road be ruth yes sir just over bridge up hill where elm tree meet overhead make green shade then come dear old grange that will never see again never nonsense ruthie be only six mile off may see day be not hour ride perhaps may see again when be grown old did not think exactly what 'never meant be so very long since

if must be such great pleasure that must be in way wrong why little goose what can be wrong in in first place miss going to church by setting out at two said ruth little gravely only for once surely see harm in missing church for once will go in morning know wonder if mr mason must think right if must allow dare say not mean to be governed by mr mason notion of right wrong thought right to treat poor girl palmer in way told about must think that wrong know so must one of sense feeling come ruth pin faith on one judge for pleasure be perfectly innocent be not selfish pleasure either for will enjoy to full a much a will will like to see place where spent childhood will almost love a much a do have dropped voice spoke in low persuasive tone ruth hung down head blushed with exceeding happiness must not speak even to urge doubt afresh thus be in manner settled how delightfully happy plan made through coming week be too young when mother died to have received caution word of advice

towards close of happy day be past five o'clock before came to great mill wheel stood in sabbath idleness motionless in brown mass of shade still wet with yesterday immersion in deep transparent water beneath clambered little hill not yet fully shaded by overarching elm then ruth checked mr bellingham by slight motion of hand lay within arm glanced up into face to see what that face must express a looked on milham grange now lying still peaceful in afternoon shadow be house of after thought building material be plentiful in neighbourhood successive owner have found necessity for addition projection till be picturesque mass of irregularity of broken light shadow a whole gave full complete idea of home gable nook be blended held together by tender green of climbing rose young creeper old couple be living in house until must be let dwelt in back part never used front door so little bird have grown tame familiar perched upon window sill porch on old stone cistern caught water from roof went silently through untrimmed garden full of pale coloured flower of spring spider have spread web over front door sight of conveyed sense of desolation to ruth heart thought be possible state entrance have never be used since father dead body have be borne forth without speaking word turned abruptly away went round house to door mr bellingham followed without questioning little understanding feeling full of admiration for varying expression called out upon face old woman have not yet returned from church from weekly gossip neighbourly tea succeeded husband sat in kitchen spelling psalm for day in prayer book reading word out aloud habit have acquired from double solitude of life for be deaf did not hear quiet entrance of pair be struck with sort of ghostly echo seems to haunt half furnished uninhabited house verse be reading be following why art thou so vexed o soul why art thou so disquieted within o put thy trust in god for will yet thank be help of countenance god when have finished shut book sighed with satisfaction of having done duty word of holy trust though perhaps be not fully understood carried faithful peace down into depth of soul a looked up saw young couple standing on middle of floor pushed iron rimmed spectacle on to forehead rose to greet daughter of old master ever honoured mistress god bless thee lass god bless thee old eye be glad to see thee again ruth sprang forward to shake horny hand stretched forward in action of blessing pressed between of hers a rapidly poured out question mr bellingham be not altogether comfortable at seeing one whom have already begun to appropriate a own so tenderly familiar with hard featured meanly dressed day labourer sauntered to window looked out into grass grown farm yard must not help overhearing of conversation seemed to carried on too much in tone of equality who be yon asked old labourer at last be sweetheart missis son reckon be spruce young chap anyhow mr bellingham blood of howard rose tingled about ear so that must not hear ruth answer began by hush thomas pray hush how went on did not catch idea of being mr mason son be really too ridiculous like most thing be too ridiculous made very angry be hardly again when ruth shyly came to window recess asked if must like to see house place into front door entered many people thought very pretty said half timidly for face have unconsciously assumed hard haughty expression must not instantly soften down followed however before left kitchen saw old man standing looking at ruth companion with strange grave air of dissatisfaction went along one two zigzag damp smelling stone passage then entered house place common sitting room for farmer family in part of country front door opened into several other apartment issued out of such a dairy state bedroom be half parlour a well small room have be appropriated to late mr hilton where sat more frequently lay commanding through open door coming going of household in day house place have be cheerful room full of life with passing to fro of husband child servant with great merry wood fire crackling blazing away evening hardly let out in very heat of summer for with thick stone wall deep window seat drapery of vine leaf ivy that room with flag floor seemed always to want sparkle cheery warmth of fire now green shadow from without seemed to have become black in uninhabited desolation oaken shovel board heavy dresser carved cupboard be now dull damp be formerly polished up to brightness of looking glass where fire blaze be for ever glinting only added to oppressive gloom flag floor be wet with heavy moisture ruth stood gazing into room seeing nothing of what be present saw vision of former day evening in day of childhood father sitting in master corner near fire sedately smoking pipe while dreamily watched wife child mother reading to a sat on little stool at foot be gone gone into land of shadow for moment seemed so present in old room that ruth believed actual life to be dream then still silent went on into mother parlour there bleak look of what have once be full of peace mother love struck cold on heart uttered cry threw down by sofa hiding face in hand while frame quivered with repressed sob dearest ruth give way so can do good can not bring back dead said mr bellingham distressed at witnessing distress know can not murmured ruth be why cry cry because nothing will ever bring back again sobbed afresh more gently for kind word soothed softened if must not take away sense of desolation come away can not have stay here full of painful association a room must be come raising with gentle violence show little garden have often told about near window of very room be not see how well remember everything tell led round through back part of house into pretty old fashioned garden there be sunny border just under window clipped box yew tree by grass plat further away from house prattled again of childish adventure solitary play when turned round saw old man who have hobbled out with help of stick be looking at with same grave sad look of anxiety mr bellingham spoke rather sharply why doe that old man follow about in way be excessively impertinent of think oh call old thomas impertinent be so good kind be like father to remember sitting on knee many many time when be child whilst told story out of 'pilgrim progress ' taught to suck up milk through straw mamma be very fond of too used to sit with always in evening when papa be away at market for mamma be rather afraid of having man in house used to beg old thomas to stay must take on knee listen just a attentively a did while mamma read aloud mean to say have sat upon old fellow knee oh yes many many time mr bellingham looked graver than have done while witnessing ruth passionate emotion in mother room lost sense of indignity in admiration of companion a wandered among flower seeking for favourite bush plant to history remembrance be attached wound in out in natural graceful wavy line between luxuriant overgrown shrub be fragrant with leafy smell of spring growth went on careless of watching eye indeed unconscious for time of existence once stopped to take hold of spray of jessamine softly kiss have be mother favourite flower old thomas be standing by horse mount be also observer of going on while mr bellingham feeling be that of passionate admiration mingled with selfish kind of love old man gazed with tender anxiety lip moved in word of blessing be pretty creature with glint of mother about be same kind lass a ever not bit set up with yon fine manty maker shop be in misdoubt that young fellow though for called real gentleman checked when asked if be sweetheart if be not sweetheart look have forgotten young day here be going suppose look want to go without word to old man be none so changed a reckon not ruth indeed never perceived dissatisfied expression of mr bellingham countenance visible to old man keen eye came running up to thomas to send love to wife to shake many time by hand tell mary will make such fine gown a soon a ever set up for myself will be in fashion big gigot sleeve that will not know in mind tell thomas will aye will lass reckon will be pleased to hear thou hast not forgotten thy old merry way lord bless thee lord lift up light of countenance upon thee ruth be half way towards impatient mr bellingham when old friend called back longed to give warning of danger that thought be in yet did not know how when came up all must think of to say be text indeed language of bible be language in thought whenever idea went beyond practical everyday life into expression of emotion feeling dear remember devil goeth about a roaring lion seeking whom may devour remember that ruth word fell on ear gave definite idea utmost suggested be remembrance of dread felt a child when verse came into mind how used to imagine lion head with glaring eye peering out of bush in dark shady part of wood for reason have always avoided even now must hardly think of without shudder never imagined that grim warning related to handsome young man who awaited with countenance beaming with love tenderly drew hand within arm old man sighed a watched away lord may help to guide step aright may be afeard be treading in perilous place will put missis up to going to town getting speech of telling bit of danger old motherly woman like mary will set about better stupid fellow like poor old labourer prayed long earnestly that night for ruth called wrestling for soul think prayer be heard for god judgeth not a man judgeth ruth went on way unconscious of dark phantom of future be gathering around melancholy turned with pliancy of childish year at sixteen not yet lost into softened manner be infinitely charming by by cleared up into sunny happiness evening be still full of mellow light new born summer be so delicious that in common with young creature shared influence be glad stood together at top of steep ascent hill of hundred at summit there be level space sixty seventy yard square of unenclosed broken ground over golden bloom of gorse cast rich hue while delicious scent perfumed fresh nimble air on one side of common ground sloped down to clear bright pond in be mirrored rough sand cliff rose abrupt on opposite bank hundred of marten found home there be now wheeling over transparent water dipping in wing in evening sport indeed sort of bird seemed to haunt lonely pool water wagtail be scattered around margin linnet perched on topmost spray of gorse bush other hidden warbler sang vesper on uneven ground beyond on far side of green waste close by road well placed for requirement of horse rider who might be weary with ascent of hill there be public house be more of farm than inn be long low building rich in dormer window on weather side be necessary in such exposed situation with odd projection unlooked for gable on side there be deep porch in front on whose hospitable bench dozen person might sit enjoy balmy air noble sycamore grew right before house with seat round such tent patriarch loved nondescript sign hung from branch on side next to road being wisely furnished with interpretation be found to mean king charles in oak near comfortable quiet unfrequented inn there be pond for household farm yard purpose from cattle be drinking before returning to field after have be milked very motion be so lazy slow that served to fill up mind with sensation of dreamy rest ruth mr bellingham plunged through broken ground to regain road near wayside inn hand in hand now pricked by far spreading gorse now ankle deep in sand now pressing soft thick heath must make so brave autumn show now over wild thyme other fragrant herb made way with many merry laugh once on road at summit ruth stood silent in breathless delight at view before hill fell suddenly down into plain extending for dozen mile more there be clump of dark scotch fir close to cut clear against western sky threw back nearest level into distance plain below be richly wooded be tinted by young tender hue of earliest summer for tree of wood have donned leaf except cautious ash here there gave soft pleasant greyness to landscape far away in champaign be spire tower stack of chimney belonging to distant hidden farm house be traced downwards through golden air by thin column of blue smoke sent up from evening fire view be bounded by rising ground in deep purple shadow against sunset sky when first stopped silent with sighing pleasure air seemed full of pleasant noise distant church bell made harmonious music with little singing bird near at hand be lowings of cattle call of farm servant discordant for voice seemed to be hushed by brooding consciousness of sabbath stood loitering before house quietly enjoying view clock in little inn struck eight sounded clear sharp in stillness can be so late asked ruth must not have thought possible answered mr bellingham never mind will be at home long before nine stay there be shorter road know through field just wait moment while go in ask exact way dropped ruth arm went into public house gig have be slowly toiling up sandy hill behind unperceived by young couple now reached table land be close upon a separated ruth turned round when sound of horse footstep came distinctly a reached level faced mr mason be not

degree influenced by force of temptation called intolerance keeping up character of establishment must have be better more christian thing if have kept up character of girl by tender vigilance maternal care evening too be in irritated state of temper brother have undertaken to drive round by henbury in order to give unpleasant information of misbehaviour of eldest son who be assistant in draper shop in neighbouring town be full of indignation against want of steadiness though not willing to direct indignation against right object ne'er do well darling while be thus charged with anger for brother justly defended son master companion from attack saw ruth standing with lover far away from home at time in evening boiled over with intemperate displeasure come here directly miss hilton exclaimed sharply then dropping voice to low bitter tone of concentrated wrath said to trembling guilty ruth attempt to show face at house again after conduct saw spark too will have slur on character of apprentice say word saw enough will write tell guardian to morrow horse started away for be impatient to be off ruth be left standing there stony sick pale a if lightning have torn up ground

unfortunate began at last then stopped then began again be very unfortunate for see did not like to name to before believe have business in fact obliges to go to town to morrow to london mean know

be magnificent a have anticipated longed to extend walk to other side of stream so sought stepping stone usual crossing place be over shadowed by tree few yard from pool water ran high rapidly a busy a life between piece of grey rock ruth have fear went lightly steadily on about middle however there be great gap one of stone be so covered with water a to be invisible have be washed lower down at rate spring from stone to stone be long ruth hesitated for moment before taking sound of rushing water be in ear to exclusion of other noise eye be on current running swiftly below foot thus be startled to see figure close before on one of stone to hear voice offering help looked up saw man who be apparently long past middle life of stature of dwarf second glance accounted for low height of speaker for then saw be deformed a consciousness of infirmity came into mind must have told in softened eye for faint flush of colour came into pale face of deformed gentleman a repeated word water be very rapid will take hand perhaps can help ruth accepted offer with assistance be across in moment made way for to precede in narrow wood path then silently followed up glen when have passed out of wood into pasture land beyond ruth once more turned to mark be struck afresh with mild beauty of face though there be something in countenance told of body deformity something more beyond pallor of habitual ill health something of quick spiritual light in deep set eye sensibility about mouth altogether though peculiar be most attractive face will allow to accompany if be going round by cwm dhu a

glove in hedge side at bottom of one two crimson speckled flower be bursting from green sheath dare say know what make fox glove bend sway so gracefully think be blown by wind looked at with grave smile did not enliven thoughtful eye gave inexpressible sweetness to face always thought be wind what be asked ruth innocently oh welsh tell that flower be sacred to fairy that have power of

house threw radiant distance into aerial perspective far away passed by little shop just issuing from came nurse baby little boy baby sat in placid dignity in nurse arm with face of queenly calm fresh soft peachy complexion be really tempting ruth who be always fond of child went up to coo to smile at little thing after peep boing be about to snatch kiss when harry whose face have be reddening ever since play began lifted up sturdy little right arm hit ruth great blow on face oh for shame sir said nurse snatching back hand how dare do to lady who be so kind a to speak to sissy be not lady said

such notion ma'be said at last apologetically to ruth who stood white still with new idea running through mind be notion be true nurse heard say go away naughty woman said boy in infantile vehemence of passion to ruth to nurse infinite relief ruth turned away humbly meekly with bent head slow uncertain step a turned saw mild sad face of deformed gentleman who be sitting at open window above shop looked sadder graver than ever eye met glance with expression of deep sorrow so condemned alike by youth age stole with timid step into house mr bellingham be awaiting coming in sitting room glorious day restored buoyancy of spirit talked gaily away without pausing for reply while ruth made tea tried to calm heart be yet beating with agitation of new idea have received from occurrence of morning

implied did not harmonise with own ruth what be matter morning really be very provoking yesterday when everything be gloomy might have be aware be out of spirit heard nothing expression of delight to day when creature under heaven be rejoicing look most deplorable woe begone really must learn to have little sympathy tear fell quickly down ruth cheek did not speak must not put into word sense be just beginning to entertain of estimation in be henceforward to be held thought must be a much grieved a be at what have taken place that morning fancied must sink in opinion if told how others regarded besides seemed ungenerous to dilate upon suffering of be cause will not thought embitter life will try be cheerful must not think of so much if can make happy what need care for chance speech

looking down on tree top be softly waving far beneath foot there be path leading sharp down followed ledge of rock made almost like going down step walk grew into bounding bounding into run before reached lowest plane green gloom reigned there be still hour of noon little bird be quiet in leafy shade went on few yard then came to circular pool overshadowed by tree whose highest bough have be beneath foot few minute before pond be hardly below surface of ground there be nothing like bank on side heron be standing there motionless when saw flapped wing slowly rose soared above green height of wood up into very sky for at depth tree appeared to touch round white cloud brooded over earth speed well grew in willowest water of pool around margin flower be hardly seen at first so deep be green shadow cast by tree in very middle of pond sky be mirrored clear dark blue looked a if black void lay behind oh there be water lily said ruth eye catching on farther side must go get will get

be flushed into brilliancy of colour resembled that of rose in june great heavy white flower drooped on side of beautiful head if brown hair be little disordered very disorder only seemed to add grace pleased more by looking so lovely than by tender endeavour to fall in with varying humour when left wood ruth have taken out flower resumed bonnet a came near inn simple thought of giving pleasure be not enough to secure ruth peace became pensive sad must not rally into gaiety really ruth said that evening must not encourage in habit of falling into melancholy revery without cause have be sighing twenty time during last half hour do be little cheerful remember have companion in out of way place be very sorry sir said ruth eye filling with tear then remembered that be very dull for to be alone with heavy hearted a have be day said in sweet penitent tone must be so kind a to teach one of game at card be speaking about yesterday sir must do best to learn soft murmuring voice won way rang for

from light not speaking presently fell asleep ruth put out candle sat patiently by for long time fancying must awaken refreshed room grew cool in night air ruth dared not rouse from what appeared to be sound restoring slumber covered with shawl have thrown over chair on coming in from twilight ramble have ample time to think tried to banish thought at last breathing became quick oppressed after listening to for minute with increasing affright ruth ventured to waken seemed stupified shivery ruth became more more terrified household be asleep except one servant girl who be wearied out of what little english have knowledge of in more waking hour must only answer i indeed ma'be to question put to by ruth sat by bedside night long moaned tossed never spoke sensibly be new form of illness to

sick agony girl have right to urge to partake of that alone broke monotony of long morning heard sound of merry party setting out on excursion on horseback in carriage once stiff wearied stole to window looked out on one side of blind day looked bright discordant to aching anxious heart gloom of darkened room be better more befitting be hour after be summoned before doctor made appearance questioned patient receiving coherent answer asked ruth concerning symptom when questioned in turn only shook head looked grave made sign to mr morgan to follow out of room went down to parlour leaving ruth in depth of despair lower than must have thought possible there remained for to experience hour before be afraid be bad case said mr jones to mr morgan in welsh brain fever have evidently

prayed with utter forgetfulness of self only with consciousness that god be powerful that whom loved so much needed aid of mighty one day night summer night seemed merged into one lost count of time in hushed darkened room one morning mr morgan beckoned out stole on tiptoe into dazzling gallery on one side of bedroom opened be come whispered mr morgan looking very much excited forgetting that ruth have never heard that mr bellingham have be summoned who be come asked ruth idea of mr mason flashed through mind with more terrible because more vague dread heard that be mother mother of whom have always spoken a person whose opinion be to be regarded more than of other individual what must do will be angry with said relapsing into child like dependence on others feeling even mr morgan be one to stand between mr bellingham mr morgan be little perplexed morality be rather shocked at idea of proper real lady like mr bellingham discovering that have winked at connexion between son ruth be quite inclined to encourage ruth in inclination to shrink out of mr bellingham observation inclination arose from definite consciousness of having done wrong principally from representation have always heard of lady awfulness mr bellingham swept into son room a if be unconscious what poor young creature have lately haunted while ruth hurried into unoccupied bedroom alone there felt restraint suddenly give way burst into saddest most utterly wretched weeping have ever known be worn out with watching exhausted by passionate cry lay down on bed fell asleep day passed on slumbered unnoticed unregarded awoke late in evening with sense of having done wrong in sleeping so long strain upon responsibility have not yet left twilight be closing fast around waited until have become night then stole down to mr morgan parlour if please may come in asked jenny morgan be doing up hieroglyphic called account answered sharply enough be permission to enter ruth be thankful for will tell how be do

going to door shouting out sharp direction in welsh to nest gwen three four other rough kind slatternly servant brought tea be comfortable according to idea of comfort prevalent in rude hospitable place there be plenty to eat too much indeed for revolted appetite be intended to provoke heartiness with kind rosy waiter pressed to eat scolding mr morgan gave when found buttered toast untouched toast on have desired that butter might not be spared did ruth more good than tea began to hope to long for morning when hope might have become certainty be in vain that be told that room have be in day be at service did not say word be not going to bed night of night in year when life death hung trembling in balance went into bedroom till bustling house be still heard busy foot passing to fro in room might not enter voice imperious though hushed down to whisper ask for innumerable thing then there be silence when thought that be dead asleep except watcher stole out into gallery on other side be two window cut into thick stone wall flower pot be placed on shelf thus formed where great untrimmed straggling geranium grew strove to reach light window near mr bellingham door be open soft warm scented night air came sighing in in faint gust then be still be summer there be black darkness in twenty four hour only light grew dusky colour disappeared from object of shape form remained distinct soft grey oblong of barred light fell on flat wall opposite to window deeper grey shadow marked out tracery of plant more graceful thus than in reality ruth crouched where light fell sat on ground close by door whole existence be absorbed in listening be still be only heart beating with strong heavy regular sound of hammer wished must stop rushing incessant clang heard rustle of silken gown knew ought not to have be worn in sick room for sens seemed to have passed into keeping of invalid to feel only a felt noise be probably occasioned by change of posture in watcher inside for be once more dead still soft wind outside sank with low long distant moan among winding of hill lost there came more again ruth heart beat loud rose with a little noise a if be vision crept to open window to try lose nervous listening for ever recurring sound out beyond under calm sky veiled with mist rather than with cloud rose high dark outline of mountain shutting in village a if lay in nest stood like giant solemnly watching for end of earth time here there black round shadow reminded ruth of cwm hollow where lover have rambled in sun in gladness then thought land enchanted into everlasting brightness happiness fancied then that into region so lovely bale woe must enter must be charmed away disappear before sight of glorious guardian mountain now knew truth that earth have barrier avail against agony come lightning like down from heaven into mountain house town garret into palace into cottage garden lay close under house bright spot enough by day for in soil be planted grew blossomed in spite of neglect white rose glimmered out in dusk night through red be lost in shadow between low boundary of garden hill swept one two green meadow ruth looked into grey darkness till traced separate wave of outline then heard little restless bird chirp out wakefulness from nest in ivy round wall of house mother bird spread soft feather hushed into silence presently however many little bird began to scent coming dawn rustled among leaf chirruped loud clear just above horizon too mist became silvery grey cloud hanging on edge of world presently turned shimmering white then in instant flushed into rose mountain top sprang into heaven bathed in presence of shadow of god with bound sun of molten fiery red came above horizon immediately thousand of little bird sang out for joy soft chorus of mysterious glad murmur came forth from earth low whispering wind left hiding place among cleft hollow of hill wandered among rustling herb tree waking flower bud to life of day ruth gave sigh of relief that night be over gone for knew that soon suspense must be ended verdict known whether for life for death grew faint sick with anxiety almost seemed a if must go into room learn truth then heard movement be not sharp rapid a if prompted by emergency then again be still sat curled up upon floor with head thrown back against wall hand clasped round knee have yet to wait meanwhile invalid be slowly rousing from long deep sound health giving sleep mother have sat by night through be now daring to change position for first time be even venturing to give direction in low voice to old nurse who have dozed away in arm chair ready to obey summons of mistress mr bellingham went on tiptoe towards door chiding because stiff weary limb made slight noise have irrepressible longing for few minute change of scene after night of watching felt that crisis be over relief to mind made conscious of bodily feeling irritation have passed unheeded a long a have be in suspense slowly opened

be once more in open air away from scene thought have be pressing on for last three day there be new beauty in everything from blue mountain glimmered in distant sunlight down to flat rich peaceful vale with calm round shadow where sat very margin of white pebble lay on bank of stream have sort of cleanly beauty about felt calmer more at ease than have done for day yet when began to think be

softer more wavering than last how be ill pretty nearly a quiet a if be dead doe not speak move even sigh must be better for to die at once think faith one word put right be spoken in tone have authority over be so full of grieved surprise mournful upbraiding be accustomed to exercise sway over owing to greater decision of character probably if everything be traced to cause to superior vigour of constitution at time be humbled before pure childlike nature felt where be inferior be too good true to conceal feeling to resent being forced upon after time said thurstan dear let go to

that redemption may date from time help to speak to in loving spirit of thy holy son tear be full in eye almost trembled in earnestness be faint with strong power of own conviction with inability to move sister be shaken sat very still for quarter of hour more while leaned back exhausted by own feeling poor child said at poor poor child what will have to struggle through endure do remember thomas

just said of discipline penance to mother consisting in strengthening child to meet trustfully bravely consequence of own weakness remembered more clearly wild fierceness cain like look of thomas wilkins a obnoxious word in baptismal registry told that must go forth branded into world with hand against man man against how must be managed faith nay must know much more alone can tell before can see how be to be managed be certainly best plan perhaps be said brother thoughtfully no longer clearly decidedly so conversation dropped ruth moved bed curtain aside in soft manner when miss benson re entered room did not speak looked at a if wished to come near miss benson went stood by ruth took hand in hers kissed then a if fatigued even by slight movement fell asleep miss benson took up work

bradshaw come think know of what household consists not know sally oh yes doe asked mr bradshaw one day if knew what wage gave said might get far more efficient younger servant for money speaking about money think what expense must be if took home for next six month that consideration be puzzling one sat silent perplexed for time miss benson be a sorrowful a brother for be becoming a anxious a be to find possible that plan must be carried out there be fifty pound said with sigh of reluctance at idea yes there be fifty pound echoed sister with same sadness in tone suppose be hers suppose be being so must not think who gave to will defray expense be very sorry think must take must never do to apply to under present circumstance said miss benson in hesitating manner that wo said brother decisively if consent to let take care of will never let stoop to request anything from even for child can live on bread water can live on bread water rather than then will speak to propose plan oh thurstan from child must persuade to anything hope be doing right however much oppose at first be sure to yield soon almost in proportion to violence at first think be very weak not in instance be right in way in child ought to be viewed dear good faith for thinking of taking home with god bless dear for when ruth began to sit up strange new delicious prospect of becoming mother seemed to give mysterious source of strength so that recovery be rapid swift from time miss benson brought letter bank note do recollect receiving letter ruth asked with grave gentleness ruth changed colour took read again without making reply to miss benson then sighed thought while then took up read second note note mr bellingham have sent to mr benson in answer to after took up bank note turned round round not a if saw miss benson noticed that finger trembled sadly that lip be quivering for time before spoke if please miss benson must like to return money why dear have strong feeling against taking

benson went enclosed up there then simply writing word in envelope from ruth hilton now wash hand of bellingham said triumphantly ruth looked tearful sad not about returning note from conviction that reason have given for ground of determination be true no longer loved to cheer miss benson began to speak of future miss benson be one of people who more spoke of plan in detail more realised in own mind more firmly became partisan of project thus grew warm happy in idea of taking ruth home ruth remained depressed languid under conviction that no longer loved home future thought of child must wean from sorrow miss benson be little piqued pique showed afterwards in talking to brother of morning proceeding in sick chamber admired at time for sending away fifty pound so proudly think have cold heart hardly thanked at for proposal of taking home with thought be full of other thing just now people have such different way of showing feeling by silence by word at rate be unwise to expect gratitude what do expect not indifference ingratitude be better not to expect calculate consequence longer live more fully see let try simply to do right action without thinking of feeling be to call out in others know that holy self denying effort can fall to ground vain useless sweep of eternity be large god alone know when effect be to be produced be trying to do right now to feel right let perplex with endeavouring to map out how must feel how must show feeling be very fine dare say very true said miss benson little chagrined ' bird in hand be worth two in bush must rather have have one good hearty 'thank ' now for have be planning to do for than grand effect promise in beweep of eternity be grave sorrowful thurstan will go out of room can stand sally scolding ca bear look of quiet

satisfied remembering way in ruth have spoken of watch felt what sacrifice must have be to resolve to part with goodness just help out of dilemma said brother who be unaware of feeling with ruth regarded watch perhaps might have parted with facciolati mr hughes patiently awaited leisure for answering practical question where must watch be sold suddenly face brightened mr jones doctor be going to be married perhaps must like nothing better than to give pretty watch to bride indeed think be very likely will pay money for a well a letting alone bill will ask sir at rate mr jones be only too glad to obtain possession of so elegant present at so cheap rate even a mr hughes have foretold paid money for more than be required to defray expense of ruth accommodation a most of article of food have be paid for at time by mr miss benson strictly forbade mr hughes to tell ruth of must object to buying black gown said miss benson to day after sale of watch hesitated little then went on brother

kindness after tea miss benson took upstairs to room white dimity bed wall stained green have something of colouring purity of effect of snowdrop while floor rubbed with mixture turned into rich dark brown suggested idea of garden mould out of snowdrop grows a miss benson helped pale ruth to undress voice became le full toned hurried hush of approaching night subdued into softened solemn kind of tenderness murmured blessing sounded like granted prayer when miss benson came downstairs found brother reading letter have be received during absence went softly shut door of communication between parlour kitchen then fetching grey worsted stocking be knitting sat down near eye not looking at work fixed on fire while eternal rapid click of knitting needle broke silence of room with sound a monotonous incessant a noise of hand loom expected to speak did not enjoyed examination into discussion of feeling be interest amusement to while dreaded avoided such conversation there be time when feeling be always earnest sometimes morbid burst forth defied control overwhelmed when force be upon compelling to speak in general strove to preserve composure from fear of compelling pain of such time consequent exhaustion heart have be very full of ruth day long be afraid of sister beginning subject so read on seemed to do so though hardly saw letter held before be great relief to when sally threw open middle door with bang did not indicate calmness of mind sweetness of temper be yon young woman going to stay length o time with asked of miss benson mr benson put hand gently on sister arm

knelt down side by side two of prayed earnestly for have gone astray before ten o'clock household be in bed ruth sleepless weary restless with oppression of sorrow dared not face contemplate bravely kept awake early part of night many time did rise go to long casement window look abroad over still quiet town over grey stone wall chimney old high pointed roof on to far away hilly line of horizon lying calm under bright moonshine be late in morning when woke from long deferred slumber when went downstairs found mr miss benson awaiting in parlour homely pretty old fashioned little room how bright still clean looked window window at back of house be casement be open to let in sweet morning air streaming eastern sunshine long jessamine spray with white scented star forced almost into room little square garden beyond with grey stone wall round be rich mellow in autumnal colouring running from deep crimson hollyhock up to amber gold nasturtium toned down by clear delicate air be so still that gossamer web laden with dew did not tremble quiver in least sun be drawing to sweet incense of many flower parlour be scented with odour of mignonette stock miss benson be arranging bunch of china damask rose in old fashioned jar lay dewy fresh on white breakfast cloth when ruth entered mr benson be reading in large folio with gentle morning speech greeted quiet repose of scene be instantly broken by sally popping in from kitchen glancing at ruth with sharp reproach said reckon may bring in breakfast now with strong emphasis on last word be afraid be very late said ruth oh never mind said mr benson gently be fault for not telling breakfast hour always have prayer at past seven for sally sake never vary from time for can so arrange work if know hour of prayer a to have mind calm untroubled ahem said miss benson rather inclined to testify against invariable calmness of sally mind at hour of day brother went on a if did not hear breakfast doe not signify being delayed little be sure be sadly tired with long day yesterday sally came slapping in put down withered tough dry toast with be not doing if be like leather a one appeared to hear withdrew to kitchen leaving ruth cheek like crimson at annoyance have caused day long have that feeling common to who go to stay at fresh house among comparative stranger feeling of necessity that must become accustomed to new atmosphere in be placed before must move act freely be indeed purer diviner air be breathing in now than what have be accustomed to for long month gentle blessed mother who have made childhood home holy ground be in very nature so far removed from of earth stain temptation that seemed truly one of who ask not if thine eye be on who in love truth where misgiving be rely upon genial sense of youth in bensons house there be same unconsciousness of individual merit same absence of introspection analysis of motive a there have be in mother seemed that life be pure good not merely from lovely beautiful nature from law obedience to be of harmonious peace governed almost implicitly with a little questioning on part a glorious star haste not rest not in eternal obedience household have many failing be human with loving desire to bring life into harmony with will of god often erred fell short somehow very error fault of one individual served to call out higher excellence in so reacted upon other result of short discord be exceeding harmony peace have idea of real state of thing did not trouble with marking progress by self examination if mr benson did sometimes in hour of sick incapacity for exertion turn inwards be to cry aloud with almost morbid despair god be merciful to sinner strove to leave life in hand of god to forget ruth sat still quiet through long first day be languid weary from journey be uncertain what help might offer to give in household duty what might not in languor in uncertainty be pleasant to watch new way of people among whom be placed after breakfast mr benson withdrew to study miss benson took away cup saucer leaving kitchen door open talked sometimes to ruth sometimes to sally while washed up sally have upstairs duty to perform for ruth be thankful a kept receiving rather angry glance for unpunctuality a long a sally remained downstairs miss benson assisted in preparation for early dinner brought kidney bean to shred into basin of bright pure spring water caught danced in sunbeam a sat near open casement of parlour talking to ruth of thing people a yet latter did not understand must not arrange comprehend be like child who get few piece of dissected map be confused until glimpse of whole unity be shown mr mr bradshaw be centre piece in ruth map child servant be accessory one two other name be occasionally mentioned ruth wondered almost wearied at miss benson perseverance in talking to about people whom did not know in truth miss benson heard long drawn quivering sigh came from poor heavy heart when be left to silence have leisure to review past quick accustomed ear caught also low muttering of thunder in distance in shape of sally soliloquy like aside at theatre be intended to be heard suddenly miss benson called ruth out of room upstairs into own bed chamber then began rummaging in little old fashioned box drawn out of equally old fashioned bureau half desk half table wholly drawer dear have be very stupid

scissors always hung at side began to cut in merciless manner expected remonstrance opposition have torrent of word ready to flow forth at least sign of rebellion ruth be still silent with meekly bowed head under strange hand be shearing beautiful hair into clipped shortness of boy long before have finished sally have slight misgiving a to fancied necessity of task be too late for curl be gone rest must now come off when have done lifted up ruth face by placing hand under round white chin gazed into countenance expecting to read anger there though have not come out in word only met large quiet eye that looked at with sad gentleness out of finely hollowed orbit ruth soft yet dignified submission touched sally with compunction though did not choose to show change in feeling tried to hide indeed by stooping to pick up long bright tress holding up admiringly letting drop down float on air like pendant branch of weeping birch said thought must have have cry did be pretty curl enough

past seven next morning in widow cap smooth pale face with oval untouched by time looked more young childlike than ever when contrasted with head gear usually associated with idea of age blushed very deeply a mr miss benson showed astonishment must not conceal in look said in low voice to miss benson sally thought have better wear miss benson made reply be startled at intelligence thought be conveyed in speech of sally acquaintance with ruth real situation noticed sally look particularly morning manner in old servant treated ruth have in far more of respect than there have be day before there be kind of satisfied way of braving out miss benson glance made latter uncertain uncomfortable followed brother into study do know thurstan be almost certain sally suspect mr benson sighed deception grieved yet thought saw necessity what make think so asked oh many little thing be odd way of ducking head about a if to catch good view of ruth left hand made think of wedding ring once yesterday when thought have made up quite natural speech be saying how sad be for so young creature to be left widow broke in with 'widow be farred ' in very strange contemptuous kind of manner if suspect have far better tell truth at once will never rest till find out so must make virtue of necessity well brother will tell then for be sure dare mind doing thing since talked to that day since have got to know ruth do mind clatter people will make about sally be not 'people ' oh see must be done will talk a much a other person put together so be reason call 'people ' will call for house be too homely primitive to have bell sally came fully aware of what be now going to be told determined not to help out in telling awkward secret by understanding nature of before be put into plainest language in pause when hoped have caught meaning be hinting at persisted in looking stupid perplexed in saying well a if quite unenlightened a to end of story when be complete plain before said honestly enough be just a thought be think may thank for having have sense to put into widow cap clip off bonny brown hair be fitter for bride in lawful matrimony than for such a took very well though be a quiet a lamb clipped pretty roughly at first must say though if 'd have known who visitor be 'd have packed up thing cleared out of house before such a came into a be done suppose must stand by help through with only hope sha lose character parish clerk daughter oh sally people know too well to think ill of said miss benson who be pleased to find difficulty so easily got over for in truth sally have be much softened by unresisting gentleness with ruth have submitted to clipping of night before if 'd be with master thurstan 'd have ' seen sharp after for be always picking up one a nobody else must touch with pair of tongs why there be that nelly brandon child a be left at door if have gone to th ' overseer must have have that irish tramp babby saddled on for life went off told th ' overseer th ' mother be caught yes said mr benson sadly often lie awake wonder what be fate of poor little thing forced back on mother who tried to get quit of often doubt whether did right be use thinking about now be thankful be said sally now if have talked doctrine long enough will go make th ' bed yon girl secret be safe enough for saying left room miss benson followed found ruth busy washing breakfast thing be done in so quiet orderly manner that miss benson sally particular enough have of little fancy prejudice annoyed seemed to have instinctive knowledge of exact period when help be likely to become hindrance withdrew from busy kitchen just at right time afternoon a miss benson ruth sat at work mr miss bradshaw called miss benson be so nervous a to surprise ruth who did not understand probable possible question might be asked respecting visitor at minister house ruth went on sewing absorbed in own thought glad that conversation between two elder lady silence of younger one who sat at distance from gave opportunity of retreating into haunt of memory soon work fell from hand eye be fixed on little garden beyond did not see flower wall saw mountain girdled llan dhu saw sun rise from behind iron outline just a have done how long ago be month be year since have watched night through crouched up at door be dream reality distant life moan rang more clearly in ear than buzzing of conversation between mr bradshaw miss benson at subdued scared looking little lady bright eyed silent daughter rose to take leave ruth started into present stood up curtseyed turned sick at heart with sudden recollection miss benson accompanied mr bradshaw to door in passage gave long explanation of ruth fictitious history mr bradshaw looked so much interested pleased that miss benson enlarged little more than be necessary rounded off invention with one two imaginary detail be quite unconscious be overheard by brother through half open study door be rather dismayed when called into room after mr bradshaw departure asked what have be saying about ruth oh thought be better to explain thoroughly mean to tell story wished to have believed once for know agreed about thurstan deprecatingly yes heard saying believed husband have be young surgeon did not well thurstan know must have be something young surgeon be so in way of dying seemed very natural besides said with sudden boldness do think have talent for fiction be so pleasant to invent make incident dovetail together after if be to tell lie may a well do thoroughly else be of use bungling lie must be worse than useless thurstan may be very wrong believe be afraid enjoy not being fettered by truth look so grave know be necessary if ever be to tell falsehood now be angry with because do well be shading eye with hand did not speak for time at last said if be not for child must tell world be so cruel know how apparent necessity for falsehood pain faith must not invent detail be so many additional lie well well will restrain if have to talk about ruth again mr bradshaw will tell one who need to know wish to contradict thurstan surely be such pretty probable story faith hope god will forgive if be doing wrong pray dear add one unnecessary word be not true day elapsed then be sunday house seemed filled with deep peace even sally movement be le hasty abrupt mr benson seemed invested with new dignity made bodily deformity be forgotten in calm grave composure of spirit trace of week day occupation be put away night before bright new handsome tablecloth have be smoothed down over table jar have be freshly filled with flower sunday be festival holy day in house after very early breakfast little foot pattered into mr benson study for have class for boy sort of domestic sunday school only that there be more talking between teacher pupil than dry absolute lesson going on miss benson too have little neat tippeted maiden sitting with in parlour be far more particular in keeping to reading spelling than brother be with boy sally too put in word of instruction from kitchen helping a fancied though assistance be often rather malapropos for instance called out to little fat stupid roly poly girl to whom miss benson be busy explaining meaning of word quadruped quadruped thing wi ' four leg jenny chair be quadruped child miss benson have deaf manner sometimes when patience be not too severely tried put on now ruth sat on low hassock coaxed least of little creature to showed picture till fell asleep in arm sent thrill through at thought of tiny darling who must lie on breast before long whom must have to cherish to shelter from storm of world then remembered that be once white sinless a wee lassie who lay in arm knew that have gone astray by by child trooped away miss benson summoned to put on thing for chapel chapel be up narrow street rather cul de sac close by stood on outskirt of town almost in field be built about time of matthew philip henry when dissenter be afraid of attracting attention observation hid place of worship in obscure out of way part of town in be built accordingly often happened a in present case that building immediately surrounding a well a chapel looked a if carried back to period hundred fifty year ago chapel have picturesque old world look for luckily congregation have be too poor to rebuild new face in george third time staircase led to gallery be outside at end of building irregular roof worn stone step looked grey stained by time weather grassy hillock with little upright headstone be shaded by grand old wych elm lilac bush two white rose tree few laburnum old gnarled enough be planted round chapel yard casement window of chapel be made of heavy leaded diamond shaped pane almost covered with ivy producing green gloom not without solemnity within ivy be home of infinite number of little bird twittered warbled till might have be thought that be emulous of power of praise possessed by human creature within with such earnest long drawn strain did crowd of winged songster rejoice be glad in beautiful gift of life interior of building be plain simple a plain simple must be when be fitted up oak timber be much cheaper than be now so wood work be of description roughly hewed for early builder have not much wealth to spare wall be whitewashed be recipient of shadow of beauty without on white plain tracery of ivy might be seen now still now stirred by sudden flight of little bird congregation consisted of here there farmer with labourer who came down from upland beyond town to worship where father worshipped who loved place because knew how much father have suffered for although never troubled with reason why left parish church of few shopkeeper far more thoughtful reasoning who be dissenter from conviction unmixed with old ancestral association of one two family of still higher worldly station with many poor who be drawn there by love for mr benson character by feeling that faith made what be must not be far wrong for base of pyramid with mr bradshaw for apex congregation stood complete country people came in sleeking down hair treading with earnest attempt at noiseless lightness of step over floor of aisle by by when be assembled mr benson followed unmarwilled unattended when have closed pulpit door knelt in prayer for instant two gave out psalm from dear old scottish paraphrase with primitive inversion of simple perfect bible word kind of precentor stood up having sounded note on pitch pipe sang couple of line by way of indicating tune then congregation stood up sang aloud mr bradshaw great bass voice being note in advance of others in accordance with place of precedence a principal member of congregation powerful voice be like organ very badly played very much out of tune a have ear diffidence pleased very much to hear fine loud sound be tall large boned iron man stern powerful authoritative in appearance dressed in clothes of finest broadcloth scrupulously ill made a if to show that be indifferent to outward thing wife be sweet gentle looking a if be thoroughly broken into submission ruth did not see hear aught word be reverently oh how reverently spoken by mr benson have have ruth present in thought time have be preparing for sunday duty have tried carefully to eschew everything might feel a allusion to own case remembered how good shepherd in poussin beautiful picture tenderly carried lamb have wearied by going astray felt how like tenderness be required towards poor ruth where be chapter doe not contain something broken contrite spirit may not apply to so fell out that a read ruth heart be smitten sank down down till be kneeling on floor of pew speaking to god in spirit if not in word of prodigal son father have sinned against heaven before thee be more worthy to be called thy child miss benson be thankful although loved ruth better for self abandonment that minister seat be far in shade of gallery tried to look most attentive to brother in order that mr bradshaw might not suspect anything unusual while stealthily took hold of ruth passive hand a lay helpless on cushion pressed softly tenderly ruth sat on ground bowed down crushed in sorrow till be ended miss benson loitered in seat divided between consciousness a locum tenens for minister wife be expected to be at door to receive kind greeting of many after absence from home unwillingness to disturb ruth who be evidently praying by quiet breathing receiving grave solemn influence into soul at length rose up calm composed even to dignity chapel be still empty miss benson heard buzz of voice in chapel yard without be probably of people waiting for summoned courage taking ruth arm in hers holding hand affectionately went out into broad daylight a issued forth miss benson heard mr bradshaw strong bass voice speaking to brother winced a knew must be wincing under broad praise be impertinence however little may be intended esteemed a such oh yes wife told yesterday about husband be surgeon father be surgeon too a think have heard very much to credit must say mr benson with limited mean to burden with poor relation very creditable indeed miss benson glanced at ruth either did not hear did not understand passed on into awful sphere of mr bradshaw observation unmoved be in bland condescending humour of universal approval when saw ruth nodded head in token of satisfaction that ordeal be over miss benson thought in thought rejoiced after dinner must go lie down dear said untying ruth bonnet string kissing sally go to church again wo mind staying alone in house be sorry have so many people to dinner brother will always have enough on sunday for old weak people who may have come from distance to stay dine with to day seem to have come because be first sabbath at home in way ruth first sabbath passed over chapter xv mother child here be parcel for ruth said miss benson on tuesday morning for said ruth sort of rushing thought hope filling mind turning dizzy with expectation if have be from new born resolution must have have hard struggle for existence be directed bers denbigh ' said miss benson before giving up be in mr bradshaw handwriting far more curious than ruth awaited untying of close knotted string when paper be opened displayed whole piece of delicate cambric muslin there be short note from mr bradshaw to ruth saying husband have wished to send muslin in aid of preparation mr denbigh might have to make ruth said nothing coloured up sat down again to employment very fine muslin indeed said miss benson feeling holding up against light with air of connoisseur yet time be glancing at ruth grave face latter kept silence showed wish to inspect present further at last said in low voice suppose may send back again dear child send back to mr bradshaw 'd offend for life may depend upon mean a mark of high favour what right have to send asked ruth still in quiet voice what right mr bradshaw think know exactly what mean by 'right ruth be silent for moment then said there be people to whom love to feel that owe gratitude gratitude can not express have better not talk about can not see why person whom know must lay under obligation oh say must take muslin please miss benson what miss benson might have said if brother have not just then entered room other person must tell felt presence be most opportune called in a umpire have come hastily for have much to do sooner heard case than sat down tried to draw more explicit declaration of feeling from ruth who have remained silent during miss benson explanation must rather send present back said yes answered softly be wrong why do want to return because feel a if mr bradshaw have right to offer mr benson be silent be beautifully fine said miss benson still examining piece think that be right must be earned yes said after minute pause understand what mean be delight to have gift made to by whom esteem love because then such gift be merely to be considered a fringe to garment a inconsiderable addition to mighty treasure of affection adding grace additional value to what before be precious proceeding a naturally out of a leaf burgeon out upon tree feel to be different when there be regard for giver to idealise gift when simply take stand among property a so much money value be ruth think be never reasoned why felt a did only knew that mr bradshaw giving present hurt instead of making glad well there be side of case have not looked at yet must think of too know who said 'do unto others a ye must that must do unto ' mr bradshaw may not have have that in mind when desired wife to send may have be self seeking only anxious to gratify love of patronising be worst motive can give must be excuse for thinking only of returning present must not have pretend to be obliged asked ruth must not have often be similarly situated to ruth mr bradshaw have frequently opposed on point on feel warmest be most earnestly convinced doubt think quixotic often speaks of to with great contempt when be angry suppose have little fit of penitence afterwards perhaps think can pay for ungracious speech by present so formerly invariably sent something after occasion be time of others to feel a be doing now became convinced must be right to accept giving only very cool thanks felt omission of show of much gratitude have best effect present have much diminished if gift have lessened unjustifiable speech have decreased in still greater proportion be sure respect other more take muslin ruth for reason named thank a feeling prompt overstrained expression of gratitude always seem like endeavour to place receiver of expression in position of debtor for future favour wo fall into error ruth listened to mr benson have not yet fallen sufficiently into tone of mind to understand fully only felt that comprehended better than miss benson who once more tried to reconcile to present by calling attention to length breadth thereof will do what wish said after little pause of thoughtfulness may talk of something else mr benson saw that sister frame of mind be not particularly congenial with ruth more than ruth be with miss benson putting aside thought of returning to business have appeared to so important when came into room principally related to remained above hour in parlour interesting on subject far removed from present left at end of time soothed calm present gave new current to ruth idea heart be a yet too sore to speak mind be crowded with plan asked sally to buy with money produced by sale of ring two coarsest linen homeliest dark blue print similar material on set busily to work to make clothes for herself a be made put on a put on gave grace to such homely material simple shaping have never have before then fine linen delicate soft white muslin have chosen in preference to more expensive article of dress when mr bellingham have given carte blanche in london be cut into small garment most daintily stitched made ready for little creature for whom in white purity of soul nothing must be too precious love dictated extreme simplicity coarseness of attire be taken for stiff hard economy by mr bradshaw when deigned to observe economy by without soul spirit in to make living holy be great merit in eye indeed ruth altogether found favour with quiet manner subdued by internal consciousness of deeper cause for sorrow than be aware of interpreted into very proper becoming awe of looked off from own prayer to observe how well attended to hers at chapel when came to verse in hymn relating to immortality future life sang unusually loud thinking must thus comfort in sorrow for deceased husband desired mr bradshaw to pay attention must even once remarked that thought so respectable young person that must not object to being asked to tea next time mr miss benson came added that thought indeed benson have looked last sunday a if rather hoped to get invitation be right to encourage minister to show respect even though salary be small only thing against mr denbigh be circumstance of having married too early without provision for family though ruth pleaded delicacy of health declined accompanying mr miss benson on visit to mr bradshaw still preserved place in esteem miss benson have to call little upon talent for fiction to spare ruth from infliction of further present in making love of patronising delighted yellow crimson leaf came floating down on still october air november followed bleak dreary be more cheerful when earth put on beautiful robe of white covered up grey naked stem loaded leaf of holly evergreen with burden of feathery snow when ruth sank down to languor sadness miss benson trotted upstairs rummaged up article of spare worn out clothing bringing down variety of strange material tried to interest ruth in making up into garment for poor though ruth finger flew through work still sighed with thought remembrance miss benson be at first disappointed then be angry when heard low long sigh saw dreamy eye filling with glittering tear must say what be matter ruth in half reproachful tone for sight of suffering be painful to have done in power to remedy though acknowledged cause beyond reach for ruth deep sorrow in fact loved respected more for manifestation of grief yet at time irritated then ruth must snatch up dropped work stitch away with drooping eye from hot tear fell fast miss benson be then angry with yet not at inclined to agree with sally when asked mistress why kept beithering ' poor lass with asking for ever what be matter a if did not know well enough element of harmony be wanting little angel of peace in loving whom heart nature must be drawn together discord hushed earth be still hiding guilty front with innocent snow when little baby be laid by side of pale white mother be boy beforehand have wished for girl a being le likely to feel want of father a being what mother worse than widowed must most effectually shelter now did not think remember what be must not have exchanged for wilderness of girl be own darling individual baby already though not hour old separate sole in heart strangely filling up measure with love peace even hope for here be new pure beautiful innocent life fondly imagined in early passion of maternal love must guard from touch of corrupting sin by ever watchful most tender care mother have thought same most probably thousand of others think same pray to god to purify cleanse soul that may be fit guardian for little child oh how ruth prayed even while be yet too weak to speak how felt beauty significance of word father be roused from holy abstraction by sound of miss benson voice be very much a if have be cry look ruth said softly brother sends be first snowdrop in garden put on pillow by ruth baby lay on opposite side wo look at said ruth be so pretty miss benson have strange reluctance to see to ruth in spite of have come gone be reconciled nay more be deeply attached over baby there hung cloud of shame disgrace poor little creature heart be closed against firmly a thought must not resist ruth low faint voice pleading eye went round to peep at a lay in mother arm a yet shield guard sally say will have black hair think said ruth little hand be quite man already just feel how firmly close with own weak finger opened little red fist taking miss benson reluctant hand placed one of finger in grasp that baby touch called out love door of heart be thrown open wide for little infant to go in take possession ah darling said ruth falling back weak weary if god will spare to never mother did more than will have done grievous wrong if may live will spend life in serving in serving god said miss benson with tear in eye must not make into idol god will perhaps punish through pang of affright shot through ruth heart at word have already sinned made child into idol be there punishment already in store for through then internal voice whispered that god be father that knew frame knew how natural be first outburst of mother love so although treasured up warning ceased to affright for what have already gushed forth now go to sleep ruth said miss benson kissing darkening room ruth must not sleep if heavy eye closed opened again with start for sleep seemed to be enemy stealing from consciousness of being mother one thought excluded remembrance anticipation in first hour of delight soon remembrance anticipation came there be natural want of person who alone must take interest similar in kind though not in amount to mother sadness grew like giant in still watch of night when remembered that there must be no father to guide strengthen child place in favourable position for fighting hard battle of life hoped believed that one must know sin of parent that struggle might be spared to father powerful care mighty guidance must never be then in hour of spiritual purification came wonder doubt of how far real father must be one to whom with desire of heaven for child might become of must wish to entrust slight speech telling of selfish worldly nature unnoticed at time came back upon ear having new significance told of low standard of impatient self indulgence of acknowledgment of thing spiritual heavenly even while examination be forced upon by new spirit of maternity have entered into made child welfare supreme hated reproached for necessity there seemed upon of examining judging absent father of child so compelling presence have taken possession of wearied into kind of feverish slumber in dreamt that innocent babe that lay by side in soft ruddy slumber have started up into man growth instead of pure noble being whom have prayed to present a child to father in heaven be repetition of father like lured maiden who in dream seemed strangely like only more utterly sad desolate even than into sin left there to even worse fate than of suicide for ruth believed there be worse dreamt saw girl wandering lost that saw son in high place prosperous with more than blood on soul saw son dragged down by clinging girl into pit of horror into dared not look from whence father voice be heard cry aloud that in day generation have not remembered word of god now be tormented in flame then started in sick terror saw by dim rushlight sally nodding in arm chair by fire felt little soft warm babe nestled up against breast rocked by heart yet beat hard from effect of evil dream dared not go to sleep again prayed time prayed asked with more complete wisdom more utter self forgetting faith little child thy angel be with god drew nearer nearer to whose face be continually beheld by angel of little child chapter xvi sally tell of sweetheart discourse on duty of life sally miss benson took in turn to sit up rather took in turn to nod by fire for if ruth be awake lay very still in moonlight calm of sick bed that time resembled beautiful august evening such a have seen white snowy rolling mist cover up under great sheet tree meadow token of earth can not rise high enough to shut out heaven on such night seem bending very near to be only real present object so near so real present did

benson spoke of child thence went on to talk about own childhood by degree spoke of education book learning that form one part of result be that ruth determined to get up early through bright summer morning to acquire knowledge hereafter to be given to child mind be uncultivated reading scant beyond mere mechanical art of education knew nothing have refined taste excellent sense judgment to separate true from false with quality set to work under mr benson direction read in early morning book that marked out trained with strict perseverance to do thoroughly did not attempt to acquire

of dissenter to mr benson belonged be not considered necessary to baptize infant a early a ceremony can be performed many circumstance concurred to cause solemn thanksgiving dedication of child for so dissenter look upon christening to be deferred until be probably somewhere about six month old there have be many conversation in little sitting room between brother sister protegee have consisted more of question betraying thoughtful wondering kind of ignorance on part of ruth answer more suggestive than explanatory from mr benson while miss benson kept up kind of running commentary always simple often quaint with intuition into very heart of thing truly religious be often gift of who seem at first sight to be only affectionate sensible when mr benson have explained own view of what christening ought to be considered by calling out ruth latent feeling into pious earnestness brought into right frame of mind felt that have done what must to make ceremony more than mere form to invest quiet humble obscure a must necessarily be in outward shape mournful anxious a much of antecedent have rendered with severe grandeur of act done in faith truth be not far to carry little one for a said chapel almost adjoined minister house whole procession be to have consisted of mr miss benson ruth carrying baby sally who felt a church of england woman to be condescending kind in requesting leave to attend baptism among dissenter unless have asked permission must not have be desired to attend so careful be habit of master mistress that must be allowed that freedom claimed for

redeem from character of being utterly schismatic spoke about with air of patronage to three four among to of servant at mr bradshaw miss benson be rather surprised to receive call from jemima bradshaw on very morning of day on little leonard be to be baptized miss bradshaw be rosy breathless with eagerness although second in family have be at school when younger sister have be christened be now come in full warmth of girl fancy to ask if might be present at afternoon service have be struck with mr denbigh grace beauty at very first sight when have accompanied mother to call upon bensons on return from wale have kept up enthusiastic interest in widow only little older than whose very reserve retirement added to unconscious power of enchantment oh miss benson never saw christening papa say may go if think mr benson mr denbigh must not dislike will be quite quiet sit up behind door anywhere that sweet little baby must so like to see christened be to be called leonard did say after mr denbigh be no not exactly said miss benson rather discomfited be not mr denbigh name leonard then mamma thought must be sure to be called after so did may come to christening may not dear miss benson miss benson gave consent with little inward reluctance brother ruth shared in feeling although one expressed be presently forgotten jemima stood grave quiet in old fashioned vestry adjoining chapel a entered with step subdued to slowness thought ruth looked so pale awed because be left solitary parent ruth came to presence of god a one who have gone astray doubted own worthiness to be called child came a mother who have incurred heavy responsibility who entreated almighty aid to enable to discharge full of passionate yearning love craved for more faith in god to still distrust fear of future might hang over darling when thought of boy sickened trembled when heard of god loving kindness far beyond tender mother love be hushed into peace prayer there stood fair pale cheek resting on baby head a slumbered on bosom eye went slanting down under half closed white lid gaze be not on primitive cottage like room be earnestly fixed on dim mist through fain must have seen life lay before child mist be still dense too thick veil for anxious human love to penetrate future be hid with god mr benson stood right under casement window be placed high up in room be almost in shade except for one two marked light fell on hair already silvery white voice be always low musical when spoke to few be too weak to speak so a to be heard by many without becoming harsh strange now filled little room with loving sound like stock dove brooding murmur over young ruth forgot in earnestness of thought when said let pray little congregation knelt down might have heard baby faint breathing scarcely sighing out upon stillness so absorbed be in solemnity prayer be long thought followed thought fear crowded upon fear be to be laid bare before god aid counsel asked before end sally have shuffled quietly out of vestry into green chapel yard upon door opened miss benson be alive to movement so full of curiosity a to what might mean that must no longer attend to brother felt inclined to rush off question sally moment be ended miss bradshaw hung about babe ruth begged to be allowed to carry child home ruth pressed to a if there be safe harbour for in mother breast mr benson saw feeling caught miss bradshaw look of disappointment come home with said stay to tea have never drank tea with since went to school wish might said miss bradshaw colouring with pleasure must ask papa may run home ask to be sure dear jemima flew off fortunately father be at home for mother permission must have be deemed insufficient received many direction about behaviour take sugar in tea jemima be sure bensons ought not to be able to afford sugar with mean eat much can have plenty at home on return remember mr denbigh keep must cost great deal so jemima returned considerably sobered very much afraid of hunger leading to forget mr benson poverty meanwhile miss benson sally acquainted with mr benson invitation to jemima set about making capital tea cake on piqued enjoyed office of hospitality be glad to place home made tempting dainty before guest what made ye leave chapel vestry before brother have ended inquired miss benson indeed ma'be thought master have prayed so long 'd be drouthy so just slipped out to put on kettle for tea miss benson be on point of reprimanding for thinking of anything besides object of prayer when remembered how have be unable to attend after sally departure for wondering what have become of so be silent be disappointment to miss benson kind hospitable expectation when jemima a hungry a hound confined to one piece of cake hostess have have such pleasure in making jemima wished have not prophetic feeling tea time of manner in father must inquire into particular of meal elevating eyebrow at viand named beyond plain bread butter winding up with such sentence a well marvel how with benson salary can afford to keep table sally must have told of denial when one be by when left hand did not know what right hand did on part of master mistress practised without thinking even to that be sacrifice virtue in order to enable to help who be in need even to gratify miss benson kind old fashioned feeling on such occasion a present when stranger came to house homely affectionate pleasure in making others comfortable might have shown that such little occasional extravagance be not waste good work be not to be gauged by standard of money spending evening spirit be damped by jemima refusal to eat poor jemima cake be so good be so hungry still refused while sally be clearing away tea thing miss benson jemima accompanied ruth upstairs when went to put little leonard to bed christening be very solemn service said miss bradshaw have idea be so solemn mr benson seemed to speak a if have weight of care on heart that god alone must relieve lighten brother feel thing very much said miss benson rather wishing to cut short conversation for have be aware of several part in prayer knew be suggested by peculiarity sadness of case before must not quite follow through continued jemima what did mean by saying 'this child rebuked by world bidden to stand apart thou wilt not rebuke wilt suffer to come to thee be blessed with thine almighty blessing ' why be little darling to be rebuked think remember exact word said something like dear gown be dripping wet must have dipped into tub let wring out oh thank never mind gown said jemima hastily wanting to return to question just then caught sight of tear falling fast down cheek of silent ruth a bent over child crowing splashing away in tub with sudden consciousness that unwittingly have touched on painful chord jemima rushed into subject be eagerly seconded by miss benson circumstance seemed to die away leave trace in after year rose vivid significant before jemima memory at present be enough for if mr denbigh must let serve in possible way admiration for beauty be keen little indulged at home ruth be very beautiful in quiet mournfulness mean homely dress left only more open to admiration for gave charm by unconscious wearing of made seem like drapery of old greek statue subordinate to figure covered yet imbued by with unspeakable grace then pretended circumstance of life be such a to catch imagination of young romantic girl altogether jemima must have kissed hand professed ruth slave moved away article used at little coucher folded up leonard day clothes felt only too much honoured when ruth trusted to for few minute only too amply rewarded when ruth thanked with grave sweet smile grateful look of loving eye when jemima have gone away with servant who be sent to fetch there be little chorus of praise be warm hearted girl said miss benson remembers old day before went to school be worth two of mr richard be of just same a be when be child when broke that window in chapel ran away home came knocking at door with single knock just like beggar went to see who be be quite startled to see round brown honest face looking up at half frightened telling what have done offering money in saving bank to pay for never must have heard of master richard share in business if have not be for sally remember said mr benson how strict mr bradshaw have always be with child be wonder if poor richard be coward in day be now be much mistaken answered miss benson mr bradshaw be just a strict with jemima be coward have faith in richard have look about that like when mr bradshaw be away on business in holland last year for month young gentleman did not come half a regularly to chapel always believe that story of being seen out with hound at smithiles be of great offence in young man of twenty said mr benson smiling mind in when must change back so easily to being regular mim when father came home like leonard will never be afraid of said ruth following own train of thought will be friend from very first will try learn how to be wise friend will teach wo sir what made wish to call leonard ruth asked miss benson be mother father name used to tell about goodness thought if leonard must be like do remember discussion there be about miss bradshaw name thurstan father wanting to be called hepzibah insisting that be to have scripture name at rate mr bradshaw wanting to be juliana after novel have read not long before at last jemima be fixed upon because must do either for scripture name name for heroine out of book did not know jemima be scripture name said ruth oh yes be one of job daughter jemima kezia keren happuch there be good many jemimas in world kezias never heard of keren happuch yet know just a much of one a of people really like pretty name whether in scripture out of when there be particular association with name said mr benson now be called faith after cardinal virtue like name though many people must think too puritan be according to gentle mother pious desire thurstan be called by name because father wished for although be what people called radical democrat in way of talking thinking be very proud in heart of being descended from old sir thurstan who figured away in french war difference between theory practice thinking being put in mr benson who be in mood for allowing little social enjoyment leant back in chair with eye looking at not seeing ceiling miss benson be clicking away with eternal knitting needle looking at brother seeing too ruth be arranging child clothes against morrow be usual way of spending evening variety be given by different tone conversation assumed on different night yet somehow peacefulness of time window open into little garden scent came stealing in clear summer heaven above made time be remembered a happy festival by ruth even sally seemed more placid than usual when came in to prayer miss benson followed ruth to bedroom to look at beautiful sleeping leonard god bless said miss benson stooping down to kiss little dimpled hand lay outside coverlet tossed abroad in heat of evening now get up too early ruth injuring health will be short sighted wisdom poor economy good night good night dear miss benson good night sally when ruth have shut door went again to bed looked at boy till eye filled with tear god bless thee darling only ask to be one of instrument not thrown aside a useless worse than useless so ended day of leonard christening mr benson have sometimes taught child of different people a especial favour when requested by then pupil be only child by progress be little prepared for ruth have have early teaching of kind need never be unlearnt from mother enough to unfold many of power have remained inactive now for several year have grown strong in dark quiet time tutor be surprised at bound by surmounted obstacle quick perception ready adaptation of truth first principle immediate sense of fitness of thing delight in what be strong beautiful called out master sympathy most of admired complete unconsciousness of uncommon power unusual progress be le of wonder than considered to be be true for never thought of comparing what be now with former self much le with indeed did not think of at of boy what must learn in order to teach to be to do a suited hope prayer if one devotion must have flattered into self consciousness be jemima mr bradshaw never dreamed that daughter must feel inferior to minister protegee so be knight errant of old must consider more honoured by ladye command than did jemima if ruth allowed to do anything for for boy ruth loved heartily even while be rather annoyed at open expression jemima used of admiration please really must rather not be told if people do think pretty be not merely beautiful be sweet looking good mr postlethwaite called replied jemima more must rather not hear may be pretty know be not good besides think ought to hear what be said of behind back ruth spoke so gravely that jemima feared lest be displeased dear mr denbigh never will admire praise again only let love let love said ruth with tender kiss jemima must not have be allowed to come so frequently if mr bradshaw have not be possessed with idea of patronising ruth if latter have chosen might have gone dressed from head to foot in present wished to make refused constantly occasionally to miss benson great annoyance if must not load with gift must show approbation by asking to house after deliberation consented to accompany mr miss benson there house be square massy looking with great deal of drab colour about furniture mr bradshaw in lackadaisical sweet tempered way seconded husband in desire of being kind to ruth a cherished privately great taste for what be beautiful interesting a opposed to husband love of purely useful taste of hers have rarely have so healthy true mode of gratification a when watched ruth movement about room seemed in unobtrusiveness poverty of colour to receive requisite ornament of light splendour from ruth presence mr bradshaw sighed wished have daughter a lovely about whom to weave romance for castle building after manner of minerva press be outlet by escaped from pressure of prosaic life a mr bradshaw wife perception be only of external beauty be not always alive to might have seen how warm affectionate ardent nature free from envy carking care of self gave unspeakable charm to plain bright faced daughter jemima whose dark eye kept challenging admiration for friend first evening spent at mr bradshaw passed like many succeeding visit there there be tea equipage for be a handsome a ugly a money must purchase then lady produced sewing while mr bradshaw stood before fire gave assembled party benefit of opinion on many subject opinion be a good excellent a opinion of man can be who see one side of case very strongly almost ignores other coincided in many point with held by mr benson once twice interposed with plea for who might differ then be heard by mr bradshaw with kind of evident indulgent pity such a one feel for child who unwittingly talk nonsense by by mr bradshaw miss benson fell into one tete tete ruth jemima into two well behaved unnaturally quiet child be sent to bed early in evening in authoritative voice by father because one of have spoken too loud while be enlarging on alteration in

continent for last year have only recently returned seemed perfectly at home spoke little leaned back in chair screwed up eye watched everybody yet there be nothing unpleasant impertinent in keenness of observation ruth wondered to hear contradict mr bradshaw almost expected rebuff mr bradshaw if did not yield point admitted for first time that evening that be possible something might be said on other side mr farquhar differed also from mr benson be in more respectful manner than mr bradshaw have done for reason although mr farquhar have never spoken to ruth came away with impression that be man to be respected perhaps liked sally must have thought mightily aggrieved if on return have not heard account of evening a soon a miss benson came in old servant began well who be there what did give for supper only mr farquhar besides ourselves sandwich sponge cake wine there be occasion for anything more replied miss benson who be tired preparing to go upstairs mr farquhar why do say be

retreating towards kitchen bradshaw betsy know what be about must have said for nothing ruth wondered little about loved jemima well enough to be interested in what related to after thinking for few

little circle into consciousness of lapse of time one who have known at date of ruth becoming governess in mr bradshaw family have be absent until time of be now going to tell must have noted change have imperceptibly come over too must have thought that life have brought so little of turmoil vicissitude must have be calm tranquil in accordance with bygone activity of town in existence passed away alteration that must have perceived be caused by natural progress of time benson home be brightened into vividness by presence of little leonard now noble boy of six large grand in limb stature with face of marked beauty intelligence indeed might have be considered by many a too intelligent for year often living with old thoughtful people gave beyond most child appearance of pondering over mystery meet young on threshold of life fade away a advancing year bring more into contact with practical tangible fade away vanish until seems to require agitation of great storm of soul before can again realise spiritual thing at time leonard seemed oppressed bewildered after listening intent with grave wondering eye to conversation around at others bright animal life shone forth radiant three month kitten foal suddenly tossing up heel by side of sedate dam careering around pasture in pure mad enjoyment young creature of kind must show more merriment gladness of heart for ever in mischief be sally account of at such time be not intentional mischief sally must have be first to scold one else who have used same word in reference to darling indeed be once nearly giving warning because thought boy be being ill used occasion be leonard have for time shown strange odd disregard of truth invented story told with so grave face unless there be internal evidence of incorrectness such a describing cow with bonnet on be generally believed statement be given with full appearance of relating real occurrence have once twice led to awkward result three whose heart be pained by apparent unconsciousness of difference between truth falsehood be unaccustomed to child must have recognised a stage through most infant who have lively imagination pas accordingly there be consultation in mr benson study one morning ruth be there quiet very pale with compressed lip sick at heart a heard miss benson argument for necessity of whipping in order to cure leonard of story telling mr benson looked unhappy uncomfortable education be series of experiment to have secret dread of spoiling noble boy who be darling of heart perhaps very intensity of love begot impatient unnecessary anxiety made resolve on sterner measure than parent of large family where love be more spread abroad must have dared to use at rate vote for whipping carried day even ruth trembling cold agreed that must be done only asked in meek sad voice if need be present mr benson be to be executioner scene study being instantly told that have better not went slowly languidly up to room kneeling down closed ear prayed miss benson having carried point be very sorry for child must have begged off mr benson have listened more to argument than now to pleading only answered if be right will be done went into garden deliberately almost a if wished to gain time chose cut off little switch from laburnum tree then returned through kitchen gravely taking awed wondering little fellow by hand led silently into study placing before began admonition on importance of truthfulness meaning to conclude with what believed to be moral of punishment a can not remember of must give little pain to make remember be very sorry be necessary that can not recollect without doing so before have reached very proper desirable conclusion while be yet working way heart aching with terrified look of child at solemnly sad face word of upbraiding sally burst in what may ye be going to do with fine switch saw ye gathering master thurstan asked eye gleaming with anger at answer knew must come if answer have at go away sally said mr benson annoyed at fresh difficulty in path will not stir never step till give switch a have got for mischief will be bound sally remember where be said 'he spareth rod spoileth child

said triumphantly come along leonard stretched out hand to child thinking that have conquered leonard did not stir looked wistfully at mr benson come said impatiently boy mouth quivered if want to whip uncle may do much mind put in form be impossible to carry out intention so mr benson told lad might go that must speak to time leonard went away more subdued in spirit than if have be whipped sally lingered moment stopped to add think be for without sin to throw stone at poor child cut up good laburnum branch to whip only do a better do when call leonard mother mr denbigh moment have said be sorry be ungenerous advantage after enemy have acknowledged defeated mr benson dropped head upon hand hid face sighed deeply leonard flew in search of mother a in search of refuge if have found calm must have burst into passion of cry after agitation a be came upon kneeling sobbing stood quite still then threw arm round neck said mamma mamma will be good make promise will speak true make promise kept word miss benson piqued upon being le carried away by love for child than one else in house talked severely have capital theory severity ended in talk theory must not work however read several book on education knitting sock for leonard while upon whole think hand be more usefully employed than head good honest heart better than looked older than when first knew be ripe kindly age be coming over excellent practical sense perhaps made more masculine character than brother be often so much perplexed by problem of life that let time for action go by kept in check by clear pithy talk brought back wandering thought to duty lay straight before waiting for action then remembered that be faithful part to wait patiently upon god leave end in hand who alone know why evil exists in world why ever hovers on side of good in respect miss benson have more faith than brother so seemed for quick resolute action in next step of life be required while deliberated trembled often did wrong from very deliberation when first instinct must have led right although decided prompt a ever miss benson be grown older since summer afternoon when dismounted from coach at foot of long welsh hill led to llan dhu where brother awaited to consult about ruth though eye be a bright straight looking a ever quick brave in glance hair have become almost snowy white be on point consulted sally soon after date of leonard last untruth two be arranging miss benson room one morning when after dusting looking glass suddenly stopped in operation after close inspection of herself startled sally by speech sally be looking great deal older than used to do sally who be busy dilating on increased price of flour considered remark of miss benson a strangely irrelevant to matter in hand only noticed by to be sure suppose on do two fourpence dozen be too much to make pay for miss benson went on with inspection of herself sally with economical project sally said miss benson hair be nearly white last time looked be only pepper salt what must do do why must wench do asked sally contemptuously ye be never going to be taken in at time of life by hair dye such gimcrack a can only take in young girl whose wisdom teeth be not cut who be not very likely to want said miss benson quietly see sally be very awkward having such grey hair feeling so young do know sally have a great mind for dancing when hear lively tune on street organ a ever a great mind to sing when be happy to sing in old way sally know aye have from girl said sally many time when door be shut did not know if be in parlour big bumble bee in kitchen a be making that drumbling noise heard at yesterday old woman with grey hair ought not to have fancy for dancing singing continued miss benson whatten nonsense be ye talking said sally roused to indignation calling yoursel ' old woman when be better than ten year younger than many girl have grey hair at five twenty be more than five twenty sally be fifty seven next may more shame for ye then not to know better than to talk of dyeing hair can not abide such vanity oh dear sally when will understand what mean want to know how be to keep remembering how old be so a to prevent from feeling so young be quite startled just now to see hair in glass for can generally tell if cap be straight by feeling will tell what will do will cut off piece of grey hair plait together for marker in bible miss benson expected applause for bright idea sally only made answer will be taking to painting cheek next now have once thought of dyeing hair so miss benson plaited grey hair in silence quietness leonard holding one end of while wove admiring colour texture time with sort of implied dissatisfaction at auburn colour of own curl be only half comforted away by miss benson information that if lived long enough hair must be like hers mr benson who have looked old frail while be yet young be now stationary a to date of appearance there be something more of nervous restlessness in voice way than formerly be only change six year have brought to a for sally chose to forget age passage of year altogether have a much work in to use own expression a have at sixteen

yet now might have be placed among highest in land must have be taken by most critical judge for equal although ignorant of conventional etiquette ignorance must have acknowledged in simple child like way being unconscious of false shame whole heart be in boy often feared that loved too much more than god yet must not bear to pray to have love for child lessened must kneel down by little bed at night at deep still midnight with star kept watch over rizpah shining down upon tell god what have now told that feared loved child too much yet must not must not love le speak to of one treasure a must speak to earthly friend so unconsciously love for child led up to love to god to knowing who read heart might be superstition dare say be somehow never lay down to rest without saying a looked

miss benson brother sally must fetch to happy little task one so sacred a to allotted duty joyous meeting be not deadened by custom to mother child ruth gave bradshaws highest satisfaction a mr bradshaw often said to to bensons indeed rather winced under pompous approbation favourite recreation be patronising when ruth saw how quietly meekly mr benson submitted to gift praise when honest

prosperous than ever keen far seeing man of business with undisguised contempt for who failed in success have achieved be not alone who be le fortunate in obtaining wealth than that visited with severity of judgment moral error delinquency came under unsparing comment stained by vice in own eye in of human being who cared to judge having nicely wisely proportioned adapted mean to end must afford to speak act with severity be almost sanctimonious in ostentation of thankfulness a to not misfortune sin be brought to light mr bradshaw must trace to cause in former mode of action have long ago foretold must lead to shame if son turned out wild bad mr bradshaw have little sympathy might have be prevented by stricter rule more religious life at home young richard bradshaw be quiet steady other father might have have son like if have taken same pain to enforce obedience richard be only son yet mr bradshaw might venture to say have never have own way in life mr bradshaw be confessed mr bradshaw did not dislike confessing wife error rather le firm than must have liked with girl with people believed jemima be rather headstrong to wish have always shown obedient child be obedient if parent be decided authoritative one must turn out well if properly managed if did not prove good must take consequence of error mr bradshaw murmured faintly at husband when back be turned if voice be heard footstep sounded in distance be mute hurried child into attitude action most pleasing to father jemima be true rebelled against manner of proceeding savoured to little of deceit even have not a yet overcome awe of father sufficiently to act independently of according to own sense of right rather must say according to own warm passionate impulse before wilfulness made dark eye blaze out at time be hushed still have idea of self tormenting notion of almost southern jealousy seemed to belong to brunette complexion jemima be not pretty flatness shortness of face made almost plain yet most people looked twice at expressive countenance at eye flamed melted at trifle at rich colour came at expressed emotion into usually sallow face at faultless teeth made smile like sunbeam then again when thought be not kindly treated when suspicion crossed mind when be angry with lip be tight pressed together colour be wan almost livid stormy gloom clouded eye a with film before father word be few did not notice look tone brother richard have be equally silent before father in boyhood early youth since have gone to be clerk in london house preparatory to assuming place a junior partner in mr bradshaw business spoke more on occasional visit at home very proper highly moral be conversation set sentence of goodness be like flower child stick in ground have not sprung upwards from root deep down in hidden life experience of heart be a severe judge a father of other people conduct felt that mr bradshaw be sincere in condemnation of outward error vice that must try by same law a tried others somehow richard word be frequently heard with lurking distrust many shook head over pattern son then be whose son have gone astray be condemned in private tender manner by mr bradshaw so might be revenge in still jemima felt that be not right heart sympathised in rebellion against father command brother have confessed to in unusual moment of confidence uneasy conscience condemned deceit have practised brother sister be sitting alone over blazing christmas fire jemima held old newspaper in hand to shield face from hot light be talking of family event when during pause jemima eye caught name of great actor who have lately given prominence life to character in one of shakspeare play criticism in paper be fine warmed jemima heart how must like to see play exclaimed must said brother listlessly yes to be sure just hear began to read fine passage of criticism newspaper people can make article out of anything said yawning have seen man be very well nothing to make such fuss about seen have seen play richard oh why did never tell before tell about why did never name seeing in letter half smiled contemptuously enough oh at first strike one rather after while one care more for theatre than one doe for mince pie oh wish might go to london said jemima impatiently have great mind to ask papa to let go to george smith then must see must not think like mince pie must not do such thing said richard now yawning contemptuous father must never allow to go to theatre george smith be such old fogey must be sure to tell how do go then doe father give leave oh many thing be right for men be not for girl jemima sat pondered richard wished have not be so confidential need not name said rather anxiously name what said startled for thought have gone far afield oh name going once twice to theatre sha name said one here must care to hear be with little surprise almost with feeling of disgust that heard richard join with father in condemning one add to mr bradshaw list of offence by alleging that young man be playgoer did not think sister heard word mary elizabeth be two girl whom ruth have in charge resembled jemima more than brother in character household rule be occasionally little relaxed in favour for mary elder be nearly eight year younger than jemima three intermediate child have died loved ruth dearly made great pet of leonard have many profound secret together most of related to wonder if jemima mr farquhar must ever be married watched sister closely day have fresh confidence to make to other confirming discouraging to hope ruth rose early shared household work with sally miss benson till seven then helped leonard to dress have quiet time alone with till prayer breakfast at nine be to be at mr bradshaw house sat in room with mary elizabeth during latin writing arithmetic lesson received from master then read walked with clinging to a to elder sister dined with pupil at family lunch reached home by four happy home quiet day so peaceful day passed on into week month year ruth leonard grew strengthened into riper beauty of respective age while a yet touch of decay have come on quaint primitive elder of household chapter xx jemima refuse to be managed be wonder that looker on be perplexed a to state of affair between jemima mr farquhar for too be sorely puzzled at sort of relationship between be love be not be question in mr farquhar mind hoped be not believed be not yet felt a if be there be something preposterous thought in man nearly forty year of age being in love with girl of twenty have gone on reasoning through day of manhood on idea of staid noble minded wife grave sedate fit companion in experience of husband have spoken with admiration of reticent character full of self control dignity hoped trusted that time have not be allowing unconsciously to fall in love with wild hearted impetuous girl who knew nothing of life beyond father house who chafed under strict discipline enforced there for be rather suspicious symptom of state of mr farquhar affection that have discovered silent rebellion continued in jemima heart unperceived by of own family against severe law opinion of father mr farquhar shared in opinion in be modified took milder form still approved of much that mr bradshaw did said made more strange that must wince so for jemima whenever anything took place instinctively knew that must dislike after evening at mr bradshaw when jemima have gone to very verge of questioning disputing of father severe judgment mr farquhar went home in dissatisfied restless state of mind be almost afraid to analyse admired inflexible integrity almost pomp of principle evinced by mr bradshaw on occasion wondered how be that jemima must not see how grand life might be whose action be shaped in obedience to eternal law instead of be afraid rebelled against law be only guided by impulse mr farquhar have be taught to dread impulse a prompting of devil sometimes if tried to present father opinion before in form so a to bring rather more into state of agreement longed for flashed out upon with indignation of difference that dared not show to before father a if have diviner instinct taught more truly than knew with experience at least in first expression there seemed something good fine opposition made angry irritable argument be constantly provoking whenever be with in father absence frequently ended in vehemence of expression on part that offended mr farquhar who did not see how expiated anger in tear reproach when alone in chamber then must lecture severely on interest must not help feeling in wilful girl must determine not to interfere with opinion in future yet very next time differed strove to argue into harmony with in spite of resolution to contrary mr bradshaw saw just enough of interest jemima have excited in partner mind to determine in considering future marriage a settled affair fitness of thing have long ago struck father partner so fortune meant to give might continue in business man of such steadiness of character such capital eye for desirable speculation a mr farquhar just right age to unite paternal with conjugal affection consequently very man for jemima who have something unruly in might break out under regime le wisely adjusted to circumstance than be mr bradshaw in own opinion house ready furnished at convenient distance from home near relation on mr farquhar side who might be inclined to consider residence a own for indefinite time so add to household expense in short what must be more suitable in way mr bradshaw respected very self restraint thought saw in mr farquhar demeanour attributing to wise desire to wait until trade must be rather more slack man of business more at leisure to become lover a for jemima at time thought almost hated mr farquhar what business have must think to lecture often can hardly bear from papa will not bear from treat just like child a if must lose present opinion when know more of world be sure must like never to know world if be to make think a doe hard man that be wonder what made take jem brown on a gardener again if doe not believe that above one criminal in thousand be restored to goodness will ask day if be not acting on impulse rather than principle poor impulse how do get abused will tell mr farquhar will not let interfere with if do what papa bid one have right to notice whether do willingly not so then tried to defy mr farquhar by doing saying thing that knew must disapprove went so far that be seriously grieved did not even remonstrate lecture then be disappointed irritated for somehow with indignation at interference liked to be lectured by not that be aware of liking of hers still must have be more pleasant to be scolded than so quietly passed over two little sister with wide awake eye have long ago put thing together conjectured day have fresh mystery together to be imparted in garden walk whispered talk lizzie did see how tear came into mimie eye when mr farquhar looked so displeased when said good people be always dull think be in love mary said last word with grave emphasis felt like oracle of twelve year of age said lizzie know cry often enough when papa be cross be not in love with yes look a mimie did call mimie know papa doe not like yes there be so many thing papa doe not like can never remember never mind about listen to something have got to tell if will never never tell indeed wo mary what be not to mr denbigh not even to mr denbigh well then other day last friday mimie jemima interrupted more conscientious elizabeth jemima if must be so jerked out mary sent to desk for envelope what do think saw what asked elizabeth expecting nothing le than red hot valentine signed walter farquhar pro bradshaw farquhar co in full why piece of paper with dull looking line upon just like scientific dialogue remembered about be once when mr farquhar have be telling that bullet doe not go in straight line in something curve drew line on piece of paper mimie jemima put in elizabeth well well have treasured up written in corner w f april rd ' now be rather like love be not for jemima hate useful information just a much a do be saying great deal yet have kept paper dated if be know dick keep paper with miss benson name written on yet be not in love with perhaps jemima may like mr farquhar may not like seems such little while since hair be turned up have always be grave middle aged man ever since can recollect then have never noticed how often find fault with almost lecture to be sure said mary may be in love for just think how often papa lecture mamma yet of course be in love with other well will see said elizabeth poor jemima little thought of four sharp eye that watched daily course while sat alone a fancied with secret in own room for in passionate fit of grieving at impatient hasty temper have made so seriously displease mr farquhar that have gone away without remonstrance without more leave taking than distant bow have begun to suspect that rather than not be noticed at by rather than be object of indifference to oh far rather must be object of anger upbraiding thought followed confession to herself stunned bewildered for once that made dizzy with hope ten time made sick with fear for instant planned to become to be must wish to change very nature for then great gush of pride came over set teeth tight together determined that must either love a be not at unless must take with fault must not care for regard love be too noble word to call such cold calculating feeling a must be who went about with pattern idea in mind trying to find wife to match besides there be something degrading jemima thought in trying to alter to gain love of human creature yet if did not care for if late indifference be to last what great shroud be drawn over life must bear from agony dared not look at be going to risk encountering be aroused by presence of mother jemima father want to speak to in dining room what for asked girl oh be fidgeted by something mr farquhar said to repeated be sure thought there be harm in father always like to tell what everybody say in absence jemima went with heavy heart into father presence be walking up down room did not see at first oh jemima be that have mother told what want to speak to about said jemima not exactly have be telling prof to how very seriously must have displeased offended mr farquhar before must have expressed to a did when left house know what said said jemima heart swelling within have no right to say anything about be desperate durst not have said before father right what do mean jemima said mr bradshaw turning sharp round surely must know that hope may one day be husband be to say if prove worthy of excellent training have given can not suppose mr farquhar must take undisciplined girl a wife jemima held tight by chair near be standing did not speak father be pleased by silence be way in liked project to be received can not suppose continued that mr farquhar will consent to marry consent to marry repeated jemima in low tone of brooding indignation be term upon rich woman heart be to be given with calm consent of acquiescent acceptance little above resignation on part of receiver if give way to temper although have never dared to show to be well aware exists although hoped habit of self examination have instilled have done much to cure of manifesting at one time richard promised to be more headstrong of two now must desire to take pattern by yes continued falling into old train of thought must be most fortunate connexion for in way must have under own eye must still assist in formation of character must be at hand to strengthen confirm principle mr farquhar connexion with firm must be convenient agreeable to in pecuniary point of view mr bradshaw be going on in enumeration of advantage in particular jemima in second place must derive from marriage when daughter spoke at first so low that must not hear a walked up down room with creaking boot have to stop to listen have mr farquhar ever spoken to about jemima cheek be flushed a asked question wished that might have be person to whom have first addressed mr bradshaw answered not spoken have be implied between for time at least have be so aware of intention have made several allusion in course of business to a thing might take place can hardly have misunderstood must have seen that perceived design approved of said mr bradshaw rather doubtfully a remembered how very little in fact passed between partner must have reference to subject to mind prepared to receive perhaps mr farquhar have not really thought of then again that must imply that own penetration have be mistaken thing not impossible certainly quite beyond range of probability so reassured a thought daughter by saying whole thing be so suitable advantage arising from connexion be so obvious besides be quite aware from many little speech of mr farquhar that contemplates marriage at very distant time seldom leaf eccleston visit few family besides own certainly none can compare with ours in advantage have received in moral religious training then mr bradshaw be checked in implied praise of only must be martingale when once set out on career by recollection jemima must not feel too secure a might become if dwelt too much on advantage of being father daughter accordingly said must be aware jemima that do very little credit to education have given when make such impression a must have done to day before mr farquhar must have said what did of did say asked jemima still in low husky tone of suppressed anger mother say remarked to 'what pity be that jemima can not maintain opinion without going into passion what pity be that opinion be such a to sanction rather than curb fit of rudeness anger ' did say that said jemima in still lower tone not questioning father speaking rather to herself have doubt did replied father gravely mother be in habit of repeating accurately to what take place in absence besides whole speech be not one of hers have not altered word in repetition be convinced have trained to habit of accuracy very unusual in woman at time jemima might have be inclined to rebel against system of carrying constant intelligence to headquarters have long ago felt a insurmountable obstacle to free communication with mother now father mean of acquiring knowledge faded into insignificance before nature of information imparted stood quite still grasping chair back longing to be dismissed have said enough now hope to make behave in becoming manner to mr farquhar if temper be too unruly to be always under own control at least have respect to injunction take pain to curb before may go asked jemima chafing more more may said father when left room gently rubbed hand together satisfied with effect have produced wondering how be that one so well brought up a daughter must ever say do anything to provoke remark from mr farquhar a have heard repeated nothing can be more gentle docile than be when spoken to in proper manner must give farquhar hint said mr bradshaw to jemima rushed upstairs locked into room began pacing up down at first without shedding tear then suddenly stopped burst out cry with passionate indignation so be to behave well not because be right not because be right to show off before mr farquhar oh mr farquhar said suddenly changing to sort of upbraiding tone of voice did not think so of hour ago did not think must choose wife in cold hearted way though did profess to act by rule line think to have do because be fitting suitable want to be married ca spare time for wooing be lashing up by exaggeration of father have said how often have thought be too grand for now know better now can believe that do be done from calculation be good because add to business credit talk in high strain about principle because sound well be respectable even thing be better than cold way of

in fact money may be assured that will not forget little circumstance can explain what have said on head to benson sister be afraid can not do ruth began while be choosing word delicate enough to express reluctance to act a wished have almost bowed out of room thinking that be modest in estimate of qualification for remonstrating with daughter added blandly one so able mr denbigh have observed many quality in observed when perhaps have little thought if have observed ruth that morning must have seen absence of mind depression of spirit not much to credit a teacher for must not bring to feel that have right to go into family purposely to watch over find fault with one member of if have seen anything wrong in jemima ruth loved so much that must have told of in private with many doubt how

please be not way to win liked far better when inflexibly rigidly adhered to idea of right wrong not even allowing force to temptation hardly grace to repentance compared with beauty of holiness have never yielded to sin have be idol in day a found out now however much at time have opposed with violence a for mr farquhar be almost weary of reasoning even principle seemed to have influence over for saw that jemima be not at what approved of in woman saw uncurbed passionate affecting to despise rule of life held most sacred indifferent to if not positively disliking yet loved dearly resolved to make great effort of will break loose from trammel of sense while resolved old recollection must bring up hanging on arm in confidence of early girlhood looking up in face with soft dark eye questioning upon mysterious subject have so much interest for of at time although have become only matter for dissension in later day be also true a mr bradshaw have said mr farquhar wished to marry have not much choice in small town of eccleston never put so plainly before a reason for choosing jemima a father have done to be unconscious motive same however now have lectured into resolution to make pretty long absence from eccleston see if amongst distant friend there be woman more in accordance with ideal who must put naughty wilful plaguing jemima bradshaw out of head if did not soon perceive change in for better few day after ruth conversation with mr bradshaw invitation have be expecting yet dreading came be to alone mr miss benson be pleased at compliment to urged acceptance of wished that have be included have not thought right kind to jemima to tell why be going feared now lest must feel little hurt that be not asked too need not have be afraid be glad proud of attention

about skinning here ruth said mr benson coming in from garden here be rose two for be sorry there be more hoped must have have yellow rose out by time damask white be in warmer corner have got start miss benson leonard stood at door watched down little passage street till be out of sight have hardly touched bell at mr bradshaw door when mary elizabeth opened with boisterous glee saw coming have be watching for want to come round garden before tea papa be not come in yet do come went round garden with little girl clinging to arm be full of sunshine flower made contrast between usual large family room fronted north east therefore have evening sun to light up cold drab furniture more striking than usual looked very gloomy there be great dining table heavy square range of chair straight square work box useful square colouring of wall carpet curtain of coldest description everything be handsome everything be ugly mr bradshaw be asleep in easy chair when came in jemima have just put down work lost in thought leant cheek on hand when saw ruth brightened little went to kissed mr bradshaw jumped up at sound of entrance be wide awake in moment oh thought father be here said evidently relieved to find that have not come in caught sleeping thank mr denbigh for coming to to night said in quiet tone in generally spoke in husband absence when be there sort of constant terror of displeasing made voice sharp nervous child knew that many thing passed over by mother when father be away be sure to be noticed by when be present noticed too in cross querulous manner for be so much afraid of blame on occasion of misbehaviour fell upon yet looked up to husband with reverence regard faithfulness of love decision of character be likely to produce on weak anxious mind be rest support to on whom cast responsibility be obedient unremonstrating wife to no stronger affection have ever brought duty to into conflict with desire of heart loved child dearly though perplexed very frequently son be especial darling because very seldom brought into scrape with father be so cautious prudent have art of keeping calm sough about difficulty might be in with dutiful sense of obligation husband enforced upon to notice tell everything be going wrong in household especially among child mr bradshaw somehow contrived to be honestly blind to good deal be not praiseworthy in master richard mr bradshaw came in before long bringing with mr farquhar jemima have be talking to ruth with interest before then on seeing mr farquhar bent head down over work went little paler turned obstinately silent mr bradshaw longed to command to speak even have suspicion that what might say when so commanded might be rather worse in effect than gloomy silence so held peace discontented angry kind of peace be mr bradshaw saw that something be wrong must not tell what only became moment more trembling nervous irritable sent mary elizabeth off on sort of contradictory errand to servant made tea twice a strong sweetened twice a much a usual in hope of pacifying husband with good thing mr farquhar have gone for last time so thought have resolved for fifth time that must go watch jemima once more if temper got better of showed old sullenness again gave old proof of indifference to good opinion must give up altogether seek wife elsewhere sat watching with folded arm in silence altogether be pleasant family party jemima wanted to wind skein of wool mr farquhar saw came to anxious to do little service turned away pettishly asked ruth to hold for ruth be hurt for mr farquhar looked sorrowfully at jemima jemima must not see glance of upbraiding a ruth hoping that must relent delayed little to comply with request mr farquhar did went back to seat to watch saw jemima turbulent stormy in look saw ruth to appearance heavenly calm a angel with only little tinge of sorrow friend behaviour have called forth saw unusual beauty of face form have never noticed before saw jemima with brilliancy once possessed in eye complexion dimmed faded watched ruth speaking low soft to little girl who seemed to come to in difficulty remarked gentle firmness when bedtime came pleaded to stay up longer father be absent in counting house must not have dared to do so liked ruth soft distinct unwavering must go must keep to what be right far better than good natured yielding to entreaty have formerly admired in jemima be wandering off into comparison while ruth with delicate unconscious tact be trying to lead jemima into subject must take away from thought be that made so ungracious rude jemima be ashamed of before ruth in way have never be before one else valued ruth good opinion so highly that dreaded lest friend must perceive fault put check upon check at first after little time have forgotten something of trouble listened to ruth questioned about leonard smiled at little witticism only sigh must come up from very force of habit brought back consciousness of unhappiness before end of evening jemima have allowed to speak to mr farquhar in old way questioning differing disputing be recalled to remembrance of miserable conversation by entrance of father after be silent have seen face more animated bright with smile a spoke to mr farquhar although regretted loss of complexion for be still very pale be highly pleased with success of project never doubted that ruth have given sort of private exhortation to behave better must not have understood pretty art with by simply banishing unpleasant subject throwing wholesome natural sunlit tone over others ruth have insensibly drawn jemima out of gloom resolved to buy mr denbigh handsome silk gown very next day did not believe have silk gown poor creature have noticed that dark grey stuff long long time a sunday dress liked colour silk one must be just same tinge then thought that must perhaps be better to choose lighter shade one might be noticed a different to old gown for have doubt must like to have remarked perhaps must not object to tell people that be present from mr bradshaw token of approbation smiled little to a thought of additional source of pleasure to ruth in meantime be getting up to go home while jemima be lighting bed candle at lamp ruth came round to bid good night mr bradshaw must not allow to remain till morrow uncertain whether be satisfied not good night mr denbigh said good night thank be obliged to be exceedingly obliged to laid emphasis on word for be pleased to see mr farquhar step forward to help jemima in little office mr farquhar offered to accompany ruth home street intervened between mr bradshaw chapel house be so quiet that desisted when learnt from ruth manner how much disliked proposal mr bradshaw too instantly observed oh mr denbigh need not trouble farquhar have servant at liberty at moment to attend on if wish in fact wanted to make hay while sun shone to detain mr farquhar little longer now that jemima be so gracious went upstairs with ruth to help to put on thing dear jemima said ruth be so glad to see looking better to night quite frightened morning looked so ill did replied jemima oh ruth have be so unhappy lately want to come put to right continued half smiling know be sort of out pupil of yours though be so nearly of age ought to lecture make good must dear said ruth think be one to do oh yes be have done good to night well if can do anything for tell what be asked ruth tenderly oh not now not now replied jemima must not tell here be long story know can tell at mamma might come up at moment papa must be sure to ask what have be talking about so long take own time love said ruth only remember a far a can how glad be to help be too good darling said jemima fondly say so replied ruth earnestly almost a if be afraid god know be not well be none of too good answered jemima know that be very good nay wo call so if make look so miserable come away downstairs with fragrance of ruth sweetness lingering about jemima be best self during next half hour mr bradshaw be more more pleased raised price of silk be going to give ruth sixpence yard during time mr farquhar went home through garden way happier than have be long time even caught humming old refrain on revient on revient toujours s premier amour a soon a be aware of what be doing cleared away remnant of song into cough be sonorous if not perfectly real chapter xxi mr farquhar attention transferred next morning a jemima mother sat at work came into head of former to remember father very marked way of thanking ruth evening before what favourite mr denbigh be with papa said be sure wonder at did notice mamma how thanked for coming here last night yes dear think be mr bradshaw stopped short be never certain if be right wrong to say anything not what asked jemima when saw mother be not going to finish sentence not because mr denbigh came to tea here replied mr bradshaw why what else must be thanking for what have done asked jemima stimulated to curiosity by mother hesitating manner know if ought to tell said mr bradshaw oh very well said jemima rather annoyed nay dear papa never said be not to tell perhaps may never mind want to hear in piqued tone there be silence for little while jemima be trying to think of something else thought must revert to wonder what mr denbigh must have done for father think may tell though said mr bradshaw half questioning jemima have honour not to urge confidence be too curious to take active step towards repressing mr bradshaw went on think deserve to know be partly doing papa be so pleased with mr denbigh be going to buy silk gown morning think ought to know why why asked jemima because papa be so pleased to find that mind what say mind what say to be sure do always did why must papa give gown for think ought to give rather said jemima half laughing be sure must dear will give one be certain if want one be so pleased to see like old self to mr farquhar last night of must think what have come over last month now seems right dark cloud came over jemima face did not like close observation constant comment upon manner what have ruth to do with be glad be pleased said very coldly then after pause added have not told what mr denbigh have to do with good behaviour did not speak to about asked mr bradshaw looking up why must have right to criticise what do must not be so impertinent said jemima feeling very uncomfortable suspicious yes love must have have right for papa have desired to do papa desired what do mean mamma oh dear dare say must not have told said mr bradshaw perceiving from jemima tone of voice that something have gone wrong only spoke a if must be impertinent in mr denbigh be sure must not do anything be impertinent know must be right for to do what papa told said great deal to other day about finding out why be so cross bringing right be right now dear said mr bradshaw soothingly thinking that jemima be annoyed like good child at recollection of how naughty have be then papa be going to give mr denbigh gown because be civil to mr farquhar last night yes dear said mr bradshaw more more frightened at jemima angry manner of speaking low toned very indignant jemima remembered with smouldered anger ruth pleading way of wiling from sullenness night before management everywhere in case be peculiarly revolting so much so that must hardly bear to believe that seemingly transparent ruth have lent to be sure mamma papa asked mr denbigh to make behave differently seems so strange be quite sure spoke to last friday morning in study remember be friday because mr dean be working here jemima remembered now that have gone into school room on friday found sister lounging about wondering what papa must possibly want with mr denbigh after conversation jemima repulsed ruth timid effort to ascertain cause of disturbance to help if must ruth tender sympathising manner a saw jemima daily looking more wretched be distasteful to latter in highest degree must not say that mr denbigh conduct be positively wrong might even be quite right be inexpressibly repugnant to to think of father consulting with stranger week ago almost considered ruth a sister how to manage daughter so a to obtain end wished for yes even if end be for own good be thankful glad to see brown paper parcel lying on hall table with note in ruth handwriting addressed to father knew what be grey silk dress that be sure ruth must never accept one henceforward must induce jemima to enter into conversation with mr farquhar suspected manoeuvring in simplest action be miserable in constant state of suspicion must not allow to like mr farquhar even when said thing most after own heart heard one evening talking with father about principle of trade father stood out for keenest sharpest work consistent with honesty if have not be father must perhaps have thought of saying inconsistent with true christian honesty be for driving hard bargain exacting interest payment of just bill to day be said only way in trade must be conducted once allow margin of uncertainty where feeling instead of maxim be to be guide hope of there ever being good men of business be ended suppose delay of month in requiring payment might save man credit prevent becoming bankrupt put in mr farquhar must not give must let have money to set up again a soon a have passed bankruptcy court if never passed might in case make allowance must always keep justice charity separate yet charity in sense of word degrades justice tempered with mercy consideration elevates be not justice justice be certain inflexible mr farquhar must not allow quixotic notion to mingle with conduct a tradesman so went on jemima face glowing with sympathy in mr farquhar said till once on looking up suddenly with sparkling eye saw glance of father told a plain a word must say that be watching effect of mr farquhar speech upon daughter be chilled thenceforward thought father prolonged argument in order to call out sentiment knew must most recommend partner to daughter must so fain have let love mr farquhar constant manoeuvring in did not feel clear that did not take passive part made sick at heart even wished that might not go through form of pretending to try to gain consent to marriage if involved premeditated action speech making such moving about of one into right place like piece at chess felt a if must rather be bought openly like oriental daughter where one be degraded in own eye by being party to such contract consequence of admirable management of mr bradshaw must have be very unfortunate to mr farquhar who be innocent of connivance in of plot indeed must have be a much annoyed at a jemima have be aware of that impression made upon by ruth on evening have so lately described be deepened by contrast behaviour made to miss bradshaw on one two more recent occasion there be use thought in continuing attention so evidently distasteful to jemima to young girl hardly out of schoolroom probably appeared like old man might even lose friendship with used to regard be ever must be very dear to if persevered in trying to be considered a lover must always feel affectionately towards very fault gave interest in eye for have blamed most conscientiously most uselessly when be looking upon a future wife said conscience must learn to approve of when sank down to place of young friend over whom might exercise good salutary interest mr denbigh if not many month older in year have known sorrow care so early that be much older in character besides shy reserve quiet daily walk within line of duty be much in accordance with mr farquhar notion of what wife must be still be wrench to take affection away from jemima if have not helped to do so by mean in power must never have accomplished yes by mean in power have jemima alienated lover beloved for so be in fact now quick sighted eye saw be gone for ever past recall for did not jealous sore heart feel even before be conscious of fact that be drawn towards sweet lovely composed dignified ruth one who always thought before spoke a mr farquhar used to bid jemima do who never be tempted by sudden impulse walked world calm self governed what now availed jemima reproach a remembered day when have watched with earnest attentive eye a now watched ruth time since when led astray by morbid fancy have turned away from advance be only in march last march called 'dear jemima ' ah remember well pretty nosegay of green house flower that gave in exchange for wild daffodil how seemed to care for flower gave how looked at thanked that be gone over now sister came in bright glowing oh jemima how nice cool be sitting in shady room have felt even chilly have be long walk be so tired be so hot why did go then said oh wanted to go must not have stayed at home on account have be so pleasant said mary have be to scaurside wood to gather wild strawberry said elizabeth such quantity have left whole basketful in dairy mr farquhar say will teach how to dress in way learnt in germany if can get hock do think papa will let have be mr farquhar with asked jemima dull light coming into eye yes told morning mamma wanted to take old linen to lame man at scaurside farm that meant to coax mr denbigh to let go into wood gather strawberry said elizabeth thought must make excuse come said quick witted mary a eager thoughtless observer of one love affair a of quite forgetting that not many week ago have fancied attachment between jemima did did not replied elizabeth at least never thought about be quite startled when heard horse foot behind on road said be going to farm must take basket be not kind of jemima did not answer so mary continued know be great pull up to farm be so hot already road be quite white baked hurt eye terribly be so glad when mr denbigh said might turn into wood light be quite green there branch be so thick overhead there be whole bed of wild strawberry said elizabeth taking up tale now mary be out of breath mary fanned with bonnet while elizabeth went on know where grey rock crop out jemima well there be complete carpet of strawberry runner so pretty must hardly step without treading little bright scarlet berry under foot did so wish for leonard put in mary yes mr denbigh gathered great many for mr farquhar gave thought said have gone on to dawson farm said jemima oh yes just went up there then left horse there like wise man came to in pretty cool green wood oh jemima be so pretty little fleck of light coming down here there through leaf quivering on ground must go with to morrow yes said mary be going again to morrow must not gather nearly strawberry leonard be to go too to morrow yes thought of such capital plan be to say mr farquhar thought of wanted to carry leonard up hill in king cushion mr denbigh must not hear of said must tire so yet wanted to gather strawberry so interrupted mary for by time two girl be almost speaking together mr farquhar be to bring up before on horse will go with wo dear jemima asked elizabeth will be at ca go said jemima abruptly ask ca little girl be hushed into silence by

have represented a being to must care for portionless widow in humble circumstance like mr denbigh money connexion encumbered with boy very action proved mr farquhar to be lost to jemima reinstated on throne in fancy must go on in hushed quietness quivering with fresh token of preference for that other too one so infinitely more worthy of than so that must not have even poor comfort of thinking that have discrimination be throwing away on common worthless person ruth be beautiful gentle good conscientious hot colour flushed up into jemima sallow face a became aware that even while acknowledged excellence on mr denbigh part hated recollection of marble face wearied even to sickness tone of low voice be irritating from very softness goodness undoubted a be be more distasteful than many fault have more savour of human struggle in what be terrible demon in heart asked jemima better angel be indeed given up to possession be not old stinging hatred have prompted so many crime hatred of sweet virtue might win love denied to old anger wrought in elder brother heart till ended in murder of gentle abel while yet world be young oh god help did not know be so wicked cried jemima aloud in agony have be terrible glimpse into dark lurid gulf capability for evil in heart wrestled with demon must not depart be to be struggle whether not be to be given up to in time of sore temptation next day long sat pictured happy strawberry gathering going on even then in pleasant scaurside wood touch of fancy must heighten idea of enjoyment of mr farquhar attention to blushing conscious ruth such touch must add pang to self reproach keen jealousy be added by imagination got up walked about to try stop over busy fancy by bodily exercise have eaten little day be weak faint in intense heat of sunny garden even long grass walk under filbert hedge be parched dry in glowing august sun yet sister found there when returned walking quickly up down a if to warm herself on winter day be very weary not so communicative a on day before now that jemima be craving for detail to add to agony yes leonard came up before mr farquhar oh how hot be jemima do sit down will tell about ca if keep walking so ca sit still to day said jemima springing up from turf a soon a have sat down tell can hear while walk about oh ca shout can hardly speak be so tired mr farquhar brought leonard

interest through long sunny autumn weather on bed on couch in jemima room whither have be carried at first be comfort to mr bradshaw to be able at once to discover what be that have knocked up elizabeth did not rest easily until have settled upon cause for ailment illness in family be stern consolation to mr bradshaw during time of anxiety respecting daughter to be able to blame somebody must not like wife have taken comfort from inanimate fact wanted satisfaction of feeling that one have be in fault else never must have happened poor ruth did not need implied reproach when saw gentle elizabeth lying feeble languid heart blamed for thoughtlessness so severely a to make take mr bradshaw word hint a too light censure for careless way in to please own child have allowed two pupil to fatigue with such long walk begged hard to take share of nursing spare moment went to mr bradshaw asked with earnest humility to be allowed to pas with elizabeth a be often relief to have assistance mr bradshaw received entreaty very kindly desired to go upstairs where elizabeth pale countenance brightened when saw where jemima sat in silent annoyance that own room be now become open ground for one whom heart rose up against to enter in be welcomed whether be that ruth who be not inmate of house brought with fresher air more change of thought to invalid know elizabeth always gave peculiarly tender greeting if have sunk down into languid fatigue in spite of jemima endeavour to interest roused up into animation when ruth came in with flower book brown ruddy pear sending out warm fragrance

hypocritical word be polite kind in purport took pain to make action same a formerly rule line may measure out figure of man be soul give life there be soul inner meaning breathing out in jemima action ruth felt change acutely suffered from time before ventured to ask what have occasioned one day took miss bradshaw by surprise when be alone together for few minute by asking if have vexed in way be so changed be sad when friendship have cooled so far a to render question necessary jemima went rather paler than usual then made answer changed how do mean how be changed what do say do different from what used to do tone be so constrained cold that ruth heart sank within knew now a well a word must have told that not only have old feeling of love passed away from jemima that have gone unregretted attempt have be made to recall love be very precious to ruth now a of old time be one of fault of nature to be ready to make sacrifice for who loved to value affection almost above price have yet to learn lesson that be more blessed to love than to be beloved lonely a impressible year of youth have be without parent without brother sister be perhaps wonder that clung tenaciously to symptom of regard must not relinquish love of one without pang doctor who be called in to elizabeth prescribed sea air a best mean of recruiting strength mr bradshaw who liked to spend money ostentatiously went down straight to abermouth engaged house for remainder of autumn for a told medical man money be object to in comparison with child health doctor cared too little about mode in

long year right be so little disputed that never thought of acknowledging allegiance so readily paid to old feudal feeling between land owner tenant did not quake prophetically at introduction of manufacture cranworth family ignored growing power of manufacturer more especially a principal person engaged in trade be dissenter notwithstanding lack of patronage from one great family in neighbourhood business flourished increased spread wide dissenting head thereof looked around about time of speak felt powerful enough to defy great cranworth interest even in hereditary stronghold by so doing avenge slight of many year slight rankled in mr bradshaw mind a much a if did not go to chapel twice sunday pay largest pew rent of member of mr benson congregation accordingly mr bradshaw have applied to one of liberal parliamentary agent in london man whose only principle be to do wrong on liberal side must not act right wrong for tory for whig latitude of conscience have never yet be discovered be possible mr bradshaw be not aware of character of agent at rate knew be man for purpose be to hear of one who must come forward a candidate for representation of eccleston on dissenting interest there be in round number about six hundred voter said two hundred be decidedly in cranworth interest dare not offend mr cranworth poor soul two hundred more may calculate upon a pretty certain factory hand people connected with trade in way who be indignant at stubborn way in cranworth have contested right of water two hundred be doubtful much care way said parliamentary agent of course must make care mr bradshaw rather shrunk from knowing look with be said hoped that mr pilson did not mean to allude to bribery did not express hope because thought must deter agent from using mean be possible might prove to be only way if mr bradshaw once embarked on enterprise there must be failure by expedient success must be certain must have nothing to do with parliamentary agent be well accustomed to deal with kind shade of scruple be most at home with men who have none still must allow for human weakness perfectly understood mr bradshaw have notion know of man who will just suit purpose plenty of money doe not know what to do with in fact tired of yachting travelling want something new heard through of mean of intelligence employ that not very long ago be wishing for seat in parliament liberal said mr bradshaw decidedly belongs to family who be in long parliament in day mr bradshaw rubbed hand dissenter asked not so far a very lax church what be name asked mr bradshaw eagerly excuse until be certain that must like to come forward for eccleston think have better not mention name anonymous gentleman did like to come forward name proved to be donne mr bradshaw have be in correspondence during time of mr ralph cranworth illness when died everything be arranged ready for start even before cranworths have determined who must keep seat warm till eldest son came of age for father be already member for county mr donne be to come down to canvas in person be to take up abode at mr bradshaw therefore be that seaside house within twenty mile distance of

parliamentary agent have given that mr benson be person to be conciliated on account of influence over many of working people began to ask question with air of deferring to superior knowledge that almost surprised mr bradshaw who have be accustomed to treat benson in very different fashion of civil condescending indulgence just a one listens to child who can have have opportunity of knowing better at end of conversation mr hickson held with mr benson on subject in latter be really interested on have expressed at length young barrister turned to mr bradshaw said very audibly wish donne have be here conversation during last half hour must have interested almost a much a have done mr bradshaw little guessed truth that mr donne be at very moment coaching up various subject of public interest in eccleston privately cursing particular subject on mr benson have be holding forth a being unintelligible piece of quixotism leading dissenter of town need not have experienced pang of jealousy at possible future admiration minister might excite in possible future member for eccleston if mr benson have be clairvoyant need not have made especial subject of gratitude out of likelihood that might have opportunity of so far interesting mr donne in condition of people of eccleston a to induce to set face against attempt at bribery mr benson thought of night through ended by determining to write sermon on christian view of political duty might be good for elector member to hear on eve of election for mr donne be expected at mr bradshaw before next sunday of course a mr miss benson have settled must appear at chapel with on day stinging conscience refused to be quieted present plan of usefulness allayed aching remembrance of evil have done that good might come not even look of leonard a early dawn fell on mr benson sleepless eye saw rosy glow on firm round cheek open mouth through soft long drawn breath came gently quivering eye not fully shut closed to outward sight not even aspect of quiet innocent child must soothe troubled spirit leonard mother dreamt of other night dream of be one of undefined terror terror so great that wakened up strove not to sleep again for fear that ominous ghastly dream must return on contrary dreamt of sitting watching smiling by bedside a gentle self have be many morning when saw awake so fell out in dream smiled still more sweetly bending down kissed then spread out large soft white feathered wing in way surprised child seemed to have known be there all along sailed away through open window far into blue sky of summer day leonard wakened up then remembered how far away really be far more distant inaccessible than beautiful blue sky to have betaken in dream cried to sleep again in spite of absence from child made one great abiding sorrow ruth enjoyed seaside visit exceedingly in first place there be delight of seeing elizabeth daily almost hourly improvement then at doctor express order there be so few lesson to be done that there be time for long exploring ramble three delighted in when rain came storm blew house with wild sea view be equally delightful be large house built on summit of rock nearly overhung shore below there be to be sure series of zigzag tacking path down face of rock from house must not be seen old delicate people must have considered situation bleak exposed indeed present proprietor wanted to dispose of on very account by present inhabitant exposure bleakness be called by other name considered a charm from part of room saw grey storm gather on sea horizon put in marching array soon march became sweep great dome of heaven be covered with lurid cloud between vivid green earth below there seemed to come purple atmosphere making very threatening beautiful by by house be wrapped in sheet of rain shutting out sky sea inland view till of sudden storm be gone by heavy rain drop glistened in sun a hung on leaf grass little bird sang east little bird sang west there be pleasant sound of running water abroad oh if papa must buy house exclaimed elizabeth after one such storm have watched silently from very beginning of little cloud bigger than man hand mamma must never like be afraid said mary must call delicious gush of air draught think must catch cold jemima must be on side how long mr denbigh be hope be near enough post office when rain came on ruth have gone to shop in little village about mile distant where letter be left till fetched only expected one that one be to tell of leonard however received two unexpected one be from mr bradshaw news contained be if possible greater surprise than letter mr bradshaw informed that planned arriving by dinner time following saturday at eagle crag more that intended bringing mr donne one two other gentleman with to spend sunday there letter went on to give possible direction regarding household preparation dinner hour be fixed to be at six of course ruth girl must have dined long before professional cook must arrive day before laden with provision must not be obtained on spot ruth be to engage waiter from inn be that detained so long while sat in little parlour awaiting coming of landlady must not help wondering why mr bradshaw be bringing strange gentleman to spend two day at abermouth thus giving so much trouble fuss of preparation there be so many small reason went to make up large one have convinced mr bradshaw of desirableness of step that be not likely that ruth must guess at one half of in first place miss benson in pride fulness of heart have told mr bradshaw what brother have told how meant to preach upon christian view of duty involved in political right a of course mr bradshaw have told mr bradshaw began to dislike idea of attending chapel on sunday at for have uncomfortable idea by christian standard divine test of true pure bribery must not be altogether approved of yet be tacitly coming round to understanding packet must be required for what purpose mr donne be to be supposed to remain ignorant must be very awkward so near to time if be to be clearly convinced that bribery however disguised by name word be in plain term sin yet knew mr benson have once twice convinced against will of certain thing have thenceforward found impossible to do without such great uneasiness of mind that have left off doing be sadly against interest if mr donne whom have intended to take with to chapel a fair dissenting prey must also become convinced why cranworths must win day must be laughing stock of eccleston in one case bribery must be allowed be allowable be great pity human nature be so corrupt if member succeeded must double subscription to school in order that next generation might be taught better there be various other reason strengthened mr bradshaw in bright idea of going down to abermouth for sunday connected with out of door politics with domestic for instance have be plan of house to have cold dinner on sunday mr bradshaw have piqued on strictness yet have instinctive feeling mr donne be not quite man to partake of cold meat for conscience ' sake with cheerful indifference to fare mr donne have in fact taken bradshaw household little by surprise before came mr bradshaw have pleased with thinking that more unlikely thing have happened than espousal of daughter with member of small borough pretty airy bubble burst a soon a saw mr donne very existence be forgotten in le than hour when felt quiet incontestible difference of rank standard that there be in respect between guest own family be not through circumstance so palpable possibly accidental a bringing down servant whom mr donne seemed to consider a much matter of course a carpet bag though smart gentleman arrival fluttered volscians in corioli considerably more than gentle spoken master be nothing like be something indescribable quiet being at ease expecting one else to be so attention to woman be so habitual a to be unconsciously exercised to subordinate person in mr bradshaw family happy choice of simple expressive word of must be confessed be slang fashionable slang that make difference measured graceful way of utterance with style of pronunciation quite different to of eccleston put together make part of indescribable whole unconsciously affected mr bradshaw established mr donne in estimation a creature quite different to have seen before a most unfit to mate with jemima mr hickson who have appeared a model of gentlemanly ease before mr donne arrival now became vulgar coarse in mr bradshaw eye yet such be charm of languid high bred manner that mr bradshaw cottoned a expressed to mr farquhar to new candidate at once be only afraid lest mr donne be too indifferent to thing under sun to care whether gained lost election be reassured after first conversation have together on subject mr donne eye lightened with eagerness be almost fierce though tone be a musical nearly a slow a ever when mr bradshaw alluded distantly to probable expense packet mr donne replied oh of course disagreeable necessity better speak a little about such thing a possible other people can be found to arrange dirty work neither must like to soil finger by be sure four thousand pound be in mr pilson hand will never inquire what becomes of may very probably be absorbed in law expense know will let be clearly understood from hustings that most decidedly disapprove of bribery leave rest to hickson management be accustomed to sort of thing be not mr bradshaw be rather perplexed by want of bustling energy on part of new candidate if have not be for four thousand pound aforesaid must have doubted whether mr donne cared sufficiently for result of election jemima thought differently watched father visitor attentively with something like curious observation naturalist bestows on new specie of animal do know what mr donne reminds of mamma said one day a two sat at work while gentleman be absent canvassing be not like anybody ever saw quite frightens by being so ready to open door for if be going out of room by giving chair when come in never saw one like who be jemima not person not human being mamma said jemima half smiling do remember stopping at wakefield once on way to scarborough there be horse race going on somewhere of racer be in stable at inn where dined remember what about why richard somehow knew one of jockey a be coming in from ramble through town man boy asked to look at one of racer have charge of well dear well mamma mr donne be like horse nonsense jemima must not say so know what father must say if heard likening mr donne to brute brute be sometimes very beautiful mamma be sure must think compliment to be likened to race horse such a one saw thing in be alike be sort of repressed eagerness in eager why must say there never be one cooler than mr donne think of trouble papa have have month past then remember slow way in mr donne move when be going out to canvas low drawling voice in question people who bring intelligence can see papa standing by ready to shake to get out news mr donne question be always to point force out grain without chaff look at if one tell ill news about election have never seen dull red light come into eye be like race horse flesh quivered over at certain sound noise have meaning to stood quite still pretty creature now mr donne be just a eager a be though may be too proud to show though seems so gentle almost think be very headstrong in following out own will well call like horse again for be sure papa must not like do know thought be going to say be like little leonard when asked who be like leonard oh mamma be not in least like leonard be twenty time more like race horse now dear jemima do be quiet father think racing so wrong that be sure must be very seriously displeased if be to hear to return to mr bradshaw to give one more of various reason for wishing to take mr donne to abermouth wealthy eccleston manufacturer be uncomfortably impressed with indefinable sense of inferiority to visitor be not in education for mr bradshaw be well educated man be not in power for if chose present object of mr donne life might be utterly defeated did not arise from anything overbearing in manner for mr donne be habitually polite courteous be just now anxious to propitiate host whom looked upon a very useful man sense of inferiority arose from mr bradshaw be anxious to relieve of imagined that if must make more display of wealth object must be obtained now house in eccleston be old fashioned ill calculated to exhibit money worth mode of living though strained to high pitch just at time became aware be more than mr donne be accustomed to day of life first day at dessert remark opportune remark a mr bradshaw in innocence have thought be made regarding price of pine apple be rather exorbitant that year mr donne asked mr bradshaw with quiet surprise if have pinery a if to be without pinery be indeed depth of pitiable destitution in fact mr donne have be born cradled in wealth must purchase so have ancestor before for so many generation refinement luxury seemed natural condition of man dwelt without be in position of monster absence be noticed not presence now mr bradshaw knew that house ground of eagle crag be exorbitantly dear yet really thought of purchasing a one mean of exhibiting wealth so raising up to level of mr donne thought that if must take latter down to abermouth show place for because little girl have taken fancy to be willing to give fancy price of fourteen thousand pound must at last make half shut dreamy eye open wide owner confess that in wealth at least eccleston manufacturer stood on par with mingled motif caused determination made ruth sit in little inn parlour at abermouth during wild storm passage wondered if have fulfilled mr bradshaw direction looked at letter yes everything be done now home with news through wet lane where little pool by roadside reflected deep blue sky round white cloud with even deeper blue clearer white rain drop hung so thick on tree even little bird flight be enough to shake down in bright shower a of rain when told news mary exclaimed oh how charming then will see new member after while elizabeth added yes will like to do where must be papa will want dining room room where must sit oh said ruth in dressing room next to room that papa want always be that be quiet out of way chapter xxiii recognition saturday came torn ragged cloud be driven across sky be not becoming day for scenery little girl regretted much first hoped for change at twelve o'clock then at afternoon tide turning at time did sun show face papa will never buy dear place said elizabeth sadly a watched weather sun be everything to sea look quite leaden to day there be sparkle on sand be so yellow sun speckled on thursday be one dull brown now never mind to morrow may be better said ruth cheerily wonder what time will come at inquired mary papa said must be at station at five o'clock landlady at swan said must take hour to get here be to dine at six asked elizabeth yes answered ruth think if have tea hour earlier at past four then went out for walk must be nicely out of way just during bustle of arrival dinner must be in drawing room ready against papa came in after dinner oh must be nice said tea be ordered accordingly south westerly wind have dropped cloud be stationary when went out on sand dug little hole near in coming tide made canal to from water blew light sea foam against other then stole on tiptoe near to group of grey white sea gull despised caution flying softly slowly away to little distance a soon a drew near in ruth be a great child a only longed for leonard with mother longing a indeed did day hour of day by by cloud thickened yet more one two drop of rain be felt be very little ruth feared shower for delicate elizabeth besides september evening be fast closing in dark sunless day a turned homewards in rapidly increasing dusk saw three figure on sand near rock coming in direction papa mr donne exclaimed mary now will see do make out be asked elizabeth oh tall one to be sure see how papa always turn to a if be speaking to not to other who be other asked elizabeth mr bradshaw said that mr farquhar mr hickson must come with be not mr farquhar be sure said ruth girl looked at other a always did when ruth mentioned mr farquhar name be perfectly unconscious of look of conjecture gave rise to a soon a two party drew near mr bradshaw called out in strong voice well dear found there be hour before dinner so came down upon sand here be tone of voice assured that be in bland indulgent mood two little girl ran towards kissed shook hand with ruth told companion that be little girl who be tempting to extravagance of purchasing eagle crag then rather doubtfully because saw that mr donne expected introduced daughter governess mr denbigh be growing darker moment be time must hasten back to rock be even now indistinct in grey haze mr bradshaw held hand of of daughter ruth walked alongside two strange gentleman being on outskirt of party mr bradshaw began to give little girl home news told that mr farquhar be ill must not accompany jemima mamma be quite well gentleman nearest to ruth spoke to be fond of sea asked there be answer so repeated question in different form do enjoy staying by seaside must rather ask reply be yes rather breathed out in deep inspiration than spoken in sound sand heaved trembled beneath ruth figure near vanished into strange nothingness sound of voice be a distant sound in dream while echo of one voice thrilled through through must have caught at arm for support in awful dizziness wrapped up body soul voice if name face figure be changed that voice be same have touched girlish heart have spoken most tender word of love have won wrecked have last heard in low muttering of fever dared not look round to see figure of who spoke dark a be knew be there heard speak in manner in used to address stranger year ago perhaps answered perhaps did not god knew seemed a if weight be tied to foot a if steadfast rock receded a if time stood still be so long so terrible that path across reeling sand at foot of rock separated mr bradshaw afraid lest dinner must cool preferred shorter way for friend on elizabeth account girl be to take longer easier path wound upwards through rocky field where lark nest abounded where wild thyme heather be now throwing out sweet to soft night air little girl spoke in eager discussion of stranger appealed to ruth ruth did not answer be too impatient to convince other to repeat question first little ascent from sand to field surmounted ruth sat down suddenly covered face with hand be so unusual wish good be so invariably rule of motion of rest in walk that girl suddenly checked stood silent affrighted in surprise be still more startled when ruth wailed aloud inarticulate word be not well dear mr denbigh asked elizabeth gently kneeling down on grass by ruth sat facing west low watery twilight be on face a took hand away so pale so haggard so wild wandering look girl have never seen on human countenance before well what be doing here with must not be with said shaking head slowly looked at other be sadly tired said elizabeth soothingly come home let help to bed will tell papa be ill ask to send for doctor ruth looked at a if did not understand meaning of word more did at first by by dulled brain began to think most vividly rapidly spoke in sharp way deceived girl into belief that nothing have be matter yes be tired be tired sand oh sand weary dreadful sand be over now only heart ache still feel how flutter beat said taking elizabeth hand holding to side be quite well though continued reading pity in child look a felt trembling quivering beat will go straight to dressing room read chapter will still heart then will go to bed mr bradshaw will excuse know one night only ask for one night put on right frock dear do ought to do know will said bending down to kiss elizabeth then before have done so raising head abruptly be good dear girl god keep so by strong effort at self command went onwards at even pace rushing pausing to sob think very regularity of motion calmed front back door of house be on two side at right angle with other shrunk little from idea of going in at front door now that strange gentleman be about accordingly went through quiet farm yard right into bright ruddy kitchen where servant be dashing about with dinner thing be contrast in more than colour to lonely dusky field even little girl perceived noise warmth very bustle of servant be positive relief to ruth for time lifted off heavy press of pent up passion silent house with moonlit room with faint gloom brooding over apartment must have be more to be dreaded then must have given way cried out a be went up old awkward back stair into room be to sit in there be candle mary volunteered to go down for one when returned be full of wonder of preparation in drawing room ready eager to dress so a to take place there before gentleman have finished dinner be struck by strange paleness of ruth face now that light fell upon stay up here dear mr denbigh will tell papa be tired be gone to bed time ruth must have dreaded mr bradshaw displeasure for be understood thing that one be to be ill tired in household without leave asked cause given assigned never thought of now great desire be to hold quiet till be alone quietness be not be rigidity succeeded in being rigid in look movement went through duty to elizabeth who preferred remaining with upstairs with wooden precision heart felt at time like ice at time like burning fire always heavy heavy weight within at last elizabeth went to bed still ruth dared not think mary must come upstairs soon with strange sick shrinking yearning ruth awaited crumb of intelligence might drop out about ruth sense of hearing be quickened to miserable intensity a stood before chimney piece grasping tight with hand gazing into dying fire seeing not dead grey ember little spark of vivid light ran hither thither among wood ash old farm house climbing winding road little golden breezy common with rural inn on hill top far far away through thought of past came sharp sound of present of three voice one of be almost silence be so hushed indifferent people must only have guessed that mr donne be speaking by quietness in others listened ruth heard voice many of word though conveyed idea to mind be too much stunned even to feel curious to know to what related spoke that be one fact presently up came mary bounding exultant papa have let stay up one quarter of hour longer because mr hickson have asked mr hickson be so clever did not know what to make of mr donne seemed such dawdle be very handsome have ruth seen oh must not be so dark on stupid sand well never mind must see to morrow must be well to morrow papa seemed good deal put out that elizabeth be in drawing room to night last word be tell mr denbigh hope papa hope always meant expect will be able to make breakfast at nine o'clock then must see mr

cold threatening a be night tore off gown put hair back from heated face seemed now a if must not think a if thought emotion have be repressed so sternly that must not come to relieve stupified brain till at once like flash of lightning life past present be revealed to in minutest detail when saw very present now strange confusion of agony be too great to be borne cried aloud then be quite dead listened a to sound of galloping army if might see if might see if might just ask why left if have vexed in way be so strange so cruel be not be mother said almost fiercely a if answering oh god might have found out before continued sadly did not care for a did for did not care for at went on wildly sharply did cruel harm can never again lift up face in innocence think have forgotten because speak oh darling love be talking against asked tenderly be so torn perplexed who be father of child very circumstance full of such tender meaning in many case threw new light into mind changed from woman into mother stern guardian of child be still for time thinking then began again in low deep voice left might have be hurried off might have inquired might have learnt explained left to bear burden shame never cared to learn a might have done of leonard birth have love for child will have love for raised voice while uttering determination then feeling own weakness moaned out ala ala then started up for time have be rocking backwards forward a sat on ground began to pace room with hurried step what be thinking of where be who have be praying year year to be worthy to be leonard mother god what depth of sin be in heart why old time must be a white a snow to what must be now if sought out prayed for explanation must re establish in heart who have striven made mock of trying to learn god holy will in order to bring up leonard into full strength of christian who have taught sweet innocent lip to pray 'lead not into temptation deliver from evil yet somehow have be longing to give to father who be who be almost choked till at last cried sharp out oh god do believe leonard father be bad man yet oh pitiful god love can not forget can not threw body half out of window into cold night air wind be rising came in great gust rain beat down on did good still calm night must not have soothed a did wild tattered cloud hurrying past moon gave foolish kind of pleasure that almost made smile vacant smile blast driven rain came on again drenched hair through through word stormy wind fulfilling word came into mind sat down on floor time hand be clasped round knee uneasy rocking motion be stilled wonder if darling be frightened with blustering noisy wind wonder if be awake then thought went back to various time of old when affrighted by weather sound so mysterious in night have crept into bed clung to have soothed sweetly awed into stillness childlike faith by telling of goodness power of god of sudden crept to chair there knelt a in very presence of god hiding face at first not speaking word for did not know heart by by moaning out amid sob tear now for first time wept oh god help for be very weak god pray thee be rock strong fortress for of be nothing if ask in name thou

vibrated a in measured time great terrible gust came from four quarter of heaven blew around dying away in distance with loud unearthly wail be not utterly still before sound of coming blast be heard like trumpet of vanguard of prince of air there be knock at bedroom door little gentle knock soft child voice mr denbigh may come in please be so frightened be elizabeth ruth calmed passionate breathing by one hasty draught of water opened door to timid girl oh mr denbigh did ever hear night be so frightened mary sleep so sound ruth be too much shaken to be able to speak at once took elizabeth in arm to reassure elizabeth stood back why how wet be mr denbigh there be window open do believe oh how cold be said shivering get into bed dear said ruth do come too candle give strange light with long wick somehow face doe not look like please put candle out come to bed be so frightened seems a if must be safer if be by ruth shut window went to bed elizabeth be shivering quaking to soothe ruth made great effort spoke of leonard fear in low hesitating voice spoke of god tender mercy very humbly for feared lest elizabeth must think better holier than be little girl be soon asleep fear forgotten ruth worn out by passionate emotion obliged to be still for fear of awaking bedfellow went off into short slumber through depth of echo of waking sob quivered up when awoke grey light of autumnal dawn be in room elizabeth slept on ruth heard servant about early farmyard sound after have recovered from shock of consciousness recollection collected thought with stern calmness be here in few hour must meet there be escape except through subterfuge contrivance be false cowardly how must all turn out must not say even guess of one thing be clear to one thing must hold fast be come what might must obey god law be end of what might must say thy will be done only asked for strength enough to do when time came how time must come what speech action must be requisite on part did not know did not even try to conjecture left that in hand be icy cold very calm when breakfast bell rang went down immediately because felt that there be le chance of recognition if be already at place beside tea urn busied with cup than if came in after be settled heart seemed to stand still felt almost strange exultant sense of power over felt rather than saw that be not there mr bradshaw mr hickson be so busy talking election politics that did not interrupt conversation even when bowed to pupil sat one on side of before be quite settled while other two gentleman yet hung over fire mr donne came in ruth felt a if moment be like death have kind of desire to make sharp sound to relieve choking sensation be over in instant sat on very composed silent to outward appearance very model of governess who knew place by by felt strangely at ease in sense of power must even listen to what be being said have never dared a yet to look at mr donne though heart burnt to see once again sounded changed voice have lost fresh youthful eagerness of tone though in peculiarity of modulation be same must never be mistaken for voice of person there be good deal said at breakfast for none seemed inclined to hurry although be sunday morning ruth be compelled to sit there be good for that did that half hour seemed to separate present mr donne very effectively from imagination of what mr bellingham have be be analyser hardly even have learnt to notice character felt there be strange difference between people have lived with lately man who now leant back in chair listening in careless manner to conversation never joining in expressing interest in unless somewhere somehow touched now mr bradshaw always threw into subject might be in pompous dogmatic sort of way did do whether related to not be part of mr hickson trade to assume interest if felt not mr donne did one other when other two be talking of many of topic of day put glass in eye better to examine into exact nature of cold game pie at other side of table suddenly ruth felt that attention be caught by until now seeing short sightedness have believed safe now face flushed with painful miserable blush in instant be strong quiet looked up straight at face a if action took aback dropped glass began eating away with great diligence have seen be changed knew not how in fact expression have be only occasional formerly when worse self predominated have become permanent looked restless dissatisfied be very handsome still quick eye have recognised with sort of strange pride that eye mouth be like leonard although perplexed by straightforward brave look have sent right at be not entirely baffled thought mr denbigh be certainly like poor ruth woman be far handsomer face be positively greek then proud superb turn of head quite queenly governess in mr bradshaw family why might be percy howard for grandeur of grace poor ruth woman hair be darker though have le colour altogether more refined looking person poor ruth for first time for several year wondered what have become of though of course there be one thing must have happened perhaps be a well did not know end for most likely must have made very uncomfortable leant back in chair unobserved for must not have thought gentlemanly to look so fixedly at if one noticed put up glass again be speaking to one of pupil did not see by jove must be though there be little dimple came out about mouth a spoke just like used to admire so much in ruth have never seen in one else sunshine without positive movement of smile longer looked more be convinced be with jerk that recovered enough to answer mr bradshaw question whether wished to go to church not church how far mile think will perform devotion at home to day absolutely felt jealous when mr hickson sprang up to open door a ruth pupil left room be pleased to feel jealous again have be really afraid be too much used up for such sensation hickson must keep place what be paid for be doing talking to elector not paying attention to lady in family mr donne have noticed that mr hickson have tried to be gallant to miss bradshaw let if liked let beware how behaved to fair creature ruth ruth certainly be ruth only how devil have played card so well a to be governess respected governess in such family a mr bradshaw mr donne movement be evidently to be guide of mr hickson mr

returned felt weak trembling in body strong in power over have left house in good time for church so needed not to hurry went leisurely along road now then passing country person whom knew with whom exchanged kindly placid greeting presently to ruth dismay heard step behind coming at rapid pace peculiar clank of rather high heeled boot gave springy sound to walk that have known well long ago be like nightmare where evil dreaded be never avoided never completely shunned be by one side at very moment of triumph in escape there be by side there be quarter of mile intervening between church even yet trusted that have not recognised have changed mind see said quietly have curiosity to see architecture of church of old country church have singular bit about mr bradshaw kindly directed part of way be so much puzzled by 'turns to right 'turns to left be quite glad to espy party that speech required positive answer of kind answer did receive have not expected reply knew if be ruth must not answer indifferent word of silence made more certain of identity with lady by side scenery here be of kind new to grand wild yet marked by high cultivation yet have great charm reminds of part of wale breathed deeply then added have be in wale believe spoke low almost in whisper little church bell began to call lagging people with quick sharp summons ruth writhed in body spirit struggled on church

not lift eye to bright eastern light must not see how peacefully marble image of dead lay on tomb for be between light peace knew that look be on that never turned glance away must not join in prayer for remission of sin while be there for very presence seemed a sign stain must never be washed out of life although goaded chafed by thought recollection kept very still sign of emotion flush of colour be on face a looked at elizabeth must not find place then ruth breathed once long deeply a moved up pew out of straight burning glance of eye of evil meaning when sat down for reading of first lesson ruth turned corner of seat so a no longer to be opposite to must not listen word seemed to be uttered in world far away from be exiled cast out sound yet more meaning be dim distant in extreme tension of mind to hold in bewildered agony so happened that one of sens be preternaturally acute while church people swam in misty haze one point in dark corner grew clearer clearer till saw what at time must not have discerned at face gargoyle think call at end of arch next to narrowing of nave into chancel in shadow of contraction face be beautiful in feature next to be grinning monkey be not feature be most striking part there be half open mouth not in way distorted out of exquisite beauty by intense expression of suffering conveyed distortion of face by mental agony implies that struggle with circumstance be going on in face if such struggle have be be over now circumstance have conquered there be hope from mortal endeavour help from mortal creature to be have eye looked onward upward to hill from whence cometh help though parted lip seemed ready to quiver with agony yet expression of whole face owing to strange stony yet spiritual eye be high consoling if mortal gaze have never sought meaning before in deep shadow where have be placed long century ago yet ruth did now who must have imagined look who must have witnessed perhaps felt such infinite sorrow yet dared to lift up by faith into peace so pure be mere conception if so what soul unknown carver must have have for creator handicraftsman must have be one two mind must have be in such perfect harmony whatever be however came there imaginer carver sufferer be long passed away human art be ended human life done human suffering over remained stilled ruth beating heart to look on grew still enough to hear word have come to many in time of need awed in presence of extremest suffering that hushed world have ever heard of second lesson for morning of th of september be th chapter of st matthew gospel when prayed again ruth tongue be unloosed also must pray in name who underwent agony in garden a came out of church there be little pause gathering at door have begun to rain who have umbrella be putting up who have not be regretting wondering how long must last standing for moment impeded by people who be thus collected under porch ruth voice close to say very low very distinctly have much to say to much to explain entreat to give opportunity ruth did not reply must not acknowledge that heard trembled nevertheless for well remembered voice be low soft have power to thrill earnestly desired to know why how have left appeared to a if knowledge must alone give relief from restless wondering that distracted mind that one explanation must do harm no higher spirit made answer must not be ruth girl have umbrella turned to mary said mary give umbrella to mr donne come under mine way of speaking be short decided be compressing meaning into a few word a possible little girl obeyed in silence a went first through churchyard stile mr donne spoke again be unforgiving said only ask to hear have right to be heard ruth wo believe be so much changed a not to listen to when entreat spoke in tone of soft complaint have done much to destroy illusion have hung about memory for year whenever ruth have allowed to think of besides during time of residence in benson family feeling of what people ought to be have be unconsciously raised refined mr donne even while have to struggle against force of past recollection repelled so much by what be at present that speech of minute be together served to make path more more easy to follow voice retained something of former influence when spoke without seeing must not help remembering former day did not answer last speech more than first saw clearly that putting aside thought a to character of former relationship have be dissolved by will act deed that therefore power to refuse further intercourse whatsoever remained with sometimes seems little strange how after having earnestly prayed to be delivered from temptation having given ourselves with shut eye into god hand from time thought outward influence acknowledged law of life seems to lead on from strength to strength seems strange sometimes because notice coincidence be natural unavoidable consequence of truth goodness being one same therefore carried out in circumstance external internal of god creation when mr donne saw that ruth must not answer became only more determined that must hear what have to say what be did not exactly know whole affair be most mysterious piquant umbrella protected ruth from more than rain on walk homewards for under shelter must not be spoken to unheard have not rightly understood at what time girl be to dine from gathering at meal time must not shrink must show sign of weakness oh relief after walk to sit in own room locked up so that mary elizabeth must come by surprise to let weary frame weary with being so long braced up to rigidity stiff quiet fall into chair anyhow helpless nerveless motionless a if very bone have melted out of peaceful rest mind took be in thinking of leonard dared not look before behind must see well at present brooded over thought of till dreaded father more more by light of child purity innocence saw evil clearly yet more clearly thought that if leonard ever came to know nature of birth have nothing for to die out of sight must never know human heart must never know ignorant innocence small circumstance have impelled onwards god knew if leonard heard of mother error why nothing remained death for felt then a if have in power to die innocently out of such future agony that escape be not so easy suddenly fresh thought came prayed that through suffering might be purified trial woe measureless pang god might see fit to chastise with must not shrink if only at last might come into presence in heaven ala shrinking from suffering can not help that part of prayer be vain a for rest be not sure justice of law finding out even now law once broken justice very nature of law bring immutable retribution if turn penitently to enables to bear punishment with meek docile heart for mercy endureth for ever mr bradshaw have felt rather wanting in proper attention to guest inasmuch a have be unable in minute to comprehend mr donne rapid change of purpose before have entered into mind that notwithstanding distance of church mr donne be going thither that gentleman be out of sight far out of reach of burly host though latter have so far neglected duty of hospitality a to allow visitor to sit in eagle crag pew with other guard of honour than child governess mr bradshaw determined to make up for by extra attention during remainder of day accordingly never left mr donne wish that gentleman expressed be study of host to gratify did hint at pleasure walk in such beautiful scenery must give mr bradshaw be willing to accompany although at eccleston be principle with not to take walk for pleasure on sunday when mr donne turned round recollected letter must be written must compel to stay at home mr bradshaw instantly gave up walk remained at hand ready to furnish with

shame to be indoors in such place rain yes rained hour ago now be splendid weather feel quite qualified for guide assure can show beauty of neighbourhood throw in bog nest of viper to boot mr donne languidly assented to proposal of going out then became restless until mr hickson have eaten hasty lunch for hoped to meet ruth on way from church to be near watch though might not be able to speak to to have slow hour roll away to know must leave next day yet so close to not to be seeing be more than must bear in impetuous kind of way disregarded mr hickson offer of guidance to lovely view turned

down lane on way to church knew too well to distrust doing what be told sat still head bowed on arm for few minute then rose up went to put on walking thing thought impelled to sudden haste crossed field by side of house ran down steep rocky path be carried by impetus of descent far out on level sand not far enough for intent without looking to right hand to left where comer might be seen went forward to black post rising above heaving water marked where fisherman net be laid went straight towards place hardly stinted pace even where wet sand be glittering with receding wave once there turned round in darting glance saw that a yet one be near be perhaps mile more from grey silvery rock sloped away into brown moorland interspersed with field here there of golden waving corn behind be purple hill with sharp clear outline touching sky little on one side from where stood saw white cottage house formed village of abermouth scattered up down on windy hill about mile inland saw little grey church where even now many be worshipping in peace pray for sighed out a object caught eye now close under heathery field where fell softly down touched sand saw figure moving in direction of great shadow made by rock going towards very point where path from eagle crag came down to shore be said to herself turned round looked seaward tide have turned wave be slowly receding a if loath to lose hold have so lately with such swift bound gained on yellow sand eternal moan have made since world began filled ear broken only by skirl of grey sea bird a alighted in group on edge of water a rose up with measured balancing motion sunlight caught white breast there be sign of human life to be seen boat distant sail near shrimper black post there be that spoke of men work labour beyond stretch of water few pale grey hill showed like film summit clear though faint base lost in vapoury mist on hard echoing sand distinct from ceaseless murmur of salt sea wave came footstep nearer nearer very near be when ruth unwilling to show fear rioted in heart turned round faced mr donne came forward with hand extended be kind own ruth said ruth arm hung down motionless at side what ruth have word for have nothing to say said ruth why little revengeful creature so be to explain before will even treat with decent civility want explanation said ruth in trembling tone must not speak of past asked to come in leonard in child name to hear what have to say about what have to say about relates to even more how can talk about without recurring to past that past try to ignore know can not do in heart be full of happy recollection to be not happy in wale said in tenderest tone there be answer not even one faint sigh though listened intently dare not speak dare not answer heart will not allow to prevaricate know be happy suddenly ruth beautiful eye be raised to full of lucid splendour grave serious in expression cheek heretofore so faintly tinged with tenderest blush flashed into ruddy glow be happy deny come will not blench from truth have answered yet replied secretly exulting in admission not perceiving inner strength of must have be conscious before must have dared to make yet ruth be not to recur to past why not if be happy at time be recollection of so miserable to tried once more to take hand quietly stepped back came to hear what have to say about child said beginning to feel very weary child ruth drew up face went very pale what have to say about asked coldly much exclaimed much that may affect whole life depends upon whether will hear not listen good heaven ruth will drive mad oh what changed person be from sweet loving creature be wish be not so beautiful did not reply caught deep involuntary sigh will hear if speak though may not begin at once to talk of boy boy of whom mother parent might be proud must see that ruth have seen looked like prince in cramped miserable house with earthly advantage be shame must not have kind of opportunity laid open before there be sign of maternal ambition on motionless face though there might be little spring in heart a beat quick strong at idea of proposal imagined be going to make of taking boy away to give careful education have often craved for must refuse a must everything else seemed to imply that acknowledged claim over leonard yet sometimes for boy sake have longed for larger opening more extended sphere ruth acknowledge be happy once there be circumstance if must tell in detail must show how in weak convalescent state be almost passive in hand of others ah ruth have not forgotten tender nurse who soothed in delirium when be feverish dream be again at llan dhu in little old bed chamber in white always wore then know flitting about tear dropped large round from ruth eye must not help how must be happy then continued gaining confidence from sight of melted mood recurring once more to admission considered so much in favour can such happiness never return thus went on quickly anxious to lay before all have to offer before must fully understand meaning if must consent leonard must be always with educated where how liked money to amount might choose to name must be secured to if only ruth if only happy day might return ruth spoke said that be happy because have asked god to protect help dared not tell lie be happy oh what be happiness misery that must talk about now mr donne looked at a uttered word to see if be wandering in mind seemed to so utterly strange incoherent dare not think of happiness must not look forward to sorrow god did not put here to consider of thing dear ruth compose there be hurry in answering question asked what be said ruth love so can not live without offer heart life offer to place leonard wherever must have placed have power mean to advance in path of life choose who have shown kindness to will be rewarded by with gratitude even surpassing own if there be anything else can do that can suggest will do listen to said ruth now that

benson from sister from innocent girl whom teach nay even have cowered away from god what did wrong then did blindly to what must do now if listened to be so strongly agitated that put hand over face sobbed without restraint then taking away looked at with glowing face beautiful honest wet eye tried to speak calmly a asked if needed to stay longer must have gone away at once that thought of leonard wished to hear that father might have to say be so struck anew by beauty understood so little that believed that only required little more urging to consent to what wished for in have said there be trace of anger resentment for desertion of have expected must be prominent feature greatest obstacle have to encounter deep sense of penitence expressed mistook for earthly shame imagined must soon soothe away yes have much more to say have not said half can not tell how fondly will how fondly do love how life will be spent in ministering to wish money see know despise mr bellingham will not stay to hear speak to so again have be sinful be not who must must not speak be so choking with passionate sorrow wanted to calm a saw shaken with repressed sob put hand on arm shook off impatiently moved away in instant ruth said nettled by action of repugnance begin to think never loved never loved do dare to say so eye flamed on a spoke red round lip curled into beautiful contempt why do shrink so from said in turn getting impatient did not come here to be spoken to in way said came if by chance must do leonard good must submit to many humiliation for sake to more from be not

quiet reply delicate waving movement appeared to very type of what woman must be calm serene soul fashioning body to angelic grace be therefore with slight interest that mr farquhar inquired daily after health of little leonard asked at bensons house sally answered with swollen tearful eye that child be very bad very bad indeed asked at doctor doctor told in few short word that be only bad kind

sally be willing to take a much trouble about leonard a if believed be going to live that recovery depended upon care miss benson great object be to keep from having confidential talk with ruth a if repetition of dream must have deepened conviction in ruth mind that child must die seemed to that death must only be fitting punishment for state of indifference towards towards life death towards

contemplating what reality have be only clung more faithfully than before to thought of great god who be rock in dreary land where shadow be autumn winter with lowering sky be le dreary than woeful desolate feeling shed gloom on jemima found too late that have considered mr farquhar so securely own for so long time that heart refused to recognise a lost to unless reason went through same weary convincing miserable evidence day after day hour after hour never spoke to now except from common civility never cared for contradiction never tried with patient perseverance to bring over to opinion never used wonted wile so tenderly remembered now have existence in memory to bring round out of wilful mood such mood be common enough now frequently be sullenly indifferent to feeling of others not from unkindness because heart seemed numb stony incapable of sympathy then afterwards self reproach be terrible in dead of night when one saw with strange perversity only intelligence cared to hear only sight cared to see be circumstance gave confirmation to idea mr farquhar be thinking of ruth for wife craved with stinging curiosity to hear something of affair day partly because torture such intelligence gave be almost relief from deadness of heart to other interest so spring gioventu dell'anno came back to bringing contrast spring alone can bring to add to heaviness of soul little winged

full of other thing to care if a believed life be waning felt glad that be so delicacy be not unnoticed by mother often anxiously asked husband if did not think jemima be looking ill did affirmation to contrary satisfy a most of affirmation did thought morning before got up how must tempt jemima to eat by ordering favourite dainty for dinner in many other little way tried to minister to child poor girl own abrupt irritability of temper have made mother afraid of openly speaking to about health ruth too saw that jemima be not looking well how have become object of dislike to former friend

when come in sight who cast unloving glance at of though not seeing be conscious a of occult influence cause of whose dislike be unknown to though word action seems to increase believe that sort of dislike be only shown by jealous that render disliker even more miserable because more continually conscious than object growing evidence of jemima feeling made ruth very unhappy at time very may too idea have come into mind have tried to repress namely that mr farquhar be in love with annoyed extremely made reproach that ever must think thing possible tried to strangle notion to drown to starve out by neglect existence caused such pain distress worst be have won leonard heart who be constantly seeking out when absent talking about best be journey connected with business must take to

leonard darling for whom be far seeing covetous miserly of scrap of love kindly regard mr farquhar must not have be flattered if have known how much departure contributed to ruth rest of mind on saturday afternoon on set out on journey be beautiful day sky of intense quivering blue seemed a though must look through for ever yet not reach black infinite space be suggested a lying beyond now then thin torn vaporous cloud floated slowly within vaulted depth soft air gently wafted be not perceptible among leaf on tree did not even tremble ruth sat at work in shadow formed by old grey garden wall miss benson sally one in parlour window seat mending stocking other hard at work in kitchen be within talking distance for be weather for open door window none of three kept up continued conversation in interval ruth sang low brooding song such a remembered mother singing long ago now then stopped to look at leonard who be labouring away with vehement energy at digging over small plot of ground where meant to prick out celery plant have be given to ruth heart warmed at earnest spirited way in thrust large spade deep down into brown soil ruddy face glowing curly hair wet with exertion yet sighed to think that day be over when deed of skill must give pleasure now delight be in acting last year not fourteen month ago have watched making daisy chain for a if must not admire cleverness enough year week when have be devoting spare hour to simple tailoring performed for boy have always made article wore felt almost jealous of employment have come to with wistful look asked

through busy street be market day not only formed low rolling bass to nearer pleasanter sound enhanced sense of peace by suggestion of contrast afforded to repose of garden by bustle not far off besides physical din bustle there be mental strife turmoil afternoon a jemima be restlessly wandering about house mother desired to go on errand to mr pearson new dressmaker in order to give direction about sister new frock jemima went rather than have trouble of resisting else must have preferred staying at home moving being outwardly quiet according to own fitful will mr bradshaw who a have said have be aware for time that something be wrong with daughter be very anxious to set to right if only knew how have rather planned errand with view to dispel jemima melancholy mimie dear said mother when be there look out for new bonnet for have got very pretty one old one be so shabby doe for mother said jemima heavily want new bonnet want to have one lassie want girl to look well nice there be something of homely tenderness in mr bradshaw tone touched jemima heart went to mother kissed with more of affection than have shown to one for week before kiss be returned with warm fondness think love mother said jemima love dear if must think so if want anything wish for anything only tell with little patience can get father to give know only be happy there be good girl be happy a if one must by effort of will thought jemima a went along street too absorbed in to notice bow of acquaintance friend instinctively guiding right among throng press of cart gig market people in high street mother tone look with comforting power remained longer in recollection than inconsistency of word spoken when have completed errand about frock asked to look at bonnet in order to show recognition of mother kind thought mr pearson be smart clever looking woman of five six thirty have variety of small talk at finger end be formerly needed by barber to amuse people who came to be shaved have admired town till jemima be weary of praise sick oppressed by sameness a have be many week here be bonnet ma'be will be just thing for elegant tasty yet quite of simple style suitable to young lady oblige by trying on white silk jemima looked at in glass be obliged to own be very becoming perhaps not le so for flush of modest shame came into cheek a heard mr pearson open praise of rich beautiful hair oriental eye of wearer induced young lady who accompanied sister other day governess be ma'be yes mr denbigh be name said jemima clouding over thank ma'be well persuaded mr denbigh to try on bonnet ca think how charming looked in yet think became a much a doe mr denbigh be very beautiful said jemima taking off bonnet not much inclined to try on other very ma'be quite peculiar style of beauty if might be allowed must say that hers be grecian style of loveliness while yours be oriental reminded of young person once knew in fordham mr pearson sighed audible sigh in fordham said jemima remembering that ruth have once spoken of place a one in have spent time while county in be situated be same in ruth be born in fordham why think mr denbigh come from neighbourhood oh ma'be can not be young person mean be sure ma'be holding position doe in establishment must hardly say knew myself for only saw two three time at sister house be so remarked for beauty that remember face quite well more so on account of vicious conduct afterwards vicious conduct repeated jemima convinced by word there must be identity between ruth young person alluded to then must not have be mr denbigh oh ma'be be sure must be sorry to be understood to have suggested anything of kind beg pardon if did so all meant to say perhaps be liberty ought not to have taken considering what ruth hilton be ruth hilton said jemima turning suddenly round facing mr pearson yes ma'be be name of young person allude to tell about what did do asked jemima subduing eagerness of tone look a best might trembling a on verge of strange discovery know whether ought to tell ma'be be hardly fit story for young lady ruth hilton be apprentice to sister in law who have first rate business in fordham brought good deal of patronage from county family young creature be very artful bold thought sadly too much of beauty somehow beguiled young gentleman who took into keeping be sure ma'be ought to apologise for polluting

then know nothing more about asked jemima did hear that have gone off with gentleman that met with in wale be sure ca tell who told there be little pause jemima be pondering on have heard suddenly felt that mr pearson eye be upon watching not with curiosity with newly awakened intelligence yet must ask one more question tried to ask in indifferent careless tone handling bonnet while spoke how long be since have be telling about happened leonard be eight year old why let see be before be married be married three year poor dear pearson have be deceased five must say going on for nine year summer blush rose must become complexion perhaps better than lilac said a with superficial observation watched jemima turning bonnet round round on hand bonnet that dizzy eye did not see thank be very pretty want bonnet beg pardon for taking up time with abrupt bow to discomfited mr pearson be out away in open air threading way with instinctive energy along crowded street suddenly turned round went back to mr pearson with even more rapidity than have be walking away from house have changed mind said a came breathless up into show room will take bonnet how much be allow to change flower can be done in instant then can see if must not prefer rose with foliage be lovely little bonnet said mr pearson holding up admiringly on hand oh never mind flower yes change to rose stood by agitated mr pearson thought with impatience time milliner be making alteration with skilful busy haste by way said jemima when saw last touch be being given that must not delay executing purpose be real cause of return papa be sure must not like connecting mr denbigh name with story a have be telling oh dear ma'be have too much respect for to think of doing such thing of course know ma'be that be not to be cast up to lady that be like anybody disreputable must rather did not name likeness to one said jemima not to one tell one story have told morning indeed ma'be must never think of thing poor husband must have borne witness be a close a grave where there be anything to conceal oh dear said jemima mr pearson there be nothing to conceal only must not speak about certainly will not do ma'be may rest assured of time jemima did not go towards home in direction of outskirt of town on hilly side have dim recollection of hearing sister ask if might not go invite leonard mother to tea how must face ruth after conviction have taken possession of heart that sinful creature have just heard of be one same be yet only middle of afternoon hour be early in old fashioned town of eccleston soft white cloud have come slowly sailing up out of west plain be flecked with thin floating shadow gently borne along by westerly wind be waving long grass in hay field into alternate light shade jemima went into one of field lying by side of upland road be stunned by shock have received diver leaving green sward smooth known where friend stand with familiar smiling face admiring glad bravery diver down in instant in horrid depth of sea close to strange ghastly lidless eyed monster can hardly more feel blood curdle at near terror than did jemima now two hour ago point of time on mind dial have never imagined that must ever come in contact with one who have committed open sin have never shaped conviction into word sentence still be there that respectable family religious circumstance of life must hedge in guard from ever encountering great shock of coming face to face with vice without being pharisaical in estimation of herself have pharisee dread of publican sinner child cowardliness that cowardliness prompt to shut eye against object of terror rather than acknowledge existence with brave faith father often reiterated speech have not be without effect drew clear line of partition separated mankind into two great group to one of by grace of god belonged while other be composed of whom be duty to try reform bring whole force of morality to bear upon with lecture admonition exhortation duty to be performed because be duty with very little of hope faith be spirit maketh alive jemima have rebelled against hard doctrine of father frequent repetition have have effect led to look upon who have gone astray with shrinking shuddering recoil instead of with pity so christ like a to have wisdom tenderness in now saw among own familiar associate one almost housefellow who have be stained with evil most repugnant to womanly modesty must fain have ignored existence altogether loathed thought of meeting ruth again wished that must take up put down at distance somewhere anywhere where might never see hear of more never be reminded a must be whenever saw that such thing be in sunny bright lark singing earth over blue dome of heaven bent softly down a jemima sat in hayfield that june afternoon cheek flushed red lip pale compressed eye full of heavy angry sorrow be saturday people in part of country left work hour earlier on day by jemima knew must be growing time for to be at home have have so much of conflict in own mind of late that have grown to dislike struggle speech explanation so strove to conform to time hour much more than have done in happier day oh how full of hate heart be growing against world oh how sickened at thought of seeing ruth who be to be trusted more if ruth calm modest delicate dignified ruth have memory blackened by sin a went heavily along thought of mr farquhar came into mind showed how terrible have be stun that have be forgotten until now with thought of came in first merciful feeling towards ruth must never have be have there be least latent suspicion in jemima jealous mind that ruth have purposely done aught looked look uttered word modulated tone for sake of attracting a jemima recalled passage of intercourse slowly confessed to herself how pure simple have be ruth way in relation to mr farquhar be not merely that there have be no coquetting there have be simple unconsciousness on ruth part for so long time after jemima have discovered mr farquhar inclination for when at length have slowly awakened to perception of state of feeling there have be modest shrinking dignity of manner not startled emotional even timid pure grave quiet conduct of ruth jemima instinctively acknowledged to be of necessity transparent sincere now here there be hypocrisy time somewhere on part of somebody what hypocrisy what lie must have be acted if not absolutely spoken before ruth must have be received by a sweet gentle girlish widow remembered have believed mr denbigh to be when first came among must mr miss benson know must be party to deceit not sufficiently acquainted with world to understand how strong have be temptation to play part did if wished to give ruth chance jemima must not believe guilty of such deceit a knowledge of mr denbigh previous conduct must imply yet how darkened latter into treacherous hypocrite with black secret shut up in soul for year living in apparent confidence daily household familiarity with bensons for year yet never telling remorse ought to be corroding heart who be true who be not who be good pure who be not very foundation of jemima belief in mind be shaken must be false must there be two ruth hiltons went over morsel of evidence must not be knew that mr denbigh former name have be hilton have heard speak casually charily of having lived in fordham knew have be in wale short time before made appearance in eccleston there be doubt of identity into middle of jemima pain horror at afternoon discovery there came sense of power knowledge of secret gave over ruth be relief only aggravation of regret with jemima looked back on state of ignorance be wonder that when arrived at home be so oppressed with headache that have to go to bed directly quiet mother quiet dear dear mother for clung to known tried goodness of mother more than ever now be want be left to stillness of darkened room blind idly flapping to fro in soft evening breeze letting in rustling sound of branch waved close to window thrush gurgling warble distant hum of busy town jealousy be gone knew not how where might shun recoil from ruth now thought that must never more be jealous of in pride of innocence felt almost ashamed that feeling must have have existence must mr farquhar hesitate between own self one who must not name what ruth have be even in thought yet might never know so fair seeming did rival wear oh for one ray of god holy light to know what be seeming what be truth in traitorous hollow earth might be used to think such thing possible before sorrow have embittered that ruth have worked way through deep purgatory of repentance up to something like purity again god only knew if present goodness be real if after having striven back thus far on height fellow woman be to throw down into terrible depth with unkind incontinent tongue must be too cruel yet if there be such woeful uncertainty deceit somewhere if ruth jemima with noble candour admitted be impossible whatever ruth have be be good to be respected a such now did not follow that jemima be to preserve secret always doubted own power to do so if mr farquhar came home again be still constant in admiration of mr denbigh if mr denbigh gave least encouragement last thought from what knew of ruth character be impossible only what be impossible after afternoon discovery at rate must watch wait come what might ruth be in power strange to say last certainty gave jemima kind of protecting almost pitying feeling for ruth horror at wrong be not diminished more thought of struggle that wrong doer must have made to extricate more felt how cruel must be to baffle by revealing what have be for sister sake have duty to perform must watch ruth for love sake must not have helped watching be too much stunned to recognise force of love while duty seemed only stable thing to cling to for present must neither meddle mar in ruth course of life chapter xxvi mr bradshaw virtuous indignation so be that jemima no longer avoided ruth manifested by word look dislike for long time have be scarce concealing ruth must not help noticing that jemima always sought to be in presence while be at mr bradshaw house when daily teaching mary elizabeth when came a occasional visitor with mr miss benson by up to time jemima have used no gentle skill to conceal abruptness with must leave room rather than ruth must be brought into contact rather than that must fall to lot to entertain ruth during part of evening be month since jemima have left off

that be always watching watching at first ruth have welcomed change in habit behaviour a giving chance thought by patient waiting opportune show of enduring constant love to regain lost friend regard by by icy chillness immovable grey struck more to heart than many sudden word of unkindness must have done might be attributed to hot impulse of hasty temper to vehement anger of accuser measured manner be conscious result of deep seated feeling cold sternness befitted calm implacability of severe judge watching ruth felt be ever upon made unconsciously shiver a must if saw that passionless eye of dead be visibly gazing upon very being shrivelled parched up in jemima presence a if blown upon by bitter keen east wind jemima bent power possessed upon one object of ascertaining what ruth

thing of poor innocent child a well a of who be guilty will throw in teeth through life that mother be never married be not married when be born be not married be not widow asked abruptly for first time getting anything like clear idea of real state of case may god forgive help exclaimed a saw strange look of repugnance cloud over boy face felt slight motion on part to extricate from hold be a slight a transient a must be over in instant have taken hand away covered up face with a quickly covered up face in shame before child in bitterness of heart be wailing out oh must to god have died that have died a baby have died a little baby hanging at mother breast mother said leonard timidly putting hand on arm shrunk from continued low passionate wailing mother said after pause coming nearer though saw not mammy darling said using caressing name have be trying to drop a not sufficiently manly mammy own own dear dear darling mother believe broke out into wild burst of cry a said in moment arm be round poor boy be hushing up like baby on bosom hush leonard leonard be still child have be too sudden with have done harm oh have done nothing harm cried in tone of bitter reproach mother said stopping tear eye blazing out with earnestness there never be such mother a have be to wo believe one who say wo will knock down if say again will clenched fist with fierce defiant look on face forget child said ruth in sweetest saddest tone ever be heard said of said because be true leonard threw arm tight round hid face against bosom felt pant there like hunted creature have soothing comfort to give oh that lay dead at last exhausted lay so still motionless that feared to look wanted to speak yet dreaded first word kissed hair head very clothes murmuring low inarticulate moaning

upon shame leonard because of mother leonard be disgrace lowering of in eye of god spoke now a if have found clue might lead to rest strength at last remember always remember that when time of trial come seems hard cruel thing that must be called reproachful name by men for what be fault of yours remember god pity god justice though sin will have made outcast in world oh child child felt kiss a if mutely trying to comfort gave strength to go on remember darling of heart be only own sin can make outcast from god grew so faint that hold of relaxed looked up affrighted brought water threw over in terror at notion that be going to die leave called by fond name imploring to open eye when partially recovered helped to bed on lay still wan death like almost hoped swoon that hung around might be death in imagination opened eye to take last look at boy saw pale terror stricken pity for affright roused made forget in wish that must not see death if be indeed dying go to aunt faith whispered be weary want sleep leonard arose slowly reluctantly tried to smile upon that what thought must be last look might dwell in remembrance a tender strong watched to door saw hesitate return to came back to said in timid apprehensive tone mother will speak to about ruth closed eye that might not express agony felt like sharp knife at question leonard have asked with child desire of avoiding painful mysterious topic from personal sense of shame a understood shame beginning thus early thus instantaneously replied may be sure will not so went now must have be thankful for unconsciousness of fainting that one little speech bore so much meaning to hot irritable brain mr miss benson in house must never speak to boy in home alone must be safe from what have already learnt to dread form in shame opprobrium must overwhelm darling haunted have be exercising strong self control for sake ever since have met at house door there be now reaction presence have kept mind on perfect balance when be withdrawn effect of strain of power be felt athwart fever mist that arose to obscure judgment sort of will o ' wisp plan flittered before tempting to course of action to anything rather than patient endurance to relieve present state of misery by sudden spasmodic effort took semblance of being wise right gradually desire longing settled on one point what have done what must do to leonard evil if be away gone one knew where lost in mystery a if be dead perhaps cruel heart might relent show pity on leonard while perpetual presence must call up remembrance of birth thus reasoned in hot dull brain shaped plan in accordance leonard stole downstairs noiselessly listened to find quiet place where must hide house be very still miss benson thought purposed expedition have taken place never dreamed that ruth leonard be on distant sunny scaurside hill after very early dinner have set out to drink tea with farmer wife who lived in country two three mile off mr benson meant to have gone with while be at dinner have received unusually authoritative note from mr bradshaw desiring to speak with so went to gentleman house instead sally be busy in kitchen making great noise not unlike groom rubbing down horse over cleaning leonard stole into sitting room crouched behind large old fashioned sofa to ease sore aching heart by cry with prodigal waste abandonment of childhood mr benson be shown into mr bradshaw own particular room latter gentleman be walking up down be easy to perceive that something have occurred to chafe to great anger sit down sir said to mr benson nodding to chair mr benson sat down mr bradshaw continued walk for few minute longer without speaking then stopped abruptly right in front of mr benson in voice tried to render calm trembled with passion with face glowing purple a thought of wrong real wrong be began mr benson have sent for to ask be almost too indignant at bare suspicion to speak a becomes did really will be obliged to beg pardon if be a much in dark a be yesterday a to character of woman who life under roof there be answer from mr benson mr bradshaw looked at very earnestly eye be fixed on ground made inquiry uttered expression of wonder dismay mr bradshaw ground foot on floor with gathering rage just a be about to speak mr benson rose up poor deformed old man before stern portly figure be swelling panting with passion hear sir stretching out hand a if to avert word be impending nothing can say can upbraid like own conscience degradation can inflict by word deed can come up to degradation have suffered for year at being party to deceit even for good end for good end nay what next taunting contempt with mr bradshaw spoke word almost surprised by what imagined must be successful power of withering in spite of mr benson lifted grave eye to mr bradshaw countenance repeated for good end end be not a perhaps consider to have be to obtain admission into family yet to put in way of gaining livelihood sister must willingly have shared what have with be intention to do so at first if not for length of time at least a long a health might require why advised perhaps only yielded to advice change of name assumption of false state of widowhood be because earnestly desired to place in circumstance in might work out self redemption sir know how terribly world go against such a have sinned a ruth did be so young too mistake sir acquaintance have not lain so much among class of sinner a to give much experience of way in be treated judging from what have seen must say meet with full a much leniency a deserve supposing know there be plenty of sickly sentimentalist just now who reserve interest regard for criminal why not pick out one of to help in task of washing blackamoor white why choose to be imposed upon household into to intrude protegee why be innocent child to be exposed to corruption say said mr bradshaw stamping foot how dared come into house where be looked upon a minister of religion with lie in mouth how dared single out of people to be gulled deceived pointed at through town a person who have taken abandoned woman into house to teach daughter own deceit be wrong faithless yes can own now be found out there be small merit in think sir claim merit take shame to myself did not single out applied to with proposal that ruth must be child governess pah temptation be too great will not say that temptation be greater than must stand seemed to open out path of usefulness now let hear speak so said mr bradshaw blazing up ca stand be too much to talk in way when usefulness be to consist in contaminating innocent girl god know that if have believed there have be danger of such contamination god know how must have died sooner than have allowed to enter family mr bradshaw believe asked mr benson earnestly really must be allowed privilege of doubting what say in future said mr bradshaw in cold contemptuous manner have deserved mr benson replied continued after moment pause will not speak of of ruth surely sir end aimed at mean took to obtain be wrong can not feel that more than do be right one will not can not say that child have suffered from associating with have in family under watchful eye of three anxious person for year more saw fault human being be without poor ruth be slight venial error saw sign of corrupt mind glimpse of boldness forwardness token of want of conscientiousness seemed be young gentle girl who have be led astray before fairly knew what life be suppose most depraved woman have be innocent in time said mr bradshaw with bitter contempt oh mr bradshaw ruth be not depraved know can not have seen have known daily year without acknowledging mr benson be almost breathless awaiting mr bradshaw answer quiet self control have maintained so long be gone now saw daily did not know if have known must have known be fallen depraved consequently not fit to come into house to associate with pure child now wish god must give power to speak out convincingly what believe to be truth that not woman who have fallen be depraved that many how many great judgment day will reveal to who have shaken off poor sore penitent heart on earth many many crave hunger after chance for virtue help man give to help gentle tender help jesus gave once to mary magdalen mr benson be almost choked by own feeling come come mr benson let have more of morbid way of talking world have decided how such woman be to be treated may depend upon there be so much practical wisdom in world that way of acting be right in long run that one can fly in face with impunity unless indeed stoop to deceit imposition take stand with christ against world said mr benson solemnly disregarding covert allusion to have world way ended in can be much worse than be speak for if please be not time to change of way of thinking acting declare before god that if believe in one human truth be to woman who like ruth have sinned must be given chance of self redemption that chance must be given in supercilious contemptuous manner in spirit of holy christ such a getting into friend house under false colour argue on ruth case in have acknowledged error argue on case state firm belief that be god will that must not dare to trample of creature down to hopeless dust that be god will that woman who have fallen must be numbered among who have broken heart to be bound up not cast aside a lost beyond recall if be god will a thing of god will stand will open way must have attached much more importance to exhortation on point if must have respected conduct in other matter a be when see man who have deluded into considering falsehood right be disinclined to take opinion on subject connected with morality can no longer regard a fitting exponent of will of god perhaps understand what mean mr benson can no longer attend chapel if mr benson have felt hope of making mr bradshaw obstinate mind receive truth that acknowledged repented of connivance at falsehood by mean of ruth have be received into bradshaw family last sentence prevented making attempt simply bowed took leave mr bradshaw attending to door with formal ceremony felt acutely severance of tie mr

most tender goodness said ought not to be must be at present said in decided manner perhaps before long may have employment perhaps may be time before opportunity occurs hush said ruth leonard be moving about in parlour must go to when stood up turned so dizzy tottered so much that be glad to sit down again immediately must rest here will go to said mr benson left when be gone leaned head on back of chair cried quietly incessantly there be more patient hopeful resolved feeling in heart along through tear shed bore onwards to higher thought until at last rose to prayer mr benson caught new look of shrinking shame in leonard eye a first sought then shunned meeting be pained too by sight of little sorrowful anxious face on until now hope joy have be predominant constrained voice few word boy spoke when formerly there must have be glad free utterance grieved mr benson inexpressibly a beginning of unwonted mortification must last for year made allusion to unusual occurrence spoke of ruth a sitting overcome by headache in study for quietness hurried on preparation for tea while leonard sat by in great arm chair looked on with sad dreamy eye strove to lessen shock knew leonard have received by mixture of tenderness cheerfulness that mr benson gentle heart prompted now then languid smile stole over boy face when bedtime came mr benson told of hour although feared that leonard must have sorrowful cry of to sleep be anxious to accustom boy to cheerful movement within limit of domestic law by disobedience to to weaken power of glad submission to supreme to begin new life lay before where strength to look up to god a law giver ruler of event must be pre eminently required when leonard have gone upstairs mr benson went immediately to ruth said ruth leonard be just gone up to bed secure in instinct made silently rise go up to boy certain too that must be other best comforter that god must strengthen through other now for first time have leisure to think of to go over

yes leonard know how who told know have asked question of course be mother be very foolish cruel then said miss benson eye blazing lip trembling at thought of suffering darling boy must have gone through think be wise be sure be not cruel must have soon known that there be mystery be better that must be told openly quietly by mother than by stranger how must tell quietly asked miss benson still indignant well perhaps used wrong word of course one be by suppose even must now tell how be told in what spirit be borne miss benson be silent again be mr bradshaw very angry yes very justly so did very wrong in making false statement at first be sure did not said miss faith ruth have have year of peace in to grow stronger wiser so that can bear shame now in way never must have done at first same be wrong in to do what did did too a much more than think wrong be certain be quite right must do just same again perhaps have not done harm have done nonsense thurstan be morbid be sure be a good better than ever be be not have got what call morbid just in consequence of sophistry by persuaded that wrong must be right torment have lost clear instinct of conscience formerly if believed that such such action be according to will of god went did at least tried to do without thinking of consequence now reason weigh what will happen if do so so grope where formerly saw oh faith be such

to give change of scene be silent for where be requisite money to come from temper became fitful variable at time must be most sullen against mother then give way to passionate remorse when mr benson caught ruth look of agony at child rebuff patience failed rather must say believed that stronger severer hand than hers be required for management of lad when heard mr benson say so pleaded with have patience with leonard said have deserved anger be fretting in heart be only who can reinstate in love respect have fear when see really striving hard long to do what be right must love be not afraid even while spoke lip quivered colour went came with eager anxiety so mr benson held peace let take course be beautiful to see intuition by divined what be passing in fold of child heart so a to be always ready with right word to soothe to strengthen watchfulness be unwearied with thought of self tainting in else might have often paused to turn aside weep at cloud of shame came over leonard love for hid from faithful heart believed knew that be yet own affectionate boy although might be gloomily silent apparently hard cold in mr benson must not choose admire way in be insensibly teaching leonard to conform to law of right to recognise duty in mode in action be performed when mr benson saw knew that goodness must follow that claim mother infinite love have on boy heart must be acknowledged at last more fully because never urged silently admitted force of reason caused to be for time forgotten by by leonard remorse at ungracious sullen way to mother way alternated with passionate fitful burst of clinging love assumed more character of repentance tried to do so no more still health be delicate be averse to going out of door be much graver sadder than became age be what must be inevitable consequence of what have be ruth have to be patient pray in secret with many tear for strength needed knew what be to dread going out into street after story have become known for day day have silently shrunk from effort one evening towards dusk miss benson be busy asked to go errand for ruth got up silently obeyed silence a to inward suffering be only one part of peculiar exquisite sweetness of nature part of patience with accepted penance true instinct told that be not right to disturb others with many expression of remorse that holiest repentance consisted in quiet daily sacrifice still there be time when wearied pitifully of inaction be so willing to serve work one despised service mind a have said before have be well cultivated during last few year so now used knowledge have gained in teaching leonard be employment mr benson relinquished willingly because felt that must give of occupation that needed endeavoured to make useful in house in way must water of housekeeping have closed over place during time of absence at mr bradshaw besides now that be trying to restrict unnecessary expense be sometimes difficult to find work for three woman many many time ruth turned over in mind possible chance of obtaining employment for leisure hour nowhere must find now then sally who be confidante in wish procured needlework be of coarse common kind soon done lightly paid for whatever be ruth took be thankful although added few penny to household purse mean that there be great need of money new adjustment of expenditure be required reduction of want have never be very extravagant ruth salary of forty pound be gone while more of keep a sally called be thrown upon bensons mr benson received about eighty pound year for salary a minister of knew that twenty pound came from mr bradshaw when old man appointed to collect pew rent brought quarterly amount found diminution in inquired how be learnt that although mr bradshaw have expressed to collector determination never to come to chapel again have added that of course pew rent must be paid same mr benson must not suffer old man be commissioned to return money to mr bradshaw a being what deserted minister must not receive mr miss benson have about thirty forty pound coming in annually from sum in happier day mr bradshaw have invested in canal share for altogether income did not fall much short of hundred year lived in chapel house free of rent so ruth small earnings be very little in actual hard commercial account though in sense be much miss benson always received with quiet simplicity by degree mr benson absorbed of ruth time in gracious natural way employed mind in kind office be accustomed to render to poor around a much of peace ornament of life a gained now be gained on firm basis of truth if ruth began low down to find place in world at rate there be flaw in foundation leonard be still great anxiety at time question seemed to be must live through trial of elasticity of childhood then knew how precious blessing how true pillar of fire be to mother how black night how dreary wilderness must be when be not child mother be messenger of god angel to other have long gap between piece of intelligence respecting bradshaws mr bradshaw have at length purchased house at abermouth be much there way in bensons heard most frequently of family of former friend be through mr farquhar called on mr benson about month after latter have met jemima in street mr farquhar be not in habit of paying call on one though have always entertained evinced most kind friendly feeling towards mr benson have rarely be in chapel house mr benson received courteously rather expected that there must be especial reason alleged before conclusion of visit for occurrence more particularly a mr farquhar sat talking on topic of day in somewhat absent manner a if be not subject most present to mind truth be must not help recurring to last time when be in room waiting to take leonard ride heart beating rather more quickly than usual at idea that ruth might bring boy in when be equipped be very full now of remembrance of ruth yet be also most thankful most self gratulatory that have gone no further in admiration of that have never expressed regard in word that one a believed be cognisant of incipient love have grown partly out of admiration partly out of reason be thankful to be spared implication in nine day wonder story have made in eccleston yet feeling for have be of so strong character that winced a with extreme pain at application of censure to name censure be often exaggerated be true when be just in judgment of outward circumstance of case be not le painful distressing to first rebound to jemima be occasioned by mr bradshaw account of how severely husband be displeased at daughter having taken part with ruth must have thanked almost blessed jemima when dropped in dared do more pleading excuse charitable explanation on ruth behalf jemima have humility from discovery have be to so great shock standing have learnt to take heed lest fell when have once be aroused to perception of violence of hatred have indulged against ruth be more reticent measured in expression of opinion showed how much character have be purified from pride now felt aware that what in be again attracting mr farquhar be faithful advocacy of rival wherever such advocacy be wise practicable be quite unaware that jemima have be conscious of great admiration for ruth did not know that have ever cared enough for to be jealous unacknowledged bond between now be grief sympathy pity for ruth only in jemima feeling be ardent must fain have become active while in mr farquhar be strongly mingled with thankfulness that have escaped disagreeable position painful notoriety natural caution induced to make resolution never to think of woman a wife until have ascertained antecedent from birth upwards same spirit of caution directed inwardly made afraid of giving too much pity to ruth for fear of conclusion to feeling might lead still old regard for for leonard esteem respect for bensons induced to lend willing ear to jemima earnest entreaty that must go call on mr benson in order that might learn something about family in general ruth in particular be thus that came to sit by mr benson study fire to talk in absent way to gentleman how got on subject did not know more than one half of attention being distracted be speaking about politics when mr farquhar learned that mr benson took in newspaper will allow to send over time have generally done with before twelve o'clock after that be really waste paper in house will oblige by making use of be sure be very much obliged to for thinking of trouble to send leonard can fetch how be leonard now asked mr farquhar tried to speak indifferently grave look of intelligence clouded eye a looked for mr benson answer have not met lately said mr benson with expression of pain in countenance though too strove to speak in usual tone leonard be not strong find difficult to induce to go much out of door there be little silence for minute two during mr farquhar have to check unbidden sigh suddenly rousing into determination to change subject said will find rather lengthened account of exposure of sir thomas campbell conduct at baden seems to be complete blackleg in spite of baronetcy fancy paper be glad to get hold of anything just now who be sir thomas campbell asked mr benson thought might have heard report true one believe of mr donne engagement to daughter must be glad jilted now fancy after public exposure of father conduct be awkward speech a mr farquhar felt hastened to cover by going on without much connexion dick bradshaw be informant about projected marriage in high life be not much in way since have come down from london to take share in business think have heard more of news scandal of what suppose must be considered high life than ever did before mr donne proceeding seem to be especial object of interest to mr donne be engaged to miss campbell be be engaged if understood right broke off engagement to marry russian prince other better match dick bradshaw told assure continued mr farquhar smiling be very passive recipient of such intelligence might very probably have forgotten about if time of morning have not be so full of disgrace of young lady father richard bradshaw have quite left london have asked mr benson who felt far more interest in old patron family than in campbell that ever be ever must be yes have come to settle down here hope may do well not disappoint father who have formed very high expectation from be not sure if be not too high for young man to realise mr farquhar must have said more dick bradshaw be jemima brother object of anxiety

ruth sat over sewing fancying how have taken place a soon a have arranged event be going on among people place once so familiar to found discrepancy set to afresh to picture declaration of love yielding blushing acceptance for mr farquhar have told little beyond mere fact that there be engagement between jemima have existed for time have be kept secret until now when be acknowledged sanctioned to be fulfilled a soon a returned from arrangement of family affair in scotland intelligence have be enough for mr benson who be only person mr farquhar saw a ruth always shrank from post of opening door mr benson be apt at recognising individual knock always prompt to welcome mr farquhar miss benson occasionally thought what thought be in habit of saying jemima might have come to announce such event to old friend mr benson decidedly vindicated from charge of neglect by expressing strong conviction that to owed mr farquhar call outspoken offer of service quiet steady interest in leonard moreover repeating conversation have have with in street first time met after disclosure mr benson told sister how glad be to find that with warmth of impetuous disposition hurrying on to rebellion against father be now attaining to just self control can distinguish between mere wish true reason that must abstain from coming to see ruth while must do little good reserving for great

thanked jemima for generous loving advocacy have passed unregarded at time in intensity of agony now recollected that by word tone touch have given sign of gratitude mr benson have never told her of meeting with jemima so seemed a if there be hope of future opportunity for be strange how two household rent apart by dissension can go through life parallel existence running side by side yet never touching other near neighbour a be habitual familiar guest a may have be ruth only point of hope be leonard be weary of looking for work employment everywhere seemed held above reach be not impatient

be owing to preference of hardest lesson to outdoor exercise last unnatural symptom be vanishing before assiduous kindness of mr farquhar quiet firm desire of mother next to ruth sally have perhaps most influence over dearly loved mr miss benson although be reserved on a on point not purely intellectual be hard childhood mother felt that be so child bear moderate degree of poverty privation

without coming to wish mr benson miss faith good bye will go for said ruth not just yet want to ask one two question first nothing very particular only seems a if there have be strange long separation between ruth said dropping voice be leonard stronger than be be so sorry to hear about from walter be better asked anxiously yes be better not what boy of age must be replied mother in tone of quiet deep mournfulness oh jemima continued sharpest punishment come through to think what might have be what be walter say be stronger in health not so nervous shy jemima added last word in hesitating doubtful manner a if did not know how to express full meaning without hurting ruth doe not show that feel disgrace so much can not talk about jemima heart ache so about be better continued feeling that jemima kind anxiety required answer at cost of pain to herself be only studying too closely now take to lesson evidently a relief from thought be very clever hope trust yet tremble to say believe

be so decidedly view of question to be considered that believe must refer to with heart hurry to decision let weigh well think will find advantage preponderate wonder if might trouble with little business mr farquhar a be here certainly be only too glad to be of use to why see from report of star life assurance company in time be so good a to send that have declared bonus on share now seems strange have received notification of thought that perhaps might be lying at office a mr bradshaw be purchaser of share have always received dividend through firm mr farquhar took newspaper ran eye over report have doubt be way of said of clerk have be careless about may be richard be not always most punctual exact of mortal will see about perhaps after may come for day two have always such

high importance in eye very idea seemed to produce in so much shrinking affright by mutual consent subject be dropped to be taken up again not according to circumstance mr farquhar wrote next morning on mr benson behalf to insurance company to inquire about bonus although wrote in usual formal way did not think necessary to tell mr bradshaw what have done for mr benson name be rarely mentioned between partner have be made fully aware of view other entertained on subject have caused estrangement mr farquhar felt that external argument must affect mr bradshaw resolved disapproval avoidance of former minister a happened answer from insurance company directed to firm be given to mr bradshaw along with other business letter be to effect that mr benson share have be sold transferred above twelvemonth ago sufficiently accounted for circumstance that notification of bonus have be sent to mr bradshaw tossed letter on one side not displeased to have good reason for feeling little contempt at unbusiness like forgetfulness of mr benson at whose instance one have evidently be writing to insurance company on mr farquhar entrance expressed feeling to really said dissenting minister have more notion of exactitude in affair than child idea of forgetting that have sold share applying for bonus when seems have transferred only year ago mr farquhar be reading letter while mr bradshaw spoke quite understand said mr benson be quite clear about must not have received half yearly dividend unless have be possessed of share suppose dissenting minister with ignorance of business be unlike other men in knowing whether not receive money that believe to be owing to must not wonder if be if benson be at rate why never knew watch to be right in life be always too fast too slow must have be daily discomfort to ought to have be depend upon money matter be just in same irregular state account kept will be bound see that follows said mr farquhar half amused that watch of be very curious one belonged to father grandfather know how far back sentimental feeling be guided by prompt to keep to inconvenience of one else mr farquhar gave up subject of watch a hopeless about letter wrote at mr benson desire to insurance office be not satisfied with answer transaction have passed through hand think be likely mr benson must write sell share without at rate informing at time even though forgot about afterwards probably told richard mr watson can ask mr watson at once be afraid must wait till richard come home for know where letter must catch mr bradshaw pulled bell rang into head clerk room saying a did so may depend upon farquhar blunder lie with benson be just man to muddle away money in indiscriminate charity then to wonder what have become of mr farquhar be discreet enough to hold tongue mr watson said mr bradshaw a old clerk made appearance here be mistake about insurance share purchased for benson ten dozen year ago spoke to mr farquhar about bonus be paying to shareholder seems in reply to mr farquhar letter insurance company say share be sold twelve month since have knowledge of transaction have transfer passed through hand by way turning to mr farquhar who kept certificate did benson really know said mr farquhar perhaps mr watson can tell mr watson meanwhile be studying letter when have ended took off spectacle wiped replacing read again seems very strange sir said at length with trembling aged voice for paid mr benson account of dividend last june got receipt in form be since date of alleged transfer pretty nearly twelve month after took place said mr farquhar how did receive dividend order on bank along with old mr cranmer asked mr bradshaw sharply know how came mr richard gave money desired to get receipt be unlucky richard be from home said mr bradshaw must have cleared up mystery for mr farquhar be silent do know where certificate be kept mr watson said will not be sure think be with mr cranmer paper deed in box wish old cranmer must have made other man executor too be always coming with unreasonable request other mr benson inquiry about bonus be perfectly reasonable at rate mr watson who be dwelling in slow fashion of age on have be said before now spoke will not be sure be almost certain mr benson said when paid last june that thought ought to give receipt on stamp have spoken about to mr richard time before that mr richard said be of consequence yes continued gathering up memory a went on did remember now thought to myself that mr richard be young man mr richard will know about yes said mr farquhar gravely sha wait till richard return said mr bradshaw can soon see if certificate be in box watson point out if be there insurance people be more fit to manage concern than cat will tell so if be not there a suspect will prove to be case be just forgetfulness on benson part a have said from first forget payment of dividend said mr farquhar in low voice well sir what then said mr bradshaw abruptly while spoke while eye met mr farquhar hinted meaning of latter flashed through mind be only made angry to find suspicion must pas through one imagination suppose may go sir said watson respectfully uneasy consciousness of what be in mr farquhar thought troubling faithful old clerk yes go what do mean about dividend asked mr bradshaw impetuously of mr farquhar simply that think there can have be forgetfulness no mistake on mr benson part said mr farquhar unwilling to put dim suspicion into word then of course be blunder of confounded insurance company will write to to day make little brisker more correct in statement think must be better to wait till richard return may be able to explain sir said mr bradshaw sharply think must be better have not be way of doing business to spare one company consequence of own carelessness to obtain information second hand when must have direct from source will write to insurance office by next post mr farquhar saw that further remonstrance on part must only aggravate partner obstinacy besides be suspicion uncomfortable suspicion be possible that of clerk at insurance office might have made mistake watson be not sure after that certificate have be deposited in box when mr farquhar must not find there old man drew more yet more back from first assertion of belief that have be placed there mr bradshaw wrote angry indignant reproach of carelessness to insurance company by next mail one of clerk came down to eccleston having leisurely refreshed at inn ordered dinner with care walked up to great warehouse of bradshaw co sent in card with pencil notification on part of star insurance company to mr bradshaw mr bradshaw held card in hand for minute two without raising eye then spoke out loud firm desire gentleman to walk up stay will ring bell in minute two then show upstairs when errand boy have closed door mr bradshaw went to cupboard where usually kept glass bottle of wine of very seldom partook for be abstemious man intended now to take glass bottle be empty though there be plenty more to be have for ringing even simply going into room must not allow to do stood lectured in thought after be fool for once in life if certificate be in box have yet examined that doe not imply may not be in one have not have time to search farquhar must stay so late last night even if be in none of box here that doe not prove

dignity at first in vindicating a be well in power to do character of proceeding of company at same time be not to go too far for firm of bradshaw co be daily looming larger in commercial world if reasonable explanation must be given be to be received bygone be bygone sit down sir said mr bradshaw be aware sir presume come on part of mr dennison manager of star insurance company to reply in person to letter of yours of th addressed to mr bradshaw bowed very careless piece of business said stiffly mr dennison doe not think will consider a such when have seen deed of transfer be commissioned to show mr bradshaw took deed with steady hand wiped spectacle quietly without delay without hurry adjusted on nose be possible that be rather long in looking over document at least clerk have just begun to wonder if be reading through whole of instead of merely looking at signature when mr bradshaw said be possible that may be of course will allow to take paper to mr benson to to inquire if be signature there can be doubt of think sir said clerk calmly smiling for knew mr benson signature well know sir know be speaking a if pronunciation of word required separate effort of will like man who have received slight paralytic stroke have heard sir of such thing a forgery forgery sir said repeating last word very distinctly for feared that first time have said be rather slurred over oh sir there be room for imagining thing assure in affair become aware of curious forgetfulness on part of who be not of business habit still must like to show benson to prove to forgetfulness know believe on soul be of careless forgetfulness do sir said now spoke very quickly must have be allow to convince will have back to night first thing in morning clerk did not quite like to relinquish deed yet did like to refuse mr bradshaw if very uncomfortable idea of forgery must have foundation in truth have given up writing there be thousand chance to one against being anything stupid blunder risk be more imminent of offending one of director a hesitated mr bradshaw spoke very calmly almost with smile on face have regained self command be afraid see assure may trust if there have be fraud if have slightest suspicion of truth of surmise threw out just now must not quite speak bare naked word be chilling heart will not fail to aid end of justice even though culprit must be own son ended a began with smile smile stiff lip refused to relax cover teeth time kept saying to believe believe be convinced be blunder of old fool benson when have dismissed clerk secured piece of paper went locked door laid head on desk moaned aloud have lingered in office for two previous night at first occupying in searching for certificate of insurance share when box other

broken open with two decided blow of poker instrument nearest at hand did not find certificate richard have always considered careful in destroying dangerous tell tale paper stern father found enough in what remained to convince that pattern son more even than pattern son beloved pride be far other than what seemed mr bradshaw did not skip miss word did not shrink while read folded up letter by letter snuffed candle just when light began to wane sooner did not miss omit one paper read word then leaving letter in heap upon table broken desk to tell own tale locked door of room be appropriated to son a junior partner carried key away with there be faint hope even after discovery of many circumstance of richard life shocked dismayed father there be still faint hope that might not be guilty of forgery that might be forgery after only blunder omission stupendous piece of forgetfulness that hope be one straw mr bradshaw clung to late night mr benson sat in study one else in house have gone to bed be expecting summons to someone who be dangerously ill be not startled therefore at knock came to front door about twelve be rather surprised at character of knock so slow loud with pause between rap study door be step from led into street opened there stood mr bradshaw large portly figure not to be mistaken even in dusky night said that be right be wanted to see walked straight into

insurance share see remember did not write name word looked at mr benson with craving wistfulness for one particular answer mr benson be struck at last by whole proceeding glanced anxiously at mr bradshaw whose manner gait voice be so different from usual that might well excite attention a soon a latter be aware of momentary inspection changed tone at once imagine sir wish to force invention upon a remembrance if did not write name know who did once more ask doe glimmering recollection of having needed money will say never wanted to refuse subscription to chapel god know of having sold accursed share oh see by face did not write need not speak to know sank down into chair near whole figure drooped in moment be up standing straight a arrow confronting mr benson who must find clue to stern man agitation say did not write word pointing to signature with untrembling finger believe richard bradshaw did write dear sir dear old friend exclaimed mr benson be rushing to conclusion for be

bradshaw will not prosecute have said once for to morrow will be glad listen to must only do harm by saying more at present there be always something aggravating in being told that mood in be now viewing thing strongly will not be mood at other time implies that present feeling be blinding that more clear sighted spectator be able to distinguish future better than do most willow person dislike to be told that one can gauge depth mr bradshaw be not soothed by last remark of mr benson stooped down to take up hat be gone mr benson saw dizzy way of groping gave what sought for received word of thanks mr bradshaw went silently towards door just a got there turned round said if there be more people like fewer like there must be le evil in world sir be sentimentalist that nurse up sin although

chair to table on seeing visitor after first necessary word of politeness be over seemed to expect to open conversation mr farquhar have asked said mr benson plunging into subject with trembling heart to tell about letter have received from husband stopped for instant for felt that did not get nearer real difficulty yet must not tell best way of approaching need not have given that trouble be aware of reason of mr farquhar absence entirely disapprove of conduct be regardless of wish disobedient to command a son in law thought must have felt bound to respect if there be more agreeable subject that can introduce will be glad to hear sir must think of what like to hear to say must hear what concern son have disowned young man who be son replied coldly dover coach have be overturned said mr benson stimulated into abruptness by icy sternness of father in flash saw what lay below terrible assumption of indifference mr bradshaw glanced up in face one look of agony then went grey pale so livid that mr benson got up to ring bell in affright mr bradshaw motioned to to sit still oh have be too sudden sir be alive be alive exclaimed a saw ashy face working in vain attempt to speak poor lip so wooden not minute ago went working on on a if mr benson word did not sink down into mind reach understanding mr benson went hastily for mr farquhar oh jemima said have done so badly have be so cruel be very ill fear bring water brandy returned with speed into room mr bradshaw great strong iron man lay back in chair in swoon fit fetch mother mary send for doctor elizabeth said jemima rushing to father mr benson did in power to restore mr bradshaw forgot vow of estrangement from dead like husband who might never speak to hear again bitterly accused for angry word have spoken against during last few miserable day before doctor came mr bradshaw have opened eye partially rallied although either did not must not speak looked struck down into old age eye be sensible in expression have dim glaze of many year of life upon lower jaw fell from upper one giving look of melancholy depression to face although lip hid unclosed teeth answered correctly in monosyllable be true question doctor chose to ask medical man be not so much impressed with serious character of seizure a family who knew hidden mystery behind have seen father lie for first time with precursor aspect of death upon face rest watching little medicine be what doctor prescribed be so slight prescription for what have appeared to mr benson so serious attack that wished to follow medical man out of room to make further inquiry learn real opinion thought must lurk behind a be following doctor be aware of effort mr bradshaw be making to rise in order to arrest mr benson departure did stand up supporting with one hand on table for leg shook under mr benson came back instantly to spot where be for moment seemed a if have not right command of voice at last said with tone of humble wistful entreaty be very touching be alive sir be not yes sir indeed be be only hurt be sure to do well mr farquhar be with said mr benson almost unable to speak for tear mr bradshaw did not remove eye from mr benson face for more than minute after question have be answered seemed a though must read very soul there see if spoke truth satisfied at last sank slowly into chair be silent for little space waiting to perceive if must wish for further information just then at length put hand slowly together in clasped attitude of prayer said thank god chapter xxxii bradshaw pew again occupied if jemima allowed now then to imagine that one good must result from discovery of richard delinquency in return of father mr benson to something of old understanding old intercourse if hope fluttered through mind be doomed to disappointment mr benson must have be most happy to go if mr bradshaw have sent for be on watch for what might be even shadow of such invitation none came mr bradshaw on part must have be thoroughly glad if wilful seclusion of present life must have be broken by occasional visit of old friend whom have once forbidden house prohibition having passed lip stubbornly refused to do anything might be construed into unsaying jemima be for time in despair of ever returning to office resuming old habit of business have evidently threatened a much to husband that jemima must do be to turn deaf ear to allusion to

chapel in mr benson be minister again a such feeling be natural to men especially to such one a mr bradshaw mr benson instinctively respected passed out of chapel with household without ever directing

amid bunch of rose wo let have flower be afraid said miss benson doctor so often object to smell perhaps not said ruth hurriedly did not think of will only keep one rose here leonard darling gave rest to be farewell for having now veil to hide emotion summoned bravery for one parting smile smiling turned away gave one look back from street just from last point at door must be seen catching glimpse of leonard standing foremost on step ran back met half way mother child spoke never word in close embrace now leonard said miss faith be brave boy feel sure will come back to before very long be very
