failure at least seemed so at time though probably broke ice of restraint be forming over familiar intercourse between kester sylvia old servant be daunted by seeing sylvia in strange place stood

haytersbank old day till bell robson having finished afternoon nap came slowly down stair to join after that conversation became so broken up from desire of other two to attend reply a best must to fragmentary disjointed talk that kester took leave before long falling a did so into formal unnaturally respectful manner have adopted on first coming in sylvia ran after brought back from door think of thy going away kester without bit drink nay come back wi ' thee taste wine cake ' kester stood at door half shy half pleased while sylvia in glow hurry of young housekeeper hospitality sought for decanter of wine wine glass in corner cupboard hastily cut immense wedge of cake crammed into hand in spite of remonstrance then poured out overflowing glass of wine kester must far rather have gone without a knew manner too well to suppose that might taste without having gone through preliminary ceremony of wishing donor health happiness stood red half smiling with cake in one hand wine in other

cake made off that night sylvia spoke of visit to husband philip never said how have brought to pas did name fact that have heard old man come in just a have intended going into parlour for tea have kept away a thought sylvia kester must most enjoy interview undisturbed sylvia felt a if husband silence be unsympathizing shut up feeling be just beginning to expand towards sank again into listless state of indifference from nothing reference to former day present consideration for mother must rouse hester be almost surprised at sylvia evident liking for by slow degree hester be learning to love woman whose position a philip wife must have envied so keenly have not be so truly good pious sylvia seemed a though have given hester whole affection at once hester must not understand while be touched melted by trust implied for one thing sylvia remembered regretted harsh treatment of hester rainy stormy night on latter have come to haytersbank to seek mother bring into monkshaven to see imprisoned father husband sylvia have be struck with hester patient endurance of rudeness rudeness be conscious that must have immediately vehemently resented sylvia did not understand how totally different character from hers might immediately forgive anger must not forget because hester have be so meek at time sylvia who knew how passing transitory be own anger thought that be forgotten while hester believed that word must not have uttered except under deep provocation meant much more than did admired wondered at sylvia for having so entirely conquered anger against again two different woman be divergently affected by extreme fondness bell have shown towards hester ever since sylvia wedding day sylvia who have always received more love from others than knew what to do with most entire faith in own supremacy in mother heart though at time hester must do certain thing more to poor old woman satisfaction hester who have craved for affection have be withheld from have from that one circumstance become distrustful of own power of inspiring regard while exaggerated delight of being beloved feared lest sylvia must become jealous of mother open display of great attachment occasional preference for hester thought never entered sylvia mind be more thankful than knew how to express towards one who made mother happy a have be already said contributing to bell robson pleasure earned philip more of wife smile than anything else sylvia threw whole heart into word caress lavished on hester whenever poor mr robson spoke of goodness kindness of latter hester attributed more virtue to sweet word deed of gratitude than deserved did not imply in sylvia victory over evil temptation a must have done in hester seemed to be sylvia fate to captivate more people than cared to like back again turned head of john jeremiah foster who must hardly congratulate philip enough on choice of wife have be prepared to be critical on one who have interfered with favourite project of marriage between philip hester though full of compassion for cruelty of daniel robson fate be too completely men of business not to have apprehension that connection of philip hepburn with daughter of man who be hanged might injure shop over name appeared possible propriety demanded that must pay attention to bride of former shopman present successor very first visitor whom sylvia have received after marriage have be john jeremiah foster in sabbath day clothes found in parlour so familiar to of clear starching mother cap have to be got up in particular fashion that sylvia be afraid of dictating to phoebe be little disturbed at visitor discovering at employment be on own ground that gave self possession welcomed two old men so sweetly modestly looked so pretty feminine besides so notable in handiwork that conquered prejudice at one blow first thought on leaving shop be how to do honour by inviting to supper party at jeremiah foster house sylvia be dismayed when be bidden to wedding feast philip have to use authority though tenderly to make consent to go at have be to merry country party like corneys to bright haymaking romp in open air never to set stately party at friend house must fain have made attendance on mother excuse philip knew must not listen to such plea applied to hester in dilemma asking to remain with mr robson while sylvia went out visiting hester have willingly nay eagerly consented be much more to taste than going out so philip sylvia set out arm in arm down bridge street across bridge then clambered up hill on way gave direction asked for about behaviour a bride most honoured guest altogether succeeded against intention will in frightening so completely a to grandeur importance of occasion necessity of remembering certain set rule making certain set speech attending to when right time came that if one so naturally graceful must have be awkward sylvia must have be so that night a be sate pale weary looking on very edge of chair uttered formal word philip have told be appropriate to occasion heartily wished safe at home in bed yet left one unanimous impression on company when went away namely that be prettiest best behaved woman have ever seen that philip hepburn have done well in choosing felon daughter though might be host have followed into lobby to help philip in cloaking putting on patten be full of old fashioned compliment good wish one speech of theirs came up to memory in future year sylvia hepburn ' said jeremiah `` ve known thy husband long say what thou hast done well in choosing if ever neglect ill us thee come to will give sound lecture on conduct mind be thy friend from day forrards ready to take thy part against ' philip smiled a if day must never come when must neglect ill use darling sylvia smiled little without much attending to caring for word be detaining tired a be john jeremiah chuckled over joke word came up again in after day a word idly spoken sometimes do before end of first year philip have learnt to be jealous of wife new love for hester to latter sylvia gave free confidence on many thing philip fancied withheld from suspicion crossed mind from time to time sylvia might speak of former lover to hester must be not unnatural thought if did so believing to be dead idea irritated be entirely mistaken however sylvia with apparent frankness kept deep sorrow to herself never mentioned father name though be continually present to mind did speak of kinraid to human being though for sake voice softened when by chance spoke to passing sailor for sake eye lingered on

of watch on bed in lean to have be for many many sleepless tearful night night be over must never see that poor chamber again though be scarce two foot distant began to lose sense of comparative duration of time seemed a long since kind sally dobson have bent over with soft lingering look before going into humble sleeping room a long a be since boyhood when stood by mother dreaming of life must be with scent of cowslip tempting to be off to woodland where grew then there came rush eddying through brain soul trying wing for long flight again be in present heard wave lapping against

light of red morning sun fell on eye with one strong effort rose up turned so a once more to see wife pale face of misery 'in heaven ' cried bright smile came on face a fell back on pillow not long after hester came little bella scarce awake in arm with purpose of bringing child to see ere yet passed away hester have watched prayed through livelong night now found dead sylvia tearless almost unconscious lying by hand holding other thrown around kester poor old man be sobbing bitterly not at then hester bore child to sylvia opened wide miserable eye only stared a if sense be gone from bella suddenly rousing up at sight of poor scarred peaceful face cried out 'poor man who be so hungry be not hungry now 'no said hester softly 'the former thing be passed away be gone where there be more sorrow more pain ' then broke down into weeping cry sylvia sat up looked at 'why do yo cry hester ' said 'yo niver said that yo ' must forgive a long a yo ' lived yo niver broke heart of loved yo
