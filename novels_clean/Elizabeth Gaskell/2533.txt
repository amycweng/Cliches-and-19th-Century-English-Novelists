pierre who liked to contemplate in light of lover even though must be rejected one who hailed mention of word virtue dignity of human race a belonging to cant of good citizen clement be more anxious to know how invisible lady took speech there be sign at time when returned at night heard voice low singing behind madame babette a handed candle very air have sung without effect for two night past a

much of story from friend of intendant of de crequys whom met with in year afterwardsthe summer before lord deathi be travelling with in devonshire went to see french prisoner of war on dartmoor fell into conversation with one of whom found out to be very pierre of whom have heard before a having be involved in fatal story of clement virginie by be told much of last day thus learnt how to have sympathy with who be concerned in terrible event yes even with younger morin on whose behalf pierre spoke warmly even after so long time have elapsed for when younger morin called at porter lodge on evening of day when virginie have gone out for first time after so many month confinement to conciergerie be struck with improvement in appearance seems to have hardly be that thought beauty greater for in addition to fact that be not beautiful morin have arrived at point of being enamoured when doe not signify whether beloved one be plain handsomeshe have enchanted one pair of eye henceforward see through own medium morin noticed faint increase of colour light in countenance be a though have broken through thick cloud of hopeless sorrow be dawning forth into happier life so whereas during grief have revered respected even to point of silent sympathy now that be gladdened heart rose on wing of strengthened hope even in dreary monotony of existence in aunt babettes conciergerie time have not failed in work now perhaps soon might humbly strive to help time very next day returnedon pretence of businessto hotel duguesclin made aunt room rather than aunt present of rose geranium tied up in bouquet with tricolor ribbon virginie be in room sitting at coarse sewing liked to do for madame babette saw eye brighten at sight of flower asked aunt to let arrange saw untie ribbon with gesture of dislike throw on ground give kick with little foot even in girlish manner of insulting dearest prejudice found something to admire a be coming out pierre stopped lad have be trying to arrest cousin attention by futile grimace sign played off behind virginies back monsieur morin saw nothing mademoiselle cannes however pierre be not to be baffled monsieur morin found in waiting just outside threshold with finger on lip pierre walked on tiptoe by companion side till must have be long past sight hearing of conciergerie even have inhabitant devoted to purpose of spying listening chut said pierre at last go out walking well said monsieur morin half curious half annoyed at being disturbed in delicious reverie of future into longed to fall well be not well be bad why ask who be have idea

moment be in close talk head together chuchotting next have turned up bye street mademoiselle cannes be close upon mehas almost caught did not see inquired monsieur morin in so altered voice pierre gave one of quick penetrating look be struck by way in cousin featuresalways coarse common placehad become contracted pinched struck too by livid look on sallow complexion a if morin be conscious of manner in face belied feeling made effort smiled patted pierre head thanked for intelligence gave five franc piece bade go on with observation of mademoiselle cannes movement report to pierre returned home with light heart tossing up five franc piece a ran just a be at conciergerie door great tall man bustled past snatched money away from looking back with laugh added insult to injury pierre have redress no one have witnessed impudent theft if have one to be seen in street be strong enough to give redress besides pierre have seen enough of state of street of paris at time to know friend not enemy be required man have bad air about consideration did not keep pierre from bursting out into fit of cry when be once more under mother roof virginie who be alone there madame babette having gone out to make daily purchase might have imagined pommeled to death by loudness of sob what be matter asked speak child what hast thou done have robbed have robbed be pierre must gulp out robbed thee of what poor boy said virginie stroking hair gently of five franc pieceof five franc piece said pierre correcting leaving out word half fearful lest virginie must inquire how became possessed of such sum for what service have be given of course such idea came into head for must have be impertinent be gentle born wait moment lad going to one small drawer in inner apartment held few possession brought back little ringa ring just with one ruby in itwhich have worn in day when cared to wear jewel take said run with to jeweller be poor valueless thing will bring in five franc at rate go desire can not said boy hesitating dim sense of honour flitting through misty moral yes must continued urging with hand to door run if brings in more than five franc will return surplus to thus tempted by urgency

with ring after repaying five franc be enabled to bring virginie back two more so well have managed affair although whole transaction did not leave bound in way to discover forward virginies wish did leave pledged according to code to act according to advantage considered judge of best course to be pursued to end moreover little kindness attached to personally began to think how pleasant must be to have so kind generous person for relation how easily trouble might be borne if have always such ready helper at hand how much must like to make like come to for protection of masculine power first of duty a self appointed squire came necessity of finding out who strange new acquaintance be thus see arrived at same end via supposed duty that be previously pledged to via interest fancy good number of when line of action will promote own interest can make ourselves believe that reason exist compel to a duty in course of very few day pierre have so circumvented virginie a to have discovered that new friend be other than norman farmer in different dress be great piece of knowledge to impart to morin pierre be not prepared for immediate physical effect have on cousin morin sat suddenly down on one of seat in boulevardsit be there pierre have met with accidentallywhen heard who be that virginie met man have faintest idea of relationship even previous acquaintanceship between clement virginie if thought of anything beyond mere fact presented to that idol be in communication with younger handsomer man than must have be that norman farmer have seen at conciergerie have be attracted by a be natural have tried to make acquaintance have succeeded from what pierre told must not think that even much thought passed through morins mind seems to have be man of rare concentrated attachment violent though restrained undemonstrative passion above capability of jealousy of dark oriental complexion must have be type must fancy that if have married virginie must have coined life blood for luxury to make happy must have watched over petted at sacrifice to a long a must have be content to live with alone a pierre expressed to when saw what cousin be when learned nature too late perceived that must have strangled bird if whom loved be attracted by from when pierre have told morin of discovery morin sat down a said quite suddenly a if have be shot found out that first meeting between norman virginie be accidental isolated circumstance pierre be torturing with account of daily rendezvous if for moment be seeing other day sometimes twice day virginie must speak to man though to be coy reserved a hardly to utter sentence pierre caught broken word while cousin complexion grew more more livid then purple a if great effect be produced on circulation by news have just heard pierre be so startled by cousin wandering senseless eye otherwise disordered look that rushed into neighbouring cabaret for glass of absinthe paid for a recollected afterwards with portion of virginies five franc by by morin recovered natural appearance be gloomy silent pierre must get out of be that norman farmer must not sleep night at hotel duguesclin giving such opportunity of passing repassing by conciergerie door be too much absorbed in own thought to repay pierre half franc have spent on absinthe pierre perceived seems to have noted down in ledger of mind a on virginies balance of favour altogether be much disappointed at cousin mode of receiving intelligence lad thought worth five franc piece at least if not paid for in money to be paid for in open mouthed confidence expression of feeling that be for time so far partisan of virginiesunconscious virginieagainst cousin a to feel regret when norman returned more to night lodging when virginies eager watch at crevice of closely drawn blind ended only with sigh of disappointment if have not be for mother presence at time pierre thought must have told how far be mother in cousin confidence a regarded dismissal of norman in few day however pierre felt almost sure that have established new mean of communication virginie went out for short time day though pierre followed a closely a must without exciting observation be unable to discover what kind of intercourse held with norman went in general same short round among little shop in neighbourhood not entering stopping at two three pierre afterwards remembered that have invariably paused at nosegay displayed in certain window studied long then stopped looked at cap hat fashion confectionery of humble kind common in quarter so how must have known that particular attraction existed among flower morin came more regularly than ever to aunt virginie be apparently unconscious that be attraction looked healthier more hopeful than have done for month manner to be gentler not so reserved almost a if wished to manifest gratitude to madame babette for long continuance of kindness necessity for be nearly ended virginie showed unusual alacrity in rendering old woman little service in power evidently tried to respond to monsieur morins civility being madame babettes nephew with soft graciousness must have made one of principal charm for who knew speak of fascination of manner so winning attentive to others while yet opinion often action be of so decided character for a have said beauty be by mean great yet man who came near seems to have fallen into sphere of influence monsieur morin be deeper than ever in love with during last few day be worked up into state capable of sacrifice of others so that might obtain at last sat devouring with eye to use pierre expression whenever must not see if looked towards looked to groundanywhereaway from almost stammered in reply if addressed question to have be must think ashamed of extreme agitation on boulevard for pierre thought that absolutely shunned for few succeeding day must have believed that have driven norman poor clement off field by banishing from inn thought that intercourse between virginie have thus interrupted be of so slight transient character a to be quenched by little difficulty appears to have felt that have made little way awkwardly turned to pierre for helpnot yet confessing love though only tried to make friend again with lad after silent estrangement pierre for time did not choose to perceive cousin advance must reply to roundabout question morin put to respecting household conversation when be not present household occupation tone of thought without mentioning virginies name more than questioner did lad must seem to suppose that cousin strong interest in domestic way of going on be on account of madame babette at last worked cousin up to point of making confidant then boy be half frightened at torrent of vehement word have unloosed lava came down with greater rush for having be pent up so long morin cried out word in hoarse passionate voice clenched teeth finger seemed almost convulsed a spoke out terrible love for virginie must lead to kill sooner than see anothers if stepped in between herand then smiled fierce triumphant smile did not say more pierre be a said half frightened also half admiring be really lovea grande passiona really fine dramatic thinglike play acted at little theatre yonder have dozen time sympathy with cousin now that have have before readily swore by infernal god for be far too enlightened to believe in one god christianity anything of kindthat must devote body soul to forwarding cousin view then cousin took to shop bought smart second hand watch on scratched word fidelite thus be compact sealed pierre settled in own mind that if be woman must like to be beloved a virginie be by cousin that must be extremely good thing for to be wife of so rich citizen a morin filsand for pierre too for doubtless gratitude must lead to give ring watch ad infinitum day two afterwards virginie be taken ill madame babette said be because have persevered in going out in weather after confining to two warm room for so long very probably be really cause for from pierre account must have be suffering from feverish cold aggravated doubt by impatience at madame babettes familiar prohibition of more walk until be better day in spite of trembling aching limb must fain have arranged dress for walk at usual time madame babette be fully prepared to put physical obstacle in way if be not obedient in remaining tranquil on little sofa by side of fire third day called pierre to when mother be not attending having in fact locked up mademoiselle cannes out of door thing see child said virginie thou must do great favour go to gardener shop in rue de bons enfans look at nosegay in window long for pink be favourite flower here be two franc if thou seest nosegay of pink displayed in window if be ever so fadednay if thou seest two three nosegay of pink remember buy bring to have so great desire for smell fell back weak exhausted pierre hurried out now be time here be clue to long inspection of nosegay in very shop sure enough there be drooping nosegay of pink in window pierre went in with impatience made a good bargain a must urging that flower be faded good for nothing at last purchased at very moderate price now will learn bad consequence of teaching lower order anything beyond what be immediately necessary to enable to earn daily bread silly count de crequyhe who have be sent to bloody rest by very canaille of whom thought so muchhe who have made virginie indirectly be true reject man a cousin clement by inflating mind with bubble of theoriesthis count de crequy have long ago taken fancy to pierre a saw bright sharp child playing about courtmonsieur de crequy have even begun to educate boy to try work out certain opinion of into practicebut drudgery of affair wearied beside babette have left employment still count took kind of interest in former pupil made sort of arrangement by pierre be to be taught reading writing account heaven know what

nosegay examine well stalk of flower be tied up with slip of matting in wet moss pierre undid string unwrapped moss out fell piece of wet paper with writing blurred with moisture be torn piece of writing paper apparently pierre wicked mischievous eye read what be written on itwritten so a to look like fragmentready night at nine be prepared have fright trust one who hope might once have have be content now to serve a faithful cousin place be named forget pierre did not a be evidently rendezvous after lad have studied word till must say off by heart placed paper where have found enveloped in moss tied whole up again carefully virginies face coloured scarlet a received kept smelling at trembling did not untie although pierre suggested how much fresher must be if stalk be immediately put into water once after back have be turned for minute saw untied when looked round again virginie be blushing hiding something in bosom pierre be now impatience to set off find cousin mother seemed to want for small domestic purpose even more than usual have chafed over multitude of errand connected with hotel before must set off search for cousin at usual haunt at last two met pierre related event of morning to morin said note off word by word that lad morning have something of magpie look of pierreit made shudder to see hear repeat note by heart then morin asked to tell over again pierre be struck by morins heavy sigh a repeated story when came second time to note morin tried to write word down be not good ready scholar finger trembled too much pierre hardly remembered at rate lad have to do with wicked reading writing when be done morin sat heavily silent pierre must have preferred expected outburst for impenetrable gloom perplexed baffled have even to speak to cousin to rouse when replied what said have so little apparent connection with subject pierre have expected to find uppermost in mind that be half afraid that cousin have lost wit aunt babette be out of coffee be sure know said pierre yes be heard say so tell that friend of mine have just opened shop in rue saint antoine that if will join there in hour will supply with good stock of coffee just to give friend encouragement name be antoine meyer number one hundred fifty at sign of cap of liberty must go with now can carry few pound of coffee better than mother said pierre in good faith told must never forget look on cousin face a turned round bade begone give mother message without word have evidently sent home promptly to obey cousin command morins message perplexed madame babette how must know be out of coffee said be only used last up morning how must victor know about be sure cant tell said pierre who by time have recovered usual self possession know be that monsieur be in pretty temper that if be not sharp to time at antoine meyers be likely to come in for of black look well be very kind of to offer to give coffee to be sure how must know be out pierre hurried mother off impatiently for be certain that offer of coffee be only blind to hidden purpose on cousin part made doubt that when mother have be informed of what cousin real intention be pierre must extract from by coaxing bullying be mistaken madame babette returned home grave depressed silent loaded with best coffee time afterwards learnt why cousin have sought for interview be to extract from by promise threat real name of mamselle cannes must give clue to true appellation of faithful cousin concealed second purpose from aunt who have be quite unaware of jealousy of norman farmer of identification of with relation of virginies madame babette instinctively shrank from giving information must have felt that in lowering mood in found desire for greater knowledge of virginies antecedent boded good yet made aunt confidantetold what have only suspected beforethat be deeply enamoured of mamselle cannes must gladly marry spoke to madame babette of father hoarded rich of share a partner have in at present time of prospect of succession to whole have a only child told aunt of provision for madame babettes life must make on day when married mamselle cannes yetand yetbabette saw that in eye look made more

medlicott can decide upon in way of strengthening dainty for poor young man who be killing with over sensitive conscientiousness oh lady said then stopped well what asked if must let have farmer hale barn at once must do more good than pooh pooh child though dont think be displeased be not fit for more work just now will go write for dr trevor for next half hour did nothing arrange physical comfort cure for poor mr gray at end of time mr medlicott said have ladyship heard harry gregson have fallen from tree broken thigh bone be like to be cripple for life harry gregson black eyed lad who read letter come from over education chapter xi dont see how lady must think be over education that made harry gregson break thigh for manner in met with accident be mr horner who have fallen sadly out of health since wife death have attached greatly to harry gregson now mr horner have cold manner to one never spoke more than be necessary at best of time latterly have not be best of time with dare say have have cause for anxiety of knew nothing about lady affair be evidently annoyed by lady whim a once inadvertently called of placing miss galindo under in position of clerk yet have always be friend in quiet way with miss galindo devoted to new occupation with diligence punctuality although more than once have moaned to over order for needlework have be sent to owing to occupation in service of lady ludlow have be unable to fulfil only living creature to whom staid mr horner must be said to be attached be harry gregson to lady be faithful devoted servant looking keenly after interest anxious to forward at cost of trouble to more shrewd mr horner be more probability be there of being annoyed at certain peculiarity of opinion lady held with quiet gentle pertinacity against argument based on mere worldly business calculation made way frequent opposition to view mr horner entertained although did not interfere with sincere respect lady steward felt for other yet prevented warmer feeling of affection from coming in seems strange to say must repeat itthe only person for whom since wife death mr horner seemed to feel love be little imp harry gregson with bright watchful eye tangled hair hanging right down to eyebrow for world like skye terrier lad half gipsy whole poacher a many people esteemed hung about silent respectable staid mr horner followed step with something of affectionate fidelity of dog resembled suspect demonstration of attachment to person on harry gregsons part be what won mr horners regard in first instance steward have only chosen lad out a cleverest instrument must find for purpose dont mean to say that if harry have not be almost a shrewd a mr horner be both by original disposition subsequent experience steward must have taken to a did let lad have shown ever so much affection for even to harry mr horner be silent still be pleasant to find in many way so readily understood to perceive that crumb of knowledge let fall be picked up by little follower hoarded like gold that here be one to hate person thing whom mr horner coldly disliked to reverence admire for whom have regard mr horner have never have child unconsciously suppose something of paternal feeling have begun to develop in towards harry gregson heard one two thing from different people have always made fancy that mr horner secretly almost unconsciously hoped that harry gregson might be trained so a to be first clerk next assistant finally successor in stewardship to hanbury estate harrys disgrace with lady in consequence of reading letter be deeper blow to mr horner than quiet manner must ever have led one to suppose than lady ludlow ever dreamed of inflicting be sure probably harry have short stern rebuke from mr horner at time for manner be always hard even to cared for most harrys love be not to be daunted quelled by few sharp word dare say from what heard of afterwards that harry accompanied mr horner in walk over farm very day of rebuke presence apparently unnoticed by agent by whom absence must have be painfully felt nevertheless be way of a have be told mr horner never bade harry go with never thanked for going being at heel ready to run on errand straight a crow fly to point back to heel in a short time a possible yet if harry be away mr horner never inquired reason from of men who might be supposed to know whether be detained by father otherwise engaged never asked harry where have be miss galindo said that labourer who knew mr horner well told that be always more quick eyed to shortcoming more savage like in fault finding on day when lad be absent miss galindo indeed be great authority for most of village news heard be who gave particular of poor harrys accident see dear said little poacher have taken unaccountable fancy to master be name by miss galindo always spoke of mr horner to ever since have be a called appointed clerk now if have twenty heart to lose never must spare bit of one of for good gray square

on lady not hour before exertion on harrys behalf told miss galindo how ill have thought yes said be reason lady have sent for doctor trevor well have fallen out admirably for looked well after old donkey of prince saw that made blunder now that old donkey of prince meant village surgeon mr prince between whom miss galindo there be war to knife a often met in cottage when there be illness have queer odd recipe with grand pharmacopoeia held in infinite contempt consequence of squabbling have be not long before very time that have established kind of rule that into sick room miss galindo be admitted there refused to visit miss galindos prescription visit cost nothing be often backed by kitchen physic so though be true that never came scolded about something other be generally preferred a medical attendant to mr prince yes old donkey be obliged to tolerate be civil to for see got there first have possession a be yet lord donkey like credit of attending parson being in consultation with so grand county town doctor a doctor trevor doctor trevor be old friend of mine sighed little time may tell why treat with infinite bowing respect so donkey not to be out of medical fashion bow too though be sadly against grain pulled face a if have heard slate pencil gritting against slate when told doctor trevor meant to sit up with two lad for call mr gray little more than lad pretty conceited one too at time why must sit up miss galindo will tire sadly not see there be gregsons mother to keep quiet for sits by lad fretting sobbing so that im afraid of disturbing mr gray there mr

in from showing too much gratitude to mr gray who cant hear itand who be to do only servant be old lame betty who once lived with must leave because said be always botheringthere be good deal of truth in what said grant need not have said good deal of truth be best let alone at bottom of well what can dodeaf a ever can be too so miss galindo went way not le be at post in morning little crosser more silent than usual first be not to be wondered at last be rather blessing lady ludlow have be extremely anxious about mr gray harry gregson kind thoughtful in case of illness accident always be somehow in feeling that be not quitewhat will call itfriends seems hardly right word to use a to possible feeling between countess ludlow little vagabond messenger who have only once be in presencethat have hardly parted from a must have wished to do have death be near made more than usually anxious doctor trevor be not to spare obtaining best medical advice county must afford ordered in way of diet be to be prepared under mr medlicotts own eye sent down from hall to parsonage a mr horner have given somewhat similar direction in case of harry gregson at least there be rather multiplicity of counsellor dainty than lack of second night mr horner insisted on taking superintendence of nursing sat snored by harrys bedside while poor exhausted mother lay by childthinking that watched in reality fast asleep a miss galindo told for distrusting one power of watching nursing own have stolen across quiet village street in cloak dressing gown found mr gray in vain trying to reach cup of barley water mr horner have placed just beyond reach in consequence of mr gray illness have to have strange curate to do duty man who dropped h hurried through service yet have time enough to stand in lady way bowing to a came out of church so subservient in manner that believe that sooner than remain unnoticed by countess must have preferred being scolded even cuffed now found out that great a be lady liking approval of respect nay even reverence being paid to a person of qualitya sort of tribute to order have individual right to remit indeed not to exactyet being personally simple sincere holding in low esteem must not endure anything like servility of mr crosse temporary curate grew absolutely to loathe perpetual smiling bowing instant agreement with slightest opinion uttered veering round a blew wind have often said that lady did not talk much a might have done have lived among equal loved so much that have learnt to interpret little way pretty truly knew what particular turn of head contraction of delicate finger meant a well a if have expressed in word began to suspect that lady must be very thankful to have mr gray about again doing duty even with conscientiousness might amount to worrying fidgeting others although mr gray might hold opinion in a little esteem a of simple gentlewoman be too sensible not to feel how much flavour there be in conversation compared to of mr crosse who be only tasteless echo a for miss galindo be utterly entirely partisan of mr gray almost ever since have begun to nurse during illness know never set up for reasonableness lady so dont pretend to say a might do if be sensible woman thatthat be convinced by mr gray argument of thing tother for one thing see poor fellow have never be able to argue hardly indeed to speak for doctor

forgiven for having neglected work a parish priest miss galindo be making horrible face to keep back tear squeezing up eye in way must have amused at other time when be speaking of mr gray when see

with mr gray well said lady told only last day that be here that must think about do believe must make up mind on certain subject better if be left alone than while being constantly talked to about lady said in usual soft tone word have tinge of impatience about indeed be more ruffled than have often seen checking in instant said dont know how mr horner drag in subject of education apropos of everything not that say much about at time be not way can not let thing alone know why lady said miss galindo poor lad harry gregson will never be able to earn livelihood in active way will be lame for life now mr horner think more of harry than of one else in worldexcept perhaps ladyship be not pretty companionship for lady have scheme of own for teaching harry if mr gray must have school mr horner think harry might be schoolmaster a ladyship must not like to have coming to a steward clerk wish ladyship must fall into plan mr gray have so at heart miss galindo looked wistfully at lady a said lady only said drily rising at same time a if to end conversation so mr horner mr gray seem to have gone long way in advance of consent to plan there exclaimed miss galindo a lady left room with apology for going away have gone done mischief with long stupid tongue to be sure people plan long way ahead of to day more especially when one be sick man lying through weary day on sofa lady will soon get over annoyance said a be apologetically only stopped miss galindos self reproach to draw down wrath upon have not right to be annoyed with if like to keep annoyed a long a like be complaining of that need tell that let tell have known lady thirty year if be to take by shoulder turn out of house must only love more so dont think to come between with little mincing peace making speech have be mischief making parrot like better for being vexed with so good bye to miss wait till know lady ludlow a well a do before next think of telling will soon get over annoyance off miss galindo went must not exactly tell what have done wrong took care never again to come in between lady by remark about one to other for saw that most powerful bond of grateful affection made miss galindo almost worship lady meanwhile harry gregson be limping little about in village still finding home in mr gray house for there must most conveniently be kept under doctor eye receive requisite care enjoy requisite nourishment a soon a be little better be to go to mr horners house a steward lived distance out of way be much from home have agreed to leave harry at house to have first be taken until be quite strong again more willingly suspect from what heard afterwards because mr gray gave up little strength of speaking have to teaching harry in very manner mr horner most desired a for gregson fatherhewild man of wood tinker jack of tradeswas getting tamed by kindness to child hitherto hand have be against man a man have be against affair before justice told about when mr gray even lady

self distrustful parson gregson have also kind of grumbling respect for mr horner did not quite like steward monopoly of harry mother submitted to that with better grace swallowing down maternal jealousy in prospect of child advancement to better more respectable position than in parent have struggled through life mr horner steward gregson poacher squatter have come into disagreeable contact too often in former day for to be perfectly cordial at future time even now when there be immediate cause for anything gratitude for child sake on gregsons part must skulk out of mr horners way if saw coming took mr horners natural reserve acquired restraint to keep from occasionally holding up father life a warning to harry now gregson have nothing of desire for avoidance with regard to mr gray poacher have feeling of physical protection towards parson while latter have shown moral courage without gregson must never have respected in coming right down upon more than once in exercise of unlawful pursuit simply boldly telling be doing wrong with quiet reliance upon gregsons better feeling at same time that strong poacher must not have lifted finger against mr gray though have be to save from being apprehended taken to lock ups very next hour have rather listened to parson bold word with approving smile much a mr gulliver might have hearkened to lecture from lilliputian when

sobbing over bible using pocket handkerchief for first time in life apron having hitherto stood in necessary stead not being sufficiently in accordance with etiquette to be used when mourning over earl premature decease if be way out of hall might work by rule of three a miss galindo used to say judge what be in hall none of spoke in whisper tried not to eat indeed shock have be so really great did really care so much for lady that for day have little appetite after fear sympathy grew weaker while flesh grew stronger still spoke low heart ached whenever thought of lady sitting there alone in darkened room with light ever falling on one solemn page wished how wished that must see mr gray adam said thought lady ought to have bishop come to see still one have authority enough to send for one mr horner time be suffering a much a one be too faithful servant of great hanbury family though now family have dwindled down to fragile old lady not to mourn acutely over probable extinction have besides deeper sympathy reverence with for lady in thing than probably ever cared to show for manner be always measured cold suffered from sorrow also suffered from wrong lord executor kept writing to continually lady refused to listen to mere business saying intrusted to be more complicated than ever thoroughly understood a far a comprehended case be something of kindthere have be mortgage raised on lady property of hanbury to enable lord husband to spend money in cultivating scotch estate after new fashion required capital a long a lord son lived who be to succeed to estate after death did not signify so have said felt have refused to take step to secure repayment of capital even payment of interest of mortgage from possible representative possessor of scotch estate to possible owner of hanbury property saying ill became to calculate on contingency of son death have died childless unmarried heir of monkshaven property be edinburgh advocate far away kinsman of lord hanbury property at lady death must go to descendant of third son of squire hanbury in day of queen anne complication of affair be most grievous to mr horner have always be opposed to mortgage have hated payment of interest a obliging lady to practise certain economy though took care to make a personal a possible disliked a derogatory to family poor mr horner be so cold hard in manner so curt decisive in speech that dont think of did justice miss galindo be almost first at time to speak kind word of to take thought of at farther than to get out of way when saw approaching dont think mr horner be well said one day about three week after have heard of lord death sits resting head on hand hardly hears when speak to thought more of a miss galindo did not name again lady came amongst once more from elderly have become old little frail old lady in heavy black drapery never speaking about alluding to great sorrow quieter gentler paler than ever before eye dim with much weeping never witnessed by mortal have seen mr gray at expiration of month of deep retirement think that even to have said one word of own particular individual sorrow mention of seemed buried deep for evermore one day mr horner sent word that be too much indisposed to attend to usual business at hall wrote down direction request to miss galindo saying that must be at office early next morning next morning be dead miss galindo told lady miss galindo cried plentifully lady although very much distressed must not cry seemed physical impossibility a if have shed tear in power moreover almost think wonder be far greater that lived than mr horner died be almost natural that so faithful servant must break heart when family belonged to lost stay heir last hope yes mr horner be faithful servant think there be many so faithful now perhaps be old woman fancy of mine when will came to be examined be discovered that soon after harry gregsons accident mr horner have left few thousand three think of be possessed in trust for harrys benefit desiring executor to see that lad be well educated in certain thing for mr horner have thought that have shown especial aptitude there be kind of implied apology to lady in one sentence where stated that harrys lameness must prevent being ever able to gain living by exercise of mere bodily faculty a have be wished by lady whose wish testator be bound to regard there be codicil in will dated since lord ludlows deathfeebly written by mr horner a if in preparation only for more formal manner of bequest perhaps only a mere temporary arrangement till must see lawyer have fresh will made in revoked previous bequest to harry gregson only left two hundred pound to mr gray to be used a gentleman thought best for henry gregsons benefit with one exception bequeathed rest of saving to lady with hope that might form nest egg a be towards paying off of mortgage have be grief to during life may not repeat in lawyer phrase heard through miss galindo might make mistake though indeed be very clear headed soon earned respect of mr smithson lady lawyer from warwick mr smithson knew miss galindo little before personally by reputation dont think be prepared to find installed a steward clerk at first be inclined to treat in capacity with polite contempt miss galindo be lady spirited sensible woman must put aside self indulgence in eccentricity of speech manner whenever chose nay

spoken unasked so have buried more sense in bosom ten day than ever have uttered in whole course of life before have be so curt so abrupt so abominably dull ill answer for think worthy to be man must go back to dear so good bye to conversation though mr smithson might be satisfied with miss galindo be afraid be only part of affair with be content everything else went wrong must not say who told sobut conviction of seemed to pervade house never knew how much have looked up to silent gruff mr horner for decision until be gone lady be pretty good woman of business a woman of business go father seeing that must be heiress of hanbury property have given training be thought unusual in day liked to feel queen regnant to have to decide in case between herself tenantry perhaps mr horner must have done more wisely not what always attended to at last must begin by saying pretty clearly promptly what must have done what must not have done if mr horner approved of bowed set about obeying directly if disapproved of bowed lingered so long before obeyed that forced opinion out of with well mr horner what have to say against for always understood silence a well a if have spoken estate be pressed for ready money mr horner have grown gloomy languid since death of wife even own personal affair be not in order in have be year two before for old clerk have gradually become superannuated at rate unable by superfluity of own energy wit to supply spirit be wanting in mr horner day after day mr smithson seemed to grow more fidgety more annoyed at state of affair like one else employed by lady

smithson ever since be very sorry for lady mr smithson be inclined to blame mr horner for disorderly state in found of outlying farm for deficiency in annual payment of rent mr smithson have too much good feeling to put blame into word lady quick instinct led to reply to thought existence of perceived quietly told truth explained how have interfered repeatedly to prevent mr horner from taking certain desirable step be discordant to hereditary sense of right wrong between landlord tenant also spoke of want of ready money a misfortune must be remedied by more economical personal expenditure on own part by individual saving be possible that reduction of fifty pound year might have be accomplished a soon a mr smithson touched on larger economy such a affected welfare of others honour standing of great house of hanbury be inflexible establishment consisted of somewhere about forty servant of whom nearly a many a twenty be unable to perform work properly yet must have be hurt if have be dismissed so have credit of fulfilling duty while lady paid kept substitute mr smithson made calculation must have saved hundred year by pensioning off old servant lady must not hear of then again know privately that urged to allow of to return to home bitterly must have regretted separation from lady ludlow must have gone back gladly have known at time that circumstance required must not

have remarkable practical talent great common sense a hear from one may be affair rest between can only say will esteem fortunate if come there be more to be said after lady spoke in manner have heard mention captain james before a middy who have be very kind to son urian thought remembered then that have mentioned that family circumstance be not very prosperous confess little a knew of management of land quite sided with mr smithson silently prohibited from again speaking to lady on subject opened mind to miss galindo from whom be pretty sure to hear opinion news of household village have

so much talked about that be a curious a possible to see to know how so unusual experiment a seemed to must answer before tell anything about new agent must speak of something quite a interesting really think quite a important be lady making friend with harry gregson do believe did for mr horners sake of course can only conjecture why lady did anything heard one day from mary legard that lady have sent for harry to come see if be well enough to walk so far next day be shown into room have be in once before under such unlucky circumstance lad looked pale enough a stood propping up on crutch instant lady saw bade john footman place stool for to sit down upon while spoke to might be paleness gave whole face more refined gentle look suspect be that boy be apt to take impression mr horners grave dignified way mr gray tender quiet manner have altered then thought of illness death seem to turn many of into gentleman gentlewoman a long a such thought be in mind can not speak loudly angrily at such time be not apt to be eager about mere worldly thing for very awe at quickened sense of nearness of invisible world make calm serene about petty trifle of to day at least know be explanation mr gray once gave of what thought great improvement in harry gregsons way of behaving lady hesitated so long about what have best say that harry grew little frightened at silence few month ago must have surprised more than did now since lord son death have seemed altered in many waysmore uncertain distrustful of a be at last said think tear be in eye poor little fellow have have narrow escape with life since saw last to there be nothing to be said yes again there be silence have lost good kind friend in mr horner boy lip worked think said please dont cant be sure at rate lady went on so

have with exception of legacy to old clerk morrison knew that estateon forefather have lived for six hundred yearswas in debt have immediate chance of paying off debt yet felt that be very sad thing for old property like to belong in part to other men who have lent money understand think little man said questioning harrys face have left off cry be trying to understand with might main think have got pretty good general idea of state of affair though probably be puzzled by term estate being in debt be sufficiently interested to want lady to go on nodded head at to signify to so mr horner took money once meant to be yours have left greater part of to with intention of helping to pay off debt have told about will go long way will try hard to save rest then will die happy in leaving land free from debt paused will not die happy in thinking of know if having money even having great estate much honour be good thing for of god see fit that of must be called to condition be duty then to stand by post like brave soldier now mr horner intended to have money first will only call borrowing from harry gregson if take use to pay off debt will pay mr gray interest on money because be to stand a guardian a be till come of age must fix what ought to be done with so a to fit for spending principal rightly when estate can repay suppose now will be right for to be educated will be snare will come with money have courage harry education money may be used rightly if only pray against temptation bring with harry must make answer though be sure understood lady wanted to get to talk to little by

like to take so bold step a bringing home knowing what effect of consequent explanation must be on lady a girl be now more than seventeen past age when young lady be usually kept at school a there be great demand for governess in day a bessy have never be taught trade by to earn own living why dont exactly see what must have be done for miss galindo to bring to own home in hanbury for although

stately piece of intelligenceand there be miss galindo in day missed much so did lady be sure behind quiet sedate manner be certain heart ached sometimes for few word from miss galindo who seemed to have absented altogether from hall now bessy be come captain james might be very sensible not even lady must call substitute for old familiar friend be thorough sailor a sailor be in daysswore good deal drank good deal without ever affecting in least be very prompt kind hearted in action be not accustomed to woman a lady once said must judge in thing for lady have expected think to find one who must take notion on management of estate from ladyship own self spoke a if be responsible for good management of whole must consequently be allowed full liberty of action have be too long in command over men at sea to like to be directed by woman in anything undertook even though woman be lady suppose be common sense lady spoke of when common sense go against dont think value quite so much a ought to do lady ludlow be proud of personal superintendence of own estate liked to tell how father used to take with in ride bid observe on account to allow such such thing to be done have heard that first time told to captain james told point blank that have heard from mr smithson that farm be much neglected rent sadly behindhand that meant to set to in good earnest study agriculture see how must remedy state of thing lady must be sure be greatly surprised what must do here be very man have chosen setting to with energy to conquer defect of ignorance be that who have presumed to offer ladyship advice have ever have to say against captain james read arthur young tour in spare time a long a be invalid shook head at lady account a to how land have be cropped left fallow from time immemorial then set to tried too many new experiment at once lady looked on in dignified silence farmer tenant be in uproar prophesied hundred failure perhaps fifty did occur be only half a many a lady ludlow have feared be twice a many four eight time a many a captain have anticipated openly expressed disappointment made popular again rough country people must not have understood silent dignified regret at failure of plan sympathized with man who swore at ill successsympathized even while chuckled over discomfiture mr brooke retired tradesman did not cease blaming for not succeeding for swearing what must expect from sailor mr brooke asked even in lady hearing though might have known captain james be lady own personal choice from old friendship mr urian have always shown for think be speech of birmingham baker made lady determine to stand by captain james encourage to try again for must not allow that choice have be unwise one at bidding a be of dissenting tradesman only person in neighbourhood too who have flaunted about in coloured clothes when world be in mourning for lady only son captain james must have thrown agency up at once if lady have not felt bound to justify wisdom of choice by urging to stay be much touched by confidence in swore great oath that next year must make land such a have never be before for produce be not lady way to repeat anything have heard especially to person disadvantage so dont think ever told captain james of mr brooke speech about sailor being likely to mismanage property captain be too anxious to succeed in second year of trial to be above going to flourishing shrewd mr brooke asking for advice a to best method of working estate dare say if miss galindo have be a intimate a formerly at hall must of have heard of new acquaintance of agent long before did a be be sure lady never dreamed that captain who held opinion be even more church king than own must ever have made friend with baptist baker from birmingham even to serve ladyship own interest in most loyal manner heard of first from mr gray who came now often to see lady for must forget solemn tie fact of being person to acquaint with lord death have created between for true holy word spoken at time though having reference to aught below solemn subject of life death have made withdraw opposition to mr gray wish about establishing village school have sighed little be true be even yet more apprehensive than hopeful a to result almost a if a memorial to lord have allowed kind of rough school house to be built on green just by church have gently used power undoubtedly have in expressing strong wish that boy might only be taught to read write first four rule of arithmetic while girl be only to learn to read to add up in head rest of time to work at mending own clothes knitting stocking spinning lady presented school with more spinning wheel than there be girl requested that there might be rule that must have spun so many hank of flax knitted so many pair of stocking before ever be taught to read at after be making best of bad job with poor ladybut life be not what have be to remember well day that mr gray pulled delicately fine yarn be good judge of thing out of pocket laid capital pair of knitted stocking before lady a first fruit so to say of school recollect seeing put on spectacle carefully examine production then passed to be well mr gray be much pleased be fortunate in schoolmistress have have proper knowledge of womanly thing much patience who be one out of village lady said mr gray stammering colouring in old fashion miss bessy be so very kind a to teach sort of thingsmiss bessy miss galindo sometimes lady looked at over spectacle only repeated word miss bessy paused a if trying to remember who person must be if have then intended to say more be quelled by manner dropped subject went on to say that have thought duty to decline subscription to school offered by mr brooke because be dissenter that mr gray feared that captain james through whom mr brooke offer of money have be made be offended at refusing to accept from man who held heterodox opinion nay whom mr gray suspected of being infected by dodwells heresy think there must be mistake said lady have misunderstood captain james must never be sufficiently with schismatic to be employed by man brooke in distributing charity must have doubted until now if captain james knew indeed lady not only know be intimate with regret to say have repeatedly seen captain mr brooke walking together going through field together people do say lady looked up in interrogation at mr gray pause disapprove of gossip may be untrue people do say that captain james be very attentive to miss brooke impossible said lady indignantly captain james be loyal religious man beg pardon mr gray be impossible chapter xiv like many other thing have be declared to be impossible report of captain james being attentive to miss brooke turned out to be very true mere idea of agent being on slightest possible term of acquaintance with dissenter tradesman birmingham democrat who have come to settle in good orthodox aristocratic agricultural hanbury made lady very uneasy miss galindos misdemeanour in having taken miss bessy to live with faded into mistake mere error of judgment in comparison with captain james intimacy at yeast house a brooke called ugly square built farm lady talked quite into complacency with miss galindo even miss bessy be named by first time have ever be aware that lady recognized existence buti recollect be long rainy afternoon sat with ladyship have time opportunity for long uninterrupted talkwhenever have be silent for little while began again with something like wonder how be that captain james must ever have commenced acquaintance with man brooke lady recapitulated time must remember that anything have occurred be said by captain james must now understand a throwing light upon subject said once that be anxious to bring in norfolk system of cropping spoke good deal about mr coke of holkham who by way be more coke than amcollateral in female linewhich count for little nothing among great old commoner family of pure blood new way of cultivation of course new men bring in new way doe not follow that be better than old way however captain james have be very anxious to try turnip bone manure really be man of such good sense energy be so sorry last year about failure consented now begin to see error have always heard that town baker adulterate flour with bone dust of course captain james must be aware of go to brooke to inquire where article be to be purchased lady always ignored fact have sometimes suspect be brought under very eye during drive that mr brooke few field be in state of far higher cultivation than own so must not of course perceive that there be wisdom to be gained from asking advice of tradesman turned farmer by by fact of agent intimacy with person whom in whole world most disliked with sort of dislike in large amount of uncomfortableness be combinedthe dislike conscientious people sometimes feel to without knowing why yet can not indulge in with comfort to without having moral reason why came before lady in many shape for indeed be sure that captain james be not man to conceal be ashamed of one of action can not fancy ever lowering strong loud clear voice having confidental conversation with one when crop have failed village have known complained regretted be angry owned fool down village street consequence be that although be far more passionate man than mr horner tenant liked far better people in general take kindlier interest in one working of whose mind heart can watch understand than in man who only let know what have be thinking about feeling by what doe harry gregson be faithful to memory of mr horner miss galindo have told that used to watch hobble out of way of captain james a if to accept notice however good naturedly given must have be kind of treachery to former benefactor gregson father new agent rather took to other one day much to surprise heard that poaching tinkering vagabond a people used to call gregson when first have come to live at hanbury have be appointed gamekeeper mr gray standing godfather a be to trustworthiness if be trusted with anything thought at time be rather experiment only answered a many of mr gray deed of daring did be curious how be growing to be kind of autocrat in village how unconscious be of be a shy awkward nervous a ever in affair be not of moral consequence to a soon a be convinced that thing be right shut eye ran butted at like ram a captain james once expressed in talking over something mr gray have done people in village said never knew what parson must be at next might have said where reverence must next turn up for have heard of marching right into middle of set of poacher gathered together for desperate midnight enterprise walking into public house that lay just beyond bound of lady estate in extra parochial piece of ground named long ago be considered rendezvous of neer do weel character for mile round where parson constable be held in much same kind of esteem a unwelcome visitor yet mr gray have long fit of depression in felt a if be doing nothing making way in work useless unprofitable better out of world than in in comparison with work have set to do what did seemed to be nothing suppose be constitutional attack of lowness of spirit have about time perhaps part of nervousness made always so awkward when came to hall even mr medlicott who almost worshipped ground trod on a saying be owned that mr gray never entered one of lady room without knocking down something too often breaking must much sooner have faced desperate poacher than young lady day at least so thought know how be that came to pas that lady became reconciled to miss galindo about time whether be that ladyship be weary of unspoken coolness with old friend that specimen of delicate sewing fine spinning at school have mollified towards miss bessy be surprised to learn one day miss galindo young friend be coming very evening to tea at hall information be given by mr medlicott a message from lady who further went on to desire certain little preparation must be made in own private sitting room in greater part of day be spent from nature of preparation became quite aware that lady intended to do honour to expected visitor indeed lady ludlow never forgave by half a have known people do be coming a visitor to lady peeress poor nameless girl there be certain amount of preparation required in order to do fitting honour mean to say that preparation be of same degree of importance in case dare say if peeress have come to visit at hall cover must have be taken off furniture in white drawing room never be uncovered time stayed at hall because lady must wish to offer ornament luxury grand visitor who never camei wish have did so want to see furniture uncovered be accustomed to at home to present to in best order in lady must same rule mollified held good with miss galindo certain thing in lady knew took interest be laid out ready for to examine on very day what be more great book of print be laid out such a remembered lady have have brought forth to beguile own early day of illnessmr hogarth work likewhich be sure be put out for miss bessy one know how curious be to see mysterious miss bessytwenty time more mysterious of course for want of surname then again to try account for great curiosity of in recollection be more than half ashamed have be leading quiet monotonous life of crippled invalid for many yearsshut up from sight of new face be to be face of one whom have thought about so much so longoh think might be excused of course drank tea in great hall with four young gentlewoman who with formed small bevy now under ladyship charge of who be at hanbury when first came none remained be married gone once more to live at home must be called own whether ostensible head be father brother be not without hope of similar kind brother harry be now curate in westmoreland wanted to go live with a eventually did for time be neither here there at present what be talking about be miss bessy after reasonable time have elapsed occupied a well knew by meal in great hallthe measured yet agreeable conversation afterwardsand certain promenade around hall through drawing room with pause before different picture history subject of of be invariably told by lady to new visitora sort of giving freedom of old family seat by describing kind nature of great progenitor who have lived there before narratori heard step approaching lady room where lay think be in such state of nervous expectation that if must have moved easily must have got up run away yet need not have be for miss galindo be not in least altered nose little redder to be sure then might only have have temporary cause in private cry know must have have before coming to see dear lady ludlow once again must almost have pushed miss galindo away a intercepted in view of mysterious miss bessy miss bessy be a knew only about eighteen looked older dark hair dark eye tall firm figure good sensible face with serene expression not in least disturbed by what have be thinking must be such awful circumstance a first introduction to lady who have so disapproved of very existence be clearest impression remember of first interview with miss bessy seemed to observe in quiet manner quite a much a did spoke very little occupied indeed a lady have planned with looking over great book of engraving think must have foolishly intended to make feel at ease by patronage be seated far away from sofa in order to command light really seemed so unconcerned at unwonted circumstance that did not need countenance kindness one thing did likeher watchful look at miss galindo from time to time showed that thought sympathy be ever at miss galindos service a indeed well might be when miss bessy spoke voice be full clear what said to purpose though there be slight provincial accent in way of speaking after while lady set two to play at chess game have lately learnt at mr gray suggestion still did not talk much together though be becoming attracted towards other fancy will play well said have only learnt about six month have yet can nearly beat who have be at a many year began to learn last november remember mr gray bringing philidor on chess one very foggy dismal day what made look up so suddenly with bright inquiry in eye what made silent for moment a if in thought then go on with something know not what in quite altered tone lady miss galindo went on talking while sat thinking heard captain james name mentioned pretty frequently at last lady put down work said almost with tear in eye must noti can not believe must be aware be schismatic baker daughter be gentleman by virtue feeling a well a by profession though manner may be at time little rough dear miss galindo what will world come to miss galindo might possibly be aware of own share in bringing world to pas now dismayed ladyfor of course though be now over forgiven yet miss bessys being received into respectable maiden lady house be one of portent a to world future alarmed ladyship miss galindo knew thisbut at rate have too lately be forgiven not to plead for mercy for next offender against lady delicate sense of fitness proprietyso replied indeed lady have long left off trying to conjecture what make jack fancy gill gill jack best to sit down quiet under belief that marriage be made for somewhere out of world out of range of world reason law im not so sure must settle down that be made in heaven tother place seems to a likely workshop at rate ive given up troubling head a to

lady after moment pause for consideration although be baker might have be churchman even eloquence miss galindo shant convince that be not own fault dont see even that begging pardon lady said miss galindo emboldened by first success of eloquence when baptist be baby if understand creed aright be not baptized consequently can have godfather godmother to do anything for in baptism agree to lady

for farm belonged of right to willie susan have succeeded to guardianship of brother michael be to be married a soon a be strong enoughso perhaps authoritative manner be justified labourer did not like although said little remembered stripling on farm knowing far le than did often glad to shelter ignorance of agricultural matter behind superior knowledge must have taken order from susan with far more willingness nay willie might have commanded from old hereditary feeling toward owner of land must have obeyed with far greater cordiality than now showed to michael susan be tired with even three round of knitting seemed not to notice to care how thing went on around williepoor williethere stood lounging against door sill enormously grown developed to be sure with restless eye ever open mouth now then setting up strange kind of howling cry then smiling vacantly to at sound have made a two old labourer passed looked at other ominously shook head willie darling said susan dont make noiseit make head ache spoke feebly willie did not seem to hear at rate continued howl from time to time hold thy noise wilta said michael roughly a passed near threatening with fist susans back be turned to pair expression of willies face changed from vacancy to fear came shambling up to susan who put arm round a if protected by shelter began making face at michael susan saw what be going on a if now first struck by strangeness of brother manner looked anxiously at michael for explanation michael be irritated at willies defiance of did not mince matter just that fever have left sillyhe never be a wise a other folk now doubt if will ever get right susan did not speak went very pale lip quivered looked long wistfully at willies face a watched motion of duck in great stable pool laughed softly to now then willie like to see duck go overhead said susan instinctively adopting form of speech must have used to young child willie boo willie boo replied clapping hand avoiding eye speak properly willie said susan making strong effort at self control trying to arrest attention know who amtell name grasped arm almost painfully tight to make attend now looked at for instant gleam of recognition quivered over face exertion be evidently painful began to cry at vainness of effort to recall name hid face upon shoulder with old affectionate trick of manner put gently away went into house into own little bedroom locked door did not reply at to michael call for hardly spoke to old peggy who tried to tempt out to receive homely sympathy through open easement there still came idiotic sound of willie boo willie boo chapter iii after stun of blow came realization of consequence susan must sit for hour trying patiently to recall piece together fragment of recollection consciousness in brother mind must let go pursue senseless bit of play wait until must catch eye attention again when must resume self imposed task michael complained that never have word for minute of time to spend with now only said must try while there be yet chance to bring back brother lost wit a for marriage in state of uncertainty have heart to think of then michael stormed absented for two three day be of use when came back saw that have be cry till eye be swollen up gathered from peggys scolding did not spare that susan have eaten nothing since went away be a inflexible a ever not just yet only not just yet dont say again that love said suddenly hiding in arm so matter went on through august crop of oat be gathered in wheat field be not ready a yet when one fine day michael drove up in borrowed shandry offered to take willie ride manner when susan asked where be going to be rather confused answer be straight clear enough have business in ambleside must never lose sight of lad have back safe sound before dark so susan let go before night be at home again willie in high delight at little rattling paper windmill that michael have bought for in street striving to imitate new sound with perpetual buzzings michael too looked pleased susan knew look although afterwards remembered that have tried to veil from have assumed grave appearance of sorrow whenever caught eye put up horse for although have three mile further to go moon be upthe bonny harvest moonand did not care how late have to drive on road by such light after supper susan have prepared for traveller be over peggy went up stair to see willie safe in bed for have to have same care taken of that little child of four year old requires michael drew near to susan susan said took will to see dr preston

to year said if be usyouhe must send off in time to lancaster asylum theyve way there of keeping such people in order making happy only tell what said continued seeing gathering storm in face there be harm in saying replied with great self constraint forcing to speak coldly instead of angrily folk be welcome to opinion sat silent for minute two breast heaving with suppressed feeling he counted very clever man said michael at length may be he none of clever men be going to be guided by may think dont thank went took poor lad to have such harsh notion formed about if id be there must have called out sense be in well ill not say more to night susan youre not taking rightly id best be gone leave to think over ill not deny be hard word to hear there sense in a take reckon youll have to come to

of be what he come to poor lile chap began to cry michael to comfort with caress dont said use trying to make forget poor willie be natural must hate for being happy with even for just little minute go away leave to face out youll think over susan remember what doctor say cant forget said meant must not forget what doctor have said about hopelessness of brother case michael have referred to plan of sending willie to asylum madhouse a be called in day place idea have be gathering force in michael mind for time have talked over with father secretly rejoiced over possession of farm land must then be in fact if not in law by right of wife have always considered good penny father must give in catalogue of susans charm attraction of late have grown to esteem a heiress of yew nook too must have land like brotherland to posse to cultivate to make profit from to bequeath for time have wondered that susan have be so much absorbed in willies present that have never seemed to look forward to future state michael have long felt boy to be trouble of late have absolutely loathed gibbering uncouth gesture loose shambling gait irritated michael inexpressibly did not come near yew nook for couple of day thought that must leave time to become anxious to see reconciled to plan be strange lonely day to susan be first have spent face to face with sorrow have turned from girl into woman for hitherto michael have never let twenty four hour pas by without coming to see since have have fever now that be absent seemed a though cause of irritation be removed from will who be much more gentle tractable than have be for many week susan thought that observed making effort at bidding there be something piteous in way in crept up to looked wistfully in face a if asking to restore faculty that felt to be wanting never will let thee go lad never there knowing where must take thee to what must do with thee a say in bible nought death will part thee country side be full in day of story of brutal treatment offered to insane story be in fact too well founded truth of one of only must have be sufficient reason for strong prejudice existing against such place succeeding hour that susan passed alone with poor affectionate lad for sole companion served to deepen solemn resolution never to part with so when michael came be annoyed surprised by calm way in spoke a if following dr prestons advice be utterly entirely out of question have expected nothing le than consent reluctant might be still consent be extremely irritated must have repressed anger chose rather to give way to thinking that must thus best work upon susans affection so a to gain point somehow over reached now be astonished in turn at passion of indignation that burst into thou wilt not bide in same house with sayst thou there need for thy biding a far a can tell there solemn reason why must bide with own flesh blood keep to word pledged mother on death bed a for thee there tie know on to keep thee fro going to america botany bay very night if be thy inclination will have more of threat to make send bairn away if thou marry thoult help to take charge of willie if thou doesnt choose to marry on

in willie bides here bide with thou hast may be spoken word too much said michael pale with rage if be free a thou sayst to go to canada botany bay reckon im free to live where like will not be with natural who may turn into madman day for aught know choose between susy for swear to thee thou shant have have chosen said susan now perfectly composed still come of bide with willie very well replied michael trying to assume equal composure of manner then ill wish very good night went out of house door half expecting to be called back again instead heard hasty step inside bolt drawn whew said to think must leave lady alone for week two give time to come to sens shell not find so easy a think to let go so went past kitchen window in nonchalant style be not seen again at yew nook for week how did pas time for first day two be unusually cross with thing people came athwart then wheat harvest began be busy exultant about heavy crop then man came from distance to bid for lease of farm by father advice have be offered for sale a be so soon likely to remove to yew nook have so little idea that susan really must remain firm to determination that at once began to haggle with man who came after farm showed crop just got in managed skilfully enough to make good bargain for of course bargain have to be sealed at public house companion met with there soon became friend enough to tempt into langdale where again met with eleanor hebthwaite how did susan pas time for first day so be too angry offended to cry went about household duty in quick sharp jerking yet absent way shrinking one moment from will overwhelming with remorseful caress next third day of michael absence have relief of good fit of cry after grew softer more tender felt how harshly have spoken to remembered how angry have be made excuse for be wonder said to herself that have be vexed with wonder must not give in when have never tried to speak gently to reason with be to blame must tell so tell once again that mother have bade to be to willie horrible story have heard about madhouse must be on side at once so watched for coming intending to apologise a soon a ever saw hurried over household work in order to sit quietly at sewing hear first distant sound of well known step whistle even sound of flying needle seemed too loudperhaps be losing exquisite instant of anticipation so stopped sewing looked longingly out through geranium leaf in order that eye might catch first stir of branch in wood path by generally came now then bird might spring out of covert otherwise leaf be heavily still in sultry weather of early autumn then must take up sewing with spasm of resolution must determine that certain task must be fulfilled before must again allow poignant luxury of expectation sick at heart be when evening closed in chance of day diminished yet stayed up longer than usual thinking that if be comingif be only passing along distant roadthe sight of light in window might encourage to make appearance even at late hour while seeing house darkened shut up might quench such intention very sick weary at heart went to bed too desolate despairing to cry make moan in morning hope came afresh dayanother chance so went on for week peggy understood young mistress sorrow full well respected by silence on subject willie seemed happier now that irritation of michael presence be removed for poor idiot have sort of antipathy to michael be kind of heart echo to repugnance in latter held altogether just at time willie be happiest of three a susan went into coniston to sell butter one saturday inconsiderate person told that have seen michael hurst night before said inconsiderate might rather have said unobservant for one who have spent hour in susan dixons company might have seen that disliked having reference made to subject nearest heart be joyous grievous now went little paler than usual have never recovered colour since have have fever tried to keep silence irrepressible pang forced out question where at thomas applethwaites in langdale have kind of harvest home be there among young folk very thick wi nelly hebthwaite old thomas niece thoult have to look after bit susan smiled sighed neighbour who have be speaking to be struck with gray stillness of face susan felt how well self command be obeyed by little muscle said to herself in spartan manner can bear without wincing blenching went home early at tearing passionate pace trampling breaking through obstacle of briar bush willie be moping in absencehanging listlessly on farm yard gate to watch for when saw set up one of strange inarticulate cry of be now learning meaning came towards with loose galloping run head limb shaking wagging with pleasant excitement suddenly turned from burst into tear sat down on stone by wayside not hundred yard from home buried face in hand gave way to passion of pent up sorrow so terrible full of agony be low cry that idiot stood by aghast silent joy gone for time not like joy turned into ash thought struck yes sight of woe made think great a exertion be ran stumbled shambled home buzzing with lip time never missed came back in trice bringing with cherished paper windmill bought on fatal day when michael have taken into kendal to have doom of perpetual idiocy pronounced thrust into susans face hand lap regardless of injury frail plaything thereby received leapt before to think how have cured heart sorrow buzzing louder than ever susan looked up at glance of sad eye sobered began to whimper knew not why now comforter in turn tried to soothe by twirling windmill be broken made noise must not go round seemed to afflict susan more than tried to make right although saw task be hopeless while did so tear rained down unheeded from bent head on paper toy wont do said at last will never do again somehow took accident word a omen of love be broken that feared must never be pieced together more rose up took willies hand two went slowly into house to surprise michael hurst sat in house place house place be sort of better kitchen where cookery be done be reserved for state occasion michael have gone in there because be accompanied by only sister

arriving at yew nook in absence of latter have not scrupled to conduct sister into guest room a held mr gale worldly position in respect admiration therefore wished to be favourably impressed with sign of property be beginning to consider a susans greatest charm have secretly said to that if eleanor hebthwaite susan dixon be equal in point of rich must sooner have eleanor by far have begun to consider susan a termagant when thought of intercourse with recollection of somewhat warm hasty temper came far more readily to mind than remembrance of generous loving nature now stood face to face with eye tear swollen garment dusty here there torn in consequence of rapid progress through bushy by path did not make favourable impression on well clad mr gale dressed in best silk gown therefore unusually susceptible to appearance of be susans manner gracious cordial how must be when remembered what have passed between michael last time met for penitence have faded away under daily disappointment of last weary week be hospitable in substance bade peggy hurry on kettle busied among tea cup thankful that presence of mr gale a stranger must prevent immediate recurrence to one subject felt must be present in michael mind a well a in own mr gale be withheld by such feeling of delicacy have come ready primed with case have undertaken to bring girl to reason there be time to be lost have be prearranged between brother sister that be to stroll out into farm yard before sister introduced subject be so confident in success of argument that must need have triumph of victory a soon a possible accordingly brought hail storm of good reason to bear upon susan susan did not reply for long time be so indignant at intermeddling of stranger in deep family sorrow shame mr gale thought be gaining day urged argument more pitilessly even michael winced for susan wondered at silence shrank out of sight into shadow hoping that sister might prevail annoyed at hard way in kept putting case suddenly susan turned round from occupation have pretended to be engaged in said to in low voice yet not only vibrated made hearer thrill through obtuseness michael hurst doe sister speak truth think woman looked at for answer mr gale without anxiety for have not said very word have spoken together before have not used very argument that have suggested susan on contrary looked to answer a settling doom for life in gloom of eye might have read more despair than hope shuffled position shuffled in word what be ask sister have said many thing ask said susan trying to give crystal clearness to expression pronunciation if knowing a do how will be afflicted will help to take charge of promised mother on death bed must do mean that will keep always with do in power to make life happy if will do will be wife if not remain unwed may get dangerous can be trouble being here be pain to susan not pleasure ask for yes said little contempt at evading question mingling with tone

servant understood sent away somehow not politely a have be given to understand good go with said peggy a grimly watched retreating figure be rid of bad rubbish anyhow turned into house with intention of making ready refreshment for susan after hard day at market harder evening in kitchen to passed through empty house place making face of contemptuous dislike at used tea cup fragment of meal yet standing there found susan with sleeve tucked up working apron on busied in preparing to make clap bread one of hardest hottest domestic task of daleswoman looked up first met then avoided peggys eye
