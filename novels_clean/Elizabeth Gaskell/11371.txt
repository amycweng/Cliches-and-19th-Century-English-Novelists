sorry for determination have great desire to see son clergyman like father did not consider whether character be fitted for so sacred office rather thought that profession when once assumed must purify character in fact fitness unfitness for holy order entered little into mind have respect for profession father have belonged to have rather see curate at seventy pound year than attorney with seven hundred replied know father be always asked to dine everywhere to place where know must not have asked mr bish of woodchester make thousand year besides mr buxton have next presentation to

with power to resist wish except mother mr buxton former have long acknowledged son will a law latter though surprised almost disappointed at change of purpose have never anticipated in plan for edward benefit gave consent even advanced of money requisite for premium maggie looked upon change with mingled feeling have always from child pictured edward to a taking father place when have thought of a man be a contemplative grave gentle a remembered father with child deficiency of reasoning power have never considered how impossible be that selfish vain impatient boy must become meek humble pious man merely by adopting profession in such quality be required now at sixteen be beginning to understand not by process of thought by something more like correct feeling perceived that edward must never be true minister of christ so more glad thankful than sorry though sorrow mingled with sentiment learned decision that be to be attorney frank buxton time be growing up into young man hope of father mother be bound up in according to difference in character be difference in hope seemed indeed probable that mr buxton who be singularly void of worldliness ambition for must become worldly ambitious for son hope for frank be for honor distinction here mr buxton hope be prayer be fading away a light fade into darkness on summer evening one seemed to remark gradual progress be fully conscious of last time that frank be at home from college before death knew that must never see again when gaily left house with cheerfulness be partly assumed dragged with languid step into room at front of house from must watch down long straggling little street led to inn from coach started a went along turned to look back at home there saw mother white figure gazing after must not see wistful eye made poor heart give leap of joy by turning round running back for one more kiss one more blessing when next came home be at sudden summons of death father be a one distracted must not speak of lost angel without sudden burst of tear oftentimes of self upbraiding disturbed calm still holy idea frank liked to associate with ceased speaking to therefore about mutual loss be certain kind of relief to when did so longed for one to whom might talk of mother with quiet reverence of intense trustful affection thought of maggie of whom have seen little of late for when have be at combehurst have felt that mr buxton required presence le have remained more at home possibly mr buxton regretted never said anything far looking a one who be near death foresaw probably if maggie son met often in sick room feeling might arise must militate against husband hope plan therefore ought not to allow to spring up have be unable to refrain from expressing gratitude to maggie for many hour of tranquil happiness have unconsciously dropped many sentence made frank feel that in little brown mouse of former year be likely to meet with one who must tell much of inner history of mother in last day to whom must speak of without calling out passionate sorrow be so little in unison with memory accordingly one afternoon late in autumn rode up to mr browne air on height be so still that nothing seemed to stir now then yellow leaf came floating down from tree detached from outward violence only because life have reached full limit then ceased looking down on distant sheltered wood be gorgeous in orange crimson splendor be felt to be sign of decaying dying year even without inward sorrow there be grand solemnity in season impressed mind hushed into tranquil thought frank rode slowly along quietly dismounted at old horse mount beside there be iron bridle ring fixed in gray stone wall saw casement of parlor window open maggie head bent down over work looked up a entered court footstep sounded on flag walk came round opened door a stood in door way speaking be struck by resemblance to old painting have seen young calm face shining out with great peacefulness large

come in want to talk to maggie opened little parlor door went in for time be silent must not speak of who be with present in thought maggie shut casement put log of wood on fire sat down with back to window a flame sprang up blazed at touch of dry wood frank saw that face be wet with quiet tear still voice be even gentle a answered question seemed to understand be very thing must care most to hear spoke of mother last day without word of praise indeed must have be impertinence showed such just true appreciation of who be dead gone that felt a if must listen forever to sweet dropping word be balm to sore heart have thought possible that suddenness of death might have made life incomplete in might have departed without being able to express wish project must now have sacred force of command found that maggie though have never intruded a such have be depository of many little thought plan if be not expressed to knew that mr buxton dawson be aware of what be though in violence of early grief have forgotten to name flickering brightness of flame have died away gloom of evening have gathered into room through open door of kitchen fire sent ruddy glow distinctly marked against carpet wall frank still sat with head buried in hand against table listening tell more said at pause think have told now said maggie at last at least be recollect at present if think of anything more

to come divert with news if 'd be living in combehurst be sure must not have let grief get better of a did must get up quiet rubber in evening do think frank have shaken hand be gone a rode home thought much of sorrow different way of bearing decided that be sent by god for holy purpose to call out into existence higher good thought that if be faithfully taken a decree there must be passionate despairing resistance to yet if be trustfully acknowledged to have wise end must dare to baulk defraud by putting on one side by seeking distraction of worldly thing not let do full work then returned to conversation with maggie have be real comfort to what advantage must be to erminia to have girl for friend companion be rather strange that having thought having be struck a said with

contrived to be in drawing room ready to receive after dinner mr buxton tried to do away with thought of by much talking now then looked wistfully toward door erminia exerted to be a lively a must in order if possible to fill up vacuum edward who have come over from woodchester for walk have good deal to say be unconsciously great assistance with never ending flow of rather clever small talk mother felt proud of son new waistcoat be far more conspicuously of latest fashion than frank must be said to be after dinner when mr buxton two young men be left alone edward launched out still more thought be impressing frank with knowledge of world world way be doing in power to repel one who have never be much attracted toward worldly success be standard of merit end seemed with to justify

make most of property thing never cared about before think be aware of from one two little thing have noticed must not wonder if end in being avaricious in old age erminia sighed maggie have almost sympathy with father who sought what imagined to be for good of son that son frank although be a convinced a erminia that money must not really help one to happiness must not at instant resist saying how wish have fortune must so like to give to now maggie be silly never heard wish for anything different from what be before so will take opportunity of lecturing on folly wo either for look sadly tired with agitation besides must go jem will be wondering what have become of dearest cousin in law will come very often to see perhaps will give lecture yet chapter vi be true of mr buxton a well a of son that have seed of imperiousness in life have not be such a to call out into view with more wealth than required with gentle wife who if ruled never showed be conscious of fact looked up to by neighbor simple affectionate set of people whose father have lived near father grandfather in same kindly relation receiving benefit cordially given requiting with good will respectful attention such have be circumstance surrounding until son grew out of childhood there have not seemed wish have not in power to gratify a soon a formed again when frank be at school at college went on prosperously gained honor enough to satisfy far more ambitious father indeed be honor gained that stimulated father ambition received letter from tutor headmaster prophesying that if frank chose might rise to highest honor in church state idea thus suggested vague a be remained filled mr buxton mind for first time in life made wish that own career have be such a must have led to form connection among great powerful a be shyness gene from being unaccustomed to society have made averse to frank occasional request that might bring such such school fellow college chum home on visit now regretted on account of want of connection might thus have be formed in vision turned to marriage a best way of remedying erminia be right in saying that uncle have thought of lady adela castlemayne for instant though how little witch have found out can not say a idea have be dismissed immediately from mind be wise enough to see utter vanity a long a son remained undistinguished hope be if frank married erminia united property being father heiress must justify in standing for shire if must marry daughter of leading personage in county might lead to same step thus at once must obtain position in parliament where great talent must have scope verge enough of two vision favorite one for sister sake be that of marriage with erminia in midst of fell like bombshell intelligence of engagement with maggie browne good sweet little girl enough without fortune connection without a far a mr buxton knew least power capability spirit with to help frank on in career to eminence in land resolved to consider a boyish fancy

shown more violence of manner must have irritated le a be be most miserable interview have ever taken place between father son mr buxton tried to calm down with believing that frank must change mind if saw more of world somehow have prophesying distrust of idea internally worst be there be fault to be found with maggie although might want accomplishment desired to see in son wife connection too be so perfectly respectable though humble enough in comparison with mr buxton soaring wish that there be nothing to be objected to on score position be great offence in proportion to want of reason one for disapproving of engagement be annoyance under assumed reserve toward frank be so unusual restraint upon open genial disposition that seemed to make irritable toward others in contact with excepting erminia found difficult to behave rightly to maggie like habitually cordial person went into opposite extreme when wanted to show little coolness however angry might be with event of be cause be too innocent meek to justify in being more than cool awkwardness be so great that many man of world have met greatest enemy knowing other hatred with le freezing distance of manner than mr buxton to maggie while went simply on in own path loving more through for old kindness sake because be frank father shunned meeting with such evident painful anxiety at last tried to spare encounter hurried out of church lingered behind in order to avoid only chance now have of being forced to speak for no longer went to dear house in combehurst though erminia came to see more than ever mr browne be perplexed annoyed beyond measure upbraided mr buxton to one maggie to said one in sens might have foreseen what have happened must have thought well about before went fell in love with young man of such expectation a mr frank buxton in middle of dismay edward came over from woodchester for day two have be told of engagement in letter from maggie be too sacred subject for to enlarge upon to mr

only one arising from edward visit be that must now often be spared to go up to thorn tree calm down anxiety bring discord into peace under sweet influence of nature mr buxton have tried to teach force of lovely truth that melody of everlasting chime may abide in heart of who ply daily task in town crowded populous place solitude be not needed by faithful for to feel immediate presence of god utter stillness of human sound necessary before can hear music of angel footstep a yet soul be young disciple felt easier to speak to come to for help sitting lonely with wild moor swelling darkening around not creature in sight white speck of distant sheep bird shun haunt of men floating in still mid air sometimes longed to go to mr buxton tell how much must sympathize with if dislike to engagement arose from thinking unworthy of son frank character seemed to grand in promise with vehement impulse natural gift craving worthy employment will sat supreme over like young emperor calmly

time in early autumn have left cambridge intended to enter at temple a soon a vacation be ended have not be very long at home before maggie be made aware partly through erminia who have notion of

influence over son who have long be first paramount object in life needed not have be jealous however angry indignant frank be when went up to moorland cottage maggie almost persuaded before hour have

youth disapproved so strongly of measure of so much that be now going on at home under mr henry influence that determined to pay long promised visit to scotland maggie sad at heart to see how be suffering encouraged in determination chapter viii after be gone there came november of most dreary characteristic kind there be incessant rain closing in mist without gleam of sunshine to light up

merciful forgiving expression made use of in former day to soften in angry mood be clearly remembered while maggie spoke influence be perceptible in change of tone wavering of manner henceforward yet will not save frank from being involved in disgrace said more a if weighing deliberating on case than have ever spoken before if frank wish will quietly withdraw out of sight forever give promise

favor from if there have be time indeed must have preferred obtaining money in same manner from one else edward brightened up little when heard sum must be procured be almost indifferent how strangely callous a maggie thought even proposed to draw up legal form of assignment mr buxton only thought of hurrying on departure must not refrain from expressing approval admiration of maggie whenever came

be haggard enough to have be in anxiety concealment for month when body be refreshed spirit rose in way inconceivable to maggie spaniard who went out with pizarro be not lured on by more fantastic notion of wealth to be acquired in new world than be dwelt on vision in so brisk vivid manner that even made mother cease weary weeping have lasted livelong day despite maggie effort to look up listen to will answer for said before long will be american judge with mile of cotton plantation in america sighed out mother never mind mother said with tenderness made maggie heart glad if wo come over to

going must have be too truthful not to have said yes have tried to do right though may fail evil may seem to arise rather than good out of endeavor yet still will submit to failure try say be will be done if only might have seen frank once more told face to face to do away with such thought determined no longer to sit gazing tempted by shore giving one look to land contained lover went down below busied even through blinding tear in trying to arrange own cabin edward heard boat after boat arrive loaded with passenger learnt from edward who came down to tell fact that there be upwards of two hundred steerage passenger felt tremulous shake announced that ship be loosed from mooring being tugged down river wrapped up once more came on deck sat down among many who be looking last look at

waking whether have slept since have thrown down on cot when suddenly there be great rush then edward stood like lightning by pulling up by arm ship be on fire to deck maggie fire fire shouted like maniac while dragged up stair a if cry of fire must summon human aid on great deep cry be echoed up to heaven by crowd in accent of despair stood huddled together dressed undressed now in red lurid light showing ghastly face of terror now in white wreath of smoke a far away from steerage a must press for there up from hold rose column of smoke now then fierce blaze leaped out exulting higher higher time while from crevice on part of deck issued harbinger of terrible destruction awaited sailor be lowering boat above stood captain a calm a if be on own hearth at home home where never more must be voice be low be lower a clear a bell in distinctness a wise in direction a collected thought must make of steerage passenger be helping more be dumb motionless with affright in dead silence be heard low wail of sorrow a of number whose power be crushed out of by awful terror edward still held clutch of margaret arm be ready said in fierce whisper fire sprung up along main mast did not sink disappear again knew then that mad effort made by few below to extinguish be in vain then went up prayer of hundred in mortal agony of fear lord have mercy upon not in quiet calm of village church did ever pitiful cry go up to heaven be like one voice like day of judgment in presence of lord after there be more silence confusion of terrible farewell wild cry of affright purposeless rush hither thither boat be down rocking on sea captain spoke put child in first be most helpless one two stout sailor stood in boat to receive edward drew nearer nearer to gangway pulling maggie with be almost pressed to death stifled close in ear heard woman praying to herself poor creature knew of presence god be in awful hour spoke in low voice to heart darling be taken away from faith faith oh great god will die in peace if thou wilt grant faith in terrible hour to feel that thou wilt take care of poor orphan hush dearest billy cried out shrill to little fellow in boat waiting for mother change in voice from despair to kind of cheerfulness showed what mother love can do mother will come soon hide face anne wrap shawl tight round then voice sank down again in same low wild prayer for faith maggie must not turn to see face took hand hung near woman clutched at with grasp of vice went on praying a if unconscious just then crowd gave way little captain have said that woman be to go next be too frenzied to obey direction now pressed backward forward sailor with mute stern obedience strove to follow out captain direction edward pulled maggie kept hold on mother mate at head of gangway pushed back only woman be to go there be men there three to manage boat come on maggie while there be room for said unheeding maggie drew back put mother hand into mate save first said woman did not know of anything that child be there be only in after day quiet hour that remembered young creature who pushed forward to join fatherless child by losing place in crowd be jostled where did not know dreamed until dying day edward pressed on unaware that maggie be not close behind be deaf to reproach heedless of hand stretched out to hold back sprang toward boat men there pushed off full more than full a be overboard fell into sullen heaving water last shout have be on maggie name name never thought to hear again on earth a be pressed back sick suffocating suddenly voice rang out above confused voice moaning hungry wave above roaring fire maggie maggie maggie out of steerage side of crowd tall figure issued forth begrimed with smoke must not see knew a tame bird flutter to human breast of protector when affrighted by mortal foe so maggie fluttered cowered into arm for moment there be more terror thought of danger in heart of twain only infinite absolute peace have wonder how came there be enough that be there first thought of destruction be present with be a calm composed a if sat beneath thorn tree on still moorland far away took without word to end of quarter deck lashed to piece of spar never spoke maggie said only chance be to throw overboard spar will keep floating at first will go down deep deep down keep mouth eye shut will be there when come up by god help will struggle bravely for looked up by flashing light must see trusting loving smile upon face smiled back at grave beautiful look fit to wear on face in heaven helped to side of vessel away from falling burning piece of mast then for moment paused if maggie may be throwing in to death put hand before eye strong man lost courage then spoke be not afraid god be with whether live die looked a quiet happy a child on mother breast so before lost heart again heaved up threw a far a must over into glaring dizzying water straight leaped after came up with involuntary look of terror on face when saw by red glare of burning ship close by side shut eye looked a if peacefully going to sleep swam guiding spar think be near llandudno know have passed little ormes head be said did not speak swam out of heat fierce blaze of light into quiet dark water then into moon path might be hour before got into silver stream when beam fell down upon looked at maggie head rested on spar quite still must not bear
