to set up milliner shop have be patronised by lady in neighbourhood lady arley for instance must occasionally give miss barker pattern of old cap of hers immediately copied circulated among lite of cranford say lite for miss barker have caught trick of place piqued upon aristocratic connection must not sell cap ribbon to anyone without pedigree many farmer wife daughter turned away huffed from miss barker select millinery went rather to universal shop where profit of brown soap moist sugar enabled proprietor to go straight to paris said until found customer too patriotic john bullish to

about in search of amusement chanced to hit upon gun hanging up in hall took down to look at chasing went off through open kitchen door hit pack slow dark thread of blood came oozing out how miss pole enjoyed part of story dwelling on word a if loved rather hurried over further account of girl bravery have confused idea that somehow baffled robber with italian iron heated red hot then restored to blackness by being dipped in grease parted for night with awe stricken wonder a to what must hear of in morningand on part with vehement desire for night to be over gone be so afraid lest robber must have seen from dark lurking place miss pole have carried off plate thus have double motive for attacking house picture asked to take care of until lady glenmire came to call next day heard of nothing

who be trembling very much scouted idea said owed to society to apprehend that must certainly do best to lay hold of lock up in garret till morning when lady glenmire came almost felt jealous of mr

people thought died of apoplexy brought on by too much feeding too little exercise at rate be certain that two day after eventful night carlo be found dead with poor leg stretched out stiff in attitude of running a if by such unusual exertion must escape sure pursuer death be sorry for carlo old familiar friend who have snapped at for so many year mysterious mode of death made very uncomfortable must signor brunoni be at bottom of have apparently killed canary with only word of command will seemed of deadly force who knew what might yet be lingering in neighbourhood willing sort of awful thing whispered fancy among ourselves in evening in morning courage came back with daylight in week time have got over shock of carlos death mr jamieson poor thing felt a have felt event since husband death indeed miss pole said that a honourable mr jamieson drank good deal occasioned much uneasiness be possible that carlos death might be greater affliction there be always tinge of cynicism in miss pole remark however one thing be clear certainit be necessary for mr jamieson to have change of scene mr mulliner be very impressive on point shaking head whenever inquired after mistress speaking of loss of appetite bad night very ominously with justice too for if have two characteristic in natural state of health be facility of eating sleeping if must neither eat sleep must be indeed out of spirit out of health lady glenmire who have evidently taken very kindly to cranford did not like idea of mr jamiesons going to cheltenham more than once insinuated pretty plainly that

shadow of porch so effectually silenced that be robbed in interval between ringing bell servant answering miss pole be sure must turn out that robbery have be committed by men went very day heard report to have teeth examined to question mr hoggins came to afterwards so heard what have heard straight direct from source while be yet in excitement flutter of agitation caused by first intelligence for event have only occurred night before well said miss pole sitting down with decision of person who have made up mind a to nature of life world such people never tread lightly seat without bump well miss matty men will be men mother son of wish to be considered samson solomon rolled into onetoo strong ever to be beaten discomfitedtoo wise ever to be outwitted if will notice have always foreseen event though never tell one for one warning before event happen father be man know sex pretty well have talked out of breath must have be very glad to fill up necessary pause a chorus did not exactly know what to say man have suggested diatribe against sex so only joined in generally with grave shake of head soft murmur of be very incomprehensible certainly now only think said there have undergone risk of having one of remaining teeth drawn for one be terribly at mercy of surgeon dentist for one always speak fair till have got mouth out of clutch after mr hoggins be too much of man to own that be robbed last night not robbed exclaimed chorus dont tell miss pole exclaimed angry that must be for moment imposed upon believe be robbed just a betty told be ashamed to own

have heard exaggerated account of petty theft of neck of mutton seems be stolen out of safe in yard last week have impertinence to add believed that be taken by cat have doubt if must get at bottom of be that irishman dressed up in woman clothes who came spying about house with story about starving child after have duly condemned want of candour mr hoggins have evinced abused men in general taking for representative type got round to subject about have be talking when miss pole came in namely how far in present disturbed state of country must venture to accept invitation miss matty have just received from mr forrester to come a usual keep anniversary of wedding day by drinking tea with at five oclock playing quiet pool afterwards mr forrester have said that asked with diffidence because road be feared very unsafe suggested that perhaps one of must not object to take sedan that others by walking briskly might keep up with long trot of chairman so might arrive safely at over place suburb of town be too large expression small cluster of house separated from cranford by about two hundred yard of dark lonely lane there be doubt that similar note be awaiting miss pole at home so call be very fortunate affair a enabled to consult together must all much rather have declined invitation felt that must not be quite kind to mr forrester who must otherwise be left to solitary retrospect of not very happy fortunate life miss matty miss pole have be visitor on occasion for many year now gallantly determined to nail colour to mast to go through darkness lane rather than fail in loyalty to friend when evening came miss matty for be who be voted into chair a have cold before being shut down in sedan like jack in box implored chairman might befall not to run away leave fastened up there to be murdered even after have promised saw tighten feature into stern determination of martyr gave melancholy ominous shake of head through glass however got there safely only rather out of breath for be who must trot hardest through darkness lane be afraid poor miss matty be sadly jolted mr forrester have made extra preparation in acknowledgment of exertion in coming to see through such danger usual form of genteel ignorance a to what servant might send up be gone through harmony preference seemed likely to be order of evening for interesting conversation began dont know how have relation of course to robber who infested neighbourhood of cranford having braved danger of darkness lane thus having little stock of reputation for courage to fall back upon also daresay desirous of proving superior to men videlicet mr hoggins in article of candour began to relate individual fear private precaution of took owned that pet apprehension be eyeseyes looking at watching glittering out from dull flat wooden surface that if dared to go up to looking glass when be panic stricken must certainly turn round with back towards for fear of seeing eye behind looking out of darkness saw miss matty nerving up for confession at last out came owned that ever since have be girl have dreaded being caught by last leg just a be getting into bed by one concealed under said when be younger more active used to take flying leap from distance so bring leg up safely into bed at once that have always annoyed deborah who piqued upon getting into bed gracefully have given up in consequence now old terror must often come over especially since miss pole house have be attacked have got quite to believe in fact of attack having taken place yet be very unpleasant to think of looking under bed seeing man concealed with great fierce face staring out at so have bethought herself of somethingperhaps have noticed that have told martha to buy penny ball such a child play withand now rolled ball under bed night if came out on other side well good if not always took care to have hand on bell rope meant to call out john harry just a if expected men servant to answer ring applauded ingenious contrivance miss matty sank back into satisfied silence with look at mr forrester a if to ask for private weakness mr forrester looked askance at miss pole tried to change subject little by telling that have borrowed boy from one of neighbouring cottage promised parent hundredweight of coal at christmas supper evening for loan of at night have instructed in possible duty when first came finding sensible have given major sword major be late husband desired to put very carefully behind pillow at night turning edge towards head of pillow be sharp lad be sure for spying out major cocked hat have said if might have to wear be sure must frighten two englishman four frenchman day have impressed upon anew that be to lose time in putting on hat anything else if heard noise be to run at with drawn sword on suggesting that accident might occur from such slaughterous indiscriminate direction that might rush on jenny getting up to wash have spitted before have discovered that be not frenchman mr forrester said did not think that be likely for be very sound sleeper generally have to be well shaken cold pigged in morning before must rouse sometimes thought such dead sleep must be owing to hearty supper poor lad ate for be half starved at home told jenny to see that got good meal at night picture slaughterous indiscriminate direction still be confession of mr forresters peculiar timidity urged to tell thought must frighten more than anything paused stirred fire snuffed candle then said in sounding whisper ghost looked at miss pole a much a to say have declared must stand by look be challenge in miss pole came down upon with indigestion spectral illusion optical delusion great deal out of dr ferrier dr hibbert besides miss matty have rather leaning to ghost a have mentioned before what little did say be on mr forresters side who emboldened by sympathy protested that ghost be part of religion that surely widow of major in army knew what to be frightened at what not in short never saw mr forrester so warm before since for be gentle meek enduring old lady in most thing not elder wine that ever be mulled must night wash out remembrance of difference between miss pole hostess indeed when elder wine be brought in gave rise to new burst of discussion for jenny little maiden who staggered under tray have to give evidence of having seen ghost with own eye not so many night ago in darkness lane very lane be to go through on way home in spite of uncomfortable feeling last consideration gave must not help being amused at jenny position be exceedingly like of witness being examined cross examined by two counsel who be not at scrupulous about asking leading question conclusion arrived at be that jenny have certainly seen something beyond what fit of indigestion must have caused lady in white without head be what deposed adhered to supported by consciousness of secret sympathy of mistress under withering scorn with miss pole regarded not only many others have seen headless lady who sat by roadside wringing hand a in deep grief mr forrester looked at from time to time with air of conscious triumph then have not to pas through darkness lane before must bury beneath own familiar bed clothes preserved discreet silence a to headless lady while be putting on thing to go home for there be knowing how near ghostly head ear might be what spiritual connection might be keeping up with unhappy body in darkness lane therefore even miss pole felt that be a well not to speak lightly on such subject for fear of vexing insulting that woebegone trunk at least so conjecture for instead of busy clatter usual in operation tied on cloak a sadly a mute at funeral miss matty drew curtain round window of chair to shut out disagreeable sight men because be in spirit that labour be so nearly ended because be going down hill set off at round merry pace that be miss pole must do to keep up with have breath for nothing beyond imploring dont leave uttered a clutched arm so tightly must not have quitted ghost ghost what relief be when men weary of burden quick trot stopped just where headingley causeway branch off from darkness lane miss pole unloosed caught at one of men must not youcould not take miss matty round by headingley causewaythe pavement in darkness lane jolt so be not very strong smothered voice be heard from inside of chair oh pray go on be matter what be matter will give sixpence more to go on very fast pray dont stop here ill give shilling said miss pole with tremulous dignity if youll go by headingley causeway two men grunted acquiescence took up chair went along causeway certainly answered miss pole kind purpose of saving miss mattys bone for be covered with soft thick mud even fall there must have be easy till getting up came when there might have be difficulty in extrication chapter xi samuel brown next morning met lady glenmire miss pole setting out on long walk to find old woman who be famous in neighbourhood for skill in knitting woollen stocking miss pole said to with smile half kindly half contemptuous upon countenance have be just telling lady glenmire of poor friend mr forrester terror of ghost come from living so much alone listening to bug boo story of jenny of hers be so calm so much above superstitious fear be almost ashamed to say how glad have be of headingley causeway proposition night before turned off conversation to something else in afternoon miss pole called on miss matty to tell of adventurethe real adventure have met with on morning walk have be perplexed about exact path be to take across field in order to find knitting old woman have stopped to inquire at little wayside public house standing on high road to london about three mile from

not know what have helped to unpack take out linen clothes when other manhis twin brother believed washad gone off with horse cart miss pole have begun to have suspicion at point expressed idea that be rather strange that box cart horse must have disappeared good mr robert seemed to have become quite indignant at miss pole implied suggestion in fact miss pole said be a angry a if miss pole have told that be swindler a best way of convincing lady bethought of begging to see wife a miss pole said there be doubting honest worn bronzed face of woman who at first tender word from lady glenmire burst into tear be too weak to check until word from landlady made swallow down sob in order that might testify to christian kindness shown by mr mr robert miss pole came round with swing to a vehement belief in sorrowful tale a have be sceptical before a proof of energy in poor sufferer behalf be nothing daunted when found out that other be signor brunoni to whom cranford have be attributing manner of evil six week past yes wife said proper name be samuel brownsam called himbut to last preferred calling signor sounded so much better end of conversation with signora brunoni be that be agreed that must be placed under medical advice for expense incurred in procuring lady glenmire promised to hold responsible have accordingly gone to mr hoggins to beg to ride over to rising

although if have be inclined to take unfair advantage might have rushed in for have most out of place fit of coughing for five minute after mr forrester entered room will never forget imploring expression of eye a looked at over pocket handkerchief said a plain a word must speak dont let nature deprive of treasure be mine although for time can make use of did not mr forresters surprise be equal to ours sense of injury rather greater because have to feel for order saw more fully than must do how such conduct brought stain on aristocracy when miss pole left endeavoured to subside into
