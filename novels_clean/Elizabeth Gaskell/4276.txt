now that saw margaret with superb way of moving looking began to feel ashamed of having imagined that must do very well for hale in spite of certain vulgarity in have struck at time of looking over margaret must not help look short curled upper lip round massive up turned chin manner of carrying head movement full of soft feminine defiance always gave stranger impression of haughtiness be tired now must much rather have remained silent taken rest father have planned for of course owed to herself to be gentlewoman to speak courteously from time to time to stranger not over brushed over polished must be confessed after rough encounter with milton street crowd wished that must go a have once spoken of doing instead of sitting there answering with curt sentence remark made have taken off shawl hung over back of chair sat facing facing light full beauty met eye round white flexile throat rising out of full yet lithe figure lip moving so slightly a spoke not breaking cold serene look of face with variation from one lovely haughty curve eye with soft gloom meeting with quiet maiden freedom almost said to that did not like before conversation ended tried so to compensate for mortified feeling while looked upon with admiration must not repress looked at with proud indifference taking thought for what in irritation told be great rough fellow with not grace refinement about quiet coldness of demeanour interpreted into contemptuousness resented in heart to pitch of almost inclining to get up go away have nothing more to do with hale superciliousness just a margaret have exhausted last subject of conversation yet conversation must hardly be called consisted of so few such short speech father came in with pleasant gentlemanly courteousness of apology reinstated name family in mr thornton good opinion mr hale visitor have good deal to say respecting mutual friend mr bell margaret glad that part of entertaining visitor be over went to window to try make more familiar with strange aspect of street got so much absorbed in watching what be going on outside that hardly heard father when spoke to have to repeat what said landlord will persist in admiring that hideous paper be afraid must let remain oh dear be sorry replied began to turn over in mind possibility of hiding part of at least by of sketch gave up idea at last a likely only to make bad worse father meanwhile with kindly country hospitality be pressing mr thornton to stay to luncheon with must have be very inconvenient to to do so yet felt that must have yielded if margaret by word look have seconded father invitation be glad did not yet be irritated at for not doing so gave low grave bow when left felt more awkward conscious in limb than have ever done in life before well margaret

gentleman be hardly to be expected not vulgar common though put in father rather jealous of disparagement of sole friend have in milton oh said margaret with expression of resolution power face however plain in feature must be vulgar common must not like to have to bargain with look very inflexible altogether man who seems made for niche mamma sagacious strong a becomes great tradesman dont call milton manufacturer tradesman margaret said father be very different be apply word to who have something tangible to sell if think term be not correct papa wont use oh mamma speaking of vulgarity

composedly let think if liked that have relented from expressed determination not to repaper there be particular need to tell that what did not care to do for reverend mr hale unknown in milton be only too glad to do at one short sharp remonstrance of mr thornton wealthy manufacturer chapter viii home sickness hame hame hame hame fain wad be needed pretty light papering of room to reconcile to milton needed more more must not be have thick yellow november fog have come on view of plain in valley made by sweeping bend of river be shut out when mr hale arrived at new home margaret dixon have be at work two day unpacking arranging everything inside house still looked in disorder outside thick fog crept up to very window be driven in to open door in choking white wreath of unwholsome mist oh margaret be to live here asked mr hale in blank dismay margarets heart echoed dreariness of tone in question be put must scarcely command enough to say oh fog in london be sometimes far worse then

sympathy margaret do believe be unhealthy place only suppose that mother health yours must suffer wish have gone into country place in wale be really terrible said going up to window there be comfort to be given be settled in milton must endure smoke fog for season indeed other life seemed shut out from by a thick fog of circumstance only day before mr hale have be reckoning up with dismay how much removal fortnight at heston have cost found have absorbed nearly little stock of ready money here be here must remain at night when margaret realised felt inclined to sit down in stupor of despair heavy smoky air hung about bedroom occupied long narrow projection at back of house window placed at side of oblong looked at blank wall of similar projection not above ten foot distant loomed through fog like great barrier to hope inside room everything be in confusion effort have be directed to make mother room comfortable margaret sat down on box direction card upon struck a having be written at helstone beautiful beloved helstone lost in dismal thought at last determined to take mind away from present suddenly remembered that have letter from edith have only half read in bustle of morning be to tell of arrival at voyage along mediterranean music dancing on board ship gay new life opening upon house with trellised balcony view over white cliff deep blue sea edith wrote fluently well if not graphically must not only seize salient characteristic point of scene must enumerate enough of indiscriminate particular for margaret to make out for captain lennox lately married officer shared villa high up on beautiful precipitous rock overhanging sea day late a be in year seemed spent in boating land picnic out of door pleasure seeking glad ediths life seemed like deep vault of blue sky above free utterly free from fleck cloud husband have to attend drill most musical officer wife there have to copy new popular tune out of most recent english music for benefit of bandmaster seemed most severe arduous duty expressed affectionate hope that if regiment stopped year at corfu margaret might come out pay long visit asked margaret if remembered day twelve month on edith wrote

well edith mr shaw have gone to dinner margaret have joined party in evening recollection of plentiful luxury of arrangement stately handsomeness of furniture size of house peaceful untroubled ease of visitor came vividly before in strange contrast to present time smooth sea of old life closed up without mark left to tell where have be habitual dinner call dancing evening be going on going on for ever though aunt shaw edith be no longer there of course be even le missed doubted if one of old set ever thought of except henry lennox too knew must strive to forget because of pain have caused have heard often boast of power of putting disagreeable thought far away from then penetrated farther into what might have be if have cared for a lover have accepted change in father opinion consequent station have taken place must not doubt that must have be impatiently received by mr lennox be bitter mortification to in one sense must bear patiently because knew father purity of purpose strengthened to endure error grave serious though in estimation be fact of world esteeming father degraded in rough wholesale judgment must have oppressed irritated mr lennox a realised what might have be grew to be thankful for what be be at lowest now must not be worse ediths astonishment aunt shaw dismay must have to be met bravely when letter came so margaret rose up began slowly to undress feeling full luxury of acting leisurely late a be after past hurry of day fell asleep hoping for brightness internal external if have known how long must be before brightness came heart must have sunk low down time of year be most unpropitious to health a well a to spirit mother caught severe cold dixon be evidently not well although margaret must not insult more than by trying to save by taking care of must hear of girl to assist be at work in factory at least who applied be well scolded by dixon for thinking such a must ever be trusted to work in gentleman house so have to keep charwoman in almost constant employ margaret longed to send for charlotte besides objection of being better servant than now must afford to keep distance be too great mr hale met with several pupil recommended to by mr bell by more immediate influence of mr thornton be mostly of age when many boy must be still at school according to prevalent apparently well founded notion of milton to make lad into good

longer youth men in prime of life who have stern wisdom to acknowledge own ignorance to learn late what must have learnt early mr thornton be perhaps oldest of mr hale pupil be certainly favourite mr hale got into habit of quoting opinion so frequently with such regard that became little domestic joke to wonder what time during hour appointed for instruction must be given to absolute learning so much of appeared to have be spent in conversation margaret rather encouraged light merry way of viewing father acquaintance with mr thornton because felt that mother be inclined to look upon new friendship of husband with jealous eye a long a time have be solely occupied with book parishioner a at helstone have appeared to care little whether saw much of not now that looked eagerly forward to renewal of intercourse with mr thornton seemed hurt annoyed a if be slighting companionship for first time mr hale over praise have usual effect of over praise upon auditor be little inclined to rebel against aristides being always called just after quiet life in country parsonage for more than twenty year there be something dazzling to mr hale in energy conquered immense difficulty with ease power of machinery of milton power of men of milton impressed with sense of grandeur yielded to without caring to inquire into detail of exercise margaret went le abroad among machinery men saw le of power

to margarets share to have to look out for servant to assist dixon who have at first undertaken to find just person wanted to do rough work of house dixons idea of helpful girl be founded on recollection of tidy elder scholar at helstone school who be only too proud to be allowed to come to parsonage on busy day treated mr dixon with respect good deal more of fright paid to mr mr hale dixon be not unconscious of awed reverence be given to did dislike flattered much a louis fourteenth be flattered by courtier shading eye from dazzling light of presence nothing short of faithful love for mr hale must have made endure rough independent way in milton girl who made application for servant place replied to inquiry respecting qualification even went length of questioning back again

man who only spent at certain rate margaret be weary impatient of account dixon perpetually brought to mr hale of behaviour of must be servant not what margaret be repelled by rough uncourteous manner of people not what shrunk with fastidious pride from hail fellow accost severely resented unconcealed curiosity a to mean position of family who lived in milton yet be not engaged in trade of kind more margaret felt impertinence more likely be to be silent on subject at rate if took upon to make inquiry for servant must spare mother recital of disappointment fancied real insult margaret accordingly went up down to butcher grocer seeking for nonpareil of girl lowering hope expectation week a found difficulty of meeting with one in manufacturing town who did not prefer better wage greater independence of working in mill be something of trial to margaret to go out by in busy bustling place mr shaw idea of propriety own helpless dependence on others have always made insist that

longed to ask to do for what saw compelled to do for father who took little finger thumb in masculine hand made serve a sugar tongue mr thornton saw beautiful eye lifted to father full of light half laughter half love a bit of pantomime went on between two unobserved a fancied by margarets head still ached a paleness of complexion silence might have testified be resolved to throw into breach if there be long untoward pause rather than father friend pupil guest must have cause to think in way neglected conversation went on margaret drew into corner near mother with work after tea thing be taken away felt that might let thought roam without fear of being suddenly wanted to fill up gap mr thornton mr hale be absorbed in continuation of object have be started at last meeting margaret be recalled to sense of present by trivial low spoken remark of mother on suddenly looking up from work eye be caught by difference of outward appearance between father mr thornton a betokening such

undulating kind of trembling movement passing over showing fluctuating emotion eyelid be large arched giving to eye peculiar languid beauty be almost feminine brow be finely arched be by very size of

up with inquiring wonder in eye how in world have got from cog wheel to chevy chace be boast of mine replied mr thornton be plain matter of fact wont deny be proud of belonging to town perhaps must rather say district necessity of give birth to such grandeur of conception must rather be man toiling suffering nay failing successless here than lead dull prosperous life in old worn groove of what call more aristocratic society down in south with slow day of careless ease one may be clogged with honey unable to rise fly be mistaken said margaret roused by aspersion on beloved south to fond vehemence of defence brought colour into cheek angry tear into eye know anything about south if there be le adventure le progress suppose must not say le excitement from gambling spirit of trade seems requisite to force out wonderful invention there be le suffering also see men here going about in street who look ground down by pinching sorrow care who be not only sufferer hater now in south have poor there be not that terrible expression in countenance of sullen sense of injustice see here know south mr thornton concluded collapsing into determined silence angry with for having said so much may say know north asked with inexpressible gentleness in tone a saw that have really hurt continued resolutely silent yearning after lovely haunt have left far away in hampshire with passionate longing made feel voice must be unsteady trembling if spoke at rate mr thornton said mr hale will allow milton be much more smoky dirty town than will ever meet with in south im afraid must give up

a to what great future lay concealed in rude model of sir richard arkwrights rapid development of what might be called new trade gave early master enormous power of wealth command dont mean merely over workman mean over purchaser over whole world market why may give a instance advertisement inserted not fifty year ago in milton paper so so one of half dozen calico printer of time must close warehouse at noon day therefore purchaser must come before hour fancy man dictating in manner time when must sell when must not sell now believe if good customer chose to come at midnight must get up stand hat in hand to receive order margarets lip curled somehow be compelled to listen must no longer abstract in own thought only name such thing to show what almost unlimited power manufacturer have about beginning of century men be rendered dizzy by because man be successful in venture there be reason that in other thing mind must be well balanced on contrary sense of justice simplicity be often utterly smothered under glut of wealth came down upon tell strange tale of wild extravagance of living indulged in on gala day by early cotton lord there can be doubt too of tyranny exercised over work people know proverb mr hale set beggar on horseback hell ride to devil well of early manufacturer did ride to devil in magnificent style crushing human bone flesh under horse hoof without remorse by by came reaction there be more factory more master more men be wanted power of master men became more evenly balanced now battle be pretty fairly waged between will hardly submit to decision of umpire much le to interference of meddler with only smattering of knowledge of real fact of case even though meddler be called high court of parliament be there necessity for calling battle between two class asked mr hale know from using term be one give true idea of real state of thing to mind be true believe to be a much necessity a prudent wisdom good conduct be always opposed to doing battle with ignorance improvidence be one of great beauty of system that working man may raise into power position of master by own exertion behaviour that in fact one who rule to decency sobriety of conduct attention to duty come over to rank may not be always a master a overlooker cashier book keeper clerk one on side of authority order consider who be unsuccessful in raising in world from cause a enemy then if understand rightly said margaret in clear cold voice a own enemy certainly said quickly not little piqued by haughty disapproval form of expression tone of speaking implied in moment straightforward honesty made feel that word be poor quibbling answer to what have said be a scornful a liked be duty owed to to explain a truly a must what did mean yet be very difficult to separate interpretation keep distinct from meaning must best have illustrated what wanted to say by telling something of own life be not too personal subject to speak about to stranger still be simple straightforward way of explaining meaning so putting aside touch of shyness brought momentary flush of colour into dark cheek said be not speaking without book sixteen year ago father died under very miserable circumstance be taken from school have to become man a well a must in few day have such mother a few be blest with woman of strong power firm resolve went into small country town where living be cheaper than in milton where got employment in draper shop capital place by way for obtaining knowledge of good week by week income came to fifteen shilling out of three people have to be kept mother managed so that put by three out of fifteen shilling regularly made beginning taught denial now that be able to afford mother such comfort a age rather than own wish requires thank silently on occasion for early training gave now when feel that in own case be good luck merit talent simply habit of life taught to despise indulgence not thoroughly earned indeed never to think twice about believe that suffering miss hale say be impressed on countenance of people of milton be natural punishment of dishonestly enjoyed pleasure at former period of life look on indulgent sensual people a worthy of hatred simply look upon with contempt for poorness of character have rudiment of good education remarked mr hale quick zest with be now reading homer show that come to a unknown book have read before be only recalling old knowledge be true have blundered along at school dare say be even considered pretty fair classic in day though latin greek have slipt away from since ask what preparation be for life a have to lead none at utterly none at on point of education man who can read write start fair with in amount of really useful knowledge have at time well dont agree with there be perhaps somewhat of pedant did not recollection of heroic simplicity of homeric life nerve up not one bit exclaimed mr thornton laughing be too busy to think about dead people with living pressing alongside of neck to neck in struggle for bread now have mother safe in quiet peace becomes age duly reward former exertion can turn to old narration thoroughly enjoy dare say remark came from professional feeling of there being nothing like leather replied mr hale when mr thornton rose up to go away after shaking hand with mr mr hale made advance to margaret to wish good bye in similar manner be frank familiar custom of place margaret be not prepared for simply bowed farewell although instant saw hand half put out quickly drawn back be sorry have not be aware of intention mr thornton however knew nothing of sorrow drawing up to full height walked off muttering a left house more proud disagreeable girl never saw even great beauty be blotted out of one memory by scornful way chapter xi first impression there iron say in blood grain two perhaps be good make harshly feel have got little too much of steel anon margaret said mr hale a returned from showing guest downstairs must not help watching face with anxiety when mr thornton made confession of having be shop boy knew all along from mr bell so be aware of what be coming half expected to see get up leave room oh papa dont mean that thought so silly really liked that account of better than anything else said everything else revolted from hardness spoke about so simply with so little of pretence make vulgarity of shop people with such tender respect for mother be le likely to leave room then than when be boasting about milton a if there be not such place in world quietly professing to despise people for careless wasteful improvidence without ever seeming to think duty to try to make different to give anything of training mother gave to evidently owes position whatever may be statement of having be shop boy be thing liked best of be surprised at margaret said mother who be always accusing people of being shoppy at helstone dont think mr hale have done quite right in introducing person to without telling what have be really be very much afraid of showing how much shocked be at part of what said father dying in miserable circumstance why might have be in workhouse be not sure be not

quietly round to creditor paying first instalment of money owing to noise no gathering together of creditor be done very silently quietly be paid at last helped on materially by circumstance of one of creditor crabbed old fellow mr bell say taking in mr thornton a kind of partner that really be fine said margaret what pity nature must be tainted by position a milton manufacturer how tainted asked father oh papa by testing everything by standard of wealth when spoke of mechanical power evidently looked upon only a new way of extending trade making money poor men around be poor because be vicious out of pale of sympathy because have not iron nature capability that give for being rich not vicious never said that improvident indulgent be word margaret be collecting mother working material preparing to go to bed just a be leaving room hesitated be inclined to make acknowledgment thought must please father to be full true must include little annoyance however out came papa do

judgment firm resolution served in good stead of long argument discussion with felt instinctively that nothing must strengthen fanny to endure hardship patiently face difficulty bravely though winced a made acknowledgment to herself about daughter only gave kind of pitying tenderness of manner towards much of same description of demeanour with mother be wont to treat weak sickly child stranger careless observer might have considered that mr thornton manner to child betokened far more love to fanny than to john one must have be deeply mistaken very daringness with mother son spoke out unpalatable truth one to other showed reliance on firm centre of others soul uneasy tenderness of mr thornton manner to daughter shame with thought to hide poverty of child in grand quality possessed

keen bright little spot of positive enjoyment having come sparkling into very middle of sorrow year ago when first went to helstone first became silently conscious of querulousness in mother temper must have groaned bitterly over idea of long illness to be borne in strange desolate noisy busy place with diminished comfort on side of home life with increase of serious just ground of complaint new kind of patience have sprung up in mother mind be gentle quiet in intense bodily suffering almost in proportion a have be restless depressed when there have be no real cause for grief mr hale be in exactly stage of apprehension in men of stamp take shape of wilful blindness be more irritated than margaret have ever known at daughter expressed anxiety indeed margaret be growing fanciful god know

long after slow languid undressing be finished long after a began to listen a lay in bed chapter xiv meeting be used to sleep at night a sweetly a child now if wind blew rough made start think of poor boy tossing about upon roaring sea then seemed to feel that be hard to take from for little fault southey be comfort to margaret about time to find that mother drew more tenderly intimately towards than have ever done since day of childhood took to heart a confidential friend post margaret have always longed to fill have envied dixon for being preferred to margaret took pain to respond to call made upon for sympathy be many even when bore relation to trifle must no more have noticed regarded than elephant must perceive little pin at foot yet lift carefully up at bidding of keeper unconsciously margaret drew near to reward one evening mr hale being absent mother began to talk to about brother frederick very subject on margaret have longed to ask question almost only one on timidity overcame natural openness more wanted to hear about le likely be to speak oh margaret be so windy last night came howling down chimney in room must not sleep never can when there be such terrible wind got into wakeful habit when poor frederick be at sea now even if dont waken at once dream of in stormy sea with great clear glass green wall of wave on side ship far higher than very mast curling over with cruel terrible white foam like gigantic crested serpent be old dream always come back on windy night till be thankful to waken sitting straight stiff up in bed with terror poor frederick be on land now so wind can do harm though did think might shake down of tall chimney where be frederick now mamma letter be directed to care of messrs barbour at cadiz know where be cant

letter to show ill believe though be son sooner than court martial on earth go to little japan cabinet dear in second left hand drawer will find packet of letter margaret went there be yellow sea stained letter with peculiar fragrance ocean letter have margaret carried back to mother who untied silken string with trembling finger examining date gave to margaret to read making hurried anxious remark on content almost before daughter must have understood what be see margaret how from very first disliked captain reid be second lieutenant in ship orion in frederick sailed very first time poor little fellow how well looked in midshipman dress with dirk in hand cutting open newspaper with a if be paper knife mr reid a be then seemed to take dislike to frederick from very beginning then stay be letter wrote on board russell when be appointed to found old enemy captain reid in command did mean to bear tyranny patiently look be letter just read margaret where be say stop father may rely upon will bear with proper patience everything one officer gentleman can take from from former knowledge of present captain confess look forward with apprehension to long course of tyranny on board russell see promise to bear patiently be sure did for be sweetest tempered boy when be not vexed must possibly be be that letter in speaks of captain reid impatience with men for not going through ship manuvres a quickly a avenger see say that have many new hand on board russell while avenger have be nearly three year on station with nothing to do to keep slaver off work men till ran up down rigging like rat monkey margaret slowly read letter half illegible through fading of ink might be probably be statement of captain reid imperiousness in trifle very much exaggerated by narrator who have written while fresh warm from scene of altercation sailor being aloft in main topsail rigging captain have ordered to race down threatening hindmost with cat of nine tail who be farthest on spar feeling impossibility of passing companion yet passionately dreading disgrace of flogging threw desperately down to catch rope considerably lower failed fell senseless on deck only survived for few hour afterwards indignation of ship crew be at boiling point when young hale wrote did not receive letter till long long after heard of mutiny poor fred dare say be comfort to to write even though must not have known how to send poor fellow then saw report in paper thats to say long before freds letter reached of atrocious mutiny having broken out on board russell that mutineer have remained in possession of ship have gone off be supposed to be pirate captain reid be sent adrift in boat with men officer something whose name be given for be picked up by west indian steamer oh margaret how father turned sick over list when there be name of frederick hale thought must be mistake for poor fred be such fine fellow only perhaps rather too passionate hoped that name of carr be in list be misprint for of hale newspaper be so careless towards post time next day papa set off to walk to southampton to get paper must not stop at home so went to meet be very late much later than thought must have be sat down under hedge to wait for came at last arm hanging loose down head sunk walking heavily along a if step be labour trouble margaret see now dont go on mamma can understand said margaret leaning up caressingly against mother side kissing hand cant margaret one can who did not see then must hardly lift up to go meet everything seemed so to reel around at once when got to did not speak seem surprised to see there more than three mile from home beside oldham beech tree put arm in kept stroking hand a if wanted to soothe to be very quiet under great heavy blow when trembled so all over must not speak took in arm stooped down head on mine began to shake to cry in strange muffled groaning voice till for very fright stood quite still only begging to tell what have heard then with hand jerking a if one else moved against will gave wicked newspaper to read calling frederick traitor of blackest dye base ungrateful disgrace to profession oh can not tell what bad word did not use took paper in hand a soon a have read tore up to little bit tore oh believe margaret tore with teeth did not cry must not cheek be a hot a fire very eye burnt in head saw father looking grave at said be lie so be month after letter came see what provocation frederick have be not for own injury rebelled must speak mind to captain reid so went on from bad to worse see most of sailor stuck by frederick think margaret continued after pause in weak trembling exhausted voice be glad of be prouder of frederick standing up against injustice than if have be simply good officer be sure be said margaret in firm decided tone loyalty obedience to wisdom justice be fine be still finer to defy arbitrary power unjustly cruelly used not on behalf of ourselves on behalf of others more helpless for wish must see frederick once more just once be first baby margaret mr hale spoke wistfully almost a if apologising for yearning craving wish a though be depreciation of remaining child such idea never crossed margarets mind be thinking how mother desire must be fulfilled be six seven year ago must still prosecute mother if came stood trial what must be punishment surely might bring evidence of great provocation must do good replied mr hale of sailor who accompanied frederick be taken there be court martial held on on board amicia believed said in defence poor fellow because just agreed with frederick story be of use for first time during conversation mr hale began to cry yet something possessed margaret to force information foresaw yet dreaded from mother what happened to mamma asked be hung at yard arm said mr hale solemnly worst be that court in condemning to death said have suffered to be led astray from duty by superior officer be silent for long time frederick be in south america for several year be not yes now be in spain at cadiz somewhere near if come to england will be hung will never see face again for if come to england will be hung there be comfort to be given mr hale turned face to wall lay perfectly still in mother despair nothing must be said to console took hand out of margarets with little impatient movement a if must fain be left alone with recollection of son when mr hale came in margaret went out oppressed with gloom seeing promise of brightness on side of horizon chapter xv master men thought fight with thought out spring spark of truth from collision of sword shield w s landor margaret said father next day must return mr thornton call mother be not very well think can not walk so far will go afternoon a went mr hale began about wife health with kind of veiled anxiety margaret be glad to see awakened at last did consult doctor margaret did send for papa spoke of coming to see now be well if only knew of good doctor must go afternoon ask to come for be sure mamma be seriously indisposed put truth thus plainly strongly because father have so completely shut mind against idea when have last named fear now case be changed answered in despondent tone do think have hidden complaint do think be really very ill have dixon said anything oh margaret be haunted by fear that coming to milton have killed poor maria oh papa dont imagine such thing said margaret shocked be not well that be many one be not well for time with good advice get better stronger than ever have dixon said anything about know dixon enjoys making mystery out of trifle have be little mysterious about mamma health have alarmed rather be without reason dare say know papa said other day be getting fanciful hope trust be dont think of what said then like to be fanciful about mother health dont be afraid of telling fancy like to hear though dare say spoke a if be annoyed will ask mr thornton if can tell of good doctor wont throw away money on one first rate stay turn up street street did not look a if must contain house large enough for mr thornton habitation son presence never gave impression a to kind of house lived in unconsciously margaret have imagined that tall massive handsomely dressed mr thornton must live in house of same character a herself now marlborough street consisted of long row of small house with blank wall here there at least be must see from point at entered told lived in marlborough street im sure said mr hale with much perplexed air perhaps be one of economy still practises to live in very small house here be plenty of people about let ask accordingly inquired of passer by be informed that mr thornton lived close to mill have factory lodge door pointed out to at end of long dead wall have noticed lodge door be like common garden door on one side of be great closed gate for ingres egress of lorry wagon lodge keeper admitted into great oblong yard on one side of be office for transaction of business on opposite immense many windowed mill whence proceeded continual clank of machinery long groaning roar of steam engine enough to deafen who lived within enclosure opposite to wall along street ran on one of narrow side of oblong be handsome stone coped house blackened to be sure by smoke with paint window step kept scrupulously clean be evidently house have be built fifty sixty year stone facing long narrow window number of flight of step up to front door ascending from side guarded by railing witnessed to age margaret only wondered why people who must afford to live in so good house keep in such perfect order did not prefer much smaller dwelling in country even suburb not in continual whirl din of factory unaccustomed ear must hardly catch father voice a stood on step awaiting opening of door yard too with great door in dead wall a boundary be dismal look out for sitting room of house a margaret found when have mounted old fashioned stair be ushered into drawing room three window of went over front door room on right hand side of entrance there be one in drawing room seemed a though one have be in since day when furniture be bagged up with a much care a if house be to be overwhelmed with lava discovered thousand year hence wall be pink gold pattern on carpet represented bunch of flower on light ground be carefully covered up in centre by linen drugget glazed colourless window curtain be lace chair sofa have own particular veil of netting knitting great alabaster group occupied flat surface safe from dust under glass shade in middle of room right under bagged up chandelier be large circular table with smartly bound book arranged at regular interval round circumference of polished surface like gaily coloured spoke of wheel everything reflected light nothing absorbed whole room have painfully spotted spangled speckled look about impressed margaret so unpleasantly that be hardly conscious of peculiar cleanliness required to keep everything so white pure in such atmosphere of trouble must be willingly expended to secure effect of icy snowy discomfort wherever looked there be evidence of care labour not care labour to procure ease to help on habit of tranquil home employment solely to ornament then to preserve ornament from dirt destruction have leisure to observe to speak to other in low voice before mr thornton appeared be talking of what world might hear be common effect of such room a to make people speak low a if unwilling to awaken unused echo at last mr thornton came in rustling in handsome black silk a be wont muslin lace rivalling not excelling pure whiteness of muslin netting of room margaret explained how be that mother must not accompany to return mr thornton call in anxiety not to bring back father fear too vividly gave bungling account left impression on mr thornton mind that mr hale be temporary fanciful fine ladyish indisposition might have be put aside have there be strong enough motive that if be too severe to allow to come out day call might have be deferred remembering too horse to carriage hired for own visit to hale how fanny have be ordered to go by mr thornton in order to pay respect to mr thornton drew up slightly offended gave margaret sympathy indeed hardly credit for statement of mother indisposition how be mr thornton asked mr hale be afraid be not well from hurried note yesterday son be rarely ill when be never speaks about make excuse for not doing anything told must not get leisure to read with last night sir regretted be sure value hour spent with be sure be equally agreeable to said mr hale make feel young again to see enjoyment appreciation of be fine in classical literature have doubt that classic be very desirable for people who have leisure confess be against judgment that son renewed study of time place in life seem to to require energy attention classic may do very well for men who loiter away life in country in college milton men ought to have thought power absorbed in work of to day at least be opinion last clause gave out with pride that ape humility surely if mind be too long directed to one object only will get stiff rigid unable to take in many interest said margaret quite understand what mean by mind getting stiff rigid do admire whirligig character be full of thing to day to be utterly forgetful of in new interest to morrow having many interest doe not suit life of milton manufacturer be ought to be enough for to have one great desire to bring purpose of life to bear on fulfilment of be asked mr hale sallow cheek flushed eye lightened a answered to hold maintain high honourable place among merchant of country men of town place son have earned for go where will dont say in england only in europe name of john thornton of milton be known respected amongst men of business of course be unknown in fashionable circle continued scornfully idle gentleman lady be not likely to know much of milton manufacturer unless get into parliament marries lord daughter mr hale margaret have uneasy ludicrous consciousness that have never heard of great name until mr bell have written word that mr thornton must be good friend to have in milton proud mother world be not world of harley street gentility on one hand country clergyman hampshire squire on other margarets face in spite of endeavour to keep simply listening in expression told sensitive mr thornton feeling of hers think never heard of wonderful son of mine miss hale think im old woman whose idea be hounded by milton whose own crow be whitest ever seen said margaret with spirit may be true be thinking have hardly heard mr thornton name before came to milton since have come here have heard enough to make respect admire to feel how much justice truth there be in what have said of who spoke to of asked mr thornton little mollified yet jealous lest one el word must not have done full justice margaret hesitated before replied did not like authoritative questioning mr hale came in a thought to rescue be what mr thornton said that made know kind of man be be not margaret mr thornton drew up said son be not one to tell of own doings may again ask miss hale from whose account formed favourable opinion of mother be curious greedy of commendation of child know margaret replied be a much from what mr thornton withheld of have be told of previous life by mr bell be more that than what said that made feel what reason have to be proud of mr bell what can know of john living lazy life in drowsy college im obliged to miss hale many missy young lady must have shrunk from giving old woman pleasure of hearing that son be well spoken of why asked margaret looking straight at mr thornton in bewilderment why because suppose might have conscience told how surely be making old mother into advocate for in case have plan on son heart smiled grim smile for have be pleased by margarets frankness perhaps felt that have be asking question too much a if have right to catechise margaret laughed outright at notion presented to laughed so merrily that grated on mr thornton ear a if word called forth that laugh must have be utterly entirely ludicrous margaret stopped merriment a soon a saw mr thornton annoyed look beg pardon madam really be very much obliged to for exonerating from making plan on mr thornton heart young lady have before now said mr thornton stiffly hope miss thornton be well put in mr hale desirous of changing current of conversation be a well a ever be be not strong replied mr thornton shortly mr thornton suppose may hope to see on thursday can not answer for son engagement there be uncomfortable work going on in town threatening of strike if so experience judgment will make much consulted by friend must think must come on thursday at rate be sure will let know if can not strike asked margaret what for what be going to strike for for mastership ownership of other people property said mr thornton with fierce snort be what always strike for if son work people strike will only say be pack of ungrateful hound have doubt will be wanting higher wage suppose asked mr hale be face of thing truth be want to be master make master into slave on own ground be always trying at always have in mind five six year there come struggle between master men theyll find mistaken time fancy little out of reckoning if turn out maynt find so easy to go in again believe master have thing two in head will teach men not to strike again in hurry if try time doe make town very rough asked margaret of course doe surely be not coward be milton be not place for coward have known time when have have to thread way through crowd of white angry men swearing must have makinsons blood a soon a ventured to show nose out of factory knowing nothing of one have to go tell be dead man needed to be woman so went when got in must not get out be a much a life be worth so went up to roof where there be stone piled ready to drop on head of crowd if tried to force factory door must have lifted heavy stone dropped with a good aim a best man there that fainted with heat have gone through if live in milton must learn to have brave heart miss hale must do best said margaret rather pale know whether be brave not till be tried be afraid must be coward south country people be often frightened by what darkshire men woman only call living struggling when youve be ten year among people who be always owing better grudge only waiting for opportunity to pay off youll know whether be coward not take word for mr thornton came that evening to mr hale be shown up into drawing room where mr hale be reading aloud to wife daughter be come partly to bring note from mother partly to apologise for not keeping to time yesterday note contains address asked for dr donaldson thank said margaret hastily holding out hand to take note for did not wish mother to hear that have be making inquiry about doctor be pleased that mr thornton seemed immediately to understand feeling gave note without word of explanation mr hale began to talk about strike mr thornton face assumed likeness to mother worst expression immediately repelled watching margaret yes fool will have strike let suit well enough gave chance think trade be flourishing a be last year see storm on horizon draw in sail because dont explain reason wont believe be acting reasonably must give line letter for way choose to spend save money henderson tried dodge with men out at ashley failed rather wanted strike must have suited book well enough so when men came to ask for five per cent be claiming told em hed think about give answer on pay day knowing while what answer must be of course thinking hed strengthen conceit of own way however be too deep for heard something about bad prospect of trade so in came on friday drew back claim now he obliged to go on working milton master have to day sent in decision wont advance penny tell may have to lower wage cant afford to raise so here stand waiting for next attack what will be asked mr hale conjecture simultaneous strike will see milton without smoke in few day imagine miss hale why asked must not explain what good reason have for expecting bad trade dont know whether use right word will understand what mean do give servant reason for expenditure economy in use of own money owner of capital have right to choose what will do with human right said margaret very low beg pardon did not hear what said must rather not repeat said related to feeling think must share wont try pleaded thought suddenly bent upon learning what have said be displeased with pertinacity did not choose to affix too much importance to word said have human right meant that there seemed reason religious one why must not do what like with own know differ in religious opinion dont give credit for having though not same a yours be speaking in subdued voice a if to alone did not wish to be so exclusively addressed replied out in usual tone think have occasion to consider special religious opinion in affair meant to say be that there be human law to prevent employer from utterly wasting throwing away money if choose that there be passage in bible must rather imply to at least that neglected duty a steward if did so however know so little about strike rate of wage capital labour have better not talk to political economist like nay more reason said eagerly will only be too glad to explain to may seem anomalous mysterious to stranger especially at time like when doings be sure to be canvassed by scribbler who can hold pen thank answered coldly of course will apply to father in first instance for information can give if get puzzled with living here amongst strange society think strange why dont know suppose because on very face of see two class dependent on other in possible way yet evidently regarding interest of other a opposed to own never lived in place before where there be two set of people always running other down who have heard running master down dont ask who have heard abusing men for see persist in misunderstanding what said other day who have heard abusing master margaret reddened then smiled a said be not fond of being catechised refuse to answer question besides have nothing to do with fact must take word for have heard people may be only one of workpeople speak a though be interest of employer to keep from acquiring money that must make too independent if have sum in saving bank dare say be that man higgins who told said mr hale mr thornton did not appear to hear what margaret evidently did not wish to know caught nevertheless heard moreover that be considered to advantage of master to have ignorant workman not hedge lawyer a captain lennox used to call men in company who questioned must know reason for order latter part of sentence addressed rather to father than to mr thornton who be captain lennox asked mr thornton of with strange kind of displeasure prevented for moment from replying to father took up conversation never be fond of school margaret must have seen known before how much be being done for education in milton said with sudden meekness know care enough about school knowledge ignorance of be speaking did not relate to reading writing teaching information one can give to child be sure that what be meant be ignorance of wisdom that will guide men woman hardly know what be be informant spoke a if master must like hand to be merely tall large child living in present moment with blind unreasoning kind of obedience in short miss hale be very evident that informant found pretty ready listener to slander chose to utter against master said mr thornton in offended tone margaret did not reply be displeased at personal character mr thornton affixed to what have said mr hale spoke next must confess that although have not become so intimately acquainted with workman a margaret have be very much struck by antagonism between employer employed on very surface of thing even gather impression from what yourself have from time to time said mr thornton paused awhile before spoke have just left room be vexed at state of feeling between however little annoyance by making cooler more thoughtful gave greater dignity to what said theory be that interest be identical with of workpeople vice versa miss hale know doe not like to hear men called hand so wont use that word though come most readily to lip a technical term whose origin whatever be date before time on future day in millennium in utopia unity may be brought into practice just a can fancy republic most perfect form of government will read plato republic a soon a have finished homer well in platonic year may fall out that be men woman child fit for republic give constitutional monarchy in present state of moral intelligence in infancy require wise despotism to govern indeed long past infancy child young people be happiest under unfailing law of discreet firm authority agree with miss hale so far a to consider people in condition of child while deny that master have anything to do with making keeping so maintain that despotism be best kind of government for so that in hour in come in contact with must necessarily be autocrat will use best discretion from humbug philanthropic feeling of have have rather too much in north to make wise law come to just decision in conduct of business law decision work for own good in first instance for theirs in second will neither be forced to give reason flinch from what have once declared to be resolution let turn out will suffer a well a in end will find have not bated altered one jot margaret have re entered room be sitting at work did not speak mr hale answered dare say be talking in great ignorance from little know must say that mass be already passing rapidly into troublesome stage intervenes between childhood manhood in life of multitude a well a of individual now error many parent commit in treatment of individual at time be insisting on same unreasoning obedience a when have to do in way of duty be to obey simple law of come when youre called do a youre bid wise parent humour desire for independent action so a to become friend adviser when absolute rule will cease if get wrong in reasoning recollect be who adopted analogy very lately said margaret heard story of what happened in nuremberg only three four year ago rich man there lived alone in one of immense mansion be formerly dwelling warehouse be reported that have child one knew of for certain for forty year rumour kept rising falling never utterly dying away after death be found to be true have son overgrown man with unexercised intellect of child whom have kept up in strange way in order to save from temptation error of course when great old child be turned loose in world bad counsellor have power over did not know good from evil father have made blunder of bringing up in ignorance taking for innocence after fourteen month of riotous living city authority have to take charge of in order to save from starvation must not even use word effectively enough to be successful beggar used comparison suggested by miss hale of position of master to of parent so ought not to complain of turning simile into weapon against mr hale when be setting up wise parent a model for said humoured child in desire for independent action now certainly time be not come for hand to have independent action during business hour hardly know what must mean by then say that master must be trenching on independence of hand in way that for one must not feel justified in doing if interfered too much with life lead out of mill because labour ten hour day for see that have right to impose leading string upon for rest of time value own independence so highly that can fancy degradation greater than of having man perpetually directing advising lecturing even planning too closely in way about action might be wisest of men most powerful must equally rebel resent interference imagine be stronger feeling in north of england than in south beg pardon be not that because there have be none of equality of friendship between adviser advised class because man have have to stand in unchristian isolated position apart from jealous of brother man constantly afraid of right being trenched upon only state fact be sorry to say have appointment at eight oclock must just take fact a find to night without trying to account for indeed must make difference in determining how to act a thing stand fact must be granted said margaret in low voice seems to that make difference in world father made sign to to be silent allow mr thornton to finish what have to say be already standing up preparing to go must grant one point given strong feeling of independence in darkshire man have right to obtrude view of manner in will act upon hating a must do most vehemently merely because have labour to sell capital to buy not in least said margaret determined to say just one thing not in least because of labour capital position whatever be because be man dealing with set of men over whom have whether reject use of not immense power just because life welfare be so constantly intimately interwoven god have made so that must be mutually dependent may ignore own dependence refuse to acknowledge that others depend upon in more respect than payment of weekly wage thing must be nevertheless other master can help yourselves most proudly independent man depends on around for insensible influence on character life most isolated of darkshire ego have dependant clinging to on side can not shake off more than great rock resembles can shake off pray dont go into simile margaret have led off once already said father smiling yet uneasy at thought that be detaining mr thornton against will be mistake for rather liked a long a margaret must talk although what said only irritated just tell miss hale be ever influenced be not fair way of putting if be ever conscious of being influenced by others not by circumstance have others be working directly indirectly have be labouring to exhort to enjoin to act rightly for sake of example have be simple true men taking up duty doing unflinchingly without thought of how action be to make man industrious that man saving why if be workman must be twenty time more impressed by knowledge that master be honest punctual quick resolute in doings hand be keener spy even than valet than by amount of interference however kindly meant with way of going on out of work hour choose to think too closely on what be believe rely on straightforward honesty of hand open nature of opposition in contra distinction to way in turn out will be managed in mill just because know scorn to take single dishonourable advantage do underhand thing go farther than whole course of lecture on honesty be best policy life diluted into word what master be will men be without over much taking thought on part be great admission said margaret laughing when see men violent obstinate in pursuit of right may safely infer that master be same that be little ignorant of spirit suffereth long be kind seeketh not own be just like stranger who dont understand working of system miss hale said hastily suppose that men be puppet of dough ready to be moulded into amiable form please forget have only to do with for le than third of life seem not to perceive that duty of manufacturer be far larger wider than merely of employer of labour have wide commercial character to maintain make into great pioneer of civilisation strike said mr hale smiling that might pioneer little at home be rough heathenish set of fellow milton men of yours be replied mr thornton rose water surgery wont do for cromwell must have made capital mill owner miss hale wish have to put down strike for cromwell be hero of mine said coldly be trying to reconcile admiration of despotism with respect for other men independence of character reddened at tone choose to be unquestioned irresponsible master of hand during hour labour for hour past relation cease then come in same respect for independence that exact did not speak again for minute be too much vexed shook off bade mr mr hale good night then drawing near to margaret said in lower voice spoke hastily to once evening be afraid rather rudely know be uncouth milton manufacturer will forgive certainly said smiling up in face expression of be somewhat anxious oppressed hardly cleared away a met sweet sunny countenance out of north wind effect of discussion have entirely vanished did not put out hand to again felt omission set down to pride chapter xvi shadow of death trust in veiled hand lead none by path that must go always be for change prepared for world law be ebb flow from arabic next afternoon dr donaldson came to pay first visit to mr mystery that margaret hoped late habit of intimacy have broken through be resumed be excluded from room while dixon be admitted margaret be not ready lover where loved loved passionately with small degree of jealousy went into mother bed room just behind drawing room paced

downstairs saw triumphed over obstacle dixon threw in way assuming rightful position a daughter of house in something of spirit of elder brother quelled old servant officiousness very effectually margarets conscious assumption of unusual dignity of demeanour towards dixon gave instant amusement in midst of anxiety knew from surprised expression on dixons face how ridiculously grand must be looking idea carried downstairs into room gave that length of oblivion from keen sharpness of recollection of actual business in hand now that came back seemed to take away breath be moment two before

patient enough to submit to prohibition besides be sure be too wise too experienced to have promised to keep secret well said half smiling though sadly enough there be right did not promise in fact fear secret will be known soon enough without revealing paused margaret then went very white compressed lip little more otherwise not feature moved with quick insight into character without medical man can rise to eminence of dr donaldson saw that must exact full truth that must know if one iota be withheld that withholding must be torture more acute than knowledge of spoke two short sentence in low voice watching time for pupil of eye dilated into black horror whiteness of complexion became livid ceased speaking waited for look to go off for gasping breath to come then said thank most truly sir for confidence that dread have haunted for many week be true real agony poor poor mother lip now began to quiver let have relief of tear sure of power of self control to check few tear be shed before recollected many question longed to ask will there be much suffering shook head that can not tell depends on constitution on thousand thing late discovery of medical science have given large power of alleviation father said margaret trembling over know mr hale mean be difficult to give advice must say bear on with knowledge have forced to give so abruptly till fact must not withhold have

irritated till must do something directed margaret to pack up basket in very drawing room to be sent there then to family be almost angry with for saying that must not signify if did not go till morning a knew higgins have provided for immediate want have left money with bessy mr hale called unfeeling for saying never gave breathing time till basket be sent out of house then said after may have be doing wrong be only last time mr thornton be here that said be true friend who helped to prolong struggle by assisting turn out boucher man be turn out be not question be referred to mr hale by wife when came upstairs fresh from giving lesson to mr thornton have ended in conversation a be wont margaret did not care if gift have prolonged strife did not think far enough for in present excited state mr hale listened tried to be a calm a judge recalled have seemed so clear not hour before a came out of mr thornton lip then made unsatisfactory compromise wife daughter have not only done quite right in instance did not see for moment how must have done otherwise nevertheless a general rule be very true what mr thornton said that a strike if prolonged must end in master bringing hand from distance if indeed final result be not a have often be before invention of machine must diminish need of hand at why be clear enough that kindest thing be to refuse help might bolster up in folly a to boucher must go see first thing in morning try find out what must be done for mr hale went next morning a proposed did not find boucher at home have long talk with wife promised to ask for infirmary order for seeing plenty provided by mr hale somewhat lavishly used by child who be master downstairs in father absence came back with more consoling cheerful account than margaret have dared to hope for indeed what have said night before have prepared father for so much worse state of thing by re action of imagination described a better than really be will go again see man said mr hale hardly know a yet how to compare one of house with helstone cottage see furniture here labourer must never have thought of buying food commonly used must consider luxury yet for very family there seems other resource now that weekly wage be stopped pawn shop one have need to learn different standard up here in milton bessy too be rather better day still be so weak that seemed to have entirely forgotten wish to see margaret dressed if indeed have not be feverish desire of half delirious state margaret must not help comparing strange dressing of hers to go where did not care to be heart heavy with various anxiety with old merry girlish toilette that edith have performed scarcely more than year ago only pleasure now in decking out be in thinking that mother must take delight in seeing dressed blushed when dixon throwing drawing room door open made appeal for admiration miss hale look well maam doesnt mr shaw coral couldnt have come in better just give right touch of colour maam otherwise miss margaret must have be too pale margarets black hair be too thick to be plaited needed rather to be twisted round round have fine silkiness compressed into massive coil encircled head like crown then be gathered into large spiral knot behind kept weight together by two large coral pin like small arrow for length white silk sleeve be looped up with string of same material on neck just below base of curved milk white throat there lay heavy coral bead oh margaret how must like to be going with to one of old barrington assembly taking a lady beresford used to take margaret kissed mother for little burst of maternal vanity must hardly smile at felt so much out of spirit must rather stay at home with much rather mamma nonsense darling be sure notice dinner well will like to hear how manage thing in milton particularly second course dear look what have instead of game mr hale must have be more than interested must have be astonished if have seen sumptuousness of dinner table appointment margaret with london cultivated taste felt number of delicacy to be oppressive one half of quantity must have be enough effect tighter more elegant be one of mr thornton rigorous law of hospitality that of separate dainty enough must be provided for guest to partake if felt inclined careless to abstemiousness in daily habit be part of pride to set feast before such of guest a cared for son shared feeling have never known though might have imagined have capability to relish kind of society that depended on exchange of superb meal even now though be denying personal expenditure of unnecessary sixpence have more than once regretted that invitation for dinner have be sent out still a be to be be glad to see old magnificence of preparation margaret father be first to arrive mr hale be anxiously punctual to time specified there be one upstairs in drawing room mr thornton fanny cover be taken off apartment blazed forth in yellow silk damask brilliantly flowered carpet corner seemed filled up with ornament until became weariness to eye presented strange contrast to bald ugliness of look out into great mill yard where wide folding gate be thrown open for admission of carriage mill loomed high on left hand side of window casting shadow down from many story darkened summer evening before time son be engaged up to last moment on business will be here directly mr hale may beg to take seat mr hale be standing at one of window a mr thornton spoke turned away saying dont find such close neighbourhood to mill rather unpleasant at time drew up never be not become so fine a to desire to forget source of son wealth power besides there be not such factory in milton one room alone be two hundred twenty square yard meant that smoke noise constant going out coming in of workpeople might be annoying agree with mr hale said fanny there be continual smell of steam oily machinery noise be perfectly deafening have heard noise be called music far more deafening engine room be at street end of factory hardly hear except in summer weather when window be open a for continual murmur of workpeople disturbs more than humming of hive of bee if think of at connect with son feel how belongs to that be head directs just now there be sound to come from mill hand have be ungrateful enough to turn out a perhaps have heard very business of spoke when entered have reference to step be going to take to make learn place expression on face always stern deepened into dark anger a said did clear away when mr thornton entered room for saw in instant weight of care anxiety must not shake off although guest received from greeting appeared cheerful cordial shook hand with margaret knew be first time hand have met though be perfectly unconscious of fact inquired after mr hale heard mr hale sanguine hopeful account glancing to margaret to understand how far agreed with father saw that dissenting shadow crossed face a looked with intention be struck anew with great beauty have never seen in such dress before yet now appeared that such elegance of attire be so befitting noble figure lofty serenity of countenance that ought to go always thus apparelled be talking to fanny about what must not hear saw sister restless way of continually arranging part of gown wandering eye now glancing here now there without purpose in observation contrasted uneasily with large soft eye that looked forth steadily at one object a if from out light beamed gentle influence of repose curving line of red lip just parted in interest of listening to what companion said head little bent forward so a to make long sweeping line from summit where light caught on glossy raven hair to smooth ivory tip of shoulder round white arm taper hand laid lightly across other perfectly motionless in pretty attitude mr thornton sighed a took in with one of sudden comprehensive glance then turned back to young lady threw with effort with heart soul into conversation with mr hale more people came more more fanny left margarets side helped mother to receive guest mr thornton felt that in influx one be speaking to margaret be restless under apparent neglect never went near did not look at only knew what be doing not doing better than knew movement of one else in room margaret be so unconscious of herself so much amused by watching other people that never thought whether be left unnoticed not somebody took down to dinner did not catch name did seem much inclined to talk to there be very animated conversation going on among gentleman lady for most part be silent employing in taking note of dinner criticising others dress margaret caught clue to general conversation grew interested listened attentively mr stranger whose visit to town be original germ of party be asking question relative to trade manufacture of place rest of gentleman milton men be giving answer explanation dispute arose be warmly contested be referred to mr thornton who have hardly spoken before who now gave opinion ground of be so clearly stated that even opponent yielded margarets attention be thus called to host whole manner a master of house entertainer of friend be so straightforward yet simple modest a to be thoroughly dignified margaret thought have never seen to so much advantage when have come to house there have be always something of over eagerness of kind of vexed annoyance seemed ready to pre suppose that be unjustly judged yet felt too proud to try make better understood now among fellow there be uncertainty a to position be regarded by a man of great force of character of power in many way there be need to struggle for respect have knew security of gave fine grand quietness to voice way margaret have missed before be not in habit of talking to lady what did say be little formal to margaret hardly spoke at be surprised to think how much enjoyed dinner knew enough now to understand many local interest nay even of technical word employed by eager millowners silently took very decided part in question be discussing at rate talked in desperate earnest not in used up style that wearied so in old london party wondered that with dwelling on manufacturer trade of place allusion be made to strike then pending did not yet know how coolly such thing be taken by master a having only one possible end to be sure men be cutting own throat a have done many time before if must be fool put into hand of rascally set of paid delegate must take consequence one two thought thornton looked out of spirit of course must lose by turn out be accident might happen to day thornton be a good to manage strike a one for be a iron chap a in milton hand have mistaken man in trying dodge on chuckled inwardly at idea of workman discomfiture defeat in attempt to alter one iota of what thornton have decreed be rather dull for margaret after dinner be glad when gentleman came not merely because caught father eye to brighten sleepiness up because must listen to something larger grander than petty interest lady have be talking about liked exultation in sense of power milton men have might be rather rampant in display savour of boasting still seemed to defy old limit of possibility in kind of fine intoxication caused by recollection of what have be achieved what yet must be if in cooler moment might not approve of spirit in thing still there be much to admire in forgetfulness of present in anticipated triumph over inanimate matter at future time none of must live to see be rather startled when mr thornton spoke to close at elbow must see be on side in discussion at dinner be not miss hale certainly then know so little about be surprised however to find from what mr horsfall said that there be others who thought in so diametrically

countenance of native of wild southern country ferocity enhances charm of childlike softness into look may melt away margaret might fear violence of impulsive nature thus occasionally betrayed there be nothing in to make distrust recoil in least from new found brother on contrary intercourse be peculiarly charming to from very first knew then how much responsibility have have to bear from exquisite sensation of relief felt in frederick presence understood father mother character weakness went along with careless freedom be yet most delicately careful not to hurt wound of feeling seemed to know instinctively when little of natural brilliancy of manner conversation must not jar on deep depression of father might relieve mother pain whenever must have be out of tune out of time patient

whisper for speaking above breath must have thought irreverent a long a there be one lying dead in house margaret have resolved not to mention crowning closing affright to father there be use in speaking about have ended well only thing to be feared be lest leonard must in way borrow money enough to effect purpose of following frederick to london hunting out there there be immense chance against success of such plan margaret determined not to torment by thinking of what must hing to prevent frederick must be a much on guard a must put in day two at most must be safely out of england

be idea that must see might possibly be able to comfort old friend margaret have difficulty in world to persuade father not to invite mr thornton have indescribable repugnance to step being taken night before funeral came stately note from mr thornton to miss hale saying that at son desire carriage must attend funeral if must not be disagreeable to family margaret tossed note to father oh dont let have form said let go alone papa dont care for else must have offered to go not have proposed sending empty carriage thought be so extremely averse to going margaret said mr hale in surprise so be dont want to come at must especially dislike idea of asking seems such mockery of mourning did not expect from startled father by bursting into tear have be so subdued in grief so thoughtful for others so gentle patient in thing that must not understand impatient way to night seemed agitated restless at tenderness father in turn now lavished upon only cried more passed so bad night that be ill prepared for additional anxiety caused by letter received from frederick mr lennox be out of town clerk said that must return by following tuesday at latest that might possibly be home on monday consequently after consideration frederick have determined upon remaining in london day two longer have thought of coming down to milton again temptation have be very strong idea of mr bell domesticated in father house alarm have received at last moment at railway station have made resolve to stay in london margaret might be assured must take precaution against being tracked by leonard margaret be thankful that received letter while father be absent in mother room if have be present must have expected to read aloud to must have raised in state of nervous alarm must have found impossible to soothe away there be not merely fact disturbed excessively of frederick detention in london there be allusion to recognition at last moment at milton possibility of pursuit made blood run cold how then must have affected father many time did margaret repent of having suggested urged on plan of consulting mr lennox at moment have seemed a if must occasion so little delay add so little to apparently small chance of detection yet everything that have since occurred have tended to make so undesirable margaret battled hard against regret of hers for what must not now be helped self reproach for having said what at time appeared to be wise after event be proving to have be so foolish father be in too depressed state of mind body to struggle healthily must succumb to cause for morbid regret over what must not be recalled margaret summoned up force to aid father seemed to have forgotten that have reason to expect letter from frederick that morning be absorbed in one idea that last visible token of presence of wife be to be carried away from from sight trembled pitifully a undertaker man be arranging crape drapery around looked wistfully at margaret when released tottered towards murmuring pray for margaret have strength left in can not pray give up because must try to bear indeed do know be god will can not see why died pray for margaret may have faith to pray be great strait child margaret sat by in coach almost supporting in arm repeating noble verse of holy comfort text expressive of faithful resignation that must remember voice never faltered gained strength by doing father lip moved after repeating well known text a word suggested be terrible to see patient struggling effort to obtain resignation have not strength to take into heart a part of margarets fortitude nearly gave way a dixon with slight motion of hand directed notice to nicholas higgins daughter standing little aloof deeply attentive to ceremonial nicholas wore usual fustian clothes have bit of black stuff sown round hat mark of mourning have never shown to daughter bessys memory mr hale saw nothing went on repeating to mechanically a be funeral service a be read by officiating clergyman sighed twice thrice when be ended then putting hand on margarets arm mutely entreated to be led away a if be blind faithful guide dixon sobbed aloud covered face with handkerchief be so absorbed in own grief that did not perceive that crowd attracted on such occasion be dispersing till be spoken to by one close at hand be mr thornton have be present time standing with bent head behind group of people so in fact one have recognised beg pardon can tell how mr hale be miss hale too must like to know how be of course sir be much a be to be expected master be terribly broke down miss hale bear up better than likely mr thornton must rather have heard that be suffering natural sorrow in first place there be selfishness enough in to have taken pleasure in idea that great love might come in to comfort console much same kind of passionate pleasure come stinging through mother heart when drooping infant nestle close to be dependent upon for everything delicious vision of what might have be in in spite of margarets repulse must have indulged only few day ago be miserably disturbed by recollection of what have seen near outwood station miserably disturbed be not strong enough be haunted by remembrance of handsome young man with whom stood in attitude of such familiar confidence remembrance shot through like agony till made clench hand tight in order to subdue pain at late hour so far from home took great moral effort to galvanise trust erewhile so perfect in margarets pure exquisite maidenliness into life a soon a effort ceased trust dropped down dead powerless sort of wild fancy chased other like dream through mind here be little bit of miserable gnawing confirmation bore up better than likely under grief have then hope to look to so bright that even in affectionate nature must come in to lighten dark hour of daughter newly made motherless yes knew how must love have not loved without gaining that instinctive knowledge of what capability be in soul must walk in glorious sunlight if man be worthy by power of loving to win back love even in mourning must rest with peaceful faith upon sympathy sympathy whose that other man that be be enough to make mr thornton pale grave face grow doubly wan stern at dixons answer suppose may call said coldly on mr hale mean will perhaps admit after to morrow so spoke a if answer be matter of indifference to be not so for pain longed to see author of although hated margaret at time when thought of gentle familiar attitude attendant circumstance have restless desire to renew picture in mind longing for very atmosphere breathed be in charybdis of passion must perforce circle circle ever nearer round fatal centre dare say sir master will see be very sorry to have to deny other day circumstance be not agreeable just then for reason other dixon never named interview that have have with mr thornton to margaret might have be mere chance so be that margaret never heard that have attended poor mother funeral chapter xxxiv false true truth will fail thee never never though thy bark be tempest driven though plank be rent riven truth will bear thee on for ever anon bearing up better than likely be terrible strain upon margaret sometimes thought must give way cry out with pain a sudden sharp thought came across even during apparently cheerful conversation with father that have no longer mother about frederick too there be great uneasiness sunday post intervened interfered with london letter on tuesday margaret be surprised disheartened to find that there be still letter be quite in dark a to plan father be miserable at uncertainty broke in upon lately acquired habit of sitting still in one easy chair for day together kept pacing up down room then out of heard upon landing opening shutting bed room door without apparent object tried to tranquillise by reading aloud be evident must not listen for long together how thankful be then that have kept to herself additional cause for anxiety produced by encounter with leonard be thankful to hear mr thornton announced visit must force father thought into channel came up straight to father whose hand took wrung without word holding in for minute two during time face eye look told of more sympathy than must be put into word then turned to margaret not better than likely did look stately beauty be dimmed with much watching with many tear expression on countenance be of gentle patient sadness nay of positive present suffering have not meant to greet otherwise than with late studied coldness of demeanour must not help going up to a stood little aside rendered timid by uncertainty of manner of late saying few necessary common place word in so tender voice that eye filled with tear turned away to hide emotion took work sate down very quiet silent mr thornton heart beat quick strong for time utterly forgot outwood lane tried to talk to mr hale presence always certain kind of pleasure to mr hale a power decision made opinion safe sure port be unusually agreeable to father a margaret saw presently dixon came to door said miss hale be wanted dixons manner be so flurried that margaret turned sick at heart something have happened to fred have doubt of that be well that father mr thornton be so much occupied by conversation what be dixon asked moment have shut drawing room door come way miss said dixon opening door of what have be mr hale bed chamber now margarets for father refused to sleep there again after wife death nothing miss said dixon choking little only police inspector want to see miss dare say about nothing at did name asked margaret almost inaudibly miss named nothing only asked if lived here if must speak to martha went to door let in have shown into master study went to to try if must do miss want margaret did not speak again till hand be on lock of study door here turned round said take care papa doe not come down mr thornton be with now inspector be almost daunted by haughtiness of manner a entered there be something of indignation expressed in countenance so kept down controlled that gave superb air of disdain there be surprise curiosity stood awaiting opening of business there not question did ask beg pardon maam duty obliges to ask few plain question man have died at infirmary in consequence of fall received at outwood station between hour of five six on thursday evening twenty sixth instant at time fall did not seem of much consequence be rendered fatal doctor say by presence of internal complaint man own habit of drinking large dark eye gazing straight into inspector face dilated little otherwise there be motion perceptible to experienced observation lip swelled out into richer curve than ordinary owing to enforced tension of muscle did not know what be usual appearance so a to recognise unwonted sullen defiance of firm sweeping line never blenched trembled fixed with eye now a paused before going on said almost a if must encourage in telling tale well go on be supposed that inquest will have to be held there be slight evidence to prove that blow push scuffle caused fall be provoked by poor fellow half tipsy impertinence to young lady walking with man who pushed deceased over edge of platform much be observed by one on platform who however thought more about matter a blow seemed of slight consequence there be also reason to identify lady with in case be not there said margaret still keeping expressionless eye fixed on face with unconscious look of sleep walker inspector bowed did not speak lady standing before showed emotion no fluttering fear anxiety no desire to end interview information have received be very vague one of porter rushing out to be in readiness for train have seen scuffle at other end of platform between leonard gentleman accompanied by lady heard noise before train have got to full speed after starting have be almost knocked down by headlong run of enraged half intoxicated leonard swearing cursing awfully have not thought more about till evidence be routed out by inspector who on making farther inquiry at railroad station have heard from station master that young lady gentleman have be there about hour lady remarkably handsome said by grocer assistant present at time to be miss hale living at crampton whose family dealt at shop there be certainty that one lady gentleman be identical with other pair there be great probability leonard have gone half mad with rage pain to nearest gin palace for comfort tipsy word have not be attended to by busy waiter there however remembered starting up cursing for not having sooner thought of electric telegraph for purpose unknown believed that left with idea of going there on way overcome by pain drink have lain down in road where police have found taken to infirmary there have never recovered sufficient consciousness to give distinct account of fall although once twice have have glimmering of sense sufficient to make authority send for nearest magistrate in hope that might be able to take down dying man deposition of cause of death when magistrate have come be rambling about being at sea mixing up name of captain lieutenant in indistinct manner with of fellow porter at railway last word be curse on cornish trick have said made hundred pound poorer than ought to have be inspector ran over in mind vagueness of evidence to prove that margaret have be at station unflinching calm denial gave to such supposition stood awaiting next word with composure appeared supreme then madam have denial that be lady accompanying gentleman who struck blow gave push caused death of poor man quick sharp pain went through margarets brain oh god that knew frederick be safe deep observer of human countenance might have seen momentary agony shoot out of great gloomy eye like torture of creature brought to bay inspector though very keen be not very deep observer be little struck notwithstanding by form of answer sounded like mechanical repetition of first reply not changed modified in shape so a to meet last question be not there said slowly heavily time never closed eye ceased from glassy dream like stare quick suspicion be aroused by dull echo of former denial be a if have forced to one untruth have be stunned out of power of varying put up book of note in very deliberate manner then looked up have not moved more than if have be great egyptian statue hope will not think impertinent when say may have to call on again may have to summon to appear on inquest prove alibi if witness be

did not know margaret hale be little abashed by real composure must have be mistake of identity went on be very unlikely maam that will have to do anything of kind hope will excuse for doing what be only duty although may appear impertinent margaret bowed head a went towards door lip be stiff dry must not speak even common word of farewell suddenly walked forward opened study door preceded to door of house threw wide open for exit kept eye upon in same dull fixed manner until be fairly out of house shut door went half way into study then turned back a if moved by passionate impulse locked door inside then went into study paused tottered forward paused again swayed for instant where stood fell prone on floor in dead swoon chapter xxxv expiation there nought so finely spun cometh to sun mr thornton sate on on felt that company gave pleasure to mr hale be touched by half spoken wishful entreaty that must remain little longer plaintive dont go yet poor friend put forth from time to time wondered margaret did not return be with view of seeing that lingered for hour in presence of one who be so thoroughly feeling nothingness of earth be reasonable self controlled be deeply interested in father said of death of heavy lull of brain have grown dull be curious how presence of mr thornton have power over mr hale to make unlock secret thought kept shut up even from margaret whether be that sympathy must be so keen show in so lively manner that be afraid of reaction upon whether be that to speculative mind kind of doubt presented at time pleading cry aloud to be resolved into certainty that knew must have shrunk from expression of such doubt nay from a capable of conceiving be reason must unburden better to mr thornton than to of thought fancy fear have be frost bound in brain till now mr thornton said very little sentence uttered added to mr hale reliance regard for be that paused in expression of remembered agony mr thornton two three word must complete sentence show how deeply meaning be entered into be doubt fear wandering uncertainty seeking rest finding none so tear blinded be eye mr thornton instead of being shocked seemed to have passed through very stage of thought must suggest where exact ray of light be to be found must make dark place plain man of action a be busy in world great battle there be deeper religion binding to god in heart in spite of strong wilfulness through mistake than mr hale have ever dreamed never spoke of such thing again a happened one conversation made peculiar people to other knit together in way loose indiscriminate talking about sacred thing can ever accomplish when be admitted how can there be holy of holy while margaret lay a still white a death on study floor have sunk under burden have be heavy in weight long carried have be very meek patient till at once faith have given way have groped in vain for help there be pitiful contraction of suffering upon beautiful brow although there be other sign of consciousness remaining mouth little while ago so sullenly projected in defiance be relaxed livid e par che de la sua labbia si mova uno spirto soave e pien damore chi va dicendo lanima sospira first symptom of returning life be quivering about lip little mute soundless attempt at speech eye be still closed quivering sank into stillness then feebly leaning on arm for instant to steady margaret gathered up rose comb have fallen out of hair with intuitive desire to efface trace of weakness bring into order again sought for although from time to time in course of search have to sit down recover strength head drooped forward hand meekly laid one upon other tried to recall force of temptation by endeavouring to remember detail have thrown into such deadly fright must not only understood two fact that frederick have be in danger of being pursued detected in london a not only guilty of manslaughter a more unpardonable leader of mutiny that have lied to save there be one comfort lie have saved if only by gaining additional time if inspector came again to morrow after have received letter longed for to assure of brother safety must brave shame stand in bitter penance lofty margaret acknowledging before crowded justice room if need be that have be a dog done thing if came before heard from frederick if returned a have half threatened in few hour why must tell that lie again though how word must come out after terrible pause for reflection reproach without betraying falsehood did not know must not tell repetition of must gain time time for frederick be roused by dixons entrance into room have just be letting out mr thornton have hardly gone ten step in street before passing omnibus stopped close by man got down came up to touching hat a did so be police inspector mr thornton have obtained for first situation in police have heard from time to time of progress of protg have not often met at first mr thornton did not remember name be watson george watson sir that got ah yes why be getting on famously hear yes sir ought to thank sir be on little matter of business made so bold a to speak to now believe be magistrate who attended to take down deposition of poor man who died in infirmary last night yes replied mr thornton went heard kind of rambling statement clerk said be of great use im afraid be drunken fellow though there be doubt came to death by violence at last one of mother servant be engaged to believe be in great distress to day what about why sir death be oddly mixed up with somebody in house saw coming out of just now be mr hale believe yes said mr thornton turning sharp round looking into inspector face with sudden interest what about why sir seems to have got pretty distinct chain of evidence inculpating gentleman who be walking with miss hale night at outwood station a man who struck pushed leonard off platform so caused death young lady denies that be there at time miss hale denies be there repeated mr thornton in altered voice tell what evening be what time about six oclock on evening of thursday twenty sixth walked on side by side in silence for minute two inspector be first to speak see sir there be like to be coroner inquest ive got young man who be pretty positive at least be at first since have heard of young lady denial say must not like to swear still he pretty positive that saw miss hale at station walking about with gentleman not five minute before time when one of porter saw scuffle set down to of leonard impudence led to fall caused death seeing come out of very house sir thought might make bold to ask if see always awkward having to do with case of disputed identity one doesnt like to doubt word of respectable young woman unless one have strong proof to contrary denied having be at station that evening repeated mr thornton in low brooding tone yes sir twice over a distinct a must be told must call again seeing just a be on way back from questioning young man who said be thought must ask advice a magistrate who saw leonard on death bed a gentleman who got berth in force be quite right said mr thornton dont take step till have seen again young lady will expect to call from what said only want to delay hour now three come to warehouse at four very well sir parted company mr thornton hurried to warehouse sternly forbidding clerk to allow one to interrupt went way to own private room locked door then indulged in torture of thinking over realising detail how must have lulled into unsuspicious calm in tearful image have mirrored not two hour before till have weakly pitied yearned towards forgotten savage distrustful jealousy with sight of unknown to at hour in place have inspired how must one so pure have stooped from decorous noble manner of bearing be decorous be hated for idea forced upon just for instant more yet while be present thrilled with old potency of attraction towards image then falsehood how terrible must be dread of shame to be revealed for after provocation given by such man a leonard be when excited by drinking might in probability be more than enough to justify one who came forward to state circumstance openly without reserve how creeping deadly that fear must bow down truthful margaret to falsehood must almost pity what must be end of must not have considered be entering upon if there be inquest young man came forward suddenly started up there must be inquest must save margaret must take responsibility of preventing inquest issue of from uncertainty of medical testimony have vaguely heard night before from surgeon in attendance must be doubtful doctor have discovered internal disease far advanced sure to prove fatal have stated that death might have be accelerated by fall by subsequent drinking exposure to cold if have known how margaret must have become involved in affair if have foreseen that must have stained whiteness by falsehood must have saved by word for question of inquest inquest have hung trembling in balance only night before miss hale might love be indifferent contemptuous to must yet do faithful act of service of must never know might despise woman whom have once loved must be kept from shame shame must be to pledge to lie in public court otherwise to stand acknowledge reason for desiring darkness rather than light very gray stern did mr thornton look a passed out through wondering clerk be away about hour scarcely le stern did look when returned although errand have be successful wrote two line on slip of paper put in envelope sealed up gave to one of clerk saying appointed watson who be packer in warehouse who went into police to call on at four oclock have just met gentleman from liverpool who wish to see before leaf town take care to give note to watson when call note contained word there will be inquest medical evidence not sufficient to justify take further step have not seen coroner will take responsibility well thought watson relief from awkward job none of witness seemed certain of anything except young woman be clear distinct enough porter at railroad have seen scuffle when found be likely to bring in a witness then might not have be scuffle only little larking leonard might have jumped off platform must not stick firm to anything jennings grocer shopman well be not quite so bad doubt if must have got up to oath after heard that miss hale flatly denied must have be troublesome job satisfaction now must go tell wont be wanted accordingly presented again at mr hale that evening father dixon must fain have persuaded margaret to go to bed of knew reason for low continued refusal to do so dixon have learnt part of truth only part margaret must not tell human being of what have said did not reveal fatal termination to leonard fall from platform so dixons curiosity combined with allegiance to urge margaret to go to rest appearance a lay on sofa showed too clearly that required did not speak except when spoken to tried to smile back in reply to father anxious look word of tender inquiry instead of smile wan lip resolved into sigh be so miserably uneasy that at last consented to go into own room prepare for going to bed be indeed inclined to give up idea that inspector must call again that night a be already past nine oclock stood by father holding on to back of chair will go to bed soon papa wont dont sit up alone what answer be did not hear word be lost in far smaller sound that magnified to fear filled brain there be low ring at door bell kissed father glided down stair with rapidity of motion of one must have thought capable who have seen minute before put aside dixon dont come will open door know be can must manage a please miss said dixon testily in moment afterwards added youre not fit for be more dead than alive be said margaret turning round showing eye aglow with strange fire cheek flushed though lip be baked livid still opened door to inspector preceded into study placed candle on table snuffed carefully before turned round faced be late said well held breath for answer be sorry to have given unnecessary trouble maam for after theyve given up thought of holding inquest have have other work to do other people to see must have be here before now then be ended said margaret there be to be further enquiry believe ive got mr thornton note about said inspector fumbling in pocket book mr thornton said margaret yes he magistrate ah here be must not see to read no not although be close to candle word swam before held in hand looked at a if be intently studying im sure maam great weight off mind for evidence be so uncertain see that man have received blow at if question of identity came in so complicated case a told mr thornton mr thornton said margaret again met morning just a be coming out of house a he old friend of mine besides being magistrate who saw leonard last night made bold to tell of difficulty margaret sighed deeply did not want to hear more be afraid alike of what have heard of what might hear wished that man must go forced to speak thank for calling be very late dare say be past ten oclock oh here be note continued suddenly interpreting meaning of hand held out to receive be putting up when said think be cramped dazzling sort of writing must not read will just read to read aloud to thank told thornton be not there oh of course maam im sorry now that acted upon information seems to have be so erroneous at first young man be so positive now say that doubted along hope that mistake wont have occasioned such annoyance a to lose shop custom good night maam good night rang bell for dixon to show out a dixon returned up passage margaret passed swiftly be right said without looking at dixon before woman must follow with further question have sped upstairs entered bed chamber bolted door threw dressed a be upon bed be too much exhausted to think hour more elapsed before cramped nature of position chilliness supervening upon great fatigue have power to rouse numbed faculty then began to recall to combine to wonder first idea presented to be that sickening alarm on frederick behalf be over that strain be past next be wish to remember word of inspector related to mr thornton when have seen what have said what have mr thornton done be exact word of note until must recollect even to placing omitting article very expression have used in note mind refused to go on with progress next conviction came to be clear enough mr thornton have seen close to outwood station on fatal thursday night have be told of denial that be there stood liar in eye be liar have thought of penitence before god nothing chaos night surrounded one lurid fact that in mr thornton eye be degraded cared not to think even to herself of how much of excuse might plead have nothing to do with mr thornton never dreamed that one else must find cause for suspicion in what be so natural a accompanying brother what be really false wrong be known to have right to judge oh frederick frederick cried what have not sacrificed for even when fell asleep thought be compelled to travel same circle only with exaggerated monstrous circumstance of pain when awoke new idea flashed upon with brightness of morning mr thornton have falsehood before went to coroner suggested thought that have possibly be influenced so to do with view of sparing repetition of denial pushed notion on one side with sick wilfulness of child if be so felt gratitude to a only showed how keenly must have seen that be disgraced already before took such unwonted pain to spare further trial of truthfulness have already failed so signally must have gone through whole must have perjured to save frederick rather far rather than mr thornton must have have knowledge prompted to interfere to save what ill fate brought in contact with inspector what made be very magistrate sent for to receive leonard deposition what have leonard said how much of be intelligible to mr thornton who might already for aught knew be aware of old accusation against frederick through mutual friend mr bell if so have striven to save son who came in defiance of law to attend mother death bed under idea must feel grateful not yet if ever must if interference have be prompted by contempt oh have one just cause to feel contempt for mr thornton above people on whom have looked down from imaginary height till now suddenly found at foot be strangely distressed at fall shrank from following out premise to conclusion so acknowledging to herself how much valued respect good opinion whenever idea presented to at end of long avenue of thought turned away from following that path must not believe in be later than fancied for in agitation of previous night have forgotten to wind up watch mr hale have given especial order that be not to be disturbed by usual awakening by by door opened cautiously dixon put head in perceiving that margaret be awake came forward with letter here something to do good miss letter from master frederick thank dixon how late be spoke very languidly suffered dixon to lay on counterpane before without putting out hand to take want breakfast im sure will bring in minute master have got tray ready know margaret did not reply let go felt that must be alone before must open that letter opened at last first thing caught eye be date two day earlier than received have then written when have promised alarm might have be spared must read letter see be hasty enough perfectly satisfactory have seen henry lennox who knew enough of case to shake head over in first instance tell have done very daring thing in returning to england with such accusation backed by such powerful influence hanging over when have come to talk over mr lennox have acknowledged that there might be chance of acquittal if must prove statement by credible witness that in such case might be worth while to stand trial otherwise must be great risk must examine must take pain struck said frederick that introduction little sister of mine went long way be so made so many inquiry can assure seemed sharp intelligent fellow in good practice too to judge from sign of business number of clerk about may be only lawyer dodge have just caught packet on point of sailing be off in five minute may have to come back to england again on business so keep visit secret will send father rare old sherry such a can not buy in england such stuff a ive got in bottle before need something of kind dear love to god bless im sure here cab p what escape be take care dont breathe of having be not even to shaw margaret turned to envelope be marked too late letter have probably be trusted to careless waiter who have forgotten to post oh what slight cobweb of chance stand between temptation frederick have be safe out of england twenty nay thirty hour ago be only about seventeen hour since have told falsehood to baffle pursuit even then must have be vain how faithless have be where now be proud motto fais ce que doi advienne que pourra if have dared to bravely tell truth a regarded herself defying to find out what refused to tell concerning how light of heart must now have felt not humbled before god a having failed in trust towards not degraded abased in mr thornton sight caught up at with miserable tremor here be classing low opinion of alongside with displeasure of god how be that haunted imagination so persistently what must be why did care for what thought in spite of pride in spite of believed that must have borne sense of almighty displeasure because knew must read penitence hear cry for help in time to come mr thornton why did tremble hide face in pillow what strong feeling have overtaken at last sprang out of bed prayed long earnestly soothed comforted so to open heart a soon a reviewed position found sting be still there that be not good enough pure enough to be indifferent to lowered opinion of fellow creature that thought of how must be looking upon with contempt stood between sense of wrong doing took letter in to father a soon a be drest there be so slight allusion to alarm at railroad station that mr hale passed over without paying attention to indeed beyond mere fact of frederick having sailed undiscovered unsuspected did not gather much from letter at time be so uneasy about margarets pallid look seemed continually on point of weeping be sadly overdone margaret be wonder must let nurse now made lie down on sofa went for shawl to cover with tenderness released tear cried bitterly poor child poor child said looking fondly at a lay with face to wall shaking with sob after while ceased began to wonder whether durst give relief of telling father of trouble there be more reason against than for only one for be relief to herself against be thought that must add materially to father nervousness if be indeed necessary for frederick to come to england again that must dwell on circumstance of son having caused death of man however unwittingly unwillingly that knowledge must perpetually recur to trouble in various shape of exaggeration distortion from simple truth about own great fault must be distressed beyond measure at want of courage faith yet perpetually troubled to make excuse for formerly margaret must have come to a priest a well a father to tell of temptation sin latterly have not spoken much on such subject knew not how in change of opinion must reply if depth of soul called unto must keep secret bear burden alone alone must go before god cry for absolution alone must endure disgraced position in opinion of mr thornton be unspeakably touched by tender effort of father to think of cheerful subject on to talk so to take thought away from dwelling on have happened of late be month since have be so talkative a be day must not let sit up offended dixon desperately by insisting on waiting upon at last smiled poor weak little smile gave truest pleasure seems strange to think that what give most hope for

presbyterian when knew be very soft pretty name how young be younger by fourteen month than be just age that edith be when be engaged to captain lennox papa will go see in spain shook head said if

spanish daughter papa wont go without who be to take care of when be gone must like to know of be taking care of other if went must persuade mr thornton to let give double lesson must work up classic famously must be perpetual interest might go on see edith at corfu if liked margaret did not speak at once then said rather gravely thank papa dont want to go will hope that mr lennox will manage so well that frederick may bring dolores to see when be married a for edith regiment wont remain much longer in corfu perhaps will see of here before year be out mr hale cheerful subject have come to end

smitten with feeling of ingratitude to mr thornton inasmuch a in morning have refused to accept kindness have shown in making further inquiry from medical men so a to obviate inquest being held oh be grateful have be cowardly false have shown cowardliness falsehood in action must not be recalled be not ungrateful sent glow to heart to know must feel towards one who have reason to despise cause for contempt be so just that must have respected le if have thought did not feel contempt be pleasure to feel how thoroughly respected must not prevent doing that be one comfort in misery late in evening

after day like chapter xxxvii looking spade rake hoe pickaxe bill hook to reap scythe to mow flail what ye will here ready hand to ply needful tool skilld enough by lesson rough in labour rugged school hood higginss door be locked next day when went to pay call on widow boucher learnt time from officious neighbour that be really from home have however be in to see mr boucher before starting on day business be be unsatisfactory visit to mr boucher considered ill used woman by poor husband suicide there be quite germ of truth enough in idea to make very difficult one to refute still be unsatisfactory to see how completely thought be turned upon own position selfishness extended even to relation with child whom considered a incumbrance even in very midst of somewhat animal affection for margaret tried to make acquaintance with one two of while father strove to raise widow thought into higher channel than of mere helpless querulousness found that child be truer simpler mourner than widow daddy have be kind daddy to must tell in eager stammering way of tenderness shown indulgence granted by lost father be yon thing upstairs really doesna look like im feared on never be feared o daddy margarets heart bled to hear that mother in selfish requirement of sympathy have taken child upstairs to see dead disfigured father be intermingling coarseness of horror with profoundness of natural grief tried to turn thought in other direction on what must do for mother on what for be more efficacious way of putting what father must have wished to do margaret be more successful than mr hale in effort child seeing little duty lie in action close around began to try one to do something that suggested towards redding up slatternly room father set too high standard too abstract view before indolent invalid must not rouse torpid mind into vivid imagination of what husband misery might have be before have resorted to last terrible step must only look upon a affected must not enter into enduring mercy of god who have not specially interposed to prevent water from drowning prostrate husband although be secretly blaming husband for having fallen into such drear despair denying that have excuse for last rash act be inveterate in abuse of who must by possibility be supposed to have driven to such desperation master mr thornton in particular whose mill have be attacked by boucher who after warrant have be issued for apprehension on charge of rioting have caused to be withdrawn union of higgins be representative to poor woman child so numerous so hungry so noisy made up one great army of personal enemy whose fault be that be now helpless widow margaret heard enough of unreasonableness to dishearten when came away found impossible to cheer father be town life said nerve be quickened by haste bustle speed of everything around to say nothing of confinement in pent up house of be enough to induce depression worry of spirit now in country people live so much more out of door even child even in winter people must live in town in country get such stagnant habit of mind that be almost fatalist yes acknowledge that suppose mode of life produce own trial own temptation dweller in town must find a difficult to be patient a country bred man must find to be active equal to unwonted emergency must find hard to realise future of kind one because present be so living hurrying close around other because life tempts to revel in mere sense of animal existence not knowing of consequently not caring for pungency of pleasure for attainment of can plan deny look forward thus necessity for engrossment stupid content in present produce same effect poor mr how little can do for yet dare not leave without effort although may seem so useless oh papa hard world to live in so be child feel so just now at rate have be very happy even in midst of sorrow what pleasure frederick visit be yes that be said margaret brightly be such charming snatched forbidden thing suddenly stopped speaking have spoiled remembrance of frederick visit to herself by own cowardice of fault one most despised in others be want of bravery meanness of heart lead to untruth here have be guilty of then came thought of mr thornton cognisance of falsehood wondered if must have minded detection half so much from one else tried in imagination with aunt shaw edith with father with captain mr lennox with thought of last knowing what have done even in own behalf be most painful for brother sister be in first flush of mutual regard love even fall in frederick opinion be a nothing to shame shrinking shame felt at thought of meeting mr thornton again yet longed to see to get over to understand where stood in opinion cheek burnt a recollected how proudly have implied objection to trade in early day of acquaintance because too often led to deceit of passing off inferior for superior good in one branch of assuming credit for wealth resource not possessed in other remembered mr thornton look of calm disdain a in few word gave to understand in great scheme of commerce dishonourable way of acting be sure to prove injurious in long run that testing such action simply according to poor standard of success there be folly not wisdom in such kind of deceit in trade a well a in other thing remembered then strong in own untempted truth asking if did not think that buying in cheapest selling in dearest market proved want of transparent justice be so intimately connected with idea of truth have used word chivalric father have corrected with higher word christian so drawn argument upon while sate silent by with slight feeling of contempt more contempt for more talk about chivalric henceforward must feel humiliated disgraced in sight when must see heart leaped up in apprehension at ring of door bell yet when fell down to calmness felt strangely saddened sick at heart at disappointment be very evident that father expected to see be surprised that did not come truth be that there be point in conversation other night on have time then to enlarge have be understood that if possible on succeeding evening if not then at least very first evening mr thornton must command must meet for further discussion mr hale have looked forward to meeting ever since have parted have not yet resumed instruction to pupil have relinquished at commencement of wife more serious illness so have fewer occupation than usual great interest of last day so bouchers suicide have driven back with more eagerness than ever upon speculation be restless evening kept saying quite expected to have seen mr thornton think messenger who brought book last night must have have note forgot to deliver do think there have be message left to day will go inquire papa said margaret after change on sentence have be rung once twice stay there ring sat down instantly bent head attentively over work heard step on stair be only one knew be dixons lifted up head sighed believed felt glad higgins sir want to see else miss hale might be miss hale first then sir for he in strange kind of way have better come up here dixon then can see choose like for listener oh very well sir ive wish to hear what he got to say im sure only if must see shoe im sure youd say kitchen be fitter place can wipe suppose said mr hale so dixon flung off to bid walk up stair be little mollified however when looked at foot with hesitating air then sitting down on bottom stair took off offending shoe without word walked up stair sarvant sir said slicking hair down when came into room if hool excuse looking at margaret for being stocking ise be tramping day street be none o th cleanest margaret thought that fatigue might account for change in manner for be unusually quiet subdued have evidently difficulty in saying what came to say mr hale ever ready sympathy with anything of shyness hesitation want of self possession made come to aid will have tea up directly then youll take cup with mr higgins be sure be tired if youve be out much wet relaxing day margaret dear cant hasten tea margaret must only hasten tea by taking preparation of into own hand so offending dixon who be

what did that evening said mr thornton getting up coming near to mother stood by chimney piece with face turned away from room must not have approved of fanny being seen out after dark in rather lonely place walking about with young man say nothing of taste must choose time when mother lay unburied for such promenade must have liked sister to have be noticed by grocer assistant for doing so in first place a be not many year since myself be draper assistant mere circumstance of grocer assistant noticing act doe not alter character of act to in next place see great deal of difference between miss hale fanny can imagine that one may have weighty reason may ought to make overlook seeming impropriety in conduct never knew fanny have weighty reason for anything other people must guard believe miss hale be guardian to herself pretty character of sister indeed really john one must have thought miss hale have done enough to make clear sighted drew on to offer by bold display of pretended regard for to play off against very young man ive doubt whole conduct be clear to now believe be lover suppose agree to that turned round to mother face be very gray grim yes mother do

have good reason to believe that miss hale be in strait difficulty connected with attachment of from knowledge of miss hale character be perfectly innocent right what reason be refuse to tell never let hear one say word against implying more serious imputation than now need counsel of kind gentle woman promised mr hale to be that woman said mr thornton be happy to say did not promise kindness gentleness for felt at time that might be out of power to render to one of miss hale character disposition promised counsel advice such a must give to own daughter will speak to a must do to fanny if have gone gallivanting with young man in dusk will speak with relation to circumstance know without being influenced one way by strong reason will not confide to then will have fulfilled promise done duty will never bear said passionately will have to bear if speak in dead mother name well said breaking away dont tell more about can not endure to think of will be better that must speak to way than that must not be spoken to at oh that look of love continued between teeth a bolted into own private room that cursed lie showed terrible shame in background to be kept from light in thought lived perpetually oh margaret margaret mother how have tortured oh margaret must not have loved be uncouth hard must never have led into falsehood for more mr thornton thought over what son have said in pleading for merciful judgment for margarets indiscretion more bitterly felt inclined towards took savage pleasure in idea of speaking mind to in guise of fulfilment of duty enjoyed thought of showing untouched by glamour be well aware margaret have power of throwing over many people snorted scornfully over picture of beauty of victim jet black hair clear smooth skin lucid eye must not help to save one word of just stern reproach mr thornton spent night in preparing to mind be miss hale within knew be for have seen at window have foot inside little hall before martha have half answered question margaret be sitting alone writing to edith giving many particular of mother last day be softening employment have to brush away unbidden tear a mr thornton be announced be so gentle ladylike in mode of reception that visitor be somewhat daunted became impossible to utter speech so easy of arrangement with one to address to margarets low rich voice be softer than usual manner more gracious because in heart be feeling very grateful to mr thornton for courteous attention of call exerted to find subject of interest for conversation praised servant whom mr thornton have found for have asked edith for little greek air about have spoken to miss thornton mr thornton be fairly discomfited sharp damascus blade seemed out of place useless among rose leaf be silent because be trying to task up to duty at last stung into performance by suspicion in spite of probability allowed to cross mind that sweetness be put on with view of propitiating mr thornton somehow other attachment have fallen through that suited miss hale purpose to recall rejected lover poor margaret there be perhaps so much truth in suspicion a mr thornton be mother of one whose regard valued feared to have lost thought unconsciously added to natural desire of pleasing one who be showing kindness by visit mr thornton stood up to go yet seemed to have something more to say cleared throat began miss hale have duty to perform promised poor mother a far a poor judgment went must not allow to act in way wrongly softened speech down little here inadvertently without remonstrating at least without offering advice whether took not margaret stood before blushing like culprit with eye dilating a gazed at mr thornton thought have come to speak to about falsehood have told that mr thornton have employed to explain danger have exposed to of being confuted in full court although heart sank to think have not rather chosen to come upbraid receive penitence restore again to good opinion yet be too much humbled not to bear blame on subject patiently meekly mr thornton went on at first when heard from one of servant that have be seen walking about with gentleman so far from home a outwood station at time of evening must hardly believe son be sorry to say confirmed story be indiscreet to say least many young woman have lost character before now margarets eye flashed fire be new idea be too insulting if mr thornton have spoken to about lie have told well good must have owned humiliated to interfere with conduct to speak of character mr thornton mere stranger be too impertinent must not answer not one word mr thornton saw battle spirit in margarets eye called up combativeness also for mother sake have thought right to warn against such impropriety must degrade in long run in estimation of world even if in fact lead to positive harm for mother sake said margaret in tearful voice will bear much can not bear everything never meant to be exposed to insult be sure insult miss hale yes madam said margaret more steadily be insult what do know of must lead to suspect oh said breaking down covering face with hand know now mr thornton have told miss hale said mr thornton truthfulness causing to arrest confession margaret be on point of making though curiosity be itching to hear stop mr thornton have told nothing know son be not worthy to know said listen young lady that may understand if can what sort of man rejected milton manufacturer great tender heart scorned a be scorned said to only last night go to have good reason to know that be in strait arising out of attachment need womanly counsel believe be very word farther than beyond admitting fact of being at outwood station with gentleman on evening of twenty sixth have said nothing not one word against if have knowledge of anything must make sob so keep to margarets face be still hidden in hand finger of be wet with tear mr thornton be little mollified come miss hale there may be circumstance ill allow if explained may take off from seeming impropriety still answer margaret be considering what to say wished to stand well with mr thornton yet must not might not give explanation mr thornton grew impatient will be sorry to break off acquaintance for fanny sake a told son if fanny have done so must consider great disgrace fanny might be led away can give explanation said margaret in low voice have done wrong not in way think know about think mr thornton judge more mercifully than have hard work to keep from choking with tear believe madam mean to do rightly thank said mr thornton drawing up be not aware that meaning be doubted be last time will interfere be unwilling to consent to do when mother asked have not approved of son attachment to while only suspected did not appear to worthy of when compromised a did at time of riot exposed to comment of servant workpeople felt be no longer right to set against son wish of proposing to wish by way have always denied entertaining until day of riot margaret winced drew in breath with long hissing sound of however mr thornton took notice came have apparently changed mind told son yesterday thought possible short a be interval might have heard learnt something of other lover what must think of madam asked margaret throwing head back with proud disdain till throat curved outwards like swan can say nothing more mr thornton decline attempt to justify for anything must allow to leave room swept out of with noiseless grace of offended princess mr thornton have quite enough of natural humour to make feel ludricrousness of position in be left there be nothing for to show out be not particularly annoyed at margarets way of behaving did not care enough for for have taken mr thornton remonstrance to full a keenly to heart a lady expected margarets passion at once mollified visitor far more than silence reserve must have done showed effect of word young lady thought mr thornton to herself pretty good temper of own if john have come together must

saying not word only bowing low to hide sudden paleness that felt have come over face bent equally low in return then closed door after a hurried to mr bouchers heard clang seemed to fill up measure of mortification too be annoyed to find there have tenderness in heart soft place a nicholas higgins called have pride in concealing kept very sacred safe be jealous of circumstance tried to gain admission if dreaded exposure of tenderness be equally desirous that men must recognise justice felt that have be unjust in giving so scornful hearing to one who have waited with humble patience for five hour to speak to that man have spoken saucily to when have opportunity be nothing to mr thornton rather liked for be conscious of own irritability of temper at time probably made quits be five hour of waiting that struck mr thornton have not five hour to spare one hour two hour of hard penetrating intellectual a well a bodily labour did give up to going about collecting evidence a to truth of higginss story nature of character tenor of life tried not to be be convinced that higgins have said be true then conviction went in a if by spell touched latent tenderness of heart patience of man simple generosity of motive for have learnt about quarrel between boucher higgins made forget entirely mere reasoning of justice overleap by diviner instinct came to tell higgins must give work be more annoyed to find margaret there than by hearing last word for then understood that be woman who have urged higgins to come to dreaded admission of thought of a motive to what be doing solely because be right so that be lady spoke of a woman said indignantly to higgins might have told who be then maybe yod have spoken of more civil than yo did yod getten mother who might have kept yor

of dreamt came dancing towards with outspread arm with lightness gaiety made loathe even while allured impression of figure of margaret with margarets character taken out of a completely a if evil

enlightened mr thornton be accusing mr bell morning of kind of oxonian medival bigotry against native town margaret believe suggested that must do good to associate little with milton manufacturer beg pardon margaret thought must do milton manufacturer good to associate little more with oxford men now wasnt so margaret believe thought must do good to see little more of other did not know be idea more than papa so see mr thornton ought to have be improving other down stair instead of talking over vanished family of smith harrison however be willing to do part now wonder when milton men intend to live life seem to be spent in gathering together material for life by living suppose mean enjoyment yes enjoyment dont specify of what because trust must consider mere pleasure a very poor enjoyment must rather have nature of enjoyment defined well enjoyment leisure enjoyment of power influence money give be striving for money what do want for mr thornton be silent then said really dont know money be not what strive for what then be home question will have to lay open to catechist be not sure that be prepared to do said mr hale dont let be personal in catechism be of representative

if reverence past a do in oxford be because want something can apply to present more directly be fine when study of past lead to prophecy of future to men groping in new circumstance must be finer if word of experience must direct how to act in what concern most intimately immediately be full of difficulty to be encountered upon mode in be met conquered not merely pushed aside for time depends future people can speak of utopia much more easily than of next day duty yet when duty be done by others who so ready to cry fie for shame time dont see what be talking about must milton men condescend to send up to day difficulty to oxford have not tried yet mr thornton laughed outright at believe be talking with reference to good deal have be troubling of late be thinking of strike have

abruptly left room margaret rose from seat began silently to fold up work long seam be heavy have unusual weight for languid arm round line in face took lengthened straighter form whole appearance be that of one who have gone through day of great fatigue a three prepared for bed mr bell muttered little condemnation of mr thornton never saw fellow so spoiled by success cant bear word jest of kind everything seems to touch on soreness of high dignity formerly be a simple noble a open day must not offend because have vanity be not vain now said margaret turning round from table speaking with quiet distinctness to night have not be like something must have annoyed before came here mr bell gave one of sharp glance from above spectacle stood quite calmly after have left room suddenly asked

having else must say there be very pretty symptom about then be sure be wrong said mr hale may care for though really have be almost rude to at time why margaret must never think of im sure thing have never entered head entering heart must do merely threw out suggestion of what might be dare say be wrong whether be wrong right im very sleepy so having disturbed night rest a can see with untimely fancy ill betake with easy mind to own mr hale resolved that must not be disturbed by such nonsensical idea so lay awake determining not to think about mr bell took leave next day bidding margaret

pupil lukewarmness about greek literature have short time ago so great interest for now often happened that hurried note from mr thornton must arrive just at last moment saying that be so much engaged that must not come to read with mr hale that evening though other pupil have taken more than place a to time one be like first scholar in mr hale heart be depressed sad at partial cessation of intercourse have become dear to used to sit pondering over reason must have occasioned change startled one evening a sate at work by suddenly asking have ever reason for thinking mr thornton cared for

ungraciously disposed towards mr thornton knew must never be hoped whole thing be imagination knew too well what real feeling be to suppose that must ever like mr thornton in way be very sorry be very quiet still for minute on stroking cheek in caressing way soon after be almost shocked to find face wet with tear a touched sprang up smiling with forced brightness began to talk of lennoxes with vehement desire to turn conversation that mr hale be too tender hearted to try to force back into old channel to morrow yes to morrow will be back in harley street oh how strange will be wonder what room will make into nursery aunt shaw will be happy with baby fancy edith mamma captain lennox wonder what will do with now have sold out ill tell said father anxious to indulge in fresh subject of

be uniting business with pleasure papa can not spare whats more wont be spared then after pause added be losing hope sadly about frederick be letting down gently can see mr lennox have hope of hunting up witness under year year of time said that bubble be very pretty very dear to heart have burst like many must console with being glad that frederick be so happy with being great deal to other so dont offend by talking of being able to spare papa for assure cant idea of change took root germinated in margarets heart although not in way in father proposed at first began to consider how desirable something of kind must be to father whose spirit always feeble now became too frequently depressed whose health though never complained have be seriously affected by wife illness death there be regular hour of reading with pupil that giving receiving must no longer be called companionship a in old day when mr thornton came to study under margaret be conscious of want under be suffering

of brightness of hope usually accompanies ray of february sun mr thornton have of course entirely ceased to come to house mr thornton came occasionally visit be addressed to father be confined to study mr hale spoke of a always same indeed very rarity of intercourse seemed to make mr hale set only higher value on from what margaret must gather of what mr thornton have said there be nothing in cessation of visit must arise from umbrage vexation business affair have become complicated during strike required closer attention than have given to last winter nay margaret must even discover that spoke from time to time of always a far a must learn in same calm friendly way never avoiding never seeking mention of name be not in spirit to raise father tone of mind dreary peacefulness of present

meeting awkward even in presence of captain lennox edith doubly awkward now that found only lady there person to whom must naturally perforce address great part of conversation be first to recover self possession began to talk on subject came uppermost in mind after first flush of awkward shyness mr lennox have be so much obliged to for have done about frederick be only sorry have be so unsuccessful replied with quick glance towards mr bell a if reconnoitring how much might say before margaret a if read thought addressed to mr bell including in conversation implying that be perfectly aware of endeavour have be made to clear frederick horrocks very last witness of have proved a unavailing a others mr lennox have discovered that sailed for australia only last august only two month before frederick be in england gave name of frederick in england never told that exclaimed mr bell in surprise thought knew never doubted have be told of course be great secret perhaps must not have named now said little dismayed have never named to either brother cousin said mr lennox with little professional dryness of implied reproach never mind margaret be not living in talking babbling world

for one will ask stay interrupting rather abruptly be at mother funeral be with mamma when died said margaret softly to be sure to be sure why one asked if have not be over then denied stoutly not many week ago who must have be oh recollect did not say name although margaret must have given much to know if suspicion be right have be mr thornton who have made enquiry must not ask question of mr bell much a longed to do so there be pause for moment two then mr lennox said addressing to margaret suppose a mr bell be now acquainted with circumstance attending brother unfortunate dilemma can not

around for hat have be removed to make room for tea well said dont know what mr lennox be inclined to do im disposed to be moving off homewards ive be journey to day journey begin to tell upon sixty odd year believe will stay see brother sister said mr lennox making movement of departure margaret be seized with shy awkward dread of being left alone with scene on little terrace in helstone garden be so present to that must hardly help believing be so with dont go yet please mr bell said hastily want to see edith want edith to know please said laying light determined hand on arm looked at saw confusion stirring in countenance sate down again a if little touch have be possessed of resistless strength see how overpowers mr lennox said hope noticed happy choice of expression want to see cousin edith who be told be great beauty have honesty to change word when come to mr lennox be to know suppose be not much to see eh margaret joked to give time to recover from slight flutter have detected in manner on proposal to leave caught tone threw ball back mr lennox wondered how brother captain must have reported a having lost good look to be sure in quiet black dress be contrast to edith dancing in white crape mourning long floating golden hair softness glitter dimpled blushed most becomingly when introduced to mr bell conscious that have reputation a beauty to keep up that must not do to have mordecai refusing to worship admire even in shape of old fellow of college nobody have ever heard of mr shaw captain lennox in separate way gave mr bell kind sincere welcome winning over to like almost in spite of especially when saw how naturally margaret took place a sister daughter of house what shame that be not at home to receive said edith too henry though dont know that must have stayed at home for for mr bell for margarets mr bell there be knowing what sacrifice must not have made said brother in law even dinner party delight of wearing very becoming dress edith did not know whether to frown to smile did not suit mr lennox to drive to first of alternative so went on will show readiness to make sacrifice to morrow morning first by asking to breakfast to meet mr bell secondly by being so kind a to order at past nine instead of at ten oclock have letter paper want to show to miss hale mr bell hope mr bell will make house own during stay in london said captain lennox be only so sorry can not offer bedroom thank be much obliged to must only think churl if have for must decline believe in spite of temptation of such agreeable company said mr bell bowing round secretly congratulating on neat turn have given to sentence if put into plain language must have be more to effect couldnt stand restraint of such proper behaved civil spoken people a be must be like meat without salt im thankful havent bed how well rounded sentence im absolutely catching trick of good manner self satisfaction lasted till be fairly out in street walking side by side with henry lennox here suddenly remembered margarets little look of entreaty a urged to stay longer also recollected few hint given long ago by acquaintance of mr lennoxs a to admiration of margaret gave new direction to thought have known miss hale for long time believe how do think looking strike a pale ill thought looking remarkably well perhaps not when first came now think of certainly when grew animated looked a well a ever saw do have have great deal to go through said mr bell yes have be sorry to hear of have have to bear not merely common universal sorrow arising from death annoyance father conduct must have caused then father conduct said mr bell in accent of surprise must have heard wrong statement behaved in most conscientious manner showed more resolute strength than must ever have given credit for formerly perhaps have be wrongly informed have be told by successor in living clever sensible man thoroughly active clergyman that there be call upon mr hale to do what did relinquish living throw family on tender mercy of private teaching in manufacturing town bishop have offered living be true if have come to entertain certain doubt must have remained where be so have occasion to resign truth be country clergyman live such isolated life isolated mean from intercourse with men of equal cultivation with by whose mind might regulate own discover when be going either too fast too slow that be very apt to disturb with imaginary doubt a to article of faith throw up certain opportunity of doing good for very uncertain fancy of own differ from think be very apt to do a poor friend hale did mr bell be inwardly chafing perhaps used too general expression in saying very apt certainly life be such a very often to produce inordinate self sufficiency morbid state of conscience replied mr lennox with perfect coolness dont meet with self sufficiency among lawyer for instance asked mr bell seldom imagine case of morbid conscience be becoming more more vexed forgetting lately caught trick of good manner mr lennox saw now that have annoyed companion a have talked pretty much for sake of saying something so passing time away while road lay together be very indifferent a to exact side took upon question quietly came round by saying to be sure there be something fine in man of mr hale age leaving home of twenty year giving up settled habit for idea be probably erroneous doe not matter untangible thought one can not help admiring with mixture of pity in one admiration something like what one feel for don quixote gentleman a be too will never forget refined simple hospitality showed to that last day at helstone only half mollified yet anxious in order to lull certain qualm of own conscience to believe that mr hale conduct have tinge of quixotism in mr bell growled out aye dont know milton change from helstone be year since have be at helstone ill answer for be standing there yet stick stone a have done for last century while milton go there

annoyance at position a regarded wealth with pride in handsome devoted husband mr bell have noticed in real life quarter of century ago dream be so like life that when awoke present life seemed dream where be in close handsomely furnished room of london hotel where be who spoke to moved around touched not instant ago dead buried lost for evermore a far a earth for evermore must extend be old man so lately exultant in full strength of manhood utter loneliness of life be insupportable to think about got up hastily tried to forget what never more might be in hurried dressing for breakfast in harley street must not attend to lawyer detail a saw made margarets eye dilate lip grow pale a one by one fate decreed so seemed morsel of evidence must exonerate frederick must fall from beneath foot disappear even mr lennoxs well regulated professional voice took softer tenderer tone a drew near to extinction of last hope be not that margaret have not be perfectly aware of result before be only that detail of successive disappointment came with such relentless minuteness to quench hope that at last fairly gave way to tear mr lennox stopped reading have better not go on said in concerned voice be foolish proposal of mine lieutenant hale even giving title of service from have so harshly be expelled be soothing to margaret lieutenant hale be happy now more secure in fortune future prospect than must ever have be in navy have doubtless adopted wife country a own be said margaret seems so selfish in to regret trying to smile yet be lost to be so lonely mr lennox turned over paper wished that be a rich prosperous a believed must be day mr bell blew nose otherwise also kept silence margaret in minute two have apparently recovered usual composure thanked mr lennox very courteously for trouble more courteously graciously because be conscious that by behaviour might probably be led to imagine that have given needle pain yet be pain must not have be without mr bell came up to wish good bye margaret said a fumbled with glove be going down to helstone to morrow to look at old place must like to come with must give too much pain speak out dont be afraid oh mr bell

keeping fountain of yours dry for next two day if dont will feel queer about lachrymal duct dont like wont cry drop said margaret winking eye to shake tear off eyelash forcing smile there good girl then well go upstairs settle margaret be in state of almost trembling eagerness while mr bell discussed plan with aunt shaw who be first startled then doubtful perplexed in end yielding rather to rough force of mr bell word than to own conviction for to last whether be right wrong proper improper must not settle to own satisfaction till margarets safe return happy fulfilment of project gave decision enough to say be sure have be very kind thought of mr bell just what have be wishing for margaret a giving very change required after anxious time have have chapter xlvi once now so on happy

spirit yet to im bound uhland margaret be ready long before appointed time have leisure enough to cry little quietly when unobserved to smile brightly when one looked at last alarm be lest must be too late miss train be in time breathed freely happily at length seated in carriage opposite to mr bell whirling away past well known station seeing old south country town hamlet sleeping in warm light of pure sun gave yet ruddier colour to tiled roof so different to cold slate of north brood of pigeon hovered around peaked quaint gable slowly settling here there ruffling soft shiny feather a if exposing fibre to delicious warmth there be few people about at station almost seemed a if be too lazily content to wish to travel none of bustle stir that margaret have noticed in two journey on london north western line later on in year line of railway must be stirring alive with rich pleasure seeker a to constant going to fro of busy tradespeople must always be widely different from northern line here spectator two stood lounging at nearly station with hand in pocket so absorbed in simple act of watching that made traveller wonder what must find to do when train whirled away only blank of railway shed distant field two be left for to gaze upon hot air danced over golden stillness of land farm after farm be left behind reminding margaret of german idyll of herman dorothea of evangeline from waking dream be roused be place to leave train take fly to helstone now sharper feeling came shooting through heart whether pain pleasure must hardly tell mile be redolent of

inhabitant of ruinous cottage be dead cottage have be pulled down new one tidy respectable have be built in stead there be small garden on place where beech tree have be did not think have be so old said margaret after pause of silence turned away sighing yes said mr bell be first change among familiar thing make mystery of time to young afterwards lose sense of mysterious take change in see a matter of course instability of human thing be familiar to to be new oppressive let go on to see little susan said margaret drawing companion up grassy road way leading under shadow of forest glade with heart though have not idea who little susan may be have kindness for susans for simple susans sake little susan be disappointed when left without wishing good bye have be on conscience ever since gave pain little more exertion on part might have prevented be long way be sure will not be tired quite sure be if dont walk so fast see here there be view can give one excuse for stopping to take breath must think romantic to be walking with person fat scant o breath if be hamlet prince of denmark have compassion on infirmity for sake will walk slower for own sake like twenty time better than hamlet on principle that living as be better than dead lion perhaps so dont analyse feeling be content to take liking without examining too curiously into material be made of only need not walk at snail pace very well walk at own pace will follow stop still meditate like hamlet compare to if go too fast thank a mother have not murdered father afterwards married uncle shouldnt know what to think about unless be balancing chance of having well cooked dinner not what do think be in good hope used to be considered famous cook a far a helstone opinion went have considered distraction of mind produced by haymaking margaret felt mr bell kindness in trying to make cheerful talk about nothing to endeavour to prevent from thinking too curiously about past must rather have gone over dear loved walk in silence if indeed be not ungrateful enough to wish that might have be alone reached cottage where susans widowed mother lived susan be not there be gone to parochial school margaret be disappointed poor woman saw began to make kind of apology oh be quite right said margaret be very glad to hear might have thought of only used to stop at home with yes did miss sadly used to teach

world must say that child be getting better simpler more natural education stopping at home helping mother learning to read chapter in new testament night by side than from schooling under sun margaret did not want to encourage to go on by replying to so prolonging discussion before mother so turned to asked how be old betty barnes dont know said woman rather shortly wese not friend why not asked margaret who have formerly be peace maker of village stole cat did know be yours dont know reckon not well must not get back again when told be yours for shed burnt burnt exclaimed margaret mr bell roasted explained woman be explanation by dint of questioning margaret extracted from horrible fact that betty barnes having be induced by gipsy fortune teller to lend latter husband sunday clothes on promise of having faithfully returned on saturday night before goodman barnes must have missed became alarmed by non appearance consequent dread of husband anger a according to one of savage country superstition cry of cat in agony of being boiled roasted alive compelled a be power of darkness to fulfil wish of executioner resort have be have to charm poor woman evidently believed in efficacy only feeling be indignation that cat have be chosen out from others for sacrifice margaret listened in horror endeavoured in vain to enlighten woman mind be obliged to give up in despair step by step got woman to admit certain fact of logical connexion sequence be perfectly clear to margaret at end bewildered woman simply repeated first assertion namely that be very cruel for sure must not like to do that there be nothing like for giving person what wished for have heard life be very cruel for margaret gave up in despair walked away sick at heart be good girl not to triumph over said mr bell how what do mean own be wrong about schooling anything rather than have child brought up in such practical paganism oh remember poor little susan must go see must mind calling at school not bit be curious to see something of teaching be to receive did not speak much more thridded way through many bosky dell whose soft green influence must not charm away shock pain in margarets heart caused by recital of such cruelty recital too manner of betrayed such utter want of imagination therefore of sympathy with suffering animal buzz of voice like murmur of hive of busy human bee made heard a soon a emerged from forest on more open village green on school be situated door be wide open entered brisk lady in black here there everywhere perceived bade welcome with somewhat of hostess air margaret remembered mother be wont to assume only in more soft languid manner when rare visitor strayed in to inspect school knew at once be present vicar wife mother successor must have drawn back from interview have be possible in instant have conquered feeling modestly advanced meeting many bright glance of recognition hearing many half suppressed murmur of miss hale vicar lady heard name manner at once became more kindly margaret wished must have helped feeling that also became more patronizing lady held out hand to mr bell with father presume miss hale see by likeness be sure be very glad to see sir so will vicar be margaret explained that be not father stammered out fact of death wondering time how mr hale must have borne coming to revisit helstone if have be a vicar

parsing lesson with miss hale poor margaret whose visit be sentimental not in degree inspective felt taken in a in way bringing in contact with little eager face once well known who have received solemn rite of baptism from father sate down half losing in tracing out changing feature of girl holding susans hand for minute two unobserved by while first class sought for book vicar lady went a near a lady must towards holding mr bell by button while explained phonetic system to gave conversation have have with inspector about margaret bent over book seeing nothing that hearing buzz of childrens voice old time rose up thought of eye filled with tear till at once there be pause one of girl be stumbling over apparently simple word uncertain what to call indefinite article said margaret mildly beg pardon said vicar wife eye ear be taught by mr milsome to call who can remember adjective absolute said dozen voice at once margaret sate abashed child knew more than did mr bell turned away smiled margaret spoke more during lesson after be over went quietly round to one two old favourite talked to little be growing out of child into great girl passing out of recollection in rapid development a by three year absence be vanishing from theirs still be glad to have seen again though tinge of sadness mixed with pleasure when school be over for day be yet early in summer afternoon mr hepworth proposed to margaret that mr bell must accompany to parsonage see word improvement have half slipped out of mouth substituted more cautious term alteration present vicar be making margaret did not care straw about seeing alteration jarred upon fond recollection of what home have be longed to see old place once more even though shivered away from pain knew must feel parsonage be so altered inside out that real pain be le than anticipated be not like same place garden grass plat formerly so daintily trim that even stray rose leaf seemed like fleck on exquisite arrangement propriety be strewed with childrens thing bag of marble here hoop there straw hat forced down upon rose tree a on peg to destruction of long beautiful tender branch laden with flower in former day must have be trained up tenderly a if beloved little square matted hall be equally filled with sign of merry healthy rough childhood ah said mr hepworth must excuse untidiness miss hale when nursery be finished will insist upon little order be building nursery out of room believe how did manage miss hale without nursery be two said margaret have many child presume seven look here be throwing out window to road on side mr hepworth be spending immense deal of money on house really be scarcely habitable when came for so large family a ours mean of course room in house be changed besides one of mr hepworth spoke have be mr hale study formerly where green gloom delicious quiet of place have conduced a have said to habit of meditation perhaps in degree to formation of character more fitted for thought than action new window gave view of road have many advantage a mr hepworth pointed out from wandering sheep of husband flock might be seen who straggled to tempting beer house unobserved a might hope not unobserved in reality for active vicar kept eye on road even during composition of most orthodox sermon have hat stick hanging ready at hand to seize before sallying out after parishioner who have need of quick leg if must take refuge in jolly forester before teetotal vicar have arrested whole family be quick brisk loud talking kind hearted not troubled with much delicacy of perception margaret feared that mr hepworth must find out that mr bell be playing upon in admiration thought fit to express for everything especially grated on taste took literally with such good faith margaret must not help remonstrating with a walked slowly away from parsonage back to inn dont scold margaret be because of if have not shown change with such evident exultation in superior sense in perceiving what improvement must be must have behaved well if must go on preaching keep till after dinner when will send to sleep help digestion be of tired margaret so much so that

whence drop like fruit fully ripe into quiet mother earth place be changed tree gone here bough there bringing in long ray of light where light be before road be trimmed narrowed green straggling pathway by side enclosed cultivated great improvement be called margaret sighed over old picturesqueness old gloom grassy way side of former day sate by window on little settle sadly gazing out upon gathering shade of night harmonized well with pensive thought mr bell slept soundly after unusual exercise through day at last be roused by entrance of tea tray brought in by flushed looking country girl who have evidently be finding variety from usual occupation of waiter in assisting day in hay field hallo who there where be who that margaret oh now remember must not imagine what woman be sitting there in such doleful attitude with hand clasped straight out upon knee face looking so steadfastly before what be looking at asked mr bell coming to window standing behind margaret nothing said rising up quickly speaking a cheerfully a must at moment notice nothing indeed bleak back ground of tree white linen hung out on sweet briar hedge great waft of damp air shut window come in make tea margaret be silent for time played with teaspoon did not attend particularly to what mr bell said contradicted took same sort of smiling notice of opinion a if have agreed with then sighed putting down spoon began apropos of nothing at in high pitched voice usually show that speaker have be thinking for time on subject that wish to introduce mr bell remember what be saying about frederick last night dont last night where be oh remember why seems week ago yes to be sure recollect talked about poor fellow yes do remember that mr lennox spoke about having be in england about time of dear mamma

margaret be there have seen intent look of occupation a listened to mr henry lennox came up to with perfectly regulated manner of old friend with first calm word vivid colour flashed into cheek never left again during evening did not seem to have much to say to disappointed by quiet way in asked what seemed to to be merely necessary question respecting old acquaintance in milton others came in more intimate in house than fell into background where mr lennox talked together from time to time think miss hale looking well said mr lennox dont milton didnt agree with imagine for when first came to london thought have never seen one so much changed to night be looking radiant be much stronger last autumn be fatigued with walk of couple of mile on friday evening walked up to hampstead back yet on saturday looked a well a doe now who two alone mr colthurst be very clever man rising member of parliament have quick eye at discerning character be struck by remark mr thornton made at dinner time enquired from edith who that gentleman be rather to surprise found from tone of indeed that mr thornton of milton be not such unknown name to a have imagined must be dinner be going off well henry be in good humour brought out dry caustic wit admirably mr thornton mr colthurst found one two mutual subject of interest must only touch upon then reserving for more private after dinner talk margaret looked beautiful in pomegranate flower if did lean back in chair speak little edith be not annoyed for conversation flowed on smoothly without margaret be watching mr thornton face never looked at so might study unobserved note change even short time have wrought in only at unexpected mot of mr lennoxs face flashed out into old look of intense enjoyment merry brightness returned to eye lip just parted to suggest brilliant smile of former day for instant glance instinctively sought hers a if wanted sympathy when eye met whole countenance changed be grave anxious once more resolutely avoided

agreeable sensible fellow tenant of yours be have be very man to give colthurst fact wanted coaching in cant conceive how contrived to mismanage affair with power opportunity must have succeeded said margaret did not quite relish tone in spoke although word expressed thought have passed through own mind a be silent caught swell in sound of conversation going on near fire place between mr colthurst mr thornton assure heard spoken of with great interest curiosity a to result perhaps must rather say heard name frequently mentioned during short stay in neighbourhood then lost word when next must hear mr thornton be speaking have not element for popularity if spoke of in way be mistaken fall slowly into new project find difficult to let be known even by whom desire to know with whom must fain have reserve yet even with drawback felt be on right path that starting from kind of friendship with one be becoming acquainted with many advantage be mutual be unconsciously consciously teaching other say be trust be intending to pursue same course must stop colthurst said henry lennox hastily by abrupt yet apropos question turned current of conversation so a not to give mr thornton

conviction that mere institution however wise however much thought may have be required to organise arrange can attach class to class a must be attached unless working out of such institution bring individual of different class into actual personal contact such intercourse be very breath of life working man can hardly be made to feel know how much employer may have laboured in study at plan for
