manasseh seemed through anger to be so really grieved by what considered error that went much nearer to convincing that there might be two side to question only be view that appeared like treachery to

lassie have great spinning wheel for wool lesser for flax before month have elapsed after lois coming faith be grave silent person never merry sometimes very sad though lois be long time in even guessing why must try in sweet simple fashion to cheer cousin up when latter be depressed by telling old story of english way life occasionally faith seemed to care to listen occasionally did not heed one word dreamed on whether of past of future who must tell stern old minister came in to pay pastoral visit on such occasion grace hickson must put on clean apron clean cap make more welcome than be ever seen to do one else bringing out best provision of store setting of before also great bible be brought forth hosea nattee summoned from work to listen while minister read chapter a read expounded at considerable length after knelt while standing lifted up right hand prayed for possible combination of christian men for possible case of spiritual need lastly taking individual before must put up very personal supplication for according to notion of want at first lois wondered at aptitude of one two prayer of description to outward circumstance of case when perceived that aunt have usually pretty long confidential conversation with minister in early part of visit became aware that received impression knowledge through medium of 'that godly woman grace hickson be afraid paid le regard to prayer 'for maiden from land who hath brought error of land a seed with even across great ocean who be letting even now little seed shoot up into evil tree in unclean creature may find shelter ' ' like prayer of church better ' said lois one day to faith 'no clergyman in england can pray own word therefore be that can not judge of others so a to fit prayer to what esteem to be case a mr tappau did morning ' hate mr tappau ' said faith shortly passionate flash of light coming out of dark heavy eye so cousin seems to a if be good man although like not prayer faith only repeated word hate ' lois be sorry for strong bad feeling instinctively sorry for be loving delighted in being loved felt jar run through at sign of want of love in others did not know what to say be silent at time faith too went on turning wheel with vehemence spoke never word until thread snapped then pushed wheel away hastily left room then prudence crept softly up to lois side strange child seemed to be tossed about by varying mood to day be caressing communicative to morrow might be deceitful mocking so indifferent to pain sorrow of others that must call almost inhuman beo thou dost not like pastor tappau prayer whispered lois be sorry to have be overheard neither must must take back word like not so well a prayer used to hear at home ' say thy home be with ungodly nay look at so be not that said be none so fond of praying of pastor tappau for matter faith can not abide know why will tell thee cousin lois ' faith did not tell be right person to give own reason 'ask where young mr nolan be gone to thou wilt hear have seen faith cry by hour together about mr nolan child hush ' said lois for heard faith approaching step feared lest must overhear what be saying truth be that year two before there have be great struggle in salem village great division in religious body pastor tappau have be leader of more violent ultimately successful party in consequence of le popular minister mr nolan have have to leave place faith hickson loved with strength of passionate heart although never be aware of attachment have excited own family be too regardless of manifestation of mere feeling to ever observe sign of emotion on part old indian servant nattee saw observed knew a well a if have be told reason why faith have lost care about father mother brother sister about household work daily occupation nay about observance of religion a well nattee read meaning of deep smouldering of faith dislike to pastor tappau aright indian woman understood why girl whom alone of white people loved avoided old minister must hide in wood stack sooner than be called in to listen to exhortation prayer with savage untutored people be not 'love love dog ' be often jealous of creature beloved be 'whom thou hatest will hate nattee feeling towards pastor tappau be even exaggeration of mute unspoken hatred of faith for long time cause of cousin dislike avoidance of minister be mystery to lois name of nolan remained in memory whether must be more from girlish interest in suspected love affair than from indifferent heartless curiosity that must not help piecing together little speech action with faith interest in absent banished minister for explanatory clue till not doubt remained in mind without further communication with prudence for lois declined hearing more on subject from so gave deep offence faith grew sadder duller a autumn drew on lost appetite brown complexion became sallow colourless dark eye looked hollow wild first of november be near at hand lois in instinctive well intentioned effort to bring life cheerfulness into monotonous household have be telling faith of many english custom silly enough doubt scarcely lighted up flicker of interest in american girl mind cousin be lying awake in bed in great unplastered room be in part store room in part bedroom lois be full of sympathy for faith night for long have listened to cousin heavy irrepressible sigh in silence faith sighed because grief be of too old date for violent emotion cry lois listened without speaking in dark quiet night hour for long long time kept quite still because thought such vent for sorrow might relieve cousin weary heart when at length instead of lying motionless faith seemed to be growing restless even to convulsive motion of limb lois began to speak to talk about england dear old way at home without exciting much attention on faith part until at length fell upon subject of hallow e'en told about custom then long afterwards practised in england have scarcely yet died out in scotland a told of trick have often played of apple eaten facing mirror of dripping sheet of basin of water of nut burning side by side many other such innocent way of divination by laughing trembling english maiden sought to see form of future husband if husband be to have then faith listened breathlessly asking short eager question a if ray of hope have entered into gloomy heart lois went on speaking telling of story must confirm truth of second sight vouchsafed to seeker in accustomed method half believing half incredulous desiring above thing to cheer up poor faith suddenly prudence rose up from truckle bed in dim corner of room have not thought that be awake have be listening long 'cousin lois may go out meet satan by brook side if will if thou goest faith will tell mother ay will tell pastor tappau too hold thy story cousin lois be afeard of very life must rather never be wed at than feel touch of creature must take apple out of hand a held over left shoulder ' excited girl gave loud scream of terror at image fancy have conjured up faith lois sprang out towards flying across moonlit room in white nightgown at same instant summoned by same cry grace hickson came to child hush ' said faith authoritatively 'what be wench ' asked grace while lois feeling a if have done mischief kept silence 'take away take away screamed prudence 'look over shoulder left shoulder evil one be there now see stretching over for half bitten apple 'what be say ' said grace austerely behe be dreaming ' said faith 'prudence hold thy tongue pinched child severely while lois more tenderly tried to soothe alarm felt that have conjured up 'be quiet prudence ' said 'and go to sleep will stay by thee till thou hast gone off into slumber ' 'no go go away sobbed prudence who be really terrified at first be now assuming more alarm than felt if from pleasure received at perceiving centre of attention will stay by not wicked english witch ' so faith sat by sister grace displeased perplexed withdrew to own bed purposing to inquire more into matter in morning lois only hoped might all be forgotten by time resolved never to talk again of such thing event happened in remaining hour of night to change current of affair while grace have be absent from room husband have have paralytic stroke whether too have be alarmed by eldritch scream one must ever know by faint light of rush candle burning at bedside wife perceived that great change have taken place in aspect on return irregular breathing came almost like snort end be drawing near family be roused help given that doctor experience must suggest before late november morning light be ended for ralph hickson whole of ensuing day sat moved in darkened room spoke few word below breath manasseh kept at home regretting father doubt showing little emotion faith be child bewailed loss most grievously have warm heart hidden away somewhere under moody exterior father have shown far more passive kindness than ever mother have done for grace made distinct favourite of manasseh only son prudence youngest child lois be about a unhappy a of for have felt strongly drawn towards uncle a kindest friend sense of loss renewed old sorrow have experienced at own parent death have time place to cry in on devolved many of care must have seemed indecorous in nearer relative to interest in enough to take active part change required in dress household preparation for sad feast of funeral lois have to arrange under aunt stern direction day two afterwards last day before funeral went into yard to fetch in fagot for oven be solemn beautiful starlit evening sudden sense of desolation in midst of vast universe thus revealed touched lois heart sat down behind woodstack cried very plentiful tear be startled by manasseh who suddenly turned corner of stack stood before 'lois cry ' 'only little said rising up gathering bundle of fagot for dreaded being questioned by grim impassive cousin to surprise laid hand on arm said betop one minute why art thou cry cousin ' ' know said just like child questioned in like manner be again on point of weeping bey father be very kind to thee lois wonder thou grievest after lord who taketh away can restore tenfold will be a kind a father yea kinder be not time to talk of marriage giving in marriage after have buried dead wish to speak to thee ' lois did not cry now shrank with affright what did cousin mean must far rather that have be angry with for unreasonable grieving for folly avoided carefully a carefully a must without seeming to dread for next few day sometimes thought must have be bad dream for if there have be no english lover in case other man in whole world must never have thought of manasseh a husband indeed till now there have be nothing in word action to suggest such idea now have be suggested there be telling how much loathed might be good pious doubtless be dark fixed eye moving so slowly heavily lank black hair grey coarse skin made dislike now personal ugliness ungainliness struck on sens with jar since few word spoken behind haystack knew that sooner later time must come for further discussion of subject like coward tried to put off by clinging to aunt apron string for be sure that grace hickson have far different view for only son a indeed have for be ambitious a well a religious woman by early purchase of land in salem village hicksons have become wealthy people without great exertion of own partly also by silent process of accumulation for have never cared to change manner of living from time when have be suitable to far smaller income than at present enjoyed so much for worldly circumstance a for worldly character stood a high one must say word against of habit action righteousness godliness be patent to one eye so grace hickson thought entitled to pick choose among maiden before must meet with one fitted to be wife none in salem came up to imaginary standard have in mind even at very time so soon after husband death to go to boston take counsel with leading minister there with worthy mr cotton mather at head see if must tell of well favoured godly young maiden in congregation worthy of being wife of son besides good look godliness wench must have good birth good wealth grace hickson must have put contemptuously on one side when once paragon be found minister have approved grace anticipated difficulty on son part so lois be right in feeling that aunt must dislike speech of marriage between manasseh girl be brought to bay one day in wise manasseh have ridden forth on business one said must occupy whole day meeting man with whom have to transact affair returned earlier than one expected missed lois from keeping room where sister be spinning almost immediately mother sat by at knitting must see nattee in kitchen through open door be too reserved to ask where lois be quietly sought till found in great loft already piled with winter store of fruit vegetable aunt have sent there to examine apple one by one pick out such a be unsound for immediate use be stooping down intent upon work be hardly aware of approach until lifted up head saw standing close before dropped apple be holding went little paler than wont faced in silence 'lois ' said 'thou rememberest word spoke while yet mourned over father think that be called to marriage now a head of household have seen maiden so pleasant in sight a thou art lois ' tried to take hand put behind with childish shake of head half cry said 'please cousin manasseh say to dare say ought to be married being head of household now want to be married must rather not 'that be well spoken ' replied frowning little nevertheless must not like to take to wife over forward maiden ready to jump at wedlock besides congregation might talk if be to be married too soon after father death have perchance said enough even now wished thee to have thy mind set at ease a to thy future well doing thou wilt have leisure to think of to bring thy mind more fully round to ' again held out hand time took hold of with free frank gesture ' owe somewhat for kindness to ever since came cousin manasseh have way of paying by telling truly can love a dear friend if will let never a wife flung hand away did not take eye off face though glance be lowering gloomy muttered something did not quite hear so went on bravely although kept trembling little have much ado to keep from cry 'please let tell there be young man in barford nay manasseh can not speak if be so angry be hard work to tell how said that wanted to marry be poor father must have none of want to marry one if did must be ' voice dropped blush told rest manasseh stood looking at with sullen hollow eye have glittering touch of wilderness in then said 'it be borne in upon verily see a in vision thou must be spouse other man thou canst not escape what be foredoomed month ago when set to read old godly book in soul used to delight until thy coming saw letter of printer ink marked on page saw gold ruddy type of unknown language meaning whereof be whispered into soul be marry lois marry lois when father died knew be beginning of end be lord will lois thou canst not escape from ' again must have taken hand drawn towards time eluded with ready movement ' acknowledge be lord will manasseh ' said 'it be not borne in upon a puritan call be to be wife be none so set upon wedlock a to take even though there be other chance for for care for a ought to care for husband must have cared for very much a cousin a kind cousin ' stopped speaking must not choose right word with to speak to of gratitude friendliness yet must never be feeling nearer dearer no more than two parallel line can ever meet be so convinced by what considered spirit of prophecy that lois be to be wife that felt rather more indignant at what considered to be resistance to preordained decree than really anxious a to result again tried to convince that have choice in matter by saying 'the voice said unto marry lois said will lord ' 'but lois replied 'the voice a call have never spoken word to ' 'lois answered solemnly 'it will speak then wilt thou obey even a samuel did 'no indeed can not ' answered briskly may take dream to be truth hear own fancy if think about too long can not marry one from obedience ' lois thou art a yet unregenerate have seen thee in vision a one of elect robed in white a yet thy faith be too weak for thee to obey meekly will not always be so will pray that thou mayest see thy preordained course meanwhile will smooth away worldly obstacle manasseh cousin manasseh ' cried lois after a be leaving room back can not put in strong enough word manasseh there be power in heaven earth can make love thee enough to marry thee to wed thee without such love say solemnly because be better that must end at once ' for moment be staggered then lifted up hand said 'god forgive thee thy blasphemy remember hazael who said be thy servant dog that must do great thing went straight did because evil course be fixed appointed for from before foundation of world will not thy path be laid out among godly a hath be foretold to ' went away for minute two lois felt a if word must come true struggle a must hate doom a must must become wife under circumstance many girl must have succumbed to apparent fate isolated from previous connection hearing word from england living in heavy monotonous routine of family with one man for head man esteemed hero by most of around simply because be only man in family fact alone must have formed strong presumption that most girl must have yielded to offer of one besides there be much to tell upon imagination in day in place time be prevalently believed that there be manifestation of

submission submission at last break came upon monotony of long dark winter parishioner once more raised discussion whether parish extending a did be not absolutely necessary for pastor tappau to have help question have be mooted once before then pastor tappau have acquiesced in necessity have gone on smoothly for month after appointment of assistant until feeling have sprung up on part of elder minister might have be called jealousy of younger if so godly man a pastor tappau must have be supposed to entertain so evil passion however might be two party be speedily formed younger more ardent being in favour of mr nolan elder more persistent at time more numerous clinging to old grey headed dogmatic mr tappau who have married baptized child be to literally a 'pillar of church ' so mr nolan left salem carrying away with possibly more heart than of faith hickson certainly have never be same creature since now christmas one two of older member of congregation being dead who be younger men having come to settle in salem mr tappau being also older charitably supposed wiser fresh effort have be made mr nolan be returning to labour in ground apparently smoothed over lois have taken keen interest in proceeding for faith sake far more than latter did for spectator must have said faith wheel never went faster slower thread never broke colour never came eye be never uplifted with sudden interest time discussion respecting mr nolan return be going on lois after hint given by prudence have found clue to many sigh look of despairing sorrow even without help of nattee improvised song in under strange allegory helpless love of favourite be told to ear heedless of meaning except of tender hearted sympathetic lois occasionally heard strange chant of old indian woman half in own language half in broken english droned over simmering pipkin from smell be to say least unearthly once on perceiving odour in keeping room grace hickson suddenly exclaimed 'nattee be at heathen way again will have mischief unless be stayed ' faith moving quicker than ordinary said something about putting stop to so forestalled mother evident intention of going into kitchen faith shut door between two room entered upon remonstrance with nattee one must hear word used faith nattee seemed more bound together by love common interest than other two among self contained individual comprising household lois sometimes felt a if presence a third interrupted confidential talk between cousin old servant yet be fond of faith must almost think that faith liked more than did either mother brother sister for first two be indifferent a to unspoken feeling while prudence delighted in discovering only to make amusement to herself out of one day lois be sitting by herself at sewing table while faith nattee be holding one of secret conclave from lois felt to be tacitly excluded when outer door opened tall pale young man in strict professional habit of minister entered lois sprang up with smile look of welcome for faith sake for must be mr nolan whose name have be on tongue of one for day who be a lois knew expected to arrive day before seemed half surprised at glad alacrity with be received by stranger possibly have not heard of english girl who be inmate in house where formerly have seen only grave solemn rigid heavy face have be received with stiff form of welcome very different from blushing smiling dimpled look that innocently met with greeting almost of old acquaintance lois having placed chair for hastened out to call faith never doubting that feeling cousin entertained for young pastor be mutual although might be unrecognised in full depth by 'faith said bright breathless 'guess checking to assumed unconsciousness of particular importance likely to be affixed to word nolan new pastor be in keeping room have asked for aunt manasseh aunt be gone to prayer meeting at pastor tappau manasseh be away ' lois went on speaking to give faith time for girl have become deadly white at intelligence while at same time eye met keen cunning eye of old indian with peculiar look of half wondering awe while nattee look expressed triumphant satisfaction ' said lois smoothing faith hair kissing white cold cheek 'or will wonder why one come to see perhaps think be not welcome ' faith went without word into keeping room shut door of communication nattee lois be left together lois felt a happy a if piece of good fortune have befallen for time growing dread of manasseh wild ominous persistence in suit aunt coldness own loneliness be forgotten must almost have danced with joy nattee laughed aloud talked chuckled to herself 'old indian woman great mystery old indian woman sent hither thither go where be told where hears with ear old indian woman here drew up expression of face quite changed how to call then white man must come old indian have spoken never word white man have hear nothing with ear so old crone muttered time thing be going on very differently in keeping

sudden burst of courage impromptu hit cut gordian knot by making usual proposal for prayer adding to request that household might be summoned in came lois quiet decorous in came nattee one impassive

jealousy faith pushed away so violently that latter be hurt against hard sharp corner of wooden settle tear came into eye not so much because cheek be bruised a because of surprised pain felt at repulse from cousin towards whom be feeling so warmly kindly just for moment lois be a angry a child must have be of word of pastor nolan prayer yet rang in ear thought must be shame if did not let

that instant vengeance be not just deliberate punishment that there must be need of conviction perchance of confession hoped for redress for suffering child from revelation if be brought to confession must leave culprit in hand in of brother minister that might wrestle with satan before delivering up to civil power spoke well for spoke from heart of father seeing child exposed to dreadful mysterious suffering firmly believing that now held clue in hand must ultimately release fellow sufferer congregation moaned into unsatisfied submission listened to long passionate prayer uplifted even while hapless hota stood there guarded bound by two men who glared at like bloodhound ready to slip even while prayer ended in word of merciful saviour lois sickened shuddered at whole scene be

be at pastor tappau just like other woman only perchance trifle more good natured to think of being witch after faith seemed in hurry to reach home paid attention to prudence talking lois hastened on with faith for manasseh be walking alongside of mother kept steady to plan of avoiding even though pressed company upon faith who have seemed of late desirous of avoiding that evening news spread through salem that hota have confessed sin have acknowledged that be witch nattee be first to hear intelligence broke into room where girl be sitting with grace hickson solemnly doing nothing because of great prayer meeting in morning cried out beercy mercy mistress everybody take care of poor indian nattee who never do wrong for mistress family hota one bad wicked witch say so herself oh oh stooping over faith said something in low miserable tone of voice of lois only heard word 'torture ' faith heard turning very pale half accompanied half led nattee back to kitchen presently grace hickson came in have be out to see neighbour will not do to say that so godly woman have be gossiping indeed subject of conversation have held be of too serious momentous nature for to employ light word to designate there be listening to repeating of small detail rumour in speaker have concern that constitutes gossiping in instance trivial fact speech might be considered to bear such dreadful significance might have so ghastly ending that such whisper be occasionally raised to tragic importance fragment of intelligence related to mr tappau household be eagerly snatched at how dog howled one long night through must not be stilled how cow suddenly failed in milk only two month after have calved how memory have forsaken one morning for minute two in repeating lord prayer have even omitted clause thereof in sudden perturbation how forerunner of child strange illness might now be interpreted understood have formed staple of conversation between grace hickson friend there have arisen dispute among at last a to how far subjection to power of evil one be to be considered a judgment upon pastor tappau for sin on part if so what be not unpleasant discussion although there be considerable difference of opinion for a none of speaker have have family so troubled be rather proof that have none of committed sin in midst of talk one entering in from street brought news that hota have confessed have owned to signing certain little red book satan have presented to have be present at impious sacrament have ridden through air to newbury fall in fact have assented to question elder magistrate carefully reading over confession of witch who have formerly be tried in england in order that might not omit single inquiry have asked of more have owned to thing of inferior importance partaking more of nature of earthly trick than of spiritual power have spoken of carefully adjusted string by crockery in pastor tappau house must be pulled down disturbed of such intelligible malpractice gossip of salem took little heed one of said that such action showed satan prompting preferred to listen to grander guilt of blasphemous sacrament supernatural ride narrator ended with saying that hota be to be next morning in spite of confession even although life have be promised to if acknowledged sin for be well to make example of first discovered witch be also well that be indian heathen whose life must be no great loss to community grace hickson on spoke out be well that witch must perish off face of earth indian english heathen worse baptized christian who have betrayed lord even a juda did have gone over to satan for part wished that first discovered witch have be member of godly english household that might be seen of men religious folk be willing to cut off right hand pluck out right eye if tainted with devilish sin spoke sternly well last comer said that word might be brought to proof for have be whispered that hota have named others from most religious family of salem whom have seen among unholy communicant at sacrament of evil one grace replied that must answer for godly folk must stand proof quench natural affection rather than such sin must grow spread among have weak bodily dread of witnessing violent death even of animal must not let that deter from standing who cast accursed creature out from among on morrow morning contrary to wont grace hickson told family much of conversation be sign of excitement on subject that thus spoke excitement spread in different form through family faith be flushed restless wandering between keeping room kitchen questioning mother particularly a to more extraordinary part of hota confession a if wished to satisfy that indian witch have really done horrible mysterious deed lois shivered trembled with affright at narration idea that such thing be possible occasionally found wandering off into sympathetic thought for woman who be to die abhorred of men unpardoned by god to whom have be so fearful traitor who be now at very time when lois sat among kindred by warm cheerful firelight anticipating many peaceful perchance happy morrow solitary shivering panic stricken guilty with none to stand by exhort shut up in darkness between cold wall of town prison lois almost shrank from sympathising with so loathsome accomplice of satan prayed for forgiveness for charitable thought yet again remembered tender spirit of saviour allowed to fall into pity till at last sense of right wrong became so bewildered that must only leave to god disposal just ask that must take creature event into hand prudence be a bright a if be listening to merry story curious a to more than mother must tell seeming to have particular terror of witch witchcraft yet to be especially desirous to accompany mother next morning to hanging lois shrank from cruel eager face of young girl a begged mother to allow to go even grace be disturbed perplexed by daughter pertinacity 'no said 'ask more thou shalt not go such sight be not for young go sicken at thought of go to show that christian woman take god part against devil thou shalt not go tell thee must whip thee for thinking of ' beanasseh say hota

power of witchcraft did evil to speak of before thee let lois come sit by thee talk to thee ' lois went to cousin grieved at heart for depressed state of mind anxious to soothe comfort yet recoiling more than ever from idea of ultimately becoming wife idea to saw aunt reconciling unconsciously day by day a perceived english girl power of soothing comforting cousin even by very tone of sweet cooing voice took lois hand 'let hold doe good ' said 'ah lois when be by forget trouble will day never come when will listen to voice speaks to continually ' ' never hear cousin manasseh ' said softly 'but think of voice tell of land hope to enclose from forest what manner of tree grow on ' thus by simple question on practical affair led back in unconscious wisdom to subject on have always

woman thought travelled in one circle be that master miller have told on account to let man into place during absence that did not know if must not think two woman a bad yet that a be not men one must say have disobeyed for be shame to let dog be out such night a amante with ready wit told to let one know that have taken shelter there that night that then master must not blame while be thus enjoining secrecy a wisest course with view to far other people than miller be hastily helping to take off wet clothes spreading a well a brown mantle have covered before great stove warmed room with effectual heat that old woman failing vitality required time poor creature be discussing with a to whether have disobeyed order in kind of garrulous way that made fear much for capability of retaining anything secret if be questioned by by wandered away to unnecessary revelation of master whereabouts gone to help in search for landlord sieur de poissy who lived at chateau just above who have not returned from chase day before so intendant imagined might have met with accident have summoned neighbour to beat forest hill side told much besides giving to understand that must fain meet with place a housekeeper where there be more servant le to do a life here be very lonely dull especially since master son have gone away gone to war then took supper be evidently apportioned out to with sparing hand a even if idea have come into head have not enough to offer fortunately warmth be that required that thanks to amante care be returning to chilled body after supper old woman grew drowsy seemed uncomfortable at idea of going to sleep leaving still in house indeed gave pretty broad hint a to propriety of going once more out into bleak stormy night begged to be allowed to stay under shelter of kind at last bright idea came over bade mount by ladder to kind of loft went half over lofty mill kitchen in be sitting obeyed what else must do found in spacious floor without safeguard wall boarding

doze await master return pulled out bedding gladly laid down in dried clothes in warmth hoping to have sleep so much needed to refresh prepare for next day must not sleep be aware from breathing that amante be equally wakeful must see through crevice between board formed flooring into kitchen below very partially lighted by common lamp that hung against wall near stove on opposite side to on be portion far on in night there be voice outside reached in hiding place angry knocking at door saw through chink old woman rouse up to go open for master who came in evidently half drunk to sick horror be followed by lefebvre apparently a sober wily a ever be talking together a came in disputing about something miller stopped conversation to swear at old woman for having fallen asleep with tipsy anger even with blow drove poor old creature out of kitchen to bed then lefebvre went on talking about sieur de poissy disappearance seemed that lefebvre have be out day along with other of husband men ostensibly assisting in search in probability trying to blind sieur de poissy follower by putting on wrong scent also fancied from one two of lefebvre sly question combining hidden purpose of discovering although miller be tenant vassal to sieur de poissy seemed to to be much more in league with people of m de la tourelle be evidently aware in part of life lefebvre others led although again suppose knew imagined one half of crime also think be seriously interested in discovering fate of master little suspecting lefebvre of murder violence kept talking letting out sort of thought opinion watched by keen eye of lefebvre gleaming out below shaggy eyebrow be evidently not cue of latter to let out that master wife have escaped from vile terrible den though never breathed word relating to not le be certain be thirsting for blood lying in wait for at turn of event presently got up took leave miller bolted out stumbled off to bed then fell asleep slept sound long next morning when awoke saw amante half raised resting on one hand eagerly gazing with straining eye into kitchen below looked too heard saw miller two of men eagerly loudly talking about old woman who have not appeared a usual to make fire in stove prepare master breakfast who now late on in morning have be found dead in bed whether from effect of master blow night before from natural cause who can tell miller conscience upbraided little must say for be eagerly declaring value for housekeeper repeating how often have spoken of happy life led with men might have doubt did not wish to offend miller agreed that necessary step must be taken for speedy funeral so went out leaving in loft so much alone for first time almost ventured to speak freely though still in hushed voice pausing to listen continually amante took more cheerful view of whole occurrence than did said that have old woman lived must have have to depart that morning that quiet departure must have be best thing must have have to hope for a in probability housekeeper must have told master of of resting place fact must sooner later have be brought to knowledge of from whom most desired to keep concealed that now have time to rest shelter to rest in during first hot pursuit knew to fatal certainty be being carried on remnant of food stored up fruit must supply with provision only thing to be feared be that something might be required from loft miller someone else mount up in search of even then with little arrangement of box chest one part might be so kept in shadow that might yet escape observation comforted little asked how be ever to escape ladder be taken away be only mean of descent amante replied that must make sufficient ladder of rope lying coiled among other thing to drop down ten foot so with advantage of being portable so that might carry away thus avoid betrayal of fact that one have ever be hidden in loft during two day intervened before did escape amante made good use of time looked into box chest during man absence at mill finding in one box old suit of man clothes have probably belonged to miller absent son put on to see if must fit when found that did cut own hair to shortness of man made clip black eyebrow a close a though have be shaved by cutting up old cork into piece such a must go into cheek altered shape of face voice to degree must not have believed possible time lay like one stunned body resting renewing strength in almost idiotic state else surely must not have taken stupid interest remember did in amante energetic preparation for disguise absolutely recollect once feeling of smile coming over stiff face a new exercise of cleverness proved success towards second day required too to exert then heavy despair returned let dye fair hair complexion with decaying shell of stored up walnut let blacken teeth even voluntarily broke front better to effect disguise through have hope of evading terrible husband third night funeral be over drinking ended guest gone
