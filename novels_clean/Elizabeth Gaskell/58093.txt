young healthy people of sex doctor seem to have expected that must have be able to extract new kind of salt from blood might account for wonderful heat of body blood be just like of other people of

rushed up to organ loft chased girl out bidding remember ear not commit sacrilege of singing praise to god along with pure race medical report of dr guyons bringing fact argument to confirm opinion that there be physical reason why cagots must not be received on term of social equality by rest of world did more for client than legal decree promulgated two century before have done french proved truth of saying in hudibras thats convinced against will be of same opinion still indeed being convinced by dr guyon that ought to receive cagots a fellow creature only made more rabid in declaring that must not one two little occurrence be recorded show that bitterness of repugnance to cagots be in full force at time just preceding first french revolution there be m dabedos curate of lourbes brother to seigneur of neighbouring castle who be living in seventeen hundred eighty be well educated for time travelled man sensible moderate in respect that of abhorrence of cagots must insult from very altar calling out to a stood afar off oh ye cagots damned for evermore one day half blind cagot stumbled touched censer borne before abb de lourbes be immediately turned out of church forbidden ever to re enter one doe not know how to account for fact that very brother of bigoted abb seigneur of village went married cagot girl so be abb brought legal process against have estate taken from solely on account of marriage reduced to condition of cagot against whom old law be still in force descendant of seigneur de lourbes be simple peasant at very day working on land belonged to

last few year having two lover of reputed cagot descent employed notary to examine pedigree see of two have least cagot in to one gave hand in brittany prejudice seems to have be more virulent than anywhere else m emile souvestre record proof of hatred borne to in brittany so recently a in eighteen hundred thirty five just lately baker at hennebon having married girl of cagot descent lost custom

opprobrious name begged to be distinguished by appellation of malandrins to english ear one be much same a other a conveys meaning to day descendant of cagots like to have name applied to preferring that of malandrin french cagots tried to destroy record of pariah descent in commotion of seventeen hundred eighty nine if writing have disappeared tradition yet remains point out such such family a cagot malandrin oiselier according to old term of abhorrence there be various way in learned men have attempted to account for universal repugnance in well made powerful race be held say that antipathy to took rise in day when leprosy be dreadfully prevalent disease that cagots be more liable than other men to kind of skin disease not precisely leprosy resembling in of symptom such a dead whiteness of complexion swelling of face extremity there be also resemblance to ancient jewish custom in respect to leper in habit of people who on meeting cagot called out cagote cagote to be bound to reply perlute perlute leprosy be not properly infectious complaint in spite of horror in cagot furniture cloth woven by be held in place disorder be hereditary hence say body of wise men who have troubled to account for origin of cagoterie reasonableness justice of preventing mixed marriage by terrible tendency to leprous complaint might be spread far wide authority say that though cagots be fine looking men hard working good mechanic yet bear in face show in action reason for detestation in be held glance if meet be jettatura evil eye be spiteful cruel deceitful above other men quality derive from ancestor gehazi servant of elisha together with tendency to leprosy again be said that be descended from arian goth who be permitted to live in certain place in guienne languedoc after defeat by king clovis on condition that abjured heresy kept separate from other men for ever principal reason alleged in support of supposition of gothic descent be specious one of derivation chiens gots can gots cagots equivalent to dog of goth again be thought to be saracen coming from syria in confirmation of idea be belief that cagots be possessed by horrible smell lombard also be unfragrant race so reputed among italian witness pope stephen letter to charlemagne dissuading from marrying bertha daughter of didier king of lombardy lombard boasted of eastern descent be noisome cagots be noisome therefore must be of eastern descent what must be clearer in addition there be proof to be derived from name cagot maintaining opinion of saracen descent held to be chiens chasseurs de gots because saracen chased goth out of spain moreover saracen be originally mahometans a such obliged to bathe seven time day whence badge of duck foot duck be water bird mahometans bathed in water proof

in egypt be long way from brittany by anointing with blood of christian child blood gushed out of body of cagot on good friday wonder if be of jewish descent be only way of accounting for so portentous fact again cagots be capital carpenter gave breton reason to believe that ancestor be very jew who made cross when first tide of emigration set from brittany to america oppressed cagots crowded to port seeking to go to new country where race might be unknown here be proof of descent from abraham nomadic people forty year wandering in wilderness wandering jew be pressed into service to prove that cagots derived restlessness love of change from ancestor jew jew also practised art magic cagots sold bag of wind to breton sailor enchanted maiden to love maiden who never must have cared for unless have be previously enchanted made hollow rock tree give out strange unearthly noise sold magical herb called bon succs be true enough that in early act of fourteenth century same law apply to jew a to cagots appellation seem used indiscriminately fair complexion remarkable devotion to ceremony of catholic church many other circumstance conspire to forbid believing to be of hebrew descent very plausible idea be that be descendant of unfortunate individual afflicted with gotres be even to day not uncommon disorder in gorge valley of pyrene have even derived word gotre from got goth name crestiaa be not unlike cretin same symptom of idiotism be not unusual among cagots although sometimes if old tradition be to be credited malady of brain took rather form of violent delirium attacked at new full moon then workman laid down tool rushed off from labour to play mad prank up down country perpetual motion be required to alleviate agony of fury that seized upon cagots at such time in desire for rapid movement attack resembled neapolitan tarantella while in mad deed performed during such attack be not unlike northern berserker in barn especially suffering from madness be dreaded by pure race barnais going to cut wooden clog in great forest lay around base of pyrene feared above thing to go too near period when cagoutelle seized on oppressed accursed people from whom be then oppressor turn to fly man be living within memory of who have married cagot wife used to beat right soundly when saw first symptom of cagoutelle having reduced to wholesome state of exhaustion insensibility locked up until moon have altered shape in heaven if have not taken such decided step say oldest inhabitant there be knowing what might have happened from thirteenth to end of nineteenth

inhabitant of biarritz met in open air on eighth of may to number of one hundred fifty approved of conduct of baillie in rejecting arnauld made subscription gave power to lawyer to defend cause of pure race against etienne arnauld stranger who having married girl of cagot blood ought also to be expelled from holy place lawsuit be carried through local court ended by appeal to highest court in paris where decision be given against basque superstition etienne arnauld be thenceforward entitled to enter gallery of church of course inhabitant of biarritz be more ferocious for having be

at time went to law afterwards end of be that abb two accomplice be condemned to public confession of penitence to be uttered while on knee at church door just after high mass appealed to parliament of bourdeaux against decision met with better success than opponent of miller arnauld legaret be confirmed in right of standing where must in parish church that living cagot have equal right with other men in town of biarritz seemed now ceded to dead cagot be different thing inhabitant of pure blood struggled long hard to be interred apart from abhorred race cagots be equally persistent in claiming to have common burying ground again text of old testament be referred to pure blood quoted triumphantly precedent of uzziah leper twenty sixth chapter of second book of chronicle who be buried in field of sepulchre of king not in sepulchre cagots pleaded that be healthy able bodied with taint of leprosy near be met by strong argument so difficult to be refuted have quoted before leprosy be of two kind perceptible imperceptible if cagots be suffering from latter kind who must tell whether be free from not that decision must be left to judgment of others one sturdy cagot family alone belone by name kept up lawsuit claiming privilege of common sepulture for forty two year although cur of biarritz have to pay one hundred livres for cagot not interred in right place inhabitant

church while greater part of inhabitant be assisting at mass inside put gravel into lock so a to prevent use of duplicate key have pleasure of seeing proud pure blooded people file out with bended head through small low door used by abhorred cagots be naturally shocked at discovering from fact such a causeless rancour with innocent industrious people be so recently persecuted moral of history of accursed race may perhaps be best conveyed in word of epitaph on mr mary hand who lie buried in churchyard of stratford on avon what fault saw in pray strive to shun look at home there something to be done for time past have observed that miss duncan made good deal of occupation for herself in writing that did not like to notice employment of course made more curious many be silent conjecture of

boy to be trouble of late have absolutely loathed gibbering uncouth gesture loose shambling gait irritated michael inexpressibly did not come near yew nook for couple of day thought that must leave time to become anxious to see reconciled to plan be strange lonely day to susan be first have spent face to face with sorrow have turned from girl into woman for hitherto michael have never let twenty four hour pas by without coming to see since have have fever now that be absent seemed a though cause of irritation be removed from will who be much more gentle tractable than have be for many week

thee go lad never there knowing where must take thee to what must do with thee a say in bible nought death will part thee country side be full in day of story of brutal treatment offered to insane story be in fact too well founded truth of one of only must have be sufficient reason for strong prejudice existing against such place succeeding hour that susan passed alone with poor affectionate lad for sole companion served to deepen solemn resolution never to part with so when michael came be annoyed surprised by calm way in spoke a if following dr prestons advice be utterly entirely out of question have expected nothing le than consent reluctant might be still consent be extremely irritated must have repressed anger chose rather to give way to thinking that must thus best work upon susans affection so a to gain point somehow over reached now be astonished in turn at passion of indignation that burst into thou wilt not bide in same house with sayst thou there need for thy biding a far a can tell there solemn reason why must bide with own flesh blood keep to word pledged mother on death bed a for thee there tie know on to keep thee fro going to america botany bay very night if

manner then ill wish very good night went out of house door half expecting to be called back again instead heard hasty step inside bolt drawn whew said to think must leave lady alone for week two give time to come to sens shell not find so easy a think to let go so went past kitchen window in nonchalant style be not seen again at yew nook for week how did pas time for first day two be unusually cross with thing people came athwart then wheat harvest began be busy exultant about heavy crop then man came from distance to bid for lease of farm by father advice have be offered for sale a be so soon likely to remove to yew nook have so little idea that susan really must remain firm to determination that at once began to haggle with man who came after farm showed crop just got in managed skilfully enough to make good bargain for of course bargain have to be sealed at public house companion met with there soon became friend enough to tempt into langdale where again met with eleanor hebthwaite how did susan pas time for first day so be too angry offended to cry went about household duty in quick sharp jerking yet absent way shrinking one moment from will overwhelming with remorseful caress next third day of michael absence have relief of good fit of cry after grew softer more tender felt how harshly have spoken to remembered how angry have be made excuse for be wonder said to herself that have be vexed with wonder must not give in when have never tried to speak gently to reason with be to blame must tell so tell once again that mother have bade be to willie horrible story have heard about madhouse must be on side at once so watched for coming intending to apologise a soon a ever saw hurried over household work in order to sit quietly at sewing hear first distant sound of well known step whistle even sound of flying needle seemed too loud perhaps be losing exquisite instant of anticipation so stopped sewing looked longingly out through geranium leaf in order that eye might catch first stir of branch in wood path by generally came now then bird might spring out of covert otherwise leaf be heavily still in sultry weather of early autumn then must take up sewing with spasm of resolution must determine that certain task must be fulfilled before must again allow poignant luxury of expectation sick at heart be when evening closed in chance of day diminished yet stayed up longer than usual thinking that if be coming if be only passing along distant road sight of light in window might encourage to make appearance even at late hour while seeing house darkened shut up might quench such intention very sick weary at heart went to bed too desolate despairing to cry make moan in morning hope came afresh day chance so went on for week peggy understood young mistress sorrow full well respected by silence on subject willie seemed happier now that irritation of michael presence be removed for poor idiot have sort of antipathy to michael be kind of heart echo to repugnance in latter held altogether just at time willie be happiest of three a susan went into coniston to sell butter one saturday inconsiderate person told that have seen michael hurst night before said inconsiderate might rather have said unobservant for one who have spent hour in susan dixons company might have seen that disliked having reference made to subject

applethwaites in langdale have kind of harvest home be there among young folk very thick wi nelly hebthwaite old thomas niece thoult have to look after bit susan smiled sighed neighbour who have be speaking to be struck with gray stillness of face susan felt how well self command be obeyed by little muscle said to herself in spartan manner can bear without wincing blenching went home early at tearing passionate pace trampling breaking through obstacle of briar bush willie be moping in absence hanging listlessly on farm yard gate to watch for when saw set up one of strange inarticulate cry of be now learning meaning came towards with loose galloping run head limb shaking wagging with pleasant excitement suddenly turned from burst into tear sat down on stone by wayside not hundred yard from home buried face in hand gave way to passion of pent up sorrow so terrible full of agony be low cry that idiot stood by aghast silent joy gone for time not like joy turned into ash thought struck yes sight of woe made think great a exertion be ran stumbled shambled home buzzing with lip time never missed came back in trice bringing with cherished paper windmill bought on fatal day when michael have taken into kendal to have doom of perpetual idiotcy pronounced thrust into susans face hand lap regardless of injury frail plaything thereby received leapt before to think how have cured heart sorrow buzzing louder than ever susan looked up at glance of sad eye sobered began to whimper knew not why now comforter in turn tried to soothe by twirling windmill be broken made noise must not go round seemed to afflict susan more than tried to make right although saw task be hopeless while did so tear rained down unheeded from bent head on paper toy wont do said at last will never do again somehow took accident word a omen of love be broken that feared must never be pieced together more rose up took willies hand two went slowly in to house to surprise michael hurst sat in house place

greatest charm have secretly said to that if eleanor hebthwaite susan dixon be equal in point of rich must sooner have eleanor by far have begun to consider susan a termagant when thought of intercourse with recollection of somewhat warm hasty temper came far more readily to mind than remembrance of generous loving nature now stood face to face with eye tear swollen garment dusty here there torn in consequence of rapid progress through bushy by path did not make favourable impression on well clad mr gale dressed in best silk gown therefore unusually susceptible to appearance of be susans manner gracious cordial how must be when remembered what have passed between michael last time met for penitence have faded away under daily disappointment of last weary week be hospitable in substance bade peggy hurry on kettle busied among tea cup thankful that presence of mr gale a stranger must prevent immediate recurrence to one subject felt must be present in michael mind a well a in own mr gale be withheld by such feeling of delicacy have come ready primed with case have undertaken to bring girl to reason there be time to be lost have be prearranged between brother sister that be to stroll out into farm yard before sister introduced subject be so confident in success of argument that must need have triumph of victory a soon a possible accordingly brought hail storm of good reason to bear upon susan susan did not reply for long time be so indignant at intermeddling of stranger in deep family sorrow shame mr gale thought be gaining day urged argument more pitilessly even michael winced for susan wondered at silence shrunk out of sight into shadow hoping that sister might prevail annoyed at hard way in kept putting case suddenly susan turned round from occupation have
