long after sound of horse hoof on round stone of paved lane beyond home meadow have died away molly stood there shading eye looking at empty space of air in form have last appeared very breath seemed suspended only two three time after long interval drew miserable sigh be caught up into sob turned away at last must not go into house must not tell mr hamley must not forget how father have looked spoken left went out through side door be way by gardener passed when took manure into garden walk to led be concealed from sight a much a possible by shrub evergreen over arching tree one must know what became of with ingratitude of misery added to herself one must care mr hamley have own husband own child close home interest be very good kind there be bitter grief in molly heart with stranger must not intermeddle went quickly on to bourne have fixed for seat almost surrounded by drooping leaf of weeping ash seat on long broad terrace walk on other side of wood overlooked pleasant slope of meadow beyond walk have probably be made to command sunny peaceful landscape with tree church spire two three red tiled roof of old cottage purple bit of rising ground in distance at previous date when there might have be large family of hamleys residing at hall lady in hoop gentleman in bag wig with sword by side might have filled up breadth of terrace a sauntered smiling along one ever cared to saunter there now be deserted walk squire son might cross in passing to little gate led to meadow beyond one loitered there molly almost thought that one knew of hidden seat under ash tree for there be not more gardener employed upon ground than be necessary to keep kitchen garden such of ornamental part a be frequented by family in sight of house in good order when have once got to seat broke out with suppressed passion of grief did not care to analyze source of tear sob father be going to be married again father be angry with have done very wrong have gone away displeased have lost love be going to be married away from away from child little daughter forgetting own dear dear mother so thought in tumultuous kind of way sobbing till be wearied out have to gain strength by being quiet for time to break forth into passion of tear afresh have cast on ground that natural throne for violent sorrow leant up against old moss grown seat sometimes burying face in hand sometimes clasping together a if by tight painful grasp of finger must deaden mental suffering did not see roger hamley returning from meadow hear click of little white gate have be out dredging in pond ditch have wet sling net with imprisoned treasure of nastiness over shoulder be coming home to lunch having always fine midday appetite though pretended to despise meal in theory knew that mother liked companionship then depended much upon luncheon be seldom downstairs visible to family much before time so overcame theory for sake of mother have reward in hearty relish with kept company in eating did not see molly a crossed terrace walk on way homewards have gone about twenty yard along small wood path at right angle to terrace when looking among grass wild plant under tree spied out one be rare one have be long wishing to find in flower saw at last with bright keen eye of down went net skilfully twisted so a to retain content while lay amid herbage went with light well planted footstep in search of treasure be so great lover of nature that without thought habitually always avoided treading unnecessarily on plant who knew what long sought growth insect might develop in now appeared insignificant step led in direction of ash tree seat much le screened from observation on side than on terrace stopped saw light coloured dress on ground somebody half lying on seat so still just then wondered if person whoever be have fallen ill fainted paused to watch in minute two sob broke out again word be miss gibson cry out in broken voice oh papa papa if must come back for minute two thought must be kinder to leave fancying unobserved have even made retrograde step two on tip toe then heard miserable sobbing again be farther than mother must walk else be sorrow what must be natural comforter of girl visitor however whether be right wrong delicate obtrusive when heard sad voice talking again in such tone of uncomforted lonely misery turned back went to green tent under ash tree started up when came thus close to tried to check sob instinctively smoothed wet tangled hair back with hand looked down upon with grave kind sympathy did not know exactly what to say be lunch time said trying to believe that did not see trace of tear disturbance of feature that have not seen lying sobbing heart out there know be going home to lunch must let say must go on when saw distress have anything happened anything in can help mean for of course have right to make inquiry if be private sorrow in can be of use have exhausted so much with cry that felt a if must neither stand walk just yet sate down on seat sighed turned so pale thought be going to faint wait moment said quite unnecessarily for must not have stirred be off like shot to spring of water that knew of in wood in minute two returned with careful step bringing little in broad green leaf turned into impromptu cup little a be did good thank said can walk back now in short time stop must let said mother must like to leave to come home alone while be so faint so remained in silence for little while breaking off examining one two abnormal leaf of ash tree partly from custom of nature partly to give time to recover papa be going to be married again said at length must not have said why told instant before spoke have intention of doing so dropped leaf held in hand turned round looked at poor wistful eye be filling with tear a met with dumb appeal for sympathy look be much more eloquent than word there be momentary pause before replied then be more because felt that must say something than that be in doubt a to answer to question asked be sorry for did not take eye away from a quivering lip formed word yes though voice made sound be silent again now looking on ground kicking softly at loose pebble with foot thought did not come readily to surface in shape of word be apt at giving comfort till saw way clear to real source from consolation must come at last spoke almost a if be reasoning out matter with seems a if there might be case where setting question of love entirely on one side must be almost duty to find one to be substitute for mother can believe said in different tone of voice looking at molly afresh that step may be greatly for father happiness may relieve from many care may give pleasant companion have know what be to other at least what be to added humbly still must have thought for best must have done may have thought best for sake even more than for own be what tried to convince of roger began kicking pebble again have not got hold of right end of

wish be not be a anxious for harriet to be happy a harriet be for father father future wife may be of same kind though such people be rare think be though murmured molly waft of recollection bringing to mind detail of day at tower long ago roger did not want to hear molly reason for doubting speech felt a if have right to hear more of mr gibson family life past present to come than be absolutely necessary for in order that might comfort help cry girl whom have come upon so unexpectedly besides wanted to go home be with mother at lunch time yet must not leave alone be right to hope for best

real suffering to took pain to lighten in own way be characteristic enough that evening adjusted microscope put treasure have collected in morning ramble on little table then asked mother to come admire of course molly came too be what have intended tried to interest in pursuit cherished first little morsel of curiosity nursed into very proper desire for further information then brought out book on subject translated slightly pompous technical language into homely day speech molly have come down to dinner wondering how long hour till bedtime must ever pas away hour during must not speak on one thing must be occupying mind to exclusion of others for be afraid that already have wearied mr hamley with during afternoon tte tte prayer bedtime came long before expected have be refreshed by new current of thought be very thankful to roger now there be to morrow to come confession of penitence to be made to father mr gibson did not want speech word be not fond of expression of feeling at

be living in strange unknown world not till after michaelmas then continuing on own thought added worst be be gone perpetuated own affected name by having daughter called after cynthia one think of moon man in moon with bundle of faggot be thankful be plain molly child how old be cynthia mean ay get accustomed to name must think cynthia kirkpatrick be about a old a be be at school in france picking up air grace be to come home for wedding so will be able to get acquainted with then though think be to go back again for half year so chapter xi making friendship mr gibson believed that cynthia kirkpatrick be to return to england to be present at mother wedding mr kirkpatrick have such intention be not what be commonly called woman of determination somehow what disliked avoided what liked tried to do to have so although in conversation have already led to a to when how be to be married have listened quietly to mr gibson proposal that molly cynthia must be two bridesmaid still have felt how disagreeable must be to to have young daughter flashing out beauty by side of faded bride mother a further arrangement for wedding became more definite saw further reason in own mind for cynthia remaining quietly at school at boulogne mr kirkpatrick have gone to bed that first night of engagement to mr gibson fully anticipating speedy marriage looked to a release from thraldom of keeping school keeping unprofitable school with barely pupil enough to pay for house rent tax food washing requisite master saw reason for ever going back to ashcombe except to wind up affair to pack up clothes hoped that mr gibson ardour must be such that must press on marriage urge never to resume school drudgery to relinquish now for ever even made up very pretty very passionate speech for in own mind quite sufficiently strong to prevail upon to overthrow scruple felt ought to have at telling parent of pupil that did not intend to resume school that must find place of education for daughter in last week one of midsummer holiday be rather like douche of cold water on mr kirkpatrick plan when next morning at breakfast lady cumnor began to decide upon arrangement duty of two middle aged lover of course ca give up school at once clare wedding ca be before christmas will do very well will be down at tower will be nice amusement for child to go over to ashcombe see married think be afraid believe mr gibson will like waiting so long men be so impatient under circumstance oh nonsense lord cumnor have recommended to tenant be sure must like to be put to inconvenience mr gibson will see that in moment be man of sense else must be family doctor now what be going to do about little girl have fixed yet yesterday there seemed so little time when one be agitated be so difficult to think of anything cynthia be nearly eighteen old enough to go out a governess if wish think will be so generous kind well must give time to settle of affair to day waste in sentiment be too old for come to clear understanding with other will be for happiness in long run so did come to clear understanding about one two thing to mr kirkpatrick dismay found that mr gibson have more idea than lady cumnor of breaking faith with parent of pupil though really be at serious loss a to what be to become of molly till must be under protection of new wife at own home though domestic worry teased more more day be too honourable to think of persuading mr kirkpatrick to give up school week sooner than be right for sake did not even perceive how easy task of persuasion must be with winning wile must scarcely lead to feel impatience for wedding to take place at michaelmas can hardly tell what comfort relief will be to hyacinth when be once wife mistress of home poor little molly mother protector must interfere with previous engagement for world must be right thank own love how good be so many men must think only of own wish interest be sure parent of dear pupil will admire will be quite surprised at consideration for interest tell then hate being admired why must say be wish to keep on school till have have time to look out for because be said daring all long to be making happy want to make home place of rest comfort to do so wish to cherish sweet molly a hope to do when come to be mother ca take virtue to myself doe belong to if have to speak for will say 'good people find school for daughter by michaelmas for after time must go make happiness of others ca bear to think of long ride in november coming home wet at night with one to take care of oh if leave to will advise parent to take daughter away from care of one whose heart will be absent though must consent to time before michaelmas must be fair right be sure must urge be too good well if think that will consider have acted uprightly by let be michaelmas with heart what doe lady cumnor say oh told be afraid must like waiting because of difficulty with servant because of molly must be so desirable to enter on new relationship with a soon a possible to be sure so must poor child be afraid intelligence of engagement have rather startled cynthia will feel deeply too said mr kirkpatrick unwilling to let daughter be behind mr gibson in sensibility affection will have over to wedding molly will be bridesmaid said mr gibson in unguarded warmth of heart plan did not quite suit mr kirkpatrick thought best not to oppose until have presentable excuse to give perhaps also reason must naturally arise out of future circumstance so at time only smiled softly pressed hand held in hers be question whether mr kirkpatrick molly wished most for day to be over be to spend together at tower mr kirkpatrick be rather weary of girl a class trial of life be connected with girl in way be very young when first became governess have be worsted in struggle with pupil in first place ever went to elegance of appearance manner accomplishment more than character acquirement have rendered easier for than for most to obtain good situation have be absolutely petted in still be constantly encountering naughty stubborn over conscientious severe judging curious observant girl again before cynthia be born have longed for boy thinking possible that if three four intervening relation died might come to be baronet instead of son lo behold be daughter nevertheless with dislike to girl in abstract a plague of life aversion be not diminished by fact of having kept school for young lady at ashcombe really meant to be a kind a must be to new step daughter whom remembered principally a black haired sleepy

individual knew nothing only knew be going to see be seen by live countess nay more by countess of hollingford mr kirkpatrick led into lady cumnor presence by hand in presenting said dear little daughter lady cumnor now clare let have nonsense be not daughter yet may never be believe that one third of engagement have heard of have never come to marriage miss gibson be very glad to see for father sake when know better hope will be for own molly very heartily hoped that might never be known better by stern looking lady who sate so upright in easy chair prepared for lounging therefore gave more effect to stiff attitude lady cumnor luckily took molly silence for acquiescent humility went on speaking after further little pause of inspection yes yes like look clare may make something of will be great advantage to dear to have lady who have trained up several young people of quality always about just at time when be growing up will tell clare sudden thought striking must become

turned over with pair of scissors lounging chair have for use at own home straight upright a sate now in lady cumnor presence dainty morsel savoury small to treated for own solitary supper many other similarly pleasant thing must have to be foregone if molly came to be pupil parlour boarder visitor a lady cumnor be planning one two thing clare be instinctively resolved upon to be married at michaelmas not to have molly at ashcombe smiled a sweetly a if plan proposed be most charming project in world while time poor brain be beating about in bush for reason excuse of must make use at

with prettiest most trustful action will try hard to love to do can to make happy must not take away from papa just very last bit of time that will have mr kirkpatrick fondled hand thus placed in hers be grateful to girl for outspoken opposition to lady cumnor plan clare be however exceedingly unwilling to back up molly by word of own until lady cumnor have spoken given cue there be something in molly little speech in straightforward manner amused instead of irritating lady cumnor in present mood perhaps be tired of silkiness with have be shut up for so many day put up glass looked at before speaking then said upon word young lady why clare have got work before not what there be good deal of truth in what say must be very disagreeable to girl of age to have stepmother coming in between father may be advantage to in long run molly almost felt a if must make friend of stiff old countess for clearness of sight a to plan proposed being trial be afraid in new born desire of thinking for others of mr kirkpatrick being hurt need not have feared a far a outward sign went for smile be still on lady pretty rosy lip soft fondling of hand never stopped lady cumnor be more interested in molly more looked at gaze be pretty steady through gold rimmed eye glass began sort of catechism string of very straightforward question such a lady under rank of countess might have scrupled to ask

accomplishment since have have governess never heard of such nonsense went on lashing up only daughter if there have be dozen there might have be sense in molly did not speak be by strong effort that kept silence mr kirkpatrick fondled hand more perseveringly than ever hoping thus to express sufficient amount of sympathy to prevent from saying anything injudicious caress have become wearisome to molly only irritated nerve took hand out of mr kirkpatrick with slight manifestation of impatience be perhaps fortunate for general peace just at moment mr gibson be announced be odd enough to see how entrance of person of opposite sex into assemblage of men woman calm down little discordance disturbance of mood be case now at mr gibson entrance lady took off glass smoothed brow mr kirkpatrick managed to get up very becoming blush a for molly face glowed with delight white teeth pretty dimple came out like sunlight on landscape of course after first greeting lady have to have private interview with doctor molly future stepmother wandered about in garden with arm round other waist hand in hand like two babe in wood mr kirkpatrick active in such endearment molly passive feeling within very shy strange for have that particular kind of shy modesty make one uncomfortable at receiving caress from person towards whom heart doe not go forth with impulsive welcome then came early dinner lady cumnor having hers in quiet of own room to be still prisoner once twice during meal idea crossed molly mind that father disliked position a middle aged lover being made so evident to men in waiting a be by mr kirkpatrick affectionate speech innuendo tried to banish tint of pink sentimentalism from conversation to confine to matter of fact when mr kirkpatrick must persevere in referring to such thing a have bearing on future relationship of party insisted upon viewing in most matter of fact way continued even after men have left room old rhyme molly have heard betty use must keep running in head making uneasy two be company three be trumpery where must go to in strange house what ought to do be roused from fit of wonder abstraction by father saying what do think of plan of lady cumnor say be advising to have molly a visitor at ashcombe until be married mr kirkpatrick countenance fell if only molly must be so good a to testify again a have done before lady cumnor if proposal be made by father must come to daughter from different quarter than have done from strange lady be ever so great molly did not say anything only looked pale wistful anxious mr kirkpatrick have to speak for must be charming plan only well know why must rather not have love wo tell papa for fear of making vain think must leave with dear mr gibson to have to herself for last few week must be cruel to take away know dear told of reason why doe not do to have molly at home just at present said mr gibson eagerly for more knew of future wife more felt necessary to remember that with foible must be able to stand between molly such adventure a have occurred lately with mr coxe so one of good reason for step have taken be always present to while have slipped off smooth surface of mr kirkpatrick mirror like mind without leaving impression now recalled on seeing mr gibson anxious face what be molly feeling at last word of father have be sent from home for reason kept secret from told to strange woman be there to be perfect confidence between two to be for ever shut out be what concerned though how did not know to be discussed between for future to be kept in dark bitter pang

desire made yet in deadness lay only comfort so seemed wandering in such maze hardly knew how conversation went on third be indeed trumpery where there be entire confidence between two who be company from other be shut out be positively unhappy father did not appear to see be absorbed with new plan new wife be to be did notice be truly sorry for little girl only thought that there be greater chance for future harmony of household if did not lead molly to define present feeling by putting into word be general plan to repress emotion by not showing sympathy felt yet when have to leave took

accept apology for tardiness to assure that quite understood pressure of business on land owner who farmed own estate such apology be made shook hand heartily a mark of congratulation on good fortune in having secured prize a friend gibson said nothing about long neglect of duty molly who by time knew few strong expression of countenance well be sure that something be matter that be very much disturbed hardly attended to mr gibson fluent opening of conversation for have already determined to make favourable impression on father of handsome young man who be heir to estate besides own

be told that mr gibson have changed mind about giving gown thought now that must reserve for cynthia if only be long enough cynthia be so tall quite overgrown in fact chance seemed equally balanced a to whether molly might not have gown after chapter xviii mr be secret illustration untitled osborne roger came to hall molly found roger established there when returned after absence at home gathered that osborne be coming very little be said about in way squire scarcely ever left wife room sat by watching now then moaning to be so much under influence of opiate that did not often rouse up when did almost invariably asked for molly on rare occasion must ask after osborne where be if have be told if be coming in weakened confused state of intellect seemed to have retained two strong impression one of sympathy with molly have received confidence about other of anger husband entertained against before squire never mentioned be name did seem at ease in speaking about to roger while when be alone with molly hardly spoke of one else must have have sort of wandering idea that roger blamed brother while remembered molly eager defence have thought hopelessly improbable at time at rate made molly confidante about first born sent to ask roger how soon must come for seemed to know perfectly well that be coming tell roger say will tell be several day before molly must ask roger question meanwhile mr hamley state have materially altered at length molly came upon roger sitting in library head buried in hand did not hear footstep till be close beside then lifted up face red stained with tear hair ruffled up in disorder have be wanting to see alone began mother doe so want news of brother osborne told last week to ask about did not like to speak of before father have hardly ever named to know why for to used to talk of perpetually have seen so little of week think forgets great deal now still if mind must like to be able to tell something if asks again put head

like will tell something more about brother really hunger for news of 'd better ask yet be so involved by promise of secrecy molly must satisfy if once began to question believe be in belgium that went there about fortnight ago partly to avoid creditor know father have refused to pay debt yes at least knew something like believe father must raise money at once without having recourse to step must exceedingly recoil from yet for time place osborne in very awkward position think what vexes father good deal be mystery a to how money be spent if mother ever say anything about part of affair said roger hastily assure from that there be nothing of vice wrong doing about ca say more be tied set mind at ease on point be not sure if remembers painful anxiety about said molly used to speak great deal to about before came when father seemed so angry now whenever see want to talk on old subject doe remember so clearly if be to see believe must recollect why be uneasy about while be absent must be here soon expect day said roger uneasily do think father will be very angry with asked molly with a much timidity a if squire displeasure might be directed against know said roger mother illness may alter did easily forgive formerly remember once be nothing to purpose ca help fancying that have put under strong restraint for mother sake that wo express much doe follow that will forget father be man of few affection what have be very strong feel anything touch on point deeply permanently that unlucky valuing of property have given father idea of post obit what be asked molly raising money to be paid on father death of course involves calculation a to duration of life how shocking said be a sure a be of own life that osborne never did anything of kind father expressed suspicion in language irritated osborne doe speak out wo justify even a much a might much a love have little influence over else must tell father all well must leave to time added sighing mother must have brought right if 'd be what once be turned away leaving molly very sad knew that member of family cared for so much be in trouble out of saw exit small power of helping be diminishing day by day a mr hamley sank more more under influence of opiate stupefying illness father have spoken to only very day of desirableness of returning home for good mr gibson wanted for particular reason for many small fragment of reason mr hamley have ceased to want much only occasionally appearing to remember existence position father thought idea have not entered head in family of only woman be invalid confined to bed be becoming awkward molly have begged hard to remain two three day longer only that only till friday if mr hamley must want argued with tear in eye must hear that have left house must think so unkind so ungrateful dear child be getting past wanting one keenness of earthly feeling be deadened papa be worst of can not bear wo believe may not ask for again may quite forget be sure to very last if medicine stupefy will look round for squire child for poor osborne most of because be in sorrow mr gibson shook head said nothing in reply in minute two asked like to take away while even fancy can

course must make noise step may go in see must tell be almost certain wo ask for may papa will go home on friday if doe not think will so molly hung about house trying to do must out of sick room for comfort of in only came out for meal for necessary business found little time for talking to so life be solitary enough waiting for call never came evening of day on have have above conversation with roger osborne arrived came straight into drawing room where molly be seated on rug reading by firelight a did not like to ring for candle merely for own use osborne came in with kind of hurry almost made appear a if must trip up fall down molly rose have not noticed before now came forward took hold of hand leading into full flickering light straining eye to look into face how be will tell must know truth have travelled day night since got father letter before must frame answer have sate down in nearest chair covering eye with hand be very ill said molly that know think suffers much pain have wanted sadly groaned aloud father forbade to come know said molly anxious to prevent self reproach brother be away too think one knew how ill be have be invalid for so long know yes told great deal be very fond of god know how loved if have not be forbidden to come home must have told all doe father know of coming now yes said molly told papa have sent for just at moment squire came in have not heard of osborne arrival be seeking molly to ask to write letter for osborne did not stand up when father entered be too much exhausted too much oppressed by feeling also too much estranged by father angry suspicious letter if have come forward with manifestation of feeling at moment everything might have be different waited for father to see before uttered word that squire said when eye fell upon at last be here sir breaking off in direction be giving to molly abruptly left room time heart be yearning after first born mutual pride kept asunder yet went straight to butler asked of when mr osborne have arrived how have come if have have refreshment dinner what since arrival for think forget everything now said poor squire putting hand up to head for life of ca remember whether have have dinner not long night sorrow watching quite bewilder perhaps sir will take dinner with mr osborne mr morgan be sending up directly hardly sate down at dinner time sir thought mistress wanted something ay remember now wo have more give mr osborne what wine chooses perhaps can eat drink so squire went away upstairs with bitterness a well a sorrow in heart when light be brought molly be struck with change in osborne looked haggard worn perhaps with travelling anxiety not quite such dainty gentleman a molly have thought when have last seen calling on stepmother two month before liked better now tone of remark pleased more be simpler le ashamed of showing feeling asked after roger in warm longing kind of way roger be out have ridden to ashcombe to transact business for squire osborne evidently wished for return hung about restlessly in drawing room after have dined be sure may see to night asked molly for third fourth time indeed will go up again if like mr jones nurse dr nicholls sent be very decided person went up while be at dinner mr hamley have just taken drop be on account to be disturbed by seeing one much le by excitement osborne kept walking up down long drawing room half talking to half to molly wish roger must come seems to be only one to give welcome doe father always live upstairs in mother room miss gibson have done since last attack believe reproach for not having be enough alarmed before heard word said to be not much of welcome be dear mother who always whether be to blame not suppose roger be sure to come home to night quite sure be staying here be not do often see mother doe omnipotent nurse keep out too mr hamley have asked for for three day now go into room unless asks be leaving on friday believe mother be very fond of know after while said in voice have great deal of sensitive pain in tone suppose do know whether be quite conscious quite not always conscious said molly tenderly have to take so many opiate never wanders only forgets sleep oh mother mother said stopping suddenly hanging over fire hand on chimney piece when roger came home molly thought time to retire poor girl be getting to be time for to leave scene of distress in must be of use sobbed to sleep tuesday night two day more must be friday must have to wrench up root have shot down into ground weather be bright next morning morning sunny weather cheer up young heart molly sate in dining room making tea for gentleman a came down must not help hoping that squire osborne might come to better understanding before left for after in dissension between father son lay bitterer sting than in illness sent by god though met at breakfast table purposely avoided addressing other perhaps natural subject of conversation between two at time must have be long journey night before have never spoken of place have come from whether north south east west squire did not choose to allude to anything might bring out what son wished to conceal again there be unexpressed idea in mind that mr hamley present illness be much aggravated if not entirely brought on by discovery of osborne debt so many inquiry answer on head be tabooed in fact attempt at easy conversation be limited to local subject principally addressed to molly roger such intercourse be not productive of pleasure even of friendly feeling though there be thin outward surface of politeness peace long before day be over molly wished that have acceded to father proposal gone home with one seemed to want mr jones nurse assured time after time that mr hamley have never named name small service in sick room be not required since there be regular nurse osborne roger seemed in to other molly now felt how much short conversation have have with roger have served to give something to think about during remainder of solitary day osborne be extremely polite even expressed gratitude to for attention to mother in very pleasant manner appeared to be unwilling to show of deeper feeling of heart almost ashamed of exhibition of emotion night before spoke to a agreeable young man speaks to pleasant young lady molly almost resented be only squire who seemed to make of account gave letter to write small bill to reckon up must have kissed hand for thankfulness last afternoon of stay at hall came roger have gone out on squire business molly went into garden thinking over last summer when mr hamley sofa used to be placed under old cedar tree on lawn when warm air seemed to be scented with rose sweetbriar now tree leafless there be sweet odour in keen frosty air looking up at house there be white sheet of blind shutting out pale winter sky from invalid room then thought of day father have brought news of second marriage thicket be tangled with dead weed rime hoar frost beautiful fine articulation of branch bough delicate twig be intertwined in leafless distinctness against sky must ever be so passionately unhappy again be goodness be numbness that made feel a though life be too short to be troubled much about anything death seemed only reality have energy heart to walk far briskly turned back towards house afternoon sun be shining brightly on window stirred up to unusual activity by unknown cause housemaid have opened shutter window of generally unused library middle window be also door white painted wood went halfway up molly turned along little flag paved path led past library window to gate in white railing at front of house went in at opened door have have leave given to choose out book wished to read to take home with be just sort of half dawdling employment suited to taste afternoon mounted on ladder to get to particular shelf high up in dark corner of room finding there volume that looked interesting sat down on step to read part of there sat in bonnet cloak when osborne suddenly came in did not see at first indeed seemed in such hurry that probably might not have noticed at if have not spoken be in way only came here for minute to look for book came down step a spoke still holding book in hand not at be who be disturbing must just write letter for post then will be gone be not open door too cold for oh be so fresh pleasant began to read again sitting on lowest step of ladder to write at large old fashioned writing table close to window there be minute two of profound silence in rapid scratching of osborne pen upon paper be only sound then came click of gate roger stood at open door face be towards osborne sitting in light back to molly crouched up in corner held out letter said in hoarse breathlessness here be letter from wife osborne went past post office thought osborne stood up angry dismay upon face roger what have done see roger looked round molly stood up in corner red trembling miserable a though be guilty person roger entered room three seemed to be equally dismayed molly be first to speak came forward said be so sorry did wish to hear must help will trust wo turning to roger said to with tear in eye please say know will not tell ca help said osborne gloomily only roger who knew of what importance be ought to have looked round before speaking so must said roger be more vexed with than can conceive not what be a sure of a of continued turning to molly yes said osborne see how many chance there be that even best meaning person may let out what be of such consequence to to keep secret know think so said roger well let begin that old discussion again at rate before third person molly have have hard work time to keep from cry now that be alluded to a third person before whom conversation be to be restrained said be going away perhaps ought not to have be here be very sorry very will try forget what have heard ca do said osborne still ungraciously will promise never to speak about to one not even to to roger will try to act speak a if have never heard be sure from what roger have told about that if give promise may rely upon yes will promise said molly putting out hand a kind of pledge osborne took rather a if action be superfluous added think must have done so even without promise be perhaps better to bind will go away now wish 'd never come into room put down book on table very softly turned to leave room choking down tear until be in solitude of own chamber roger be at door before holding open for reading felt that be reading face held out hand for hers firm grasp expressed sympathy regret for what have occurred must hardly keep back sob till reached bedroom feeling have be overwrought for time past without finding natural vent in action leaving hamley hall have seemed so sad before now be troubled with having to bear away secret ought never to have known knowledge of have brought out very uncomfortable responsibility then there must arise very natural wonder a to who be wife be molly have not stayed so long so intimately in hamley family without being well aware of manner in future lady of hamley be planned for squire for instance partly in order to show that osborne heir be above reach of molly gibson doctor daughter in early day before knew molly well have often alluded to grand high wealthy marriage hamley of hamley a represented by clever brilliant handsome son osborne might be expected to make mr hamley too unconsciously on part showed project that be constantly devising for reception of unknown daughter in law be to be drawing room must be refurnished when osborne marries osborne wife will like to have west suite of room to herself will perhaps be trial to to live with old couple must arrange so that will feel a little a possible of course when mr osborne come must try give new carriage old one doe well enough for similar speech have given molly impression of future mr osborne a of beautiful grand young lady whose very presence must make old hall into stately formal mansion instead of pleasant unceremonious home that be at present osborne too who have spoken with such languid criticism to mr gibson about various country belle even in own home be apt to give air only at home air be poetically fastidious while with mr gibson have be socially fastidious what unspeakably elegant beauty have chosen for wife who have

sized house there be difficulty in finding way very little trouble in conjecturing must enable stranger to discover room cynthia have so captivated molly that wanted to devote to new comer service ever since have heard of probability of having sister called sister whether be scotch sister sister la mode de brtagne must have puzzled most people molly have allowed fancy to dwell much on idea of cynthia coming in short time since have met cynthia unconscious power of fascination have be exercised upon people have power of course effect be only manifested in susceptible school girl may be found in school who attracts influence others not by virtue beauty sweetness cleverness by something can neither be described reasoned upon be something alluded to in old line love not for comely

over men over own sex can not be defined rather be so delicate mixture of many gift quality that be impossible to decide on proportion of perhaps be incompatible with very high principle a essence seems to consist in most exquisite power of adaptation to varying people still more various mood being thing to men at rate molly might soon have be aware that cynthia be not remarkable for unflinching morality glamour thrown over must have prevented molly from attempt at penetrating into judging companion character even have such process be least in accordance with own disposition cynthia be very beautiful be so well aware of fact that have forgotten to care about one with such loveliness ever appeared so little conscious of molly must watch perpetually a moved about room with free stately step of wild animal of forest moving almost a be to continual sound of music dress too though now to idea must be considered ugly disfiguring be suited to complexion figure fashion of

useful french pattern if have patiently waited for mother answer to letter have sent announcing return by opportunity madame have found for molly be hurt for cynthia at speech thought implied that pleasure mother felt in seeing fortnight sooner after two year absence be inferior to must have received from bundle of silver paper pattern cynthia took apparent notice of frequent recurrence of small complaint indeed received much of what mother said with kind of complete indifference that made mr gibson hold rather in awe be much more communicative to molly than to own child with regard to dress however cynthia soon showed that be mother own daughter in manner in must use deft nimble finger be capital workwoman unlike molly who excelled in plain sewing have notion of dressmaking millinery must repeat fashion have only seen in passing along street of boulogne with one two pretty rapid movement of hand a turned twisted ribbon gauze mother furnished with so refurbished gibson wardrobe doing in sort of contemptuous manner source of molly must not quite make out day after day course of small frivolity be broken in upon by news mr gibson brought of mr hamley nearer approach to death molly very often sitting by cynthia surrounded by ribbon wire net heard bulletin like toll of funeral bell at marriage feast father sympathized with be loss of dear friend to too be so accustomed to death that seemed to a be natural end of thing human to molly death of one have known so well loved so much be sad gloomy phenomenon loathed small vanity with be surrounded must wander out into frosty garden pace walk be sheltered concealed by evergreen at length yet be not so long not fortnight since molly have left hall end came mr hamley have sunk out of life a gradually a have sunk out of consciousness place in world quiet wave closed over place knew more sent love to molly said father roger said knew how must feel gibson have come in very late be having solitary dinner in

much for one do believe love little molly whom have only known for ten day better than one not than mother said molly in grave astonishment yes than mother replied cynthia half smiling be very shocking daresay be so now go condemn think love for one mother quite come by nature remember how much have be separated from mine loved father if will continued with force of truth in tone then

tuesday that after roger hamley be to go back to cambridge will seem a if nothing have happened wonder how squire mr osborne hamley will get on together be eldest son be not why must father get on well together oh know be to say do know think ought not to tell be so pedantically truthful molly besides manner show when speak truth when speak falsehood without troubling to use word knew exactly what ' know meant never consider bound to be truthful so beg may be on equal term cynthia might well say did not consider bound to be truthful literally said what came uppermost without caring very much whether be accurate not there be ill nature in general way attempt at procuring advantage for herself in deviation there be often such latent sense of fun in molly must not help being amused with in fact though condemned in theory cynthia playfulness of manner glossed such failing over with kind of charm yet at time be so soft sympathetic that molly must not resist even when affirmed most startling thing little account made of own beauty pleased mr gibson extremely pretty deference to won heart be restless too till have attacked molly dress after have remodelled mother now for sweet one said a began upon one of molly gown have be working a connoisseur until now now begin a amateur brought down pretty artificial flower plucked out of own best bonnet to put into molly saying must suit complexion that knot of ribbon must do well enough for time worked sang have sweet voice in singing a well a in speaking used to run up down gay french chansons without difficulty so flexible in art be yet did not seem to care for music rarely touched piano on molly practised with daily conscientiousness cynthia be always willing to answer question about previous life though after first rarely alluded to of be most sympathetic listener to molly innocent confidence of joy sorrow sympathizing even to extent of wondering how must endure mr gibson second marriage why did not take active step of rebellion in spite of agreeable pungent variety of companionship at home molly yearned after hamleys if there have be woman in family must probably have received many little note heard numerous detail be now lost to summed up in condensed account of father visit at hall since dear patient be dead be only occasional yes squire be good deal changed be better than be there be unspoken estrangement between osborne one can see in silence constraint of manner outwardly be friendly civil at rate squire will always respect osborne a heir future representative of family osborne doe look well say want change think be weary of domestic dullness domestic dissension feel mother death acutely be wonder that father be not drawn together by common loss roger away at cambridge too examination for mathematical tripos altogether aspect of people place be changed be natural such be perhaps summing up of news of hamleys a contained in many bulletin always ended in kind message to molly mr gibson generally said a comment upon husband account of osborne melancholy dear why ask to dinner here little quiet dinner know cook be quite up to must of wear black lilac must consider that a gaiety mr gibson took more notice of suggestion than by shaking head have grown accustomed to wife by time regarded silence on own part a great preservative against long inconsequential argument time mr gibson be struck by cynthia beauty thought more more advisable that mr osborne hamley must be cheered up by quiet little dinner party a yet one lady of hollingford mr ashton vicar hopeless impracticable old bachelor have seen cynthia be good of having lovely daughter if there be none old woman to admire cynthia appeared extremely indifferent upon subject took very little notice of mother constant talk about gaiety be possible gaiety be impossible in hollingford exerted just a much to charm two miss browning a must have done to delight osborne hamley other young heir be to say used exertion simply followed own nature be to attract one of be thrown amongst exertion seemed rather to be to refrain from doing so to protest a often did by slight word expressive look against mother word humour alike against folly caress molly be almost sorry for mr gibson who seemed so unable to gain influence over child one day cynthia read molly thought be not good told so somehow can not forgive for neglect of a child when must have clung to besides hardly ever heard from when be at school know put stop to coming over to wedding saw letter wrote to madame lefevre child must be brought up with parent if be to think infallible when grows up though may know that there must be fault replied molly ought to cover over try to forget existence ought see have grown up outside pale

room cynthia be out gone into town shopping when door be opened name given in walked young man entrance seemed to cause more confusion than molly must well account for came in with same air of easy assurance with have received father at ashcombe manor house looked remarkably handsome in riding dress with open air exercise have just have mr gibson smooth brow contracted little at sight of reception of be much cooler than usually gave to visitor yet there be degree of agitation in surprised molly little mr gibson be at everlasting worsted work frame when mr preston entered room somehow in rising to receive threw down basket of crewels declining molly offer to help must pick up reel before asked visitor to sit down stood there hat in hand affecting interest in recovery of worsted molly be sure did not feel for time eye be glancing round room taking note of detail in arrangement at length be seated conversation began be first time have be in hollingford since marriage mr gibson must certainly have called to pay respect sooner know be very busy at ashcombe did not expect to call be lord cumnor at tower have not heard from ladyship for more than week no seemed still detained at bath have letter from giving certain message for mr sheepshank mr gibson be not at home be afraid be great deal out almost constantly may say have idea must see so little of doctor wife lead very solitary life mr preston can hardly call solitary must think when have companion a miss gibson always at hand said bowing to molly oh call solitude for wife when husband be away poor mr kirkpatrick be never happy unless always went with walk visit liked to be with somehow mr gibson feel a if must be rather in way think must ride pillion behind on black be mamma said molly unless must do that must hardly go with in round up down rough lane oh might keep brougham have often said so then must use for visiting in evening really be one reason why did go to hollingford charity ball must bring to use dirty fly from 'george really must stir papa up against next winter molly will never do for pulled up suddenly looked furtively at mr preston to see if have taken notice of abruptness of course have be not going to show turned to molly said have ever be to public ball yet miss gibson said molly will be great pleasure to when time come be not sure will like if have plenty of partner be afraid sha know many people suppose that young men have own way mean of being introduced to pretty girl be exactly one of speech molly have disliked for before delivered too in kind of underbred manner showed that be meant to convey personal compliment molly took great credit to herself for unconcerned manner with went on with tatting exactly a if have never heard only hope may be one of partner at first ball go to pray remember early application for honour when be overwhelmed with request for dance choose to engage beforehand said molly perceiving from under dropped eyelid that be leaning forward looking at a though be determined to have answer young lady be always very cautious in fact however modest may be in profession replied addressing in nonchalant manner to mr gibson in spite of miss gibson apprehension of not having many partner decline certainty of having one suppose miss kirkpatrick will have returned from france before then said last word exactly in same tone a have used before molly instinct told that be making effort to do so looked up be playing with hat almost a if did not care to have answer to question yet be listening acutely with half smile on face mr gibson reddened little hesitated yes certainly daughter will be with next winter believe daresay will go out with why ca say at once cynthia be here now asked molly of yet glad that mr preston curiosity be baffled still smiled time looked up at mr gibson a asked have good news from hope yes very by way how be old friend robinson how often think of kindness to at ashcombe dear good people wish must see again will certainly tell of kind inquiry be very well believe just at moment molly heard familiar sound of click opening of front door knew must be cynthia conscious of mysterious reason made mr gibson wish to conceal daughter whereabouts from mr preston maliciously desirous to baffle rose to leave room meet cynthia on stair one of lost crewels of worsted have entangled in gown foot before have freed herself of encumbrance cynthia have opened drawing room door stood in looking at mother at molly at mr preston not advancing one step colour have be brilliant first moment of entrance faded away a gazed eye beautiful eye usually so soft grave seemed to fill with fire brow to contract a took resolution to come forward take place among three who be looking at with different emotion moved calmly slowly forward mr preston went step two to meet hand held out whole expression of face that of eager delight took notice of outstretched hand of chair that offered sate down on little sofa in one of window called molly to look at purchase said green ribbon be fourteen penny yard silk three shilling so went on forcing to speak about trifle a if be world to have attention to throw away on mother mother visitor mr preston took cue from too talked of news of day local gossip molly who glanced up at from time to time be almost alarmed by bad expression of suppressed anger almost amounting to vindictiveness entirely marred handsome look did not wish to look again tried rather to back up cynthia effort at maintaining separate conversation yet must not help overhearing mr gibson strain after increased civility a if to make up for cynthia rudeness if possible to deprecate anger talked perpetually a though object be to detain whereas previous to cynthia return have allowed frequent pause in conversation a though to give opportunity to take leave in course of conversation between hamleys came up mr gibson be never unwilling to dwell upon molly intimacy with county family when latter caught sound of own name stepmother be saying poor mr hamley must hardly do without molly quite looked upon a daughter especially towards last when be afraid have good deal of anxiety mr osborne hamley daresay have heard did not do so well at college have expected so much parent will know what did signify for have not to earn living call very foolish kind of ambition when young man have not to go into profession well at rate squire must be satisfied now saw morning time with cambridge examination list in be second son called after father roger yes said molly starting up coming nearer be senior wrangler be said mr preston almost a though be vexed with for having anything to say must give pleasure molly went back to seat by cynthia poor mr hamley said very softly a if to herself cynthia took hand in sympathy with molly sad tender look rather than because understood be passing in mind did quite understand death have come out of time wonder whether dead knew what passed upon earth have left brilliant osborne failure roger success vanity of human wish thought what suggested be inextricably mingled up in mind came to herself in few minute mr preston be saying unpleasant thing must think of about hamleys in tone of false sympathy poor old squire not wisest of men have woefully mismanaged estate osborne hamley be too fine gentleman to understand mean by to improve value of land even if have capital man who have practical knowledge of agriculture thousand of ready money might bring rental up to eight thousand so of course osborne will try marry one with money family be old well established must object to commercial descent though daresay squire will for then young fellow be not man for work no family going down fast be pity when old saxon house vanish off land be 'kismet ' with hamleys even senior wrangler if be that roger hamley will have spent brain in one effort never hear of senior wrangler being worth anything afterwards will be fellow of college of course will be livelihood for at rate believe in senior wrangler said cynthia clear high voice ringing through room from have ever heard of mr roger hamley believe will keep up distinction have earned believe that house of hamley be so near extinction in wealth fame good name be fortunate in having miss kirkpatrick good word said mr preston rising to take leave dear molly said cynthia in whisper know nothing about friend hamleys except that be friend what have told about wo have man speaking of so eye filling with tear time 'd sooner swear to having talent good fortune under sun only person of whom cynthia appeared to be wholesomely afraid be mr gibson when be present be more careful in speaking showed more deference to mother evident respect for desire to win good opinion made curb before in manner earned favour a lively sensible girl with just so much knowledge of world a made very desirable companion to molly indeed made something of same kind of impression on men be first struck with personal appearance then with pretty deprecating manner appealed to much a if have said be wise be foolish have mercy on folly be way have meant nothing really be hardly conscious of be very captivating same even old williams gardener felt said to confidante molly eh miss that be rare young lady do have such pretty coaxing way be to teach to bud rose come season will warrant ye will learn sharp enough for say bee so stupid if molly have not have sweetest disposition in world might have become jealous of allegiance laid at cynthia foot never thought of comparing amount of admiration love received yet once did feel little a if cynthia be poaching on manor invitation to quiet dinner have be sent to osborne hamley declined by thought right to call soon afterwards be first time molly have seen of family since left hall just before mr hamley death there be so much that wanted to ask tried to wait patiently till mr gibson have exhausted first gush of infinite nothing then molly came in with modest question how be squire have returned to old habit have health suffered putting inquiry with a light delicate touch a if have be dressing wound hesitated little very little before speaking of roger for just one moment thought flitted across mind that osborne might feel contrast between own brother college career too painfully to like to have referred to then remembered generous brotherly love have always existed between two have just entered upon subject when cynthia in obedience to mother summons came into room took up work one must have be quieter hardly uttered word osborne seemed to fall under power at once no longer gave undivided attention to molly cut short answer to question by by without molly rightly understanding how be have turned towards cynthia be addressing to molly saw look of content on mr gibson face perhaps be own mortification at not having heard wished to know about roger gave keener insight than usual certain be that at once perceived that mr gibson must not dislike marriage between osborne cynthia considered present occasion a auspicious beginning remembering secret have be let into so unwillingly molly watched behaviour almost a if have be retained in interest of absent wife after thinking a much of possibility of attracting cynthia a of unknown mysterious mr osborne hamley manner be expressive of great interest of strong prepossession in favour of beautiful girl to whom be talking be in deep mourning showed off slight figure delicate refined face there be nothing of flirting a far a molly understood meaning of word in look word cynthia too be extremely quiet be always much quieter with men than with woman be part of charm of soft allurement that be so passive be talking of france mr gibson have passed two three year of girlhood there cynthia late return from boulogne made very natural subject of conversation molly be thrown out of with heart still unsatisfied a to detail of roger success have to stand up at last receive osborne good by scarcely longer more intimate than farewell to cynthia a soon a be gone mr gibson began in praise well really begin to have faith in long descent what gentleman be how agreeable polite so different from forward mr preston continued looking little anxiously at cynthia cynthia quite aware that reply be being watched for said coolly mr preston doe improve on acquaintance there be time mamma when think thought very agreeable remember have clearer memory than have be talking of delightful mr osborne hamley why molly be always talking of brother be roger roger ca think how be so seldom mentioned young man did know have mentioned mr roger hamley so often said molly blushing little saw much more of be more at home well well be all right dear daresay suit best really when saw osborne hamley close to cynthia must help thinking perhaps 'd better not tell be thinking of only be of so much above average in appearance of course suggests thing perfectly understand what be thinking of mamma said cynthia with greatest composure so doe molly have doubt well there be harm in be sure did hear say that though did not like to leave father alone just at present yet that when brother roger came back from cambridge must feel more at liberty be quite a much a to say 'if will ask to dinner then will be delighted to come chicken will be so much cheaper cook have nice way of boning doing up with forcemeat everything seems to be falling out so fortunately molly dear know wo forget by by when roger hamley have taken turn at stopping at home with father will ask to one of little quiet dinner molly be very slow at taking in in about minute sense of have reached brain went over very red hot especially a saw that cynthia be watching light come into mind with great amusement be afraid molly be properly grateful mamma if be must exert to give dinner party on account bestow kindness upon molly be often puzzled by cynthia speech to mother be one of occasion be more anxious to say something for be so much annoyed at implication in mr gibson last word mr roger hamley have be very good to be great deal at home when be there mr osborne hamley be very little there be reason spoke so much more of one than other if have if have losing coherence in difficulty of finding word think must oh cynthia instead of laughing at think might help to explain instead cynthia gave diversion to conversation mamma paragon give idea of weakness ca quite make out whether be in body mind be molly be not strong know be very accomplished clever one say that even papa who doe generally praise young men made puzzle greater when did so badly at college then be character be weak be sure there be weakness somewhere be very agreeable must have be very pleasant staying at hall yes be over now oh nonsense said mr gibson wakening up from counting stitch in pattern will have young men coming to dinner pretty often will see father like will always make point of welcoming friend ca go on mourning for mother for ever expect will see great deal of that two family will become very intimate after good hollingford people be terribly behindhand must say rather commonplace chapter xxi half sister illustration untitled appeared a if mr gibson prediction be likely to be verified for osborne hamley found way to drawing room pretty frequently to be sure sometimes prophet can help on fulfilment of own prophecy mr gibson be not passive molly be altogether puzzled by manner way spoke of occasional absence from hall without exactly saying where have be be not idea of conduct of married man who imagined ought to have house servant pay rent tax live with wife who mysterious wife might be faded into insignificance before wonder of where be london cambridge dover nay even france be mentioned by a place to have be on different little journey fact came out quite casually almost a if be unaware of what be betraying sometimes dropped out such sentence a ah must be day be crossing be stormy indeed instead of being only two hour be nearly five met lord hollingford at dover last week said c cold now be nothing to what be in london on thursday thermometer be down at perhaps in rapid flow of conversation small revelation be noticed by one molly whose interest curiosity be always hovering over secret have become possessed of in spite of self reproach for allowing thought to dwell on be still to be kept a mystery be also evident to that osborne be not too happy at home have lost slight touch of cynicism have affected when be expected to do wonder at college be one good result of failure if did not give trouble of appreciating other people performance at rate conversation be not so amply sprinkled with critical pepper be more absent not so agreeable mr gibson thought did not say looked ill in health might be consequence of real depression of spirit molly occasionally saw peeping out through pleasant surface talk now then when be talking directly to referred to happy day be gone to time when mother be alive then voice sank gloom came over countenance molly longed to express own deep sympathy did not often mention father molly thought must read in manner when did that something of painful restraint have noticed when be last at hall still existed between nearly particular knew of family interior have heard from mr hamley be uncertain how far father be acquainted with so did not like to question too closely be man to be so questioned a to domestic affair of patient sometimes wondered if be dream short hour in library at hamley hall when have fact seemed so important to osborne yet made so little difference in way of life in speech action during twelve fourteen hour that have remained at hall afterwards further allusion have be made to marriage either by by roger be indeed very like dream probably molly must have be rendered much more uncomfortable in possession of secret if osborne have struck a particularly attentive in devotion to cynthia evidently amused attracted not in lively passionate kind of way admired beauty seemed to feel charm must leave side come to sit near molly if anything reminded of mother about must talk to to alone yet came so often to gibson mr gibson might be excused for fancy have taken into head that be for cynthia sake liked lounge friendliness company of two intelligent girl of beauty manner above average one of whom stood in peculiar relation to a having be especially beloved by mother whose memory cherished so fondly knowing to be out of category of bachelor be perhaps too indifferent a to other people ignorance possible consequence somehow molly did not like to be first to introduce roger name into conversation so lost many opportunity of hearing intelligence about osborne be often so languid so absent that only followed lead of talk a awkward fellow who have paid particular attention a second son roger be not pre eminent in mr gibson thought cynthia have never seen freak did not take often to speak about have not come home since have obtained high place in mathematical list molly knew knew too that be working hard for something supposed fellowship be osborne tone in speaking of be always same word inflection of voice breathed out affection respect nay even admiration from nil admirari brother who seldom carried exertion so far ah roger said one day molly caught name in instant though have not heard what have gone before be fellow in thousand in thousand indeed believe there be match anywhere for goodness real solid power combined molly said cynthia after mr osborne hamley have gone what sort of man be roger hamley one ca tell how much to believe of brother praise for be one subject on osborne hamley becomes enthusiastic have noticed once twice before while molly hesitated on point of large round to begin description mr gibson struck in just show what sweet disposition osborne hamley be of that must praise brother a doe daresay be senior wrangler much good may do deny a for conversation be a heavy a heavy can be great awkward fellow to boot who look a if did not know two two made four for be such

untidily have art of looking so well falling in such graceful fold for instance pale lilac muslin gown wore evening have be worn many time before have looked unfit to wear again till cynthia put on then limpness became softness very crease took line of beauty molly in daintily clean pink muslin did not look half so elegantly dressed a cynthia grave eye that latter raised when have to be presented to roger have sort of child like innocence wonder about did not quite belong to cynthia character put on armour of magic that evening involuntarily a always did on other side must not help

osborne about be just a cordial friendly a ever with if cynthia have not be there must have gone on a have anticipated of victim to cynthia charm fell most prone abject molly saw a be sitting next to miss phoebe at tea table acting right hand passing cake cream sugar with such busy assiduity one besides thought that mind a well a hand be fully occupied tried to talk to two shy girl a in virtue of two year seniority thought bound to do consequence be went upstairs with twain clinging to arm willing to swear eternal friendship nothing must satisfy that must sit between at vingt un be so desirous of advice in important point of fixing price of counter that must not ever have joined in animated conversation going on between roger cynthia rather must be more correct to say that roger be talking in most animated manner to cynthia whose sweet eye be fixed upon face with look of great interest in be saying while be only now then made low reply molly caught few word occasionally in interval of business at uncle always give silver threepence for three dozen know what silver threepence be dear miss gibson three class be published in senate house at nine o'clock on friday morning ca imagine

sate in place round table roger cynthia have to be called twice before came stood up be true at first sound of name did not move roger went on talking cynthia listening till second call when hurried to table tried to appear on sudden quite interested in great question of game namely price of three dozen counter whether thing considered must be better to call round counter oblong half dozen miss browning drumming pack of card on table quite ready to begin dealing decided matter by saying round be six three dozen counter cost sixpence pay up if please let begin at once cynthia sate between

be charmed by charmer who found leisure to give one two of sweet smile on return home to grand mamma gave out one two very decided rather original opinion quite opposed a be natural to sister one be that after senior wrangler be great shake man might be one if liked there be lot of fellow that knew who must be very sorry to go in for anything so slow molly thought game never must end have particular turn for gambling in card might be regularly put on two counter indifferent a to whether won lost cynthia on contrary staked high be at one time very rich ended by being in debt to molly something like six shilling have forgotten purse said be obliged to borrow from more provident molly who be aware that round game of miss browning have spoken to be likely to require money if be not very merry affair for individual concerned be very noisy one on whole molly thought be going to last till midnight punctually a clock struck nine little maid servant staggered in under weight of tray loaded with sandwich cake jelly brought on general move roger who appeared to have be on watch for something of kind came took chair by molly be so glad to see again seems such long time since

refreshment from willie orford roger be tempting with playful entreaty urging to take thing from word said must be heard by whole room yet word be said on roger part at least a if must not have spoken in peculiar manner to one else at length rather more because be weary of being entreated than because be wish cynthia took macaroon roger seemed a happy a though have crowned with flower whole affair be a trifling commonplace a must be in hardly worth noticing yet molly did notice felt uneasy must not tell why a turned out be rainy night mr gibson sent fly for two girl instead of old betty substitute cynthia molly thought of possibility of taking two orford girl back to grandmother so saving wet walk cynthia got start in speaking about thanks implied praise for thoughtfulness be hers

leave go in just a be close to garden door roger came out really be for once case of virtue own reward for be far pleasanter to to have in tte tte however short than in restraint of mr gibson cynthia presence only just found out where be molly mr gibson said have gone out did know where be greatest chance turned round saw saw time ago must leave williams think be unusually slow to day seemed a if must understand plan for new flower bed be that paper have got in hand let look at will ah see have borrowed of idea from garden at home have bed of scarlet geranium with border of young oak pegged

certainly not said molly hastily fancy if must come must put little to right know a think once told osborne have behaved differently to what must have done though not wrongly only what call error of judgment father be sure have taken up notion of never mind only end of be that hold osborne still in tacit disgrace be miserable time osborne too be sore unhappy estranged from father be just what mother must have put right very soon perhaps must have done unconsciously mean for wretched mystery that osborne preserve about affair be at root of there be use talking about know why began then with wrench changing subject while molly still thought of what have be telling broke out ca tell how much like miss kirkpatrick molly must be great pleasure to having such companion yes said molly half smiling be very fond of think like better day know how quickly have found out virtue did say 'virtues did asked reddening putting question in good faith yet think one must be deceived in face mr

conditional promise for osborne too so will see very soon again must go now have to keep appointment seven mile from here in hour time good luck to flower garden molly chapter xxii old squire trouble affair be going on worse at hall than roger have liked to tell moreover very much of discomfort there arose from mere manner a people express be always indescribable indefinable quiet passive a mr hamley have always be in appearance be ruling spirit of house a long a lived direction to servant down to most minute particular came from sitting room from sofa on lay child always knew where to find to find be to find love sympathy husband who be often restless angry from one cause always came to to be smoothed down put right be conscious of pleasant influence over became at peace with when in presence just a child be at ease when with one who be firm gentle keystone of family arch be gone stone of be composed began to fall apart be always sad when sorrow of kind seems to injure character of mourning survivor yet perhaps injury may be only temporary superficial judgment so constantly passed upon way in people bear loss of whom have deeply loved appear to be even more cruel wrongly meted out than human judgment generally be to careless observer for instance must seem a though squire be rendered more capricious exacting more passionate authoritative by wife death truth be that occurred at time when many thing came to harass to bitterly disappoint be no longer there to whom used to carry sore heart for gentle balm of sweet word so sore heart ached smarted intensely often when saw how violent conduct affected others must have cried out for pity instead of anger resentment have mercy upon for be very miserable how often have such dumb thought gone up from heart of who have taken hold of sorrow by wrong end a prayer against sin when squire saw that servant be learning to dread first born to avoid did not blame knew be becoming domestic tyrant seemed a if circumstance conspired against a if be too weak to struggle with else why did everything in door out of door go so wrong just now when must have done have thing be prosperous be to have submitted in very imperfect patience to loss of wife just when needed ready money to pacify osborne creditor harvest have turned out remarkably plentiful price of corn have sunk down to level have not touched for year squire have insured life at time of marriage for pretty large sum be to be provision for wife if survived for younger child roger be only representative of interest now squire be unwilling to lose insurance by ceasing to pay annual sum must not if must have sold part of estate inherited from father besides be strictly entailed have sometimes thought how wise step must have be must have sold portion of with purchase money have drained reclaimed remainder at length learning from neighbour government must make certain advance for drainage c at very low rate of interest on condition that work be done money repaid within given time wife have urged to take advantage of proffered loan now that be no longer there to encourage take interest in progress of work grew indifferent to

government have to be paid same whether men worked well ill then roof of hall let in melted snow water winter on examination turned out that new roof be absolutely required men who have come about advance made to osborne by london money lender have spoken disparagingly of timber on estate very fine tree sound perhaps too fifty year ago gone to rot now have wanted lopping clearing be there wood ranger forester be nothing like value young mr hamley have represented to be remark have come round to squire ear loved tree have played under a boy a if be living creature be on romantic side of nature merely looking at a representing so many pound sterling have esteemed highly have have until now opinion of by to correct own judgment so word of valuer cut sharp although affected to disbelieve tried to persuade that did so after care disappointment did not touch root of deep resentment against osborne there be nothing like wounded affection for giving poignancy to anger squire believed that osborne adviser have be making calculation based upon own death hated idea so much made so miserable that must not face define meet with full inquiry investigation chose rather to cherish morbid fancy that be useless in world born under unlucky star that thing went badly under management did not become humble in consequence put misfortune down to score of fate not to own imagined that osborne saw failure that first born grudged natural term of life fancy must have be set to right must have talked over with wife even have be accustomed to mingle much in society of whom esteemed equal a have be stated be inferior in education to who must have be mate perhaps jealousy mauvaise honte that inferiority have called out long ago extended in measure to feeling entertained towards son le to roger than to osborne though former be turning out by far most distinguished man roger be practical interested in out of door thing enjoyed detail homely enough father sometimes gave of day occurrence latter have noticed in wood field osborne on contrary be what be commonly called fine delicate almost to effeminacy in dress in manner careful in small observance father have be rather proud of in day when looked forward to brilliant career at cambridge for son have at time regarded osborne fastidiousness elegance a stepping stone to high prosperous marriage be to restore ancient fortune of hamley family now that osborne have barely obtained degree that boasting of father have proved vain that fastidiousness have led to unexpected expense to attribute most innocent cause to osborne debt poor young man way manner became subject of irritation to father osborne be still occupied with book writing when be at home mode of passing greater part of day gave few subject in common with father when did meet at meal time in evening perhaps if osborne have be able to have more out of door amusement must have be better be short sighted cared little for carefully observant pursuit of brother knew few young men of own standing in county hunting even of be passionately fond have be curtailed season a father have disposed of one of two hunter have be hitherto allowed whole stable establishment have be reduced perhaps because be economy told most on enjoyment of squire osborne therefore former took savage pleasure in enforcing old carriage heavy family coach bought in day of comparative prosperity be no longer needed after madam death fell to piece in cobwebbed seclusion of coach house best of two carriage horse be taken for gig squire now set up saying many time to who might care to listen to that be first time for generation that hamleys of hamley have not be able to keep own coach other carriage horse be turned out to grass being too old for regular work conqueror used to come whinnying up to park paling whenever saw squire who have always piece of bread sugar apple for old favourite must make many complaining speech to dumb animal telling of change of time since be in prime have never be squire custom to encourage boy to invite friend to hall perhaps too be owing to mauvaise honte also to exaggerated consciousness of deficiency of establishment a compared with what imagined lad be accustomed to at home explained once twice to osborne roger when be at rugby see public schoolboy have kind of freemasonry of own outsider be looked on by much a look on rabbit be game ay may laugh be so friend will throw eye askance at never think on pedigree must beat to shiver will be bound will have one here at hall who will look down on hamley of hamley even if only know how to make cross instead of write name then of course must not visit at house to whose son squire must not must not return like hospitality on point mr hamley have used utmost influence without avail prejudice be immoveable a regarded position a head of oldest family in three county pride be invincible a regarded personally ill at ease in society of equal deficient in manner in education morbid sensitiveness be too sore too self conscious to be called humility take one instance from among many similar scene of state of feeling between eldest son if must not be called active discord showed at least passive estrangement took place on evening in march succeeding mr hamley death roger be at cambridge osborne have also be from home have not volunteered information a to absence squire believed that osborne have be either at cambridge with brother in london must have liked to hear where son have be what have be doing whom have seen purely a piece of news a diversion from domestic worry care be pressing hard be too proud to ask question osborne have not given detail of journey silence have aggravated squire internal dissatisfaction came home to dinner weary sore hearted day two after osborne return be just six o'clock went hastily into own little business room on ground floor after washing hand came into drawing room feeling a if be very late room be empty glanced at clock over mantel piece a tried to warm hand at fire fire have be neglected have gone out during day be now piled up with half dried wood sputtered smoked instead of doing duty in blazing warming room through keen wind be cutting way in direction clock have stopped no one have remembered to wind up by squire watch be already past dinner time old butler put head into room seeing squire alone be about to draw back wait for mr osborne before announcing dinner have hoped to do unperceived squire caught in act why be dinner ready called out sharply be ten minute past six pray why be using wood be impossible to get warm by such fire a believe sir thomas talk to of thomas send dinner in directly about five minute elapsed spent by hungry squire in sort of impatient way attacking thomas who came in to look after fire knocking log about scattering out spark considerably lessening chance of warmth touching up candle appeared to to give light unusually insufficient for large cold room while be doing osborne came in dressed in full evening dress always moved slowly to begin with irritated squire then uncomfortable consciousness of black coat drab trouser checked cotton cravat splashed boot forced upon a saw be point device costume chose to consider affectation finery in osborne be on point of bursting out with remark when butler who have watched osborne downstairs before making announcement came in to say dinner be ready surely be six o'clock said osborne pulling out dainty little watch be scarcely more unaware than of storm be brewing six o'clock be more than quarter past growled out father fancy watch must be wrong sir set mine by horse guard only two day ago now impugning that old steady turnip shaped watch of squire be one of insult a must not reasonably be resented be not to be forgiven that watch have be given by father when watch be watch long ago have given law to house clock stable clock kitchen clock nay even to hamley church clock in day be now in respectable old age to be looked down upon by little whipper snapper of french watch must go into man waistcoat pocket instead of having to be extricated with due effort like respectable watch of size position from fob in waistband no not if whipper snapper be backed by horse guard ever be with life guard to boot poor osborne might have known better than to cast slur on father flesh blood for so dear did hold watch watch be like said squire 'girning ' a scotch say plain steady going at rate give law in house king may go by horse guard if like beg pardon sir said osborne really anxious to keep peace went by watch be certainly right by london time 'd idea be waiting for otherwise must have dressed much quicker must think so said squire looking sarcastically at son attire when be young man must have be ashamed to have spent a much time at looking glass a if 'd be girl must make a smart a one when be going to dance to party where be likely to meet pretty girl must have laughed to scorn if 'd stood fiddle faddling at glass smirking at own likeness for own pleasure osborne reddened be on point of letting fly caustic remark on father dress at present moment contented with saying in low voice mother always expected to dress for dinner got into habit of doing to please keep up now indeed have certain kind of feeling of loyalty to memory in keeping up little domestic habit custom have instituted preferred contrast squire thought be implied by osborne remark put beside too try to attend to wish do in more important thing did when be alive do so now never said did not said osborne astonished at father passionate word manner yes did sir meant must see by look saw look at morning coat at rate never neglected wish of hers in lifetime if 'd wished to go to school again learn b c must by must must have gone playing lounging away time for fear of vexing disappointing yet folk older than school boy squire choked here though word must not come passion did not diminish will not have casting up mother wish to sir who went near to break heart at last osborne be strongly tempted to get up leave room perhaps must have be better if have might then have brought about explanation reconciliation between father son thought did well in sitting still appearing to take notice indifference to what be saying appeared to annoy squire still more kept on grumbling talking to till osborne unable to bear longer said very quietly very bitterly be only cause of irritation to home be longer home to place in be to be controlled in trifle scolded about trifle a if be child put in way of making living for that much oldest son have right to ask of will then leave house will be no longer vexed by dress want of punctuality make request pretty much a son did long ago 'give portion falleth to ' think what did with money be much encouragement for to then thought of how little must give son portion part of stopped squire osborne took up speech be a ready a man to earn living only preparation for profession will cost money money have got more have said squire shortly what be to be done then said osborne only half believing father word why must learn to stop at home not take expensive journey must reduce tailor bill ask to help in management of land be far too fine gentleman for if ca earn money at least need spend have told be willing enough to earn money cried osborne passionately at last how be to do really be very unreasonable sir be said squire cooling in manner though not in temper a osborne grew warm set up for being reasonable men who have to pay away money that have got for extravagant son be likely to be reasonable there be two thing have gone done put beside when think of have turned out next door to dunce at college when poor mother thought so much of when might have pleased gratified so if chose well wo say what other thing be tell sir said osborne almost breathless with idea that father have discovered secret marriage father be thinking of money lender who be calculating how soon osborne must come into estate said squire know what know be not going to tell how know only will just say friend more

looked up at noise then rose a quickly hurried after father only in time to hear study door locked on inside moment reached osborne returned into dining room chagrined sorrowful be always sensitive to omission of usual observance might excite remark even with heavy heart be careful to pick up fallen chair restore to place near bottom of table afterwards so to disturb dish a to make appear that have be touched before ringing for robinson when latter came in followed by thomas osborne thought necessary to say to that father be not well have gone into study that wanted dessert must have cup of

assembled fame have trickled down to through medium of lady maid housekeeper mr gibson have have to leave ball room for time a have anticipated be to return to wife a soon a duty be accomplished in absence mr gibson kept little aloof from miss browning of acquaintance who must willingly have entered into conversation with with view of attaching to skirt of tower party when must make appearance if cynthia must not be so very ready in engaging to possible partner who asked to dance there be sure to be young men staying at tower who must be on look out for pretty girl who must tell to what dance might lead molly too though not so good dancer a cynthia from timidity graceful easy be becoming engaged pretty deeply must be confessed be longing to dance dance matter with whom even might not be available for more aristocratic partner mr gibson anticipated be feeling very much annoyed with whole proceeding of evening when be aware of one standing by turning little to one side saw mr preston keeping guard a be over seat molly cynthia have just quitted be looking so black that if eye have not met mr gibson must have preferred not speaking to a be thought unavoidable room be not well lighted to night be mr preston said who must light such dingy old paint a loaded with evergreen too always darken room company too always think that freshness brilliancy of dress go a far a anything to brighten up room look what set of people be here greater part of woman be dressed in dark silk really only fit for morning place will be quite different by by when county family be in little more force mr preston made reply have put glass in eye apparently for purpose of watching dancer if exact direction must have be ascertained must have be found that be looking intently angrily at flying figure in pink muslin many one be gazing at cynthia with intentness besides one in anger mr gibson be not so fine observer a to read here be gentlemanly handsome young man to whom must prattle instead of joining on to objectionable people sitting forlorn until tower party came so went on with small remark be not dancing preston partner have engaged have made mistake be waiting to have explanation with mr gibson be silent uncomfortable tide of recollection appeared to come over like mr preston watched cynthia dance be ended be walking round room in easy unconcern a to what might await presently partner mr harry cholmley brought back to seat took that vacant next to mr preston leaving one by mother for molly occupation latter returned moment afterwards to place cynthia seemed entirely unconscious of mr preston neighbourhood mr gibson leaned forward said to daughter last partner be gentleman dear be improving in selection really be ashamed of before figuring away with attorney clerk molly do know whom have be dancing with have found out be coreham bookseller account for being so well up in book have be wanting to hear about said molly eagerly with spice of malice in mind really be very pleasant mamma added look quite gentleman dance beautifully very well remember if go on way will have to shake hand over counter to morrow morning with of partner of to night said mr gibson coldly really know how to refuse when people be introduced to ask be longing to dance know to night be charity ball papa said everybody danced with everybody said molly in pleading tone of voice for must not quite thoroughly enjoy if be out of harmony with one reply mr gibson must have made to speech can not now be ascertained for before must answer mr preston stepped little forward said in tone meant to be icily indifferent trembled with anger if miss gibson find difficulty in refusing partner have only to apply to miss kirkpatrick for instruction cynthia lifted up beautiful eye fixing on mr preston face said very quietly a if only stating matter of fact forget think mr preston miss gibson implied that wished to dance with person who asked that make difference ca instruct how to act in difficulty to rest of little conversation cynthia appeared to lend ear be almost directly claimed by next partner mr preston took seat now left empty much to molly annoyance at first feared lest might be going to ask to dance instead put out hand for cynthia nosegay have left on rising entrusted to molly have suffered considerably from heat of room be no longer full fresh not so much so a molly have not in first instance be pulled to piece in picking out scarlet flower now adorned molly hair have since be cherished with more care enough however remained of cynthia to show very distinctly that be not one mr preston have sent be perhaps to convince of that rudely asked to examine molly faithful to what imagined must be cynthia wish refused to allow to touch only held little nearer miss kirkpatrick have not done honour of wearing bouquet sent see received suppose note yes said molly rather intimidated by tone in be said have already accepted two nosegay mr gibson be just person to come to rescue with honeyed word on occasion a present evidently be rather afraid of mr preston wished to keep at peace with oh yes be so sorry of course mean to say must be sorry for one kindness two such lovely nosegay have be sent from hamley hall may see how beautiful from what molly hold in hand have come before yours mr preston must have felt honoured if have accepted of mine since young lady be so well provided for be at pain in selecting flower at green think may say be rather more recherch than of miss kirkpatrick miss gibson hold so tenderly securely in hand oh because cynthia must take out most effective flower to put in hair exclaimed molly eagerly did said mr preston with certain accent of pleasure in voice a though be glad set so little store by nosegay walked off to stand behind cynthia in quadrille be being danced molly saw making reply to against will molly be sure somehow face manner implied power over looked grave deaf indifferent indignant defiant after half whispered speech to cynthia at conclusion of dance evidently threw impatient consent to what be asking for walked off with disagreeable smile of satisfaction on handsome face time murmur be spreading at lateness of party from tower person after person came up to mr gibson a if be accredited authority a to earl countess plan in one sense be flattering then acknowledgment of common ignorance wonder reduced to level of inquirer mr goodenough felt particularly aggrieved have have spectacle on for last hour half in order to be ready for sight very first

on lady alice trousseau kept asking so many question took up time lady harriet last word be happy anticipation of meeting to night be nearly twelve o'clock one of pretension to gentility be painfully affected by absence of family from tower very fiddler seemed unwilling to begin playing dance might be interrupted by entrance of great folk miss phoebe browning have apologized for miss browning have blamed with calm dignity be only butcher baker candlestick maker who rather enjoyed absence of restraint be happy hilarious at last there be rumbling rushing whispering music stopped so dancer be obliged to do so too in came lord cumnor in state dress with fat middle aged woman on arm be dressed almost like girl in sprigged muslin with natural flower in hair not vestige of jewel diamond yet must be duchess what be duchess without diamond in dress farmer hudson daughter might have worn be duchess must be duchess little crowd of inquirer around mr gibson thickened to hear confirm disappointing surmise after duchess came lady cumnor looking like lady macbeth in black velvet cloud upon brow made more conspicuous by line of age rapidly gathering on handsome face lady harriet other lady amongst whom there be one dressed so like duchess a to suggest idea of sister rather than daughter a far a dress went there be lord hollingford plain in face awkward in person gentlemanly in manner dozen younger men lord albert monson captain james others of age standing who came in looking anything if not critical long expected party swept up to seat reserved for at head of room apparently regardless of interruption caused for dancer stood aside almost dispersed back to seat when money musk struck up again not former set of people stood up to finish dance lady harriet who be rather different to miss piper more minded crossing room alone than if looker on be so many cabbage spied gibson party pretty quickly out came across to here be at last how d 'ye do dear why little one to molly how nice be looking be shamefully late oh be only just past twelve said mr gibson daresay dined very late be that be that ill mannered woman who went to own room after came out from

molly lady harriet asked have be dancing much miss gibson yes not dance nearly be simple question enough lady harriet speaking at to molly have become to mr gibson almost like shaking red rag at bull be one thing sure to put out of temper must not have shown to lady harriet for world only contrived to baffle endeavour at further conversation between two by placing betwixt lady harriet molly whom former asked to sit down in absent cynthia room wo go back to people be so mad with besides hardly saw other day must have gossip with so sat down by mr gibson a mr goodenough afterwards expressed looked like anybody else mr goodenough said to excuse for little misadventure fell into have taken deliberate survey of grandee at upper end of room spectacle on nose have inquired in very measured voice who everybody be from mr sheepshank lord agent very good neighbour who in vain tried to check loud ardour for information by replying to in whisper be rather deaf a well a blind so low tone only brought upon fresh inquiry now satisfied a far a must be on way to departure extinguishing of fire candle light stopped opposite to mr gibson thus addressed by way of renewal of former subject of conversation shabby thing for duchess never saw not bit of diamond near be none of 'em worth looking at except countess be always personable woman not so lusty a be be not worth waiting up for till time o ' night there be moment pause then lady harriet put hand out said remember know from having seen at tower lady cumnor be good deal thinner than be hope health be better for be lady harriet said mr gibson to mr goodenough in reproachful dismay deary ladyship hope have given offence see be to say ladyship see that be late hour for such folk a only stayed out of bed to see duchess thought 'd come in diamond coronet put one out at age to be disappointed in only chance be like to have of so fine sight be put out too said lady harriet wanted to have come early here be a late a be so cross ill tempered must be glad to hide in bed a soon a will do said so sweetly that mr goodenough relaxed into smile crabbedness into compliment believe a ever ladyship can be cross ill tempered with pretty face be old woman so must let say so lady harriet stood up made low curtsey then holding out hand said wo keep up longer will promise one thing in return for pretty speech if ever be duchess will come show to in robe gewgaw good night madam there knew how must be said not resuming seat on eve of county election too oh must not take old mr goodenough a specimen dear lady harriet be always grumbler be sure one else must complain of being a late a liked said mr gibson what do say molly said lady harriet suddenly turning eye on molly face think have lost of popularity at time mean vote by coming so late come answer used to be famous little truth teller know about popularity vote said molly rather unwillingly think many people be sorry did not come sooner be that rather proof of popularity added that be very neat diplomatic answer said lady harriet smiling tapping molly cheek with fan molly know nothing about said mr gibson little off guard must be very impertinent if one else questioned lady cumnor perfect right to come when chose well know be must go back to mamma now will make raid into region by by must keep place for ah there be miss browning see forget lesson miss gibson molly can not have speaking so to lady harriet said mr gibson a soon a be left alone with stepdaughter must never have known at if have not be for be always putting into conversation must speak if asks question pleaded molly well if must must acknowledge be candid about at rate there be need for to set up to have opinion at age know how to help said molly be such whimsical person look there if be not talking to miss phoebe miss phoebe be so weak will be easily led away into fancying be hand glove with lady harriet if there be one thing hate more than be trying to make out intimacy with great people molly felt innocent enough so offered justification of herself made reply indeed be more occupied in watching cynthia must not understand change seemed to have come over be dancing be true with same lightness grace a before smooth bounding motion a of feather blown onwards by wind be gone be conversing with partner without soft animation usually shone out upon countenance when be brought back to seat molly noticed changed colour dreamily abstracted eye what be matter cynthia asked in very low voice nothing said cynthia suddenly looking up in accent of what in be sharpness why must there be know look different to what did tired something there be nothing matter if there be talk about be fancy be rather contradictory speech to be interpreted by intuition rather than by logic molly understood that cynthia wished for quietness silence what be surprise after speech have passed before implication of cynthia whole manner to mr preston to see come up to without word offer arm lead away to dance appeared to strike mr gibson a something remarkable for forgetting late passage at arm with molly asked wonderingly a if almost distrusting evidence of sens be cynthia going to dance with mr preston molly have scarcely time to answer before be led off by partner must hardly attend to to figure of quadrille for watching for cynthia among moving form once caught glimpse of standing still downcast listening to mr preston eager speech again be walking languidly among dancer almost a if took notice of around when molly joined other again shade on cynthia face have deepened to gloom at same time if physiognomist have studied expression must have read in defiance anger perhaps also little perplexity while quadrille have be going on lady harriet have be speaking to brother hollingford said laying hand on arm drawing little apart from well born crowd amid stood silent abstracted know how good people here have be hurt disappointed with being so late with duchess ridiculous simplicity of dress why must mind asked taking advantage of being out of breath with eagerness oh be so wise stupid see be show spectacle be like having pantomime with harlequin columbine in plain clothes understand how began then take upon trust really be little disappointed whether be logical not in being so must try make up to for one thing because ca bear vassal to look dissatisfied disloyal then there be election in june really must a soon be out of house a in nonsense must grieve papa beyond measure there be time to talk about now must go dance with of townspeople will ask sheepshank to introduce to respectable young farmer ca get captain james to make useful there go with lady alice if get introduced to ugliest tailor daughter can find for next dance put arm in brother a spoke a if to lead to partner resisted however resisted piteously pray harriet know ca dance hate always did know how to get through quadrille be country dance said resolutely be same what will say to partner have notion will have subject in common speak of being disappointed will be ten time more disappointed when find can dance talk will be merciful be so cowardly in eye lord may dance like bear a lord not very far from be if like will take for grace will begin with molly gibson friend doctor daughter be good simple intelligent little girl will think great deal more of suppose than of frivolous fact of being very pretty clare will allow to introduce brother to miss gibson hope to engage for dance lord hollingford miss gibson poor lord hollingford there be nothing for for to follow sister very explicit lead molly walked off to place heartily wishing dance together well over lady harriet flew off to mr sheepshank to secure respectable young farmer mr gibson remained alone wishing that lady cumnor must send one of attendant gentleman for must be so much more agreeable to be sitting even at fag end of nobility than here on bench with everybody hoping that everybody must see molly dancing away with lord yet vexed that chance have so befallen that molly instead of cynthia be young lady singled out wondering if simplicity of dress be now become highest fashion pondering on possibility of cleverly inducing lady harriet to introduce lord albert monson to own beautiful daughter cynthia molly found lord hollingford wise learned lord hollingford strangely stupid in understanding mystery of cross hand back again down middle up again be constantly getting hold of wrong hand a constantly stopping when have returned to place quite unaware that duty of society law of dance required that must go on capering till have arrived at bottom of room perceived that have performed part very badly apologized to molly when once have arrived at haven of comparative peace expressed regret so simply heartily that felt at ease with at once especially when confided to reluctance at having to dance at only doing under sister compulsion to molly be elderly widower almost a old a father by by got into very pleasant conversation learnt from that roger hamley have just be publishing paper in scientific periodical have excited considerable attention a be intended to confute theory of great french physiologist roger article proved writer to be possessed of most unusual amount of knowledge on subject piece of news be of great interest to molly in question evinced so much intelligence mind so well prepared for reception of information that lord hollingford at rate must have felt quest of popularity very easy affair indeed if might have gone on talking quietly to molly during rest of evening when took back to place found mr gibson there fell into talk with until lady harriet once more came to stir up to duty before very long however returned to mr gibson side began telling of paper of roger hamley of mr gibson have not yet heard in midst of conversation a stood close by mr gibson lord hollingford saw molly in distance interrupted to say what charming little lady that daughter of yours be most girl of age be so difficult to talk to be intelligent full of interest in sort of sensible thing well read too be up in le rgne animal very pretty mr gibson bowed much pleased at compliment from such man be lord not be very likely that if molly have be stupid listener lord hollingford must not have discovered beauty converse might be asserted if have not be young pretty must not have exerted to talk on scientific subject in manner must understand in way molly have won approbation admiration there be doubt that have earned somehow when next returned to place mr gibson greeted with soft word gracious smile for doe not require much reasoning power to discover that if be very fine thing to be mother in law to very magnificent three tailed bashaw presupposes that wife who make connection between two party be in harmony with mother so far have mr gibson thought wandered into futurity only wished that happy chance have fallen to cynthia instead of to molly lot molly be docile sweet creature very pretty remarkably intelligent a lord have said be pity cynthia preferred making millinery to reading perhaps must be rectified there be lord cumnor coming to speak to lady cumnor nodding to indicating place by side be not unsatisfactory ball upon whole to mr gibson although paid usual penalty for sitting up beyond ordinary hour in perpetual glare movement next morning awoke irritable fatigued little of same feeling oppressed cynthia molly former be lounging in window seat holding three day old newspaper in hand be making pretence of reading when be startled by mother saying cynthia ca take up book improve be sure conversation will never be worth listening to unless read something better than newspaper why keep up french there be french book molly be reading le rgne animal think never read said molly blushing mr roger hamley sometimes read piece out of when be first at hall told what be about oh well then suppose be mistaken come to same thing cynthia really must learn to settle to improving reading morning rather to molly surprise cynthia did not reply word dutifully went brought down from among boulogne school book le sicle de louis xiv after while molly saw that improving reading be just a much mere excuse for cynthia thinking own thought a newspaper have be chapter xxvii father son illustration untitled thing be not going on better at hamley hall nothing have occurred to change state of dissatisfied feeling into squire eldest son have respectively fallen long continuance merely of dissatisfaction be sure of to deepen feeling roger did in power to bring father son together sometimes wondered if must not have be better to leave alone for be falling into habit of making confidant so defining emotion opinion must have

encouraged mr gibson be true be ready to go over ground a many time a one liked word be always like ready made clothes never fitted individual thought anybody might have used with change of proper name might have served to describe ball repeatedly used same language in speaking about till molly knew sentence sequence even to irritation ah mr osborne must have be there said to myself many time how really must have be there brother of course thought of very often during evening did now that call very kind of cynthia darling do hear what mr osborne hamley be saying a cynthia came into room

that fine word 'theoretical imply that be ignorant asked cynthia of course will be happy to see brother why ca have too confess to little timidity in presence of one so deep learned a brother be from account give little charming ignorance if must call by hard word osborne bowed be very pleasant to to be petted flattered even though knew time that be only flattery be agreeable contrast to home be so dismal to to come to house where society of two agreeable girl soothing syrup of mother speech awaited whenever liked to come to say nothing of difference struck upon sens poetical though might esteem of sitting room full of flower token of woman presence where chair be easy table well covered with pretty thing to great drawing room at home where drapery be threadbare seat uncomfortable sign of feminine presence ever now lent grace to stiff arrangement of furniture then meal light well cooked suited taste delicate appetite so much better than rich heavy viand prepared by servant at hall osborne be becoming little afraid of falling into habit of paying too frequent visit to gibson that not because feared consequence of intercourse with two young lady for never thought of excepting a friend fact of marriage be constantly present to mind aime too securely enthroned in heart for to remember that might be looked upon by others in light of possible husband reflection forced upon occasionally whether be not trespassing too often on hospitality have at present mean of returning mr gibson in ignorance of true state of affair be secretly exultant in attraction made come so often lounge away hour in house garden have doubt that be cynthia who drew thither if latter have be little more amenable to reason mother must have made more frequent allusion than did to crisis thought be approaching be restrained by intuitive conviction that if daughter became conscious of what be impending be made aware of mr gibson cautious quiet effort to forward catastrophe wilful girl must oppose to with skill power a be mr gibson trusted that cynthia affection must become engaged before knew where be that in case must not attempt to frustrate mother delicate scheming even though did perceive cynthia have come across too many variety of flirtation admiration even passionate love to be for moment at fault a to quiet friendly nature of osborne attention received always a sister might brother be different when roger returned from election a fellow of trinity trembling diffidence hardly suppressed ardour of manner made cynthia understand before long with what kind of love have now to deal did not put into so many word not even in secret heart recognized difference between roger relation to be long before mr gibson found out molly be however first to discover nature of roger attention first time saw after ball came out to observant eye cynthia have not be looking well since evening went slowly about house pale heavy eyed fond a usually be of exercise free fresh air there be hardly persuading now to go out for walk molly watched fading with tender anxiety to question a to whether have felt over fatigued with dancing whether anything have occurred to annoy such inquiry replied in languid negative once molly touched on mr preston name found that be subject on cynthia be raw now cynthia face lighted up with spirit whole body showed ill repressed agitation only said few sharp word expressive of anything kindly feeling towards gentleman then bade molly never name name to again still latter must not imagine that be more than intensely distasteful to friend a well a to herself must not be cause of cynthia present indisposition indisposition lasted so many day without change modification that even mr gibson noticed molly became positively uneasy mr gibson considered cynthia quietness languor a natural consequence of dancing with everybody who asked at ball partner whose name be in red book must not have produced amount of fatigue according to mr gibson judgment apparently if cynthia have be quite well very probably must have hit blot in mother speech with one of touch of sarcasm then again when cynthia did not rally mr gibson grew impatient accused of being fanciful lazy at length partly at molly instance there came appeal to mr gibson professional examination of supposed invalid cynthia hated more than anything especially when verdict be that there be nothing very much matter only general lowness of tone depression of health spirit must soon be remedied by tonic meanwhile be not to be roused to exertion if there be one thing dislike said cynthia to mr gibson after have pronounced tonic to be cure for present state be way doctor have of giving tablespoonful of nauseous mixture a certain remedy for sorrow care laughed up in face a spoke have always pretty word smile for even in midst of loss of spirit come acknowledge have beorrows by speech will make bargain if will tell sorrow care will try find other remedy for than giving what be pleased to term nauseous mixture said cynthia colouring never said have sorrow care spoke generally what must have sorrow about molly be only too kind to eye filling with tear well well will not talk of such gloomy thing will have sweet emulsion to disguise taste of bitter will be obliged to fall back upon please if knew how dislike emulsion disguise do want bitter if sometimes if be obliged to if be not truthful do like truth in others at least sometimes ended sentence with smile be rather faint watery now first person out of house to notice cynthia change of look manner be roger hamley yet did not see until under influence of nauseous mixture be beginning to recover eye be scarcely off during first five minute be in room time be trying to talk to mr gibson in reply to civil platitude be studying cynthia at first convenient pause came stood before molly so a to interpose person between rest of room for visitor have come in subsequent to entrance molly how ill sister be looking what be have have advice must forgive so often who live together in same house observe first approach of illness now molly love for cynthia be fast unwavering if anything tried be habit roger have fallen into of always calling cynthia molly sister in speaking to latter from one else must have be matter of indifference to hardly to be noticed vexed ear heart when roger used expression there be curtness of manner a well a of word in reply oh be over tired by ball papa have seen say will be all right very soon wonder if want change of air said roger meditatively wish do wish must have at hall mother too of course see how must be possible else how charming must be molly felt a if visit to hall under such circumstance must be altogether so different affair to former one that must hardly tell if must like not roger went on got flower in time did not ah know how often thought of that evening enjoyed too did have plenty of agreeable partner make first ball delightful heard that sister danced dance be very pleasant said molly quietly after be not sure if want to go to just yet there seems to be so much trouble connected with ball ah be thinking of sister not being well be not said molly rather bluntly be thinking of dress dressing weariness next day might think unfeeling if liked felt a if have only too much feeling just then for be bringing on strange contraction of heart be too inherently good to put harsh construction on speech just before went away while be ostensibly holding hand wishing good by said to in voice too low to be generally heard be there anything must do for sister have plenty of book a know if care for reading then receiving affirmative look word from molly in reply to suggestion went on flower like flower oh forced strawberry be just ready will bring over to morrow be sure will like said molly for reason other unknown to gibson longer interval than usual occurred between osborne visit while roger came almost day always with fresh offering by openly sought to relieve cynthia indisposition a far a lay in power manner to be so gentle gracious that mr gibson became alarmed lest in spite of uncouthness a be pleased to term might come to be preferred to osborne who be so strangely neglecting own interest in mr gibson opinion in quiet way contrived to pas many slight upon roger dart rebounded from generous nature must not have imagined motif fastened on molly have often be called naughty passionate when be child thought now that began to understand that really have violent temper what seemed to hurt roger annoy cynthia made molly blood boil now have once discovered mr gibson wish to make roger visit shorter le frequent be always on watch for indication of desire read stepmother heart when latter made allusion to squire loneliness now that osborne be absent from hall that roger be so often away amongst friend during day mr gibson must be so delighted if must have stopped to dinner of course can not be so selfish a to ask to stay when remember how father must be left alone be saying yesterday wondered how bore solitude poor old gentleman a soon a roger came with bunch of early rose be desirable for cynthia to go rest in own room while molly have to accompany mr gibson on improvised errand call still roger whose object be to give pleasure to cynthia who have from boyhood be always certain of mr gibson friendly regard be slow to perceive that be not wanted if did not see cynthia be loss at rate heard how be left little thing believed must like be willing to risk chance of own gratification by calling four five time in hope of seeing once at last there came day when mr gibson went beyond usual negative snubbiness when in unwonted fit of crossness for be very placid tempered person in general be guilty of positive rudeness cynthia be very much better tonic have ministered to mind diseased though hated to acknowledge pretty bloom much of light heartedness have come back there be cause remaining for anxiety mr gibson be sitting at embroidery in drawing room two girl be at window cynthia laughing at molly earnest endeavour to imitate french accent in former have be reading page of voltaire for duty farce of settling to improving reading in morning be still kept up although lord hollingford unconscious suggestor of idea have gone back to town without making of effort to see molly again that mr gibson have anticipated on night of ball alnaschar vision have fallen to ground be a yet early morning delicious fresh lovely june day air redolent with scent of flower growth bloom time girl have be ostensibly employed in french reading have be leaning out of open window trying to reach cluster of climbing rose have secured at last bud lay on cynthia lap many of petal have fallen off so though perfume lingered about window seat full beauty of flower have passed away mr gibson have once twice reproved for merry noise be making hindered in business of counting stitch in pattern have set certain quantity to do morning before going out be of nature attache infinite importance to fulfilling small resolution made about indifferent trifle without reason mr roger hamley be announced so tiresome said mr gibson almost in hearing a pushed away embroidery frame put out cold motionless hand to with half murmured word of welcome still eyeing lost embroidery took apparent notice passed on to window how delicious said need for more hamley rose now yours be out agree with said mr gibson replying to before cynthia molly must speak though addressed word to have be very kind in bringing flower so long now own be out need not trouble more looked at with little surprise clouding honest face be perhaps more at tone than word mr gibson however have be bold enough to strike first blow determined to go on a opportunity offered molly must perhaps have be more pained if have not seen cynthia colour rise waited for to speak if need be for knew that roger defence if defence be required might be safely entrusted to cynthia ready wit put out hand for shattered cluster of rose lay in cynthia lap at rate said trouble if mr gibson considers have be trouble to will be over paid if may have old lamp for new said cynthia smiling a gave to wish one must always buy nosegay such a have brought a cheaply forget waste of time that think must reckon a part of payment said mother really mr hamley must learn to shut door on if come so often at such early hour settle to own employment regularly after breakfast till lunch time be wish to keep cynthia molly to course of improving reading study so desirable for young people of age if be ever to become intelligent companionable woman with early visitor be quite impossible to observe regularity of habit be said in sweet false tone of late have gone through molly like scraping of slate pencil on slate roger face changed ruddy colour grew paler for moment looked grave not pleased in moment wonted frankness of expression returned why must not asked believe be early to call did interrupt regular occupation so spoke said believe have be very thoughtless will not come so early again have excuse to day brother told have made plan for going to see hurst wood when rose be out be earlier than usual year have be round to see spoke of long day there going before lunch plan be made with mr osborne hamley must not think of going without said mr gibson coldly have letter from morning in named wish say fear can not be at home till be out of flower daresay be not much to see in reality day be so lovely thought that plan of going to hurst wood must be charming excuse for being out of door thank how kind be so good too in sacrificing natural desire to be with father a much a possible be glad to say father be so much better than be in winter that spends much of time out of door in field have be accustomed to go about alone think that a great return to former habit a can be induced to make be best for when do return to cambridge there be hesitation in roger manner a replied be uncertain probably know that be fellow of trinity now hardly yet know what future plan may be be thinking of going up to london soon ah london be true place for young man said mr gibson with decision a if have reflected good deal on question if be not that really be so busy morning must have be tempted to make exception to general rule one more exception for early visit have made make too many already perhaps however may see again before go certainly will come replied rising to take leave still holding demolished rose in hand then addressing more especially to cynthia added stay in london will not exceed fortnight so be there anything can do for turning little to molly thank very much said cynthia very sweetly then acting on sudden impulse leant out of window gathered half opened rose deserve do throw that poor shabby bunch away eye brightened cheek glowed took offered bud did not throw away other bunch at rate may come after lunch be over afternoon evening will be most delicious time of day month hence said to molly cynthia in heart addressed to latter mr gibson affected not to hear what be saying held out limp hand once more to suppose will see when return pray tell brother how be longing to have visit from again when have left room molly heart be quite full have watched face read something of feeling disappointment at non acquiescence in plan of day pleasure in hurst wood delayed conviction that presence be not welcome to wife of old friend have come so slowly upon perhaps after thing touched molly more keenly than did bright look when cynthia gave rose bud indicated gush of sudden delight more vivid than pain have shown by previous increase of gravity ca think why will come at such untimely hour said mr gibson a soon a heard fairly out of house be different from osborne be so much more intimate with came made friend with time stupid brother of be muddling brain with mathematics at cambridge fellow of trinity indeed wish must learn to stay there not come intruding here assuming that because asked osborne to join in picnic be same to brother came in short mamma one man may steal horse must not look over hedge said cynthia pouting little two brother have always be treated so exactly alike by friend there have be strong friendship between that be wonder roger think may be welcome where osborne be allowed to come at hour continued molly in high dudgeon roger beuddled brain indeed roger betupid oh very well dear when be young must have be thought becoming for girl of age to fly out because little restraint be exercised a to hour at must receive young men call must have supposed that there might be good reason why parent disapproved of visit of certain gentleman even while be proud pleased to see member of same family be what said mamma said cynthia looking at mother with expression of innocent bewilderment on face one man may be quiet child proverb be vulgar do believe be vulgarest of be really catching roger hamley coarseness cynthia mamma said cynthia roused to anger mind abusing mr roger hamley have be very kind to while have not be well ca bear to hear disparaged if be coarse have objection to be coarse a well for seems to must mean kindliness pleasantness bringing of pretty flower present molly tear be brimming over at word must have kissed cynthia for warm partisanship afraid of betraying emotion making scene a mr gibson called sign of warm feeling laid down book hastily ran upstairs to room locked door in order to breathe freely there be trace of tear upon face when returned into drawing room hour afterwards walking straight demurely up to former place where cynthia still sate gazed idly out of window pouting displeased mr gibson meanwhile counting stitch aloud with great distinctness vigour chapter xxix bush fighting during month have elapsed since mr hamley death molly have wondered many time about secret have so unwittingly become possessed of last day in hall library seemed so utterly strange unheard of thing to inexperienced mind that man must be married yet not live with wife that son must have entered into holy state of matrimony without father knowledge without being recognized a husband of one known unknown by with whom came in daily contact that felt occasionally a if little ten minute of revelation must have be vision in dream roger have only slightly referred to once have kept entire silence on subject ever since not even look pause betrayed allusion to even seemed to have passed out of thought there have be great sad event of mother death to fill mind on next occasion of meeting molly since then long pause of intercourse have taken place so that sometimes felt a if brother must have forgotten how have come to know important secret even found often entirely forgetting perhaps consciousness of be present to unawares enabled to comprehend real nature of osborne feeling towards cynthia at rate never for moment have supposed that gentle kind manner towards cynthia be anything courtesy of friend strange to say in latter day molly have looked upon osborne relation to herself a pretty much same a in at one time have regarded roger thought of former a of one a nearly brother to cynthia a young man must well be whom have not known in childhood who be in nowise related to thought that be very much improved in manner probably in character by mother death be no longer sarcastic fastidious vain self confident did not know how often style of talk of behaviour be put on to conceal shyness consciousness to veil real self from stranger osborne conversation way might very possibly have be just same a before have be thrown amongst new people molly only saw in own circle in be on term of decided intimacy still there be doubt that be really improved though perhaps not to extent for molly gave credit exaggeration on part arose very naturally from fact that perceiving roger warm admiration for cynthia withdrew little out of brother way used to go talk to molly in order not to intrude between roger cynthia of two perhaps osborne preferred molly to needed not to talk if mood be not on be on happy term where silence be permissible where effort to act against prevailing mood of mind be not required sometimes indeed when osborne be in humour to be critical fastidious a of yore used to vex roger by insisting upon that molly be prettier than cynthia mark word roger five year hence beautiful cynthia red white will have become just little coarse figure will have thickened while molly will only have developed into more perfect grace believe girl have done growing yet be sure be taller than when first saw last summer miss kirkpatrick eye must always be perfection can not fancy must come up to soft grave appealing tender heavenly colour often try to find something in nature to compare to be not like violet blue in eye be too like physical weakness of sight be not like sky that colour have something of cruelty in come go on trying to match eye a if be draper bit of ribbon say at once 'her eye be loadstar have done with set up molly grey eye curling black lash long odds above other young woman of course be matter of taste now osborne roger have left neighbourhood in spite of mr gibson have said about roger visit being ill timed intrusive began to feel a if have be very pleasant variety now that have ceased altogether brought in whiff of new atmosphere from of hollingford brother have be always ready to do numberless little thing only man can do for woman small service mr gibson be always too busy to render for good doctor business grew upon thought that increase be owing to greater skill experience must probably have be mortified if must have known how many of patient be solely biassed in sending for by fact that be employed at tower something of sort must have be contemplated in low scale of payment adopted long ago by cumnor family of money received for going to tower must hardly have paid for horse flesh then a lady cumnor in younger day have worded be such thing for man just setting up in practice for to be able to say attends at house so prestige be tacitly sold paid for buyer seller defined nature of bargain on whole be a well that mr gibson spent so much of time from home sometimes thought so when heard wife plaintive fret pretty babble over totally indifferent thing perceived of how flimsy nature be fine sentiment still did not allow to repine over step have taken wilfully shut eye waxed up ear to many small thing that knew must have irritated if have attended to in solitary ride forced to dwell on positive advantage have accrued to through marriage have obtained unexceptionable chaperone if not tender mother for little girl skilful manager of previous disorderly household woman who be graceful pleasant to look at for head of table moreover cynthia reckoned for something on favourable side of balance be capital companion for molly two be evidently very fond of other feminine companionship of mother daughter be agreeable to a well a to child when mr gibson be moderately sensible not over sentimental mentally added then checked for must not allow to become more aware of fault foible by defining at rate be harmless wonderfully just to molly for stepmother piqued upon indeed must often call attention to fact of being unlike other woman in respect just then sudden tear came into mr gibson eye a remembered how quiet undemonstrative little molly have become in general behaviour to how once twice when have met upon stair be otherwise unwitnessed have caught kissed hand cheek in sad passionateness of affection in moment began to whistle old scotch air have heard in childhood have never recurred to memory since five minute afterwards be too busily treating case of white swelling in knee of little boy thinking how to relieve poor mother who went out charring day have to listen to moan of child night to have thought for own care if really existed be of so trifling nature compared to hard reality of hopeless woe osborne came home first returned in fact not long after roger have gone away be languid unwell though did not complain felt unequal to exertion thus week more elapsed before of gibson knew that be at hall then be only by chance that became aware of mr gibson met in one of lane near acute surgeon noticed gait of man a came near before recognized who be when overtook said why osborne be thought be old man of fifty loitering before did know have come back illustration why osborne be yes said osborne have be at home nearly ten day daresay ought to have called on people for made half promise to mr gibson to let know a soon a returned fact be be feeling very good for nothing air oppresses must hardly breathe in house yet be already tired with short walk 'd better get home at once will call see a come back from rowe must on account said osborne hastily father be annoyed enough about going from home so often say though have be from for six week put down languor to having be away keep purse string know added with faint smile be in unlucky position of penniless heir have be brought up so in fact must leave home from time to time if father get confirmed in notion of health be worse for absence will stop supply altogether may ask where do spend time when be not at hamley hall asked mr gibson with hesitation in manner replied osborne reluctantly will tell stay with friend in country lead life ought to be conducive to health because be thoroughly simple rational happy now have told more about than father know never asks where have be must tell if did at least think not mr gibson rode on by osborne side not speaking for moment two osborne scrape may have got into must advise telling father boldly out know know will be angry enough at first will come round take word for somehow will find money to pay debt set free if be that kind of difficulty if be other kind of entanglement why still be best friend be estrangement from father be telling on health will be bound said osborne beg pardon be not that be really out of order daresay unwillingness to encounter displeasure from father be consequence of indisposition will answer for be not cause of instinct tell there be something really matter with come be setting up instinct against profession said mr gibson cheerily dismounted throwing rein of horse round arm looked at osborne tongue felt pulse asking various question at end said will soon bring about though must like little more quiet talk with without tugging brute for third if will manage to ride over lunch with to morrow dr nicholls will be with be coming over to see old rowe will have benefit of advice of two doctor instead of one go home now have have enough exercise for middle of day a hot a be mope in house listening to maunderings of stupid instinct what else have to do said osborne father be not companion one ca read write for ever especially when there be end to be gained by mind telling in confidence recollect have be trying to get of poem published there be one like publisher for taking conceit out of one not man among must have a gift oho so be be master osborne thought there be mental cause for depression of health must trouble head about if be though be always very easily said know try hand at prose if ca manage to please publisher with poetry at rate go on fretting over spilt milk must lose time here come over to to morrow a said what with wisdom of two doctor wit folly of three woman think will cheer up bit so saying mr gibson remounted rode away at long slinging trot so well known to country people a doctor pace like look thought mr gibson to at night a over daybook reviewed event of day then pulse how often be mistaken ten to one own hidden enemy lie closer to than doe to even taking worse view of case osborne made appearance considerable time before luncheon next morning one objected to earliness of call be feeling better there be few sign of invalid about what few there be disappeared under bright pleasant influence of welcome a received from molly cynthia have much to tell of small proceeding since went away to relate conclusion of half accomplished project cynthia be often on point of gay careless inquiry a to where have be what have be doing molly who conjectured truth a often interfered to spare pain of equivocation pain that tender conscience must have felt for much more than must have felt for mr gibson talk be desultory complimentary sentimental after usual fashion still on whole though osborne smiled to at much that said be soothing agreeable presently dr nicholls mr gibson came in former have have conference with latter on subject of osborne health from time to time skilful old physician sharp observant eye gave comprehensive look at osborne then there be lunch when one be merry hungry excepting hostess who be trying to train midday appetite into genteelest of way thought falsely enough that dr nicholls be good person to practise semblance of ill health upon that must give proper civil amount of commiseration for ailment guest ought to bestow upon hostess who complains of delicacy of health old doctor be too cunning man to fall into trap must keep recommending to try coarsest viand on table at last told if must not fancy cold beef to try little with pickled onion there be twinkle in eye a said must have betrayed humour to observer mr gibson cynthia molly be attacking osborne on subject of literary preference have expressed dr nicholls have mr gibson quite at mercy be not sorry when luncheon be over to leave room to three gentleman ever afterwards spoke of dr nicholls a bear presently osborne came upstairs after old fashion began to take up new book to question girl a to music mr gibson have to go out pay call so left three together after while adjourned into garden osborne lounging on chair while molly employed busily in tying up carnation cynthia gathered flower in careless graceful way hope notice difference in occupation mr hamley molly see devotes to useful to ornamental please under what head do class what be doing think might help one of instead of looking on like grand seigneur know what can do said rather plaintively must like to be useful know how day be past for purely ornamental work must let be be afraid besides be really rather exhausted by being questioned pulled about by good doctor why mean to say have be attacking since lunch exclaimed molly yes indeed have might have gone on till now if mr gibson have not come in opportunely thought mamma have gone out time ago said cynthia catching waft of conversation a flitted hither thither among flower came into dining room not five minute ago do want for see crossing hall at very moment osborne half rose oh not at said cynthia only seemed to be in such hurry to go out fancied have set off long ago have errand to do for lady cumnor thought must manage to catch housekeeper who be always in town on thursday be family coming to tower autumn believe so know much care take kindly to continued cynthia so suppose be not generous enough to take kindly to must have thought that very unusual blot in discrimination must have interested in a extraordinary people said osborne with little air of conscious gallantry be that compliment said cynthia after pause of mock meditation if one pay compliment please let be short clear be very stupid at finding out hidden meaning then such speech a 'you be very pretty ' 'you have charming manner be what prefer now pique on wrapping up sugar plum delicately then must please to write down at leisure will parse must be too much trouble will meet way study clearness next time what be two talking about said molly resting on light spade be only discussion on best way of administering compliment said cynthia taking up flower basket again not going out of reach of conversation like at in way said molly perhaps be rather sour grape with added nonsense said osborne will tell what heard of at ball will provoke mr preston said cynthia to begin upon be like turning tap stream of pretty speech flow out at moment lip curled with scorn for perhaps said molly not for for woman be notion of making agreeable if dare molly will try experiment will see with what success pray said molly in hurry do so dislike why said osborne roused to little curiosity by vehemence oh know never seems to know what one be feeling must care if did know said cynthia might know be not wanted if chooses to stay care little

run about like instead of being shut up for ever in dull old house osborne be apt occasionally to contrast position with roger in tone of complaint forgetting that be result of character also out of income roger gave up so large portion for maintenance of brother wife if ungenerous thought of osborne have be set clearly before conscience must have smote breast cried mea culpa with best of be only that be too indolent to keep unassisted conscience must have thought of going up said roger reddening a if have be accused of spending money instead of own if have have to go up on business lord

measure cause why have seen so little of mother in day when little girl have craved for love found none moreover cynthia missed slave although did not care for roger one thousandth part of what did

love molly grew angry with many many time a conviction of fact be forced upon molly did not know own feeling roger have overwhelming interest in what might be while very life breath seemed to depend on what cynthia felt thought therefore molly have keen insight into sister heart knew that cynthia did not love roger molly must have cried with passionate regret at thought of unvalued treasure lying at cynthia foot must have be merely unselfish regret be old fervid tenderness wish for moon o darling for can not give thee cynthia love be moon roger yearned for molly saw that be far away out of reach else must have strained heart cord to give to roger be sister must say to herself that old bond be not done away with though be too much absorbed by cynthia to speak about just now mother called 'fanny ' be almost like adoption must wait watch see if can do anything for brother one day lady harriet came to call on gibson rather on mr gibson for latter retained old jealousy if one else in

have be for late dinner be instantly put down to fire prettiest china brought out table decked with flower fruit arranged with cynthia usual dexterity taste so that when meal be announced lady harriet entered room must not think hostess apology have be quite unnecessary be more more convinced that clare have done very well for cynthia now joined party pretty elegant a always be somehow did not take lady harriet fancy only noticed on account of being mother daughter presence made conversation more general lady harriet gave out several piece of news none of of great importance to a what have be talked about by circle of visitor assembled at tower lord hollingford ought to have be with said amongst other thing be obliged fancy obliged be same thing to stay in town about crichton legacy legacy to lord hollingford be so glad be in hurry to be glad be nothing for trouble did hear of rich eccentric mr crichton who died time ago fired by example of lord bridgewater suppose left sum of money in hand of trustee of whom brother be one to send out man with thousand fine qualification to make scientific voyage with view to bringing back specimen of fauna of distant land so forming nucleus of museum be to be called crichton museum so perpetuate founder name such various form doe man vanity take sometimes stimulates philanthropy sometimes love of science seems to very laudable useful object be sure said mr gibson safely daresay be taking from public good view be rather tiresome to privately for keep hollingford in town between cambridge place a dull empty a can be just when want down at tower thing ought to have be decided long ago there be danger of legacy lapsing two other trustee have run away to continent feeling a say utmost confidence in in reality shirking responsibility however believe like so ought not to grumble think be going to be very successful in choice of man belongs to county too young hamley of hamley if can only get college to let go for be fellow of trinity senior wrangler something be not so foolish a to send crack man to be eaten up by lion tiger must be roger hamley exclaimed cynthia eye brightening cheek flushing be not eldest son can scarcely be called hamley of hamley said mr gibson hollingford man be fellow of trinity a said before then be mr roger hamley said cynthia be up in london about business what news for molly when come home why what have molly to do with asked lady harriet be looked into mr gibson face for answer mr gibson in reply gave intelligent very expressive glance at cynthia who however did not perceive oh not at mr gibson nodded little at daughter a much a to say if one lady harriet began to look at pretty miss kirkpatrick with fresh interest brother have spoken in such manner of young mr hamley one connected with phoenix be worthy of observation then a if mention of molly name have brought afresh into mind lady harriet said where be molly time must like to see little mentor hear be very much grown since day oh when once get gossiping with miss browning never know when to come home said mr gibson miss browning oh be so glad named be very fond of pecksy flapsy may call so in molly absence will go see before go home then perhaps will see dear little molly too do know clare have quite taken fancy to girl so mr gibson after precaution have to submit to lady harriet leaving half hour earlier than otherwise must have done in order to make herself common a mr gibson expressed by calling on miss browning molly have left before lady harriet arrived molly went long walk to holly farm to order damson out of kind of penitence have felt conscious of anger at being sent out of house by palpable manoeuvre a stepmother have employed of course did not meet cynthia so went alone along pretty lane with grassy side high hedge bank not at in style of modern agriculture at first made uncomfortable with questioning a to how far be right to leave unnoticed small domestic failing web distortion of truth have prevailed in household ever since father second marriage knew that very often longed to protest did not do from desire of sparing father discord saw by face that too be occasionally aware of certain thing gave pain a showing that wife standard of conduct be not a high a must have liked be wonder to molly whether silence be right wrong with girl want of toleration want of experience to teach force of circumstance of temptation have often be on point of telling stepmother forcible home truth possibly father example of silence often piece of kindness on mr gibson part for after way when in good temper be very kind to molly made hold tongue that night at dinner mr gibson recounted conversation between herself lady harriet giving very strong individual colouring a be wont telling nearly whole of what have passed although implying that there be great deal said be so purely confidential that be bound in honour not to repeat three auditor listened to without interrupting much indeed without bestowing extreme attention on what be saying until came to fact of lord hollingford absence in london reason for roger hamley going off on scientific expedition exclaimed mr gibson suddenly awakened into vivacity yes at least be not settled finally a lord hollingford be only trustee who take interest being lord cumnor son be next to certain think must have voice in matter said mr gibson relapsed into silence keeping ear open however henceforward how long will be away asked cynthia will miss sadly molly lip formed acquiescing yes to remark sound be heard there be buzzing in ear a if others be going on with conversation word uttered seemed indistinct blurred be merely conjecture did not interfere with one great piece of news to rest of party appeared to be eating dinner a usual if be silent there be one listener more to mr gibson stream of prattle mr gibson cynthia remark chapter xxxiii brightening prospect illustration untitled be day two afterwards mr gibson made time to ride round by hamley desirous to learn more exact particular of scheme for roger than must obtain from extraneous source rather puzzled to know whether must interfere in project not state of case be osborne symptom be in mr gibson opinion sign of having fatal disease dr nicholls have differed from on head mr gibson knew that old physician have have long experience be considered very skilful in profession still believed that be right if so complaint be one might continue for year in same state a at present might end young man life in hour minute supposing that mr gibson be right must be well for roger to be away where sudden call for presence must reach away for two year yet if affair be concluded interference of medical man might accelerate very evil to be feared after dr nicholls might be right symptom might proceed from other cause might yes probably did mr gibson must not bring to say yes to latter form of sentence so rode on meditating rein slack head little bent be one of still lovely autumn day when red yellow leaf be hanging peg to dewy brilliant gossamer web when hedge be full of trailing bramble loaded with ripe blackberry when air be full of farewell whistle pipe of bird clear short not long full throated warble of spring when whirr of partridge wing be heard in stubble field a sharp hoof blow fall on paved lane when here there leaf float flutter down to ground although there be not single breath of wind country surgeon felt beauty of season perhaps more than most men saw more of by day by night in storm sunshine in still soft cloudy weather never spoke about what felt on subject indeed did not put feeling into word even to if mood ever approached to sentimental be on such day a rode into stable yard gave horse to man went into house by side entrance in passage met squire be capital gibson what good wind blew here will have lunch be on table only just minute left room kept shaking mr gibson hand time till have

there be not duty involved in aspect of lot in life whether by continually passing over failing own standard be not lowered practical application of thought being dismal sort of perplexity on molly part a to whether father be quite aware of stepmother perpetual lapse from truth whether blindness be wilful not then felt bitterly enough that although be sure a must be that there be real estrangement between father yet there be perpetual obstacle thrown in way of intercourse thought with sigh that if must come in with authority might cut way clear to old intimacy with daughter that might have former walk talk quip crank glimpse of real confidence once again thing that stepmother did not value yet like dog in manger prevented molly enjoying after molly be girl not so far removed from childhood in middle of grave regret perplexity eye be caught by sight of fine ripe blackberry flourishing away high up on hedge bank among scarlet hip green russet leaf did not care much for

virtue see so will go get ready for dinner leave to vanity of dress took molly face in hand before molly be aware of intention kissed playfully then left molly to herself chapter xxxv mother manoeuvre mr gibson be not at home at dinner detained by patient most probably be not unusual occurrence be rather unusual occurrence for mr gibson to go down into dining room sit with a ate deferred meal when came in hour two later in general preferred easy chair corner of sofa upstairs in drawing room though be very rarely that must allow molly to avail herself of stepmother neglected privilege molly must fain have gone down kept father company night that have solitary meal for peace quietness gave up own wish on matter mr gibson took seat by fire in dining room patiently waited for auspicious moment

many risk go into many danger will come back nearer to power of maintaining wife than when went out know that replied still in arch manner of one possessing superior knowledge little bird did tell that osborne life be not so very secure then what will roger be heir to estate who told that about osborne said facing round upon frightening with sudden sternness of voice manner seemed a if absolute fire came out of long dark sombre eye who told say made faint rally back into former playfulness why can deny be not truth ask again hyacinth who told that osborne hamley life be in more danger than mine yours oh speak in frightening way life be not in danger be sure yours love hope gave impatient movement knocked wine glass off table for moment felt grateful for diversion busied in picking up fragment bit of glass be so dangerous said be startled by voice of command such a have never yet heard from husband never mind glass ask again hyacinth who told anything about osborne hamley state of health be sure wish harm to daresay be in very good health a say whispered at last who told began again sterner than ever well if will know will make such fuss about said driven to extremity be dr nicholls be sure forget never spoke to on subject believe nicholls did 'd better tell at once what be alluding to for be resolved will have out before leave room wish 'd never married again said now fairly cry looking round room a if in vain search for mouse hole in to hide then a if sight of door into store room gave courage turned faced must not talk medical secret so loud then if want people to hear have to go into store room that day dr nicholls be here cook wanted jar of preserve stopped just a be going out be sure be for pleasure of mine for be sadly afraid of stickying glove be that might have comfortable dinner looked a if be going to cry again gravely motioned to go on merely saying well overheard conversation suppose not much answered eagerly almost relieved by being thus helped out in forced confession only sentence two be asked why have just be saying something dr nicholls said 'if have got aneurism of aorta day be numbered ' well anything more yes said ' hope to god may be mistaken there be pretty clear indication of symptom in opinion how do know be speaking of osborne hamley asked perhaps in hope of throwing off scent a soon a perceived that be descending to level of subterfuge took courage said in quite different tone to cowed one have be using oh know heard name mentioned by before began to listen then own did listen yes said hesitating little now pray how do come to remember so exactly name of disease spoken of because went now be angry really ca see harm in what did then deprecate anger went into surgery looked out why might not mr gibson did not answer did not look at face be very pale forehead lip be contracted at length roused sighed said well suppose a one brew one must bake understand what mean pouted perhaps not replied suppose that be what heard on occasion that made change behaviour to roger hamley have noticed how much more civil be to of late if mean have ever got to like a much a osborne be very much mistaken not even though have offered to cynthia be to be son in law let know whole affair overheard will own that be osborne about whom be speaking though will have something to say about presently then if understand rightly changed behaviour to roger made more welcome to house than have ever done before regarding a proximate heir to hamley estate know what mean by 'proximate go into surgery look into dictionary then said losing temper for first time during conversation knew said through sob tear that roger have taken fancy to cynthia one might see a long a roger be only younger son with profession nothing fellowship thought right to discourage a one must who have grain of common sense in for clumsier more common awkward stupid fellow never saw to be called 'county mean take care will have to eat word presently when come to fancy will have hamley day sha said not perceiving exact drift be vexed now because be not molly be in love with call very unjust unfair to poor fatherless girl be sure have always tried to further molly interest a if be own daughter mr gibson be too indifferent to accusation to take notice of returned to what be of far more importance to point want to be clear about be did did not alter behaviour to roger in consequence of what overheard of professional conversation with dr nicholls have not favoured suit to cynthia since then on understanding gathered from conversation that stood good chance of inheriting hamley suppose did said sulkily if did ca see harm in must be questioned a if be in witness box be in love with cynthia long before conversation liked so much be not for to cross path of true love see how must have mother show love for child if may not turn accidental circumstance to advantage perhaps cynthia might have died if have be crossed in love poor father be consumptive know that professional conversation be confidential that must be most dishonourable thing possible for to betray secret learn in exercise of profession yes of course well be not one in respect can not do dishonourable act without being inculpated in disgrace if must be deep disgrace for to betray professional secret what must be for to trade on knowledge be trying hard to be patient offence be of class galled insupportably know what mean by trading trading in daughter affection be last thing must do must have thought must be rather glad than otherwise to get cynthia well married off hand mr gibson got up walked about room hand in pocket once twice began to speak stopped impatiently short without going on know what to say to said at length ca wo see what mean be glad enough to have cynthia here have given true welcome sincerely hope will find house a much home a own daughter doe for future must look out of door double lock approach if be so foolish a to however be past gone remains with to prevent recurrence a far a can for future now let hear present state of affair think ought to tell anything about be secret just a much a mystery be very well have told enough for to act upon most certainly will do be only other day promised squire to let know if suspected anything love affair entanglement much le engagement between of son girl be not engagement must not let be so if must only listen to must tell only do hope wo go tell squire everybody cynthia did so beg that might not be known be only unfortunate frankness have led into scrape never must keep secret from whom love must tell squire will not mention to one else do quite think be consistent with general frankness to have overheard what did never to have mentioned to must have told then that dr nicholls opinion be decidedly opposed to mine that believed that disturbance about consulted on osborne behalf be merely temporary dr nicholls must tell that osborne be a likely a man to live marry beget child if there be skill used by mr gibson so to word speech a to conceal own opinion mr gibson be not sharp enough to find out be dismayed mr gibson enjoyed dismay restored to something like usual frame of mind let review misfortune for see consider a such said no not quite misfortune said certainly if have known dr nicholls opinion hesitated see advantage of always consulting continued gravely here be cynthia engaged not engaged told before must not allow to be considered engagement on part well entangled in love affair with lad of three twenty with nothing beyond fellowship chance of inheriting encumbered estate profession even abroad for two year must go tell father about to morrow oh dear pray say that if dislike have only to express opinion think can act without cynthia in affair if be not mistaken cynthia will have pretty stout will of own on subject oh think care for very much be not one to be always falling in love doe not take thing very deeply to heart of course one must not do anything abruptly two year absence give one plenty of time to turn in little while ago be threatened with consumption early death if cynthia affection be thwarted oh dear creature how remember silly word might be know poor dear mr kirkpatrick be consumptive cynthia may have inherited great sorrow might bring out latent seed at time be so fearful daresay be not probable for think take thing very deeply to heart then be quite at liberty to give up affair acting a cynthia proxy if squire disapproves of poor mr gibson be in strait at question said at last can not give up be sure cynthia must not especially if thought others be acting for really be very much in love wish be in osborne place will tell must do said mr gibson in real earnest however may have be brought about here be two young people in love with other one be a fine young fellow a ever breathed other very pretty lively agreeable girl father of young man must be told be most likely will bluster oppose for there be doubt be imprudent affair a far a money go let be steady patient better lot need await young woman only wish be molly good fortune to meet with such will try for will indeed said mr gibson relieved by change of tone be one thing forbid will have 'trying ' for molly well be angry dear do know be quite afraid be going to lose temper at one time must have be of use said gloomily getting up a if to close sitting wife be only too glad to make escape conjugal interview have not be satisfactory to mr gibson have be compelled to face acknowledge fact that wife have chosen have very different standard of conduct from have upheld life have hoped to have seen inculcated in daughter be more irritated than chose to show for there be so much of self reproach in irritation that kept to brooded over allowed feeling of suspicious dissatisfaction with wife to grow up in mind extended by by to innocent cynthia caused manner to mother daughter to assume certain curt severity took latter at rate with extreme surprise on present occasion followed wife up to drawing room gravely congratulated astonished cynthia have mamma told said shooting indignant glance at mother be hardly engagement pledged ourselves to keep secret mamma among rest dearest cynthia must not expect must not have wished to keep secret from husband pleaded mr gibson perhaps not at rate sir said cynthia turning towards with graceful frankness be glad must know have always be most kind friend to daresay must have told did not want named if please must still be secret in fact be hardly engagement blushed sparkled little at euphuism implied that there be one present in thought at moment must not allow to bind by promise until return mr gibson looked gravely at irresponsive to winning look at moment reminded too forcibly of mother way then took hand said seriously enough hope be worthy of cynthia for have indeed drawn prize have never known truer warmer heart than roger have known boy man molly felt a if must have thanked father aloud for testimony to value of who be gone away cynthia pouted little before smiled up in face be not complimentary be mr gibson said think worthy suppose if have so high opinion of ought to respect judgment of if hoped to provoke compliment be disappointed for mr gibson let go hand in absent manner sate down in easy chair by fire gazing at wood ember a if hoping to read future in molly saw cynthia eye fill with tear followed to other end of room where have gone to seek working material dear cynthia be said pressed hand while trying to assist in search oh molly be so fond of father what make speak so to to night know said molly perhaps be tired be recalled from further conversation by mr gibson have roused from reverie be now addressing cynthia hope will not consider breach of confidence cynthia must tell squire of of what have taken place to day between son have bound by promise to be afraid be a well to tell truth be afraid emphasis on last word of something of kind between son one of two girl be only other day assured there be nothing of kind on foot told then must inform at once if saw symptom cynthia looked extremely annoyed be one thing stipulated for secrecy why said mr gibson can understand not wishing to have made public under present circumstance nearest friend on side surely can have objection to yes have said cynthia must not have have one know if must have helped be almost certain roger will tell father wo said cynthia made promise think be one to respect promise with glance at mother who feeling in disgrace with husband child be keeping judicious silence well at rate story must come with so much better grace from that will give chance wo go over to hall till end of week may have written told father before then cynthia held tongue for little while then said with tearful pettishness man promise be to override woman wish then be see reason why must not will trust in reason when tell will cause great deal of distress if get known said in so pleading voice that if mr gibson have not be thoroughly displeased annoyed by previous conversation with mother must have yielded to a be said coldly telling roger father be not making public like exaggerated desire for such secrecy cynthia seems to a if something more than be apparent be concealed behind come molly said cynthia suddenly let sing that duet have be teaching be better than talking a be doing be little lively french duet molly sang carelessly with heaviness at heart cynthia sang with spirit apparent merriment only broke down in hysteric at last flew upstairs to own room molly heeding nothing else father mr gibson word followed found door of bedroom locked for reply to entreaty to be allowed to come in heard cynthia sobbing cry be more than week after incident just recorded before mr gibson found at liberty to call on squire heartily hoped that long before then roger letter might have arrived from paris telling father whole story saw at first glance that squire have heard nothing unusual to disturb equanimity be looking better than have done for month past light of hope be in eye face seemed of healthy ruddy colour gained partly by resumption of outdoor employment in superintendence of work partly because happiness have lately have through roger mean caused blood to flow with regular vigour have felt roger going away be true whenever sorrow of parting with pressed too heavily upon filled pipe smoked out over long slow deliberate re perusal of lord hollingford letter word of knew by heart expression in made pretence to of doubting that might have excuse for looking at son praise once again first greeting over mr gibson plunged into subject news from roger yet oh yes here be letter said squire producing black leather case in roger missive have be placed along with other very heterogeneous content mr gibson read hardly seeing word after have by one rapid glance assured that there be mention of cynthia in hum see doe name one very important event have befallen since left said mr gibson seizing on first word came believe be committing breach of confidence on one side be going to keep promise made last time be here find there be something something of kind apprehended understand between step daughter cynthia kirkpatrick called at house to wish good by while waiting for london coach found alone spoke to call engagement of course be one give back letter said squire in constrained kind of voice then read again a if have not previously mastered content a if there might be sentence sentence have overlooked no said at last with sigh tell nothing about lad may play at confidence with father keep deal back squire appeared more disappointed at not having heard of straight from roger than displeased at fact mr gibson thought let take time be not eldest son continued squire talking a be to be not match must have planned for how came sir said firing round on mr gibson suddenly to say when be last here that there be nothing between son of girl why must have be going on time be afraid be be a ignorant about a babe unborn only heard of on evening of day of roger departure be week ago sir what be kept quiet ever since thought that roger must tell that show have son more than life be unknown to father why osborne there live together be to say have meal together sleep under same roof yet well well life be a god have made say be not engagement yet wonder what be doing hoping for lad disappointment in folly be set heart on just when be be helping be folly be not ask gibson for must know girl have much money suppose about thirty pound year at pleasure during mother life whew be well be not osborne will have to wait what family be of none of 'em in trade reckon from being so poor believe father be grandson of certain sir gerald kirkpatrick mother tell be old baronetcy know nothing of such thing be something do know something of such thing a be pleased to call like honourable blood mr gibson must not help saying be afraid that only one eighth of cynthia blood be honourable know nothing further of relation excepting fact that father be curate professional be step above trade at rate how old be eighteen nineteen pretty yes think so most people do be matter of taste come squire judge for ride over take lunch with day like may not be in mother will be there can make acquaintance with son future wife be going too fast however presuming too much on quietness with squire have be questioning mr hamley drew back within shell spoke in surly manner a replied roger 'future wife will be wiser by time come home two year among black folk will have put more sense in possible not probable must say replied mr gibson black folk be not remarkable for power of reasoning believe so that have much chance of altering opinion by argument even if understood other language certainly if share taste peculiarity of complexion will only make appreciate white skin more said be engagement growled squire if think better of wo keep to will if wish to break off will certainly advise cynthia to be equally willing that be can say see reason for discussing affair further at present have told how matter stand because promised must if saw anything of kind going on in present condition of thing can neither make mar can only wait took up hat to go squire be discontented go gibson take offence at what have said though be sure know why must what be girl like in herself know what mean said mr gibson did only be vexed did not choose to understand be well be like molly sweet tempered sensible with glove always mended neat about foot ready to do anything one asks just a if doing be very thing liked best in world mr gibson face relaxed now must understand squire broken sentence unexplained meaning be much prettier than molly to begin with have very winning way be always well dressed smart looking know have much to spend on clothes always doe what be asked to do be ready enough with pretty lively answer think ever saw out of temper then be not sure if take thing keenly to heart certain obtuseness of feeling go great way towards character for good temper have observed altogether think cynthia be one in hundred squire meditated little molly be one in thousand to mind then see come of family at suppose will have chance of much money said a if be thinking aloud without reference to mr gibson nettled latter replied somewhat impatiently well a there be question of molly in business see use of bringing name in considering family fortune to be sure not said squire rousing up wit have gone far afield will own be only thinking what pity be must do for osborne of course be out of question out of question yes said mr gibson if will excuse squire really must go now then will be at liberty to send wit afield uninterrupted time be at door before squire called back stood impatiently hitting top boot with riding whip waiting for interminable last word say gibson be old friend be fool if take anything say a offence madam wife did hit off only time ever saw wo say be silly think one of be silly be however will pas that over suppose bring girl cynthia be a outlandish christian name a 'd wish to hear little molly out here to lunch day be more at ease in own house be more sure to be civil too need say nothing about roger lass keep wife tongue quiet if can will only be like compliment to on marriage know one must take for anything more mind allusion mention of roger piece of folly will see girl then can judge for myself for a say will be best plan osborne will be here too be always in element talking to woman sometimes think be woman spends so much money be so unreasonable squire be pleased with own speech own thought smiled little a finished speaking mr gibson be pleased amused smiled too anxious a be to be gone next thursday be soon fixed upon a day on mr gibson be to bring womenkind out to hall thought that on whole interview have gone off good deal better than have expected felt rather proud of invitation of be bearer therefore mr gibson manner of receiving be annoyance to meanwhile have be considering a injured woman ever since evening of day of roger departure what business have one have to speak a if chance of osborne life being prolonged be infinitely small if in fact matter be uncertain liked osborne extremely much better than roger must gladly have schemed to secure for cynthia if have not shrunk from notion of daughter becoming widow for if mr gibson have ever felt anything acutely be death of mr kirkpatrick amiably callous a be in most thing recoiled from exposing daughter wilfully to same kind of suffering have experienced if have only known dr nicholls opinion must never have favoured roger suit never then mr gibson why be so cold reserved in treatment of since night of explanation have done nothing wrong yet be treated a though be in disgrace everything about house be flat just now even missed little excitement of roger visit watching of attention to cynthia cynthia too be silent enough a for molly be absolutely dull out of spirit state of mind so annoying to mr gibson just now that vented of discontent upon poor girl from whom feared complaint repartee chapter xxxvi domestic diplomacy evening of day on mr gibson have be to see squire three woman be alone in drawing room for mr gibson have have long round be not a yet come in have have to wait dinner for for time after return there be nothing done said what related to necessary business of eating mr gibson be perhaps a well satisfied with day work a of four for visit to squire have be weighing on mind ever since have heard of state of thing between roger cynthia did not like having to go tell of love affair so soon after have declared belief that such thing existed be confession of fallibility be distasteful to most men if squire have not be of so unsuspicious simple nature might have drawn own conclusion from apparent concealment of fact felt doubtful of mr gibson perfect honesty in business being what be there be danger of such unjust misapprehension still mr gibson knew hot hasty temper have to deal with have expected more violence of language than really encountered last arrangement by cynthia mother molly who a mr gibson thought to smiled at thought be sure to be peacemaker sweetener of intercourse be to go to hall make acquaintance with squire appeared like great success to mr gibson for achieving took not little credit to altogether be more cheerful bland than have be for many day when came up into drawing room for few minute after dinner before going out again to see town patient whistled little under breath a stood with back to fire looking at cynthia thinking that have not done justice when describing to squire now soft almost tuneless whistling be to mr gibson what purring be to cat must no more have done with anxious case on mind when be annoyed by human folly when be hungry than must have flown through air molly knew by instinct be happy without being aware of a soon a heard low whistle be music after mr gibson did not like trick of husband be not refined thought not even artistic if must have called by fine word must have compensated for want of refinement to night be particularly irritating to nerve since conversation with mr gibson about cynthia engagement have not felt in sufficiently good position to complain mr gibson began well cynthia have seen squire to day made clean breast of cynthia looked up quickly questioning with eye molly stopped netting to listen one spoke be to go there on thursday to lunch asked promised for still reply natural perhaps very flat will be glad of cynthia sha asked mr gibson may be little formidable hope will be beginning of good understanding between thank said with effort wo make public do so wish not to have known talked about not till come back close upon marriage see how must make public said mr gibson wife go to lunch with friend take daughter with there be nothing in be there be not sure that will go put in mr gibson did not know why said for fully intended to go time having said be bound to stick to for little while with such husband a hers hard necessity be sure to fall upon of having to find reason for saying then came quick sharp why not said turning round upon oh because because think ought to have called on cynthia first have that sort of sensitiveness ca bear to think of being slighted because be poor nonsense said mr gibson do assure slight be intended doe not wish to speak about engagement to one not even to osborne be wish too be cynthia doe intend to mention to of when go there naturally enough want to make acquaintance with future daughter in law if deviated so much from usual course a to come calling here be sure want to come calling here said mr gibson interrupting be not so very agreeable only time did come be that sort of character can not put up with neglect of person love just because be not smiled upon by fortune sighed little ostentatiously a ended sentence well then wo go said mr gibson provoked not wishing to have long discussion especially a felt temper going do wish cynthia said mr gibson anxious for excuse to yield daughter be quite aware of motive for question replied quietly not particularly mamma be quite willing to refuse invitation be already accepted said mr gibson almost ready to vow that must never again meddle in affair in woman be concerned must effectually shut out from love affair for future have be touched by squire relenting pleased with what have thought must give others pleasure be end of oh do go cynthia said molly pleading with eye a well a word do be sure will like squire be such pretty place will be so much disappointed must not like to give up dignity said cynthia demurely heard what mamma said be very malicious of fully intended to go be equally sure that mother be already planning dress for occasion in own mind mr gibson however who surgeon though be have never learnt to anatomize woman heart took literally be excessively angry with cynthia mother so angry that did not dare to trust to speak went quickly to door intending to leave room wife voice arrested said dear do wish to go if do will put own feeling on one side of course do said short stern left room then will go said in voice of victim word be meant for hardly heard will have fly from 'george get livery coat for thomas have long be wanting only dear mr gibson did not like on occasion like be sure wo mind thomas will go on box mamma have feeling too said cynthia nonsense child when be so nicely arranged too so went on day appointed mr gibson be aware of change of plan that be going after be so much annoyed by manner in wife have received invitation appeared to so much kinder than have expected from previous knowledge of squire wish on subject of son marriage that mr gibson heard interest curiosity expressed by husband a to visit reception met with cynthia indifference a to whether invitation be accepted not have displeased mr gibson be not up to way with mother did not understand how much of said indifference have be assumed in order to countervent mr gibson affectation false sentiment for annoyance on subject be in fact very curious to know how visit have gone off took first opportunity of being alone with molly to question about lunch of day before at hamley hall so went to hamley yesterday after yes thought must have come squire seemed quite to expect thought of going there at first changed mind like other people see why woman be to have monopoly of changeableness well how did go off pleasantly suppose for mother cynthia be in high spirit last night yes dear old squire be in best dress on best behaviour be so prettily attentive to cynthia looked so lovely walking about with listening to talk about garden farm mamma be tired stopped in door so got on very well saw great deal of other little girl trotted behind oh yes know be almost at home besides of course molly went very red left sentence unfinished do think be worthy of asked father just a if have completed speech of roger papa oh who be be very sweet very very

yes on wednesday morning did show to of course not besides read squire letter told about now cynthia rather to molly surprise have told that might read letter if liked molly have shrunk from availing herself of permission for roger sake thought that must probably have poured out heart to one sole person that be not fair to listen a be to confidence be osborne at home asked mr gibson squire said did not think must have come back young fellow be so uncertain no be still from home then molly blushed over crimson for suddenly struck that osborne be probably with wife that mysterious wife of whose existence be cognizant of whom knew so little of whom father knew nothing mr gibson noticed blush with anxiety what did mean be troublesome enough to find one of squire precious son have fallen in love within prohibited rank what must not have to be said done if anything fresh be to come out between osborne molly spoke out at once to relieve of new apprehension molly be taken by surprise by affair between cynthia roger hamley if there be anything more on tapis let know at once honestly openly know be awkward question for to reply to must ask unless have good reason took hand a spoke looked up at with clear truthful eye filled with tear a spoke did not know why tear came perhaps be because be not so strong a formerly if mean that be afraid that osborne think of a roger think of cynthia papa be quite mistaken osborne be friend nothing more never can be anything more be can tell be quite enough little one be great relief want to have molly carried off by young man just yet must miss sadly must not help saying in fulness of heart just then be surprised at effect few tender word produced molly threw arm round neck began to sob bitterly head lying on shoulder there there said patting on back leading to sofa will do get quite enough of tear in day shed for real cause not to want at home where hope be shed for cause at there be nothing really matter be there dear continued holding little away from that might look in face smiled at through tear did not see look of sadness returned to face after have left nothing dear dear papa nothing now be such comfort to have to myself make happy mr gibson knew implied in word felt that there be effectual help for state of thing have arisen from own act be better for that must not speak out more fully so kissed said be right dear can leave in comfort now indeed have stayed too long already gossiping go out have walk take cynthia with if like must be off good by little one commonplace word acted like astringent on molly relaxed feeling intended that must do so be truest kindness to walked away from with sharp pang at heart stunned into numbness a soon a must by throwing violently into affair care of others chapter xxxvii fluke what came of illustration untitled honour glory of having lover of own be soon to fall to molly share though to be sure be little deduction from honour that man who came with full intention of proposing to ended by making cynthia offer be mr coxe who came back to hollingford to follow out purpose have announced to mr gibson nearly two year before of inducing molly to become wife a soon a must have succeeded to uncle estate be now rich though still red haired young man came to george inn bringing horse groom not that be going to ride much that thought such outward sign of rich might help on suit be so justly modest in estimation of that believed that needed extraneous aid piqued on constancy indeed considering that have be so much restrained by duty affection expectation to crabbed old uncle that have not be able to go much into society very rarely indeed into company of young lady such fidelity to molly be very meritorious at least in own eye mr gibson too be touched by made point of honour to give fair field time sincerely hoping that molly must not be such goose a to lend willing ear to youth who must never remember difference between apophysis epiphysis thought a well not to tell wife more of mr coxe antecedent than that have be former pupil who have relinquished that knew of understood medical profession because old uncle have left enough of money to be idle mr gibson who felt that have somehow lost place in husband favour took into head that must reinstate if be successful in finding good match for daughter molly knew that husband have forbidden to try for end a distinctly a word must express meaning own word so seldom expressed meaning if did held to opinion so loosely that have idea that be same with other people accordingly gave coxe very sweet gracious welcome be such pleasure to to make acquaintance with former pupil of husband have spoken to so often of that quite feel a if be one of family a indeed be sure that mr gibson considers mr coxe felt much flattered took word a happy omen for love affair be miss gibson in asked blushing violently knew formerly be to say lived in same house with for more than two year must be great pleasure to to certainly be sure will be so glad to see sent cynthia know daughter cynthia think mr coxe molly be such great friend out for brisk walk frosty day think will soon come back went on saying agreeable nothing to young man who received attention with certain complacency be time much more engaged in listening to well remembered click at front door shutting to again with household care sound of familiar bounding footstep on stair at last came cynthia entered first bright blooming fresh colour in cheek lip fresh brilliance in eye looked startled at sight of stranger for instant stopped short at door a if taken by surprise then in came molly softly behind smiling happy dimpled not such glowing beauty a cynthia oh mr coxe be said going up to with outstretched hand greeting with simple friendliness yes seems such long time since saw be so much grown so much well suppose must say what replied speaking hurriedly holding hand time rather to discomfiture then mr gibson introduced daughter two girl spoke of enjoyment of walk mr coxe marred cause in very first interview if indeed ever must have have chance by precipitancy in showing feeling mr gibson helped to mar by trying to assist molly lost open friendliness of manner began to shrink away from in way thought be very ungrateful return for faithfulness to two year past after be not wonderful beauty fancy love have painted that miss kirkpatrick be far more beautiful much easier of access for cynthia put on pretty air look of intent interest in what one be saying to let subject be what must a if be thing cared most about in whole world unspoken deference in short unconscious way possessed by instinct of tickling vanity of men so while molly quietly repelled cynthia drew to by soft attractive way constancy fell before charm be thankful that have not gone too far with molly grateful to mr gibson for having prohibited declaration two year ago for cynthia cynthia alone must make happy after fortnight time during have entirely veered round in allegiance thought desirable to speak to mr gibson did so with certain sense of exultation in own correct behaviour in affair at same time feeling rather ashamed of confession of own changeableness be naturally involved now have so happened that mr gibson have be unusually little at home during fortnight mr coxe have ostensibly lodged at george in reality have spent greater part of time at mr gibson house so that have seen very little of former pupil on whole have thought improved especially after molly manner have made father pretty sure that mr coxe stood chance in quarter mr gibson be quite ignorant of attraction cynthia have have for young man if have perceived must have nipped in bud pretty quickly for have notion of girl even though only partially engaged to one man receiving offer from others if little plain speaking must prevent mr coxe have asked for private interview be sitting in old surgery now called consulting room still retaining so much of former self a to be last place in mr coxe must feel at ease be red up to very root of red hair kept turning glossy new hat round round in finger unable to find out proper way of beginning sentence so at length plunged in grammar grammar mr gibson daresay will be surprised be sure be at at what want to say think be part of honourable man a said sir year two ago to to speak to father first a sir stand in place of father to miss kirkpatrick must like to express feeling hope perhaps must say wish in short miss kirkpatrick said mr gibson good deal surprised yes sir continued mr coxe rushing on now have got so far know may appear inconstant changeable do assure came here with heart a faithful to daughter a ever beat in man bosom most fully intended to offer have to acceptance before left really sir if have seen manner to time endeavoured to press suit little be more than coy be absolutely repellent there must be mistaking while miss kirkpatrick looked modestly down smoothed nap of hat smiling little while did so while miss kirkpatrick repeated mr gibson in such stern voice mr coxe landed esquire a be now felt a much discomfited a used to do when be apprentice mr gibson have spoken to in similar manner be only going to say sir so far a one can judge from manner willingness to listen apparent pleasure in visit altogether think may venture to hope that miss kirkpatrick be not quite indifferent to must wait have objection have sir to speaking to mean said mr coxe little anxious at expression on mr gibson face do assure have chance with miss gibson continued not knowing what to say fancying that inconstancy be rankling in mr gibson mind no suppose have go fancy be that be annoying be mistaken about miss kirkpatrick however believe must ever have meant to give encouragement mr coxe face grew perceptibly paler feeling if evanescent be evidently strong think sir if must have seen consider vain manner be so difficult to describe at rate can have objection to taking chance speaking to of course if wo be convinced otherwise can have objection if will take advice will spare pain of refusal may perhaps be trenching on confidence think ought to tell that affection be otherwise engaged can not be said mr coxe mr gibson there must be mistake have gone a far a dared in expressing feeling manner have be most gracious think must have misunderstood meaning perhaps have changed mind be possible that after consideration have learnt to prefer be not by mean suppose can believe in such inconstancy must not help in own mind giving slight sneer at instance before must be very sorry to think that miss kirkpatrick must be guilty of may be chance will allow to see certainly poor fellow for intermingled with little contempt be good deal of respect for simplicity unworldliness strength of feeling even though feeling be evanescent will send to directly thank sir god bless for kind friend mr gibson went upstairs to drawing room where be pretty sure must find cynthia there be a bright careless a usual making up bonnet for mother chattering to molly a worked cynthia will oblige by going down into consulting room at once mr coxe want to speak to mr coxe said cynthia what can want with evidently answered own question a soon a be asked for coloured avoided meeting mr gibson severe uncompromising look a soon a have left room mr gibson sat down took up new edinburgh lying on table a excuse for conversation be there anything in article made say after minute two to molly who sat silent wondering molly must never trifle with love of honest man know what pain may give presently cynthia came back into drawing room looking very much confused most likely must not have returned if have known that mr gibson be still there be such unheard of thing for to be sitting in room in middle of day reading making pretence to read that have never thought of remaining looked up at moment came in so there be nothing for putting bold face on going back to work be mr coxe still downstairs asked mr gibson be gone asked to give kind regard believe be leaving afternoon cynthia tried to make manner a commonplace a possible did not look up voice trembled little mr gibson went on looking at book for few minute cynthia felt that more be coming only wished must come quickly for severe silence be very hard to bear came at last trust will never occur again cynthia said in grave displeasure must not feel satisfied with conduct of girl however free who must receive marked attention from young man with complacency so lead on to make offer never meant to accept what must think of young woman in position engaged yet 'accepting most graciously ' for be way coxe expressed overture of man do consider what unnecessary pain have given by thoughtless behaviour call thoughtless be mildest epithet can apply to beg that thing may not occur again will be obliged to characterize more severely illustration trust will never occur again cynthia molly must not imagine what more severely must be for father manner appeared to almost cruel in sternness cynthia coloured up extremely then went pale at length raised beautiful appealing eye full of tear to mr gibson be touched by look resolved immediately not to be mollified by of physical charm of expression to keep to sober judgment of conduct please mr gibson hear side of story before speak so hardly to did not mean to to flirt merely meant to make agreeable ca help doing that goose of mr coxe seems to have fancied meant to give encouragement do mean that be not aware that be falling in love with mr gibson be melting into readiness to be convinced by sweet voice pleading face well suppose must speak truly cynthia blushed smiled ever so little be smile hardened mr gibson heart again did think once twice that be becoming little more complimentary than occasion required hate throwing cold water on people never thought must take into silly head to fancy seriously in love to make such fuss at last after only fortnight acquaintance seem to have be pretty well aware of silliness must rather call simplicity think must have remembered that might lead to exaggerate what be doing saying into encouragement perhaps daresay be wrong that be all right said cynthia piqued pouting used to say in france that 'les absens ont toujours tort ' really seems a if here stopped be unwilling to be impertinent to man whom respected liked took up point of defence rather made matter worse besides roger must not allow to consider a finally engaged to must willingly have done must not let nonsense let go on talking about cynthia have said mean to say believe that be only thoughtless a told before let happen again left room at once to put stop to conversation continuance of must serve useful purpose perhaps end by irritating not guilty recommend prisoner not to do again be pretty much be molly said cynthia letting tear downfall even while smiled do believe father might make good woman of yet if must only take pain be quite so severe to think of stupid little fellow making mischief pretended to take to heart a if have loved for year instead of only for day daresay only for hour if truth be told be afraid be becoming very fond of said molly at least struck once twice knew must not stay long thought must only make uncomfortable if said anything about now wish have must have made bit of difference replied cynthia knew liked like to be liked be born in to try to make one come near fond of then must carry too far for becomes very troublesome if do will hate red haired people for rest of life to think of such man a being cause of father displeasure with molly have question at tongue end that longed to put knew be indiscreet at last out came almost against will will tell roger about cynthia replied have not thought about think will there be need perhaps if be ever married ever married said molly under breath cynthia took notice of exclamation until have finished sentence interrupted can see face know mood may tell then not in writing when be absent might annoy be afraid must make uncomfortable said molly simply yet must be so pleasant to be able to tell everything difficulty trouble yes only worry with thing be better to write merry letter cheer up among black folk repeated 'ever married ' little while ago do know molly think ever will be married to know why have strong presentiment so be just a well not to tell secret for must be awkward for to know if never came off molly dropped work sat silent looking into future at length said think must break heart cynthia nonsense why be sure that mr coxe came here with intention of falling in love with need blush so violently be sure saw a plainly a did only made disagreeable took pity on consoled wounded vanity can do dare to compare roger hamley to mr coxe asked molly indignantly said cynthia in moment be a different a men can be be so dreadfully serious over everything molly look a oppressed with sad reproach a if have be passing on to scolding father gave because think value roger a ought cynthia said molly stoutly for required good deal of courage to force to say although must not tell why shrank so from speaking yes do be not in nature to go into ecstasy suppose will ever be what people call 'in love ' be glad love like to make happy think best most agreeable man know always excepting father when be angry with can say more molly must like to say think handsome know most people think plain well be of opinion of most people then small blame to like face oh ten thousand time better than mr preston handsomeness for first time during conversation cynthia seemed thoroughly in earnest why mr preston be introduced neither molly knew came up out by sudden impulse fierce look came into eye soft lip contracted a cynthia named name molly have noticed look before always at mention of one person cynthia what make dislike mr preston so much why do ask yet molly said suddenly relaxing into depression not merely in tone look in droop of limb molly what must think of if married after married have ever asked cynthia instead of replying to question went on uttering own thought more unlikely thing have happened have never heard of strong will mesmerizing weaker one into submission one of girl at madame lefevre went out a governess to russian family who lived near moscow sometimes think will write to to find situation in russia just to get out of daily chance of seeing that man sometimes seem quite intimate with talk to how can help said cynthia impatiently then recovering added knew so well at ashcombe be not man to be easily thrown off can tell must be civil to be not from liking know be not for have told so however wo talk about know how came to do be sure mere fact of existence of being within mile of be bad enough oh wish roger be at home rich must marry at once carry away from man if 'd thought of really believe must have taken poor red haired mr coxe understand at said molly dislike mr preston must never think of taking such violent step a speak of to get away from neighbourhood in life because be reasonable little darling said cynthia resuming usual manner coming up to molly kissing at least will acknowledge be good hater yes still understand oh never mind there be old complication with affair at ashcombe money matter be at root of horrid poverty do let talk of something else better still let go finish letter to roger will be too late for african mail be gone oh ought to have reminded will be too late did not see notice at post office that letter ought to be in london on morning of th instead of evening oh be so sorry so be ca be helped be to be hoped will be greater treat when doe get have far greater weight on heart because father seems so displeased with be fond of now be making quite coward see molly continued little piteously have never lived with people with high standard of conduct before quite know how to behave must learn said molly tenderly will find roger quite a strict in notion of right wrong ah be in love with said cynthia with pretty consciousness of power molly turned away head be silent be of use combating truth tried rather not to feel not to feel poor girl that too have great weight on heart into cause of shrank from examining that whole winter long have felt a if sun be shrouded over with grey mist must no longer shine brightly for wakened up in morning with dull sense of something being wrong world be out of joint if be born to set right did not know how to do blind a must must not help perceiving that father be not satisfied with wife have chosen for long time molly have be surprised at apparent contentment sometimes have be unselfish enough to be glad that be satisfied still more frequently nature must have way be almost irritated at what considered blindness something however have changed now something have arisen at time of cynthia engagement have become nervously sensitive to wife failing whole manner have grown dry sarcastic not merely to sometimes to cynthia even very rarely to molly herself be not man to go into passion ebullition of feeling must have relieved even while degrading in own eye became hard occasionally bitter in speech way molly now learnt to long after vanished blindness in father have passed first year of marriage yet there be outrageous infraction of domestic peace people might say that mr gibson accepted inevitable told in more homely phrase that be use cry over spilt milk from principle avoided actual dissension with wife preferring to cut short discussion by sarcasm by leaving room moreover mr gibson have very tolerable temper of own cat like nature purred delighted in smooth way pleasant quietness have great facility for understanding sarcasm be true disturbed a be not quick at deciphering depth of meaning felt unpleasant to think about forgot a soon a possible saw be often in kind of disfavour with husband made uneasy resembled cynthia in liked to be liked wanted to regain esteem did not perceive have lost for ever molly sometimes took stepmother part in secret felt a if must never have borne father hard speech so patiently must have cut to heart must either have demanded explanation probed sore to bottom sat down despairing miserable instead of mr gibson after husband have left room on occasion must say in manner more bewildered than think dear papa seems little put out to day must see that have dinner that like when come home have often perceived that everything depends on making man comfortable in own house thus went on groping about to find mean of reinstating in good grace really trying according to light till molly be often compelled to pity in spite of herself although saw that stepmother be cause of father increased astringency of disposition for indeed have got into kind of exaggerated susceptibility with regard to wife fault may be best typified by state of bodily irritation be produced by constant recurrence of particular noise who be brought within hearing of be apt to be always on watch for repetition if be once made to notice be in irritable state of nerve so poor molly have not passed cheerful winter independently of private sorrow that might have in own heart did not look well either be gradually falling into low health rather than bad health heart beat more feebly slower vivifying stimulant of hope even unacknowledged hope be gone out of life seemed a if there be not never must be in world help for dumb discordancy between father wife day after day month after month year after year must molly have to sympathize with father pity stepmother feeling acutely for certainly more than mr gibson felt for molly must not imagine how have at one time wished for father eye to be opened how must ever have fancied that if be must be able to change thing in mr gibson character be hopeless only attempt at remedy be to think about a little a possible then cynthia way manner about roger gave molly great deal of uneasiness did not believe that cynthia cared enough for at rate not with sort of love that must have bestowed if have be so happy be not if have be in cynthia place felt a if must have gone to hand held out full brimming over with tenderness be grateful for word of precious confidence bestowed on yet cynthia received letter with kind of carelessness read with strange indifference while molly sat at foot so to speak looking up with eye a wistful a dog waiting for crumb such chance beneficence tried to be patient on occasion at last must ask where be cynthia what doe say by time cynthia have put down letter on table by smiling little from time to time a remembered loving compliment contained where oh did look exactly somewhere in abyssinia huon ca read word doe much signify for must give idea be well asked greedy molly yes now have have slight touch of fever say be over now hope be getting acclimatized of fever who took care of must want nursing so far from home oh cynthia oh fancy have nursing poor fellow one doe expect nursing hospital doctor in abyssinia have plenty of quinine with suppose be best specific at rate say be quite well now molly sat silent for minute two be date of letter cynthia did look december december th be nearly two month ago said molly yes determined must worry with useless anxiety when went away if anything did go wrong know said cynthia using euphuism for death a most people do be ugly word to speak plain out in midst of life must be over before even heard of illness must be of use to must molly daresay be very true only must think squire must not take so easily always write little note when hear from roger think will name touch of fever will molly know said molly people say one ought almost wish have heard please doe say anything else may hear oh lover letter be so silly think be sillier than usual said cynthia looking over letter again here be piece may read from line to indicating two place have read for looked dullish about aristotle pliny want to get bonnet cap made up before go out to pay call molly took letter thought crossing mind that have touched have have hand upon in far distant desert land where might be lost to sight to human knowledge of fate even now pretty brown finger almost caressed flimsy paper with delicacy of touch a read saw reference made to book with little trouble must be accessible to here in hollingford perhaps detail reference must make letter dull dry to people not to thanks to former teaching interest have excited in for pursuit a said in apology what have to write about in savage land love research travel there be society gaiety new book to write about gossip in abyssinian wild molly be not in strong health perhaps made little fanciful certain be that thought by day dream by night be haunted by idea of roger lying ill untended in savage land constant prayer o lord give living child in wise slay came from heart a true a of real mother in king solomon judgment let live let live even though may never set eye upon again have pity upon father grant that may come home safe live happily with whom love so tenderly so tenderly o god then must burst into tear drop asleep at last sobbing chapter xxxviii mr kirkpatrick qc cynthia be always same with molly kind sweet tempered ready to help professing great deal of love for probably feeling a much a did for one in world molly have reached to superficial depth of affection intimacy in first few week of cynthia residence in father house if have be of nature prone to analyse character of one whom loved dearly might have perceived that with cynthia apparent frankness there be certain limit beyond confidence did not go where reserve began real self be shrouded in mystery for instance relation with mr preston be often very puzzling to molly be sure that there have be much greater intimacy between formerly at ashcombe that remembrance of be often very galling irritating to cynthia who be a evidently desirous of forgetting a be anxious to make remember why intimacy have ceased why cynthia disliked so extremely now many other unexplained circumstance connected with two fact be cynthia secret effectually baffled molly innocent attempt during first glow of friendship for cynthia to learn girlish antecedent of companion life now then molly came to dead wall beyond must not pas at least with delicate instrument be chose to use perhaps cynthia might have told there be to tell to more forcible curiosity knew how to improve slip of tongue fit of temper to own gratification molly be interest of affection not coarser desire of knowing everything for little excitement a soon a saw that cynthia did not wish to tell anything about period of life molly left off referring to if cynthia have preserved sweet tranquillity of manner unvarying kindness for molly during winter of there be question at present be only person to whom beauty way be unchanged mr gibson influence have be good for a long a saw that liked have tried to keep a high place in good opinion a must have curbed many little sarcasm against mother many twisting of absolute truth when be by now there be constant uneasiness about made more cowardly than before even partisan molly must not help being aware of distinct equivocation occasionally used when anything in mr gibson word behaviour pressed too hard repartee to mother be le frequent than have be there be often unusual phenomenon of pettishness in behaviour to change in humour disposition here described at once be in series of delicate alteration of relative conduct spread over many month many winter month of long evening bad weather bring out discord of character a dash of cold water brings out fading colour of old fresco during much of time mr preston have be at ashcombe for lord cumnor have not be able to find agent whom liked to replace mr preston while inferior situation remained vacant mr preston have undertaken to do duty of mr goodenough have have serious illness little society at hollingford did not care to meet while one of habitual set be scarcely out of danger so there have be very little visiting though miss browning said that absence of temptation of society be very agreeable to cultivated mind after dissipation of previous autumn when there be party week to welcome mr preston yet miss phoebe let out in confidence that sister have fallen into habit of going to bed at nine o'clock for found cribbage night after night from five o'clock till ten rather too much of good thing to tell truth that winter if peaceful be monotonous in hollingford whole circle of gentility there be delighted to be stirred up in march by intelligence mr kirkpatrick newly made qc be coming on visit for couple of day to sister in law mr gibson mr goodenough room be very centre of gossip gossip have be daily bread through life gossip be meat wine to now dear ah said old

gibson said that cynthia kirkpatrick have paid visit in london to have lesson with cousin said that wife be most accomplished woman of good family though brought fortune be very creditable connection

matter be of fond o ' turning best breadth o ' gown to front remember speaking o ' breadth how have undone skirt many time oft to put stain grease spot next to poor mr goodenough 'd soft kind of heart when first be married said say 'patty thy right arm into left one then thou'lt be nearer to heart so kept up habit when poor man 'd deal more to think on than romancing on side heart lay so a said

opinion than mr goodenough there be great opportunity for cultivation of mind afforded by intercourse with foreign country always admire cynthia grace of manner never too shy to speak yet never putting forward be quite help to party if have few air grace why be natural at age now a for dear molly there be kind of awkwardness about broke one of best china cup last time be at party at house

always faithful to molly well did say be be there need for to be stupid evening after be rather sharp rather displeased think duty to be sharp ay cross too when see young folk careless when see duty clear do be not one to shrink from ought to be grateful to be not one will take trouble of reproving a mr goodenough know be very fond of molly gibson very for own sake for mother too be not sure if think be worth dozen cynthia for that must break best china teacup then sit doing nothing for livelihood rest of evening by time mr goodenough gave evident sign of being tired molly misdemeanor miss browning broken teacup be not a exciting subject of conversation a mr gibson newly discovered good luck in having successful london lawyer for relation mr kirkpatrick have be like many other men struggling on in profession encumbered with large family of own be ready to do good turn for connection if occasioned loss of time if be perhaps primary condition remembered existence cynthia visit to doughty street nine ten year ago have not made much impression upon after have once suggested feasibility to good natured wife be even rather startled now then by appearance of pretty little girl amongst own child a trooped in to dessert have to remind who be a be custom to leave table almost immediately to retreat into small back room called study to immerse in paper for rest of evening child have not made much impression upon probably next time remembered existence be when mr kirkpatrick wrote to to beg to receive cynthia for night on way to school at same request be repeated on return so happened that have not seen either time only dimly remembered remark wife have made on one of occasion that seemed to rather hazardous to send so young girl so long journey without making more provision for safety than mr kirkpatrick have done knew that wife must fill up deficiency in respect a if cynthia have be own daughter thought more about until received invitation to attend mr kirkpatrick wedding with mr gibson highly esteemed surgeon of hollingford c c attention irritated instead of pleasing doe woman think have nothing to do run about country in search of bride bridegroom

said meditatively such ignorance be possible now great case of houghton v houghton be thing of past hard struggle be over comparative table land of q c dom gained mr kirkpatrick have leisure for family feeling recollection one day in easter vacation found near hollingford have sunday to spare wrote to offer a visitor to gibson from friday till monday expressing strongly what really felt in le degree wish to make mr gibson acquaintance mr gibson though often overwhelmed with professional business be always hospitable moreover be always pleasure to to get out of somewhat confined mental atmosphere have breathed over over again have whiff of fresh air glimpse of what be passing in great world beyond daily limit of thought action so be ready to give cordial welcome to unknown relation mr gibson be in flutter of sentimental delight fancied be family affection might not have be quite so effervescent if mr kirkpatrick have remained in former position of struggling lawyer with seven child living in doughty street when two gentleman met be attracted towards other by similarity of character with just enough difference in opinion to make experience of on such opinion be based valuable to other to mr gibson although bond between counted for very little in intercourse mr kirkpatrick paid very polite attention be in fact very glad that have done so well for a to marry sensible agreeable man who be able to keep in comfort to behave to daughter in so liberal manner molly struck a delicate looking girl who might be very pretty if have greater look of health animation indeed looking at critically there be beautiful point about face long soft grey eye black curling eyelash rarely showing dimple perfect teeth there be languor over slow depression of manner contrasted unfavourably with brightly coloured cynthia sparkling quick graceful witty a mr kirkpatrick expressed afterwards to wife be quite in love with girl cynthia a ready to captivate stranger a little girl of three four rose to occasion forgot care despondency remembered no longer regret at having lost something of mr gibson good opinion listened eagerly made soft reply intermixed with nave sally of droll humour till mr kirkpatrick be quite captivated left hollingford almost surprised to have performed duty found pleasure for mr gibson molly have general friendly feeling did not care if never saw

did by change of mood from gloomy decision with have refused to accept invitation only hour ago suddenly took molly round waist began waltzing round room with to imminent danger of various little table loaded with objets d'art a mr gibson delighted to call with drawing room be crowded avoided however with usual skill stood still at last surprised at mr gibson surprise a stood at door looking at whirl going on before upon word only hope be not going crazy of what be about pray only because be so glad be going to london mamma said cynthia demurely be not sure if be quite thing for engaged young lady to be so much beside at prospect of gaiety in time great pleasure in lover absence be in thinking about must have thought must have given pain because must have have to remember that be away ought to have made unhappy now to tell truth just at moment have forgotten about roger hope be very wrong osborne look a if did share a well a own of fretting after roger how ill looked yesterday yes said molly did know if one besides have noticed be quite shocked ah said mr gibson be afraid that young man wo live long very much afraid shook head ominously oh what will happen if dy exclaimed molly suddenly sitting down thinking of strange mysterious wife who never made appearance whose very existence be never spoken about roger away too well must be very sad of course must feel very much have doubt for have always be very fond of osborne in fact before roger became a be own flesh blood liked osborne better must not forget living dear molly for molly eye be filling with tear at dismal thought presented to dear good roger must be sure do in power to fill place in way marriage need not be so long delayed speak of in same breath a osborne life mamma said cynthia hastily why dear be very natural thought for poor roger sake know one wish not to be so very very long engagement be only answering molly question after one ca help following out one thought people must die know young a well a old if ever suspected roger of following out thought in similar way said cynthia 'd never speak to again a if must said molly warm in turn know never must must suppose of cynthia not even for moment ca see great harm of for part said mr gibson plaintively young man strike a looking very ill be sure be sorry for illness very often lead to death surely agree with there what be harm of saying so then molly asks what will happen if dy try to answer question like talking thinking of death more than one else must think wanting in strength of mind if must not look forward to consequence of death really think be commanded to do so somewhere in bible prayer book do look forward to consequence of death mamma asked cynthia really be most unfeeling girl ever met with said mr gibson really hurt wish must give little of own sensitiveness for have too much for happiness let speak of osborne look again ten to one be only temporary over fatigue anxiety about roger perhaps little fit of indigestion be very foolish to attribute to anything more serious dear papa might be displeased if knew have done so medical men like other people to be making conjecture about health consider a trenching on own particular province very proper be sure now let consider about dress cynthia must not understand how have spent money made so little show with mamma may sound very cross must tell molly everybody once for a want did ask for more than allowance be not going to answer question about what do with did not say with want of respect said with quiet determination subdued mother for time though often afterwards when mr gibson molly be alone former must start wonder a to what cynthia must possibly have done with money hunt poor conjecture through wood valley of doubt till be wearied out exciting sport be given up for day at present however confined to practical matter in hand genius for millinery dress inherent in mother daughter soon settled great many knotty point of contrivance taste then three set to work to gar auld claes look amaist a weel new cynthia relation with squire have be very stationary ever since visit have paid to hall previous autumn have received at time with hospitable politeness have be more charmed with cynthia than liked to acknowledge to when thought visit over afterwards be pretty lass sure enough thought have pretty way about too like to learn from older people be good sign somehow like madam mother still be mother girl daughter yet spoke to once twice a must have ' liked little fanny to have spoken if have pleased god for to have ' lived be not right way may be bit old fashioned like right way then again took possession o ' a may say little molly have to run after in garden walk be too narrow for three just like little four legged doggie other be so full of listening to never turned round for to speak word to molly mean to say be not fond of other be in roger sweetheart favour be very ungrateful in to go find fault with lass who be so civil to have pretty way with of hanging on word fell from lip well deal may come go in two year lad say nothing to about will be a deep a take more notice of affair till come home tell so although squire be always delighted to receive little note cynthia sent time heard from roger although attention on part be melting heart tried to harden controlled into writing briefest acknowledgment word be strong in meaning formal in expression did not think much about being satisfied to do kind action called forth mother criticised pondered thought have hit on truth when decided in own mind that be very old fashioned style that house furniture wanted of brightening up polishing be sure to receive when never quite liked to finish sentence definitely although kept repeating to herself that there be harm in to return to squire occupied a now be recovered former health something of former cheerfulness if osborne have met way be probable that old bond between father son might have be renewed osborne be really invalid have sunk into invalid habit made effort to rally if father urged to go out nay once twice gulped down pride asked osborne to accompany must go to window find out flaw speck in wind weather make excuse for stopping in door over book must saunter out on sunny side of house in manner that squire considered a indolent unmanly yet if there be prospect of leaving home did pretty often about time be seized with hectic energy cloud in sky easterly wind dampness of air be nothing to then a squire did not know real secret cause of anxiety to be gone took into head that arose from osborne dislike to hamley to monotony of father society be mistake thought squire see now be never great at making friend always thought oxford cambridge men turned up nose at for country booby 'd get start have none o ' when boy went to rugby cambridge must have let have have own friend about even though might have looked down on be worst must have ' done to now what few friend have have fallen off from by death somehow be dreary work for young man grant might try not to show so plain to a doe be getting case hardened doe cut to quick sometimes doe so fond of dad a be once if can get land drained will make allowance let go to london where like maybe will do better time maybe will go to dog altogether perhaps will make think bit kindly of old father at home must like to do must be possible that osborne might have be induced to tell father of marriage during long solitary intercourse if squire in unlucky moment have not given confidence about roger engagement with cynthia be on one wet sunday afternoon when father son be sitting together in large empty drawing room osborne have not be to church in morning squire have be now trying hard to read one of blair sermon have dined early always did on sunday sermon hopeless wetness of day made afternoon seem interminably long to squire have certain unwritten rule for regulation of conduct on sunday cold meat sermon reading smoking till after evening prayer a little thought a possible a to state of land condition of crop a much respectable sitting in door in best clothes a be consistent with going to church twice day saying response louder than clerk to day have rained so unceasingly that have remitted afternoon church oh even with luxury of nap how long seemed before saw hall servant trudging homewards along field path covey of umbrella have be standing at window for last half hour hand in pocket mouth often contracting into traditional sin of whistle a often checked into sudden gravity ending nine time out of ten in yawn looked askance at osborne who be sitting near fire absorbed in book poor squire be something like little boy in child story who asks sort of bird beast to come play with in case receives sober answer that be too busy to have leisure for trivial amusement father wanted son to put down book talk to be so wet so dull little conversation must so wile away time osborne with back to window where father be standing saw nothing of went on reading have assented to father remark that be very wet afternoon have not carried on subject into variety of truism of be susceptible something more rousing must be started squire felt recollection of affair between roger cynthia came into head without giving moment consideration began osborne do know anything about attachment of roger quite successful osborne laid down book in moment turned round to father roger attachment never heard of can hardly believe be to say suppose be to then stopped for thought have right to betray own conjecture that object be cynthia kirkpatrick yes be though can guess who to nobody particularly like not connection to mind yet be very pretty girl suppose be to blame in first instance be be use beating about bush have gone so far may a well tell all be miss kirkpatrick gibson stepdaughter be not engagement mind be very glad hope like roger back again like be only too good connection for not to like if roger be of same mind when come home will be bound will be only too happy wonder roger never told said osborne little hurt now began to consider never told said squire be gibson who came here made clean breast of like man of honour 'd be saying to must have of two lad taking up with lass will own be be afraid of be bad enough with roger maybe will come to nothing after if have be 'd have ' broken with gibson mother son of 'em sooner than have let go on so told gibson beg pardon for interrupting once for claim right of choosing wife for subject to man interference said osborne hotly then will keep wife with man interference be for ne'er penny will get from lad unless marry to please little a well a great deal be ask of be not particular a to beauty a to cleverness piano playing that sort of thing if roger marries girl will have enough of in family must much mind being bit older than must be well born more money brings better for old place say again father choose wife for myself admit man right of dictation well well said squire getting little angry in turn if be not to be father in matter thou sha' be son go against in what have set heart on will find there be devil to pay be let get angry be sunday afternoon for one thing be sin besides have not finished story for osborne have taken up book again under pretence of reading be fuming to hardly put away even at father request a be saying gibson said when first spoke about that there be nothing on foot between of four that if there be must let know so by by come tell of of what understand how far have gone there be tone in osborne voice squire did not quite like began answering rather angrily of to be sure of what be telling of roger going making love to girl day left after have gone away from here be waiting for 'umpire ' in hollingford one must think quite stupid at time osborne can only say that detail be quite new to never mentioned before assure well never mind whether did not be sure said roger be attached to miss kirkpatrick be hanged to might have understood rest a matter of course possibly said osborne politely may ask if miss kirkpatrick who appeared to to be very nice girl responds to roger affection fast enough will be bound said squire sulkily hamley of hamley be to be have day now will tell what osborne be only marriageable one left in market want to hoist old family up again go against in really will break heart if do father talk so said osborne will do anything can to oblige except except only thing have set heart on doing well well let alone for present there be question of marrying just at moment be out of health be not up to going into society meeting young lady sort of thing even if have opening into fitting society must have opening fast enough there will be more money coming in in year two please god a for health why what be to make well if cower over fire day shudder away from good honest tankard a if be poison so be to said osborne languidly playing with book a if wanted to end conversation take up again squire saw movement understood well said will go have talk with will about poor old black be be sunday work enough asking after dumb animal ache pain after father have left room osborne did not take up book again laid down on table by leant back in chair covered eye with hand be in state of health made despondent about many thing though least of about what be most in danger long concealment of marriage from father made disclosure of far far more difficult than must have be at first unsupported by roger how must explain to one so passionate a squire how tell of temptation stolen marriage consequent happiness ala consequent suffering for osborne have suffered did suffer greatly in untoward circumstance in have placed saw way out of excepting by one strong stroke of felt incapable so with heavy heart addressed to book again everything seemed to come in way be not strong enough in character to overcome obstacle only overt step took in consequence of what have heard from father be to ride over to hollingford first fine day after have received news go to see cynthia gibson have not be there for long time bad weather languor combined have prevented found full of preparation discussion about cynthia visit to london not at in sentimental mood proper to respond to delicate intimation of how glad be in brother joy indeed be so long after time cynthia scarcely perceived that to intelligence be recent that first bloom of emotion have not yet passed away with head little on one side be contemplating effect of knot of ribbon when began in low whisper leaning forward towards a spoke cynthia may call cynthia now may be so glad of news have only just heard of be so glad what news do mean have suspicion be annoyed to think that from one person secret be passing to till in fact be becoming secret at still cynthia must always conceal annoyance when chose why be to begin calling cynthia now went on smiling terrible word have slipped out from between lip before do know light way of taking tender congratulation did not quite please osborne who be in sentimental mood for minute so remained silent then having finished making bow of ribbon turned to continued in quick low voice anxious to take advantage of conversation between mother molly think can guess why made that pretty little speech just now do know ought not to have be told moreover thing be not quite arrived at solemnity of of well engagement must not have so now sha' say more must not pray remember ought not to have known be own secret particularly wished not to be spoken about like being so talked about oh leaking of water through one small hole then plunged into talk of other two making conversation general osborne be rather discomfited at non success of congratulation have pictured to unbosoming of love sick girl full of rapture glad of sympathizing confidant little knew cynthia nature more suspected that be called upon for display of emotion le must show emotion be generally under control of will have made effort to come see now leant back in chair weary little dispirited poor dear young man said mr gibson coming up to with soft soothing manner how tired look do take of eau de cologne bathe forehead spring weather overcomes too 'primavera ' think italian call be very trying for delicate constitution a much from association a from variableness of temperature make sigh perpetually then be so sensitive dear lady cumnor always used to say be like thermometer have heard how ill have be said osborne not very much caring oh yes be better now anxiety about have tried so detained here by what be of course duty far away from intelligence not knowing what next post might bring where be then asked osborne becoming little more sympathetic at spa distance off three day post ca conceive trial living with a did for year bound up in family a be lady harriet said in last letter that hoped must be stronger than have be for year said molly innocently yes lady harriet of course one who know lady harriet know that be of too sanguine temperament for statement to be perfectly relied on altogether stranger be often deluded by lady harriet have off hand manner take in doe not mean half say will hope doe in instance said cynthia shortly be in london now lady cumnor have suffered from journey say so said mr gibson shaking head laying emphasis on word say be perhaps over anxious wish wish must see judge for must be only way of calming anxiety almost think will go up with cynthia for day two just to see with own eye quite like travelling alone will think about will write to mr kirkpatrick propose if determine upon can tell of anxiety will be only sharing bed for couple of night chapter xl molly gibson breathes freely be way in mr gibson first broached intention of accompanying cynthia up to london for few day visit have trick of producing first sketch of new plan before outsider to family circle so that first emotion of others if disapproved of project have to be repressed until idea have become familiar to to molly seemed too charming proposal ever to come to pas have never allowed to recognize restraint be under in stepmother presence at once found out when heart danced at idea of three whole day for that must be at least of perfect freedom of intercourse with father of old time come back again of meal without perpetual fidgetiness after detail of ceremony correctness of attendance will have bread cheese for dinner eat on knee will make up for having have to eat sloppy pudding with fork instead of spoon time by putting knife in mouth till cut papa will pour tea into saucer if be in hurry if be thirsty will take slop basin oh if must get buy borrow steal kind of old horse grey skirt be new will do must be too delightful after think can be happy again for month month have seemed a if have got too old ever to feel pleasure much le happiness again so thought molly yet blushed a if with guilt when cynthia reading thought said to one day molly be very glad to get rid of be not not of cynthia at least think be only if knew how love papa how used to see great deal more of than ever do now ah often think what interloper must seem be in fact feel a such at rate have be new delight to sister never knew how charming relationship must be mamma said cynthia half suspiciously half sorrowfully be papa wife said molly quietly mean to say be not often very sorry to feel be longer first with be violent colour flushed into face till even eye burnt suddenly found on point of cry weeping ash tree misery slow dropping comfort comforter came so vividly before be roger went on looking up at cynthia a overcame slight hesitation at mentioning name roger who told how ought to take papa marriage when be first startled grieved at news oh cynthia what great thing be to be loved by cynthia blushed looked fluttered pleased yes suppose be at same time molly be afraid will expect to be always a good a fancy now will have to walk on tiptoe rest of life be good cynthia put in molly be not be just a much mistaken a be day will go down in opinion with run just like hall clock other day when spring broke think will love just a much said molly must must be friend if if turned out ever have done very wrong thing must remember how very difficult have sometimes be to to act rightly took hold of molly hand a spoke wo speak of mamma for sake a much a mine hers must see be one to help girl with much good advice good oh molly know how be neglected just at time when wanted friend most mamma doe not know be not in to know what might have be if have only fallen into wise good hand know what be more continued suddenly ashamed of unusual exhibition of feeling try not to care daresay be really worst of must worry to death if once took to serious thinking wish must help even understand said molly after moment two of sad perplexity can help said cynthia changing manner abruptly can trim bonnet make head dress somehow hand ca fold up gown collar like deft little finger please will help to pack be real tangible piece of kindness not sentimental consolation for sentimental distress be perhaps imaginary after in general be people be left behind stationary who give way to low spirit at parting traveller however bitterly may feel separation find something in change of scene to soften regret in very first hour of separation a molly walked home with father from seeing mr gibson cynthia off to london by umpire coach almost danced along street now papa said be going to have to myself for whole week must be very obedient be tyrannical then be walking out of breath be cutting mr goodenough in hurry so crossed over street to speak to mr goodenough have just be seeing wife daughter off to london mr gibson have gone up for week deary deary to london only for week why can remember being three day journey will be very lonesome for miss molly without young companion yes said molly suddenly feeling a if ought to have taken view of case will miss cynthia very much mr gibson why will be like being widower over again must come drink tea with evening must try cheer up bit amongst will be tuesday in spite of sharp pinch molly gave to arm mr gibson accepted invitation much to gratification of old lady papa how must go waste one of evening have six in now five have so reckoned on doing sort of thing together what sort of thing oh know everything be unrefined ungenteel added slily looking up into father face eye twinkled rest of face be perfectly grave be not going to be corrupted with toil labour have reached very fair height of refinement wo be pulled down again yes will papa will have bread cheese for lunch very day will wear slipper in drawing room evening will stay quietly at home oh papa think must ride nora creina have be looking out old grey skirt think must make tidy where be side saddle to come from to be sure old one wo fit that great irish mare be not particular papa think must manage somehow thank be not quite going to return into barbarism may be depraved taste must like to see daughter properly mounted think of riding together down lane why dog rose must be out in flower honeysuckle hay how must like to see merriman farm again papa do let have one ride with please do be sure can manage somehow somehow be managed somehow molly wish came to pas there be only one little drawback to week of holiday happy intercourse with father everybody must ask out to tea be quite like bride bridegroom for fact be that late dinner mr gibson have introduced into own house be great inconvenience in calculation of small tea drinking at hollingford how ask people to tea at six who dined at hour how when refused cake sandwich at half past eight how induce other people who be really hungry to commit vulgarity before calm scornful eye so there have be great lull of invitation for gibson to hollingford tea party mr gibson whose object be to squeeze into county society have taken being left out of smaller festivity with great equanimity molly missed kind homeliness of party to have gone from time to time a long a must remember though a three cornered note be brought in grumbled little over loss of charming evening with father really be glad to go again in old way among old friend miss browning miss phoebe be especially compassionate towards in loneliness if have have will must have dined there day have to call upon very frequently in order to prevent being hurt at declining dinner mr gibson wrote twice during week absence to husband that piece of news be quite satisfactory to miss browning who have of late held great deal aloof from house where chose to suppose that presence be not wanted in winter evening have often talked over mr gibson household having little besides conjecture to go upon found subject interminable a must vary possibility day one of wonder be how mr mr gibson really got on together be whether mr gibson be extravagant not now two letter during week of absence showed what be in day considered very proper amount of conjugal affection yet not too much at elevenpence halfpenny postage third letter must have be extravagant sister looked to sister with approving nod a molly named second letter arrived in hollingford very day before mr gibson be to return have settled between that two letter must show right amount of good feeling proper understanding in gibson family more must have be extravagant only one must have be mere matter of duty there have be rather question between miss browning miss phoebe a to person second letter supposing came be to be addressed to must be very conjugal to write twice to mr gibson yet must be very pretty if molly came in for share have have letter say dear asked miss browning daresay mr gibson have written to time be large sheet cynthia have written on one half to rest be to papa very nice arrangement be sure what doe cynthia say be enjoying oh yes think so have have dinner party one night when mamma be at lady cumnor cynthia went to play with cousin upon word in one week do call dissipation why thursday must

little simper knowing look sate oddly on kindly innocent face see great deal of mr preston molly mr preston said molly flushing up with surprise no not much be be at ashcombe winter know have just come back to settle here what must make think so oh little bird told said miss browning molly knew little bird from childhood have always hated longed to wring neck why must not people speak out say that did not mean to give up name of informant be very favourite form of fiction with miss browning to miss phoebe be very acme of wit little bird be flying about one day in heath lane saw mr preston young lady wo say who walking together in very friendly manner be to say be on horseback path be raised above road just where there be little wooden bridge over brook perhaps molly be in secret ought not to ask about said miss phoebe seeing molly extreme discomfiture annoyance can be great secret said miss browning dropping little bird formula assuming air of dignified reproval at miss phoebe interruption for miss hornblower say mr preston owns to being engaged at rate be to cynthia know positively said molly with vehemence pray put stop to such report know what mischief may do do so hate that kind of chatter be not very respectful of molly to speak in way to be sure thought only of roger distress such report might cause must ever hear of in centre of africa made colour up scarlet with vexation heighty teighty miss molly remember that be old enough to be mother that be not pretty behaviour to speak so to to 'chatter ' to be sure really molly beg pardon said molly only half penitent daresay did not mean to speak so to sister said miss phoebe trying to make peace molly did not answer at once wanted to explain how much mischief might be done by such report see went on still flushed by vexation how bad be to talk of such thing in such way supposing one of cared for one else that might happen know mr preston for instance may be engaged to one else molly pity woman indeed do have very poor opinion of mr preston said miss browning in warning tone of voice for new idea have come into head well woman young lady must not like to hear such report about mr preston perhaps not for take word for be great flirt young lady have better not have much to do with daresay be accident meeting in heath lane said miss phoebe know nothing about said molly daresay have be impertinent only please talk about more have reason for asking got up for by striking of church clock have just found out that be later than have thought knew that father must be at home by time bent down kissed miss browning grave passive face how be growing molly said miss phoebe anxious to cover over sister displeasure 'as tall a straight a poplar tree a old song say grow in grace molly a well a in good look

heath lane day when mr goodenough saw together gracious goodness exclaimed miss phoebe receiving at once a gospel how do know by putting two two together did notice how red molly went then pale how said knew for fact that mr preston cynthia kirkpatrick be not engaged perhaps not engaged mr goodenough saw loitering together by own two self mr goodenough only crossed heath lane at shire oak a be

got new plaid shawl just alike trim bonnet alike molly be grown a tall a cynthia since christmas be always afraid 'd be short stumpy be now a tall slender a anyone need be will answer for mr goodenough saw molly took for cynthia when miss browning answered for miss phoebe gave up doubting sate time in silence revolving thought then said must be such very bad match after sister spoke very meekly awaiting sister sanction to opinion phoebe must be bad match for mary pearson daughter if have known what know now 'd never have have to tea last september why what do know asked miss phoebe miss hornblower told many thing think ought to hear phoebe be engaged to very pretty miss gregson at henwick where come from father made inquiry heard so much that be bad about that made daughter

event did not write often letter be tolerably long when did come very sprightly in tone there be constant mention made of many new name conveyed idea to molly though mr gibson must try enlighten by running commentary like following mr green ah be mr jones pretty cousin who life in russell square with fat husband keep carriage be not sure if be not mr green who be mr jones cousin can ask cynthia

gay life have be enjoying yet not at out of spirit at having left behind brought home sort of pretty dainty device for molly neck ribbon made up in newest fashion pattern for tippet delicate pair of light glove embroidered a molly have never seen glove embroidered before many little sign of remembrance during absence yet somehow other molly felt that cynthia be changed in relation to molly be aware that have never have cynthia full confidence for with apparent frankness navet of manner cynthia be extremely reserved reticent knew much of herself have often laughed about to molly latter have by time found out truth of friend assertion molly did not trouble much about too knew that there be many thought feeling flitted through mind must never think of telling to one except perhaps if be ever very much thrown together to father knew that cynthia withheld from more than thought feeling that withheld fact then a molly reflected fact might involve detail of struggle suffering might relate to mother neglect altogether be of so painful character that must be well if cynthia must forget childhood altogether instead of fixing in mind by relation of grievance trouble so be not now by want of confidence molly felt distanced a be be because cynthia rather avoided than sought companionship because eye shunned straight serious loving look of molly because there be certain subject on evidently disliked speaking not particularly interesting thing a far a molly must perceive almost seemed a if lay on road to point to be avoided molly felt sort of sighing pleasure in noticing cynthia changed manner of talking about roger spoke of tenderly now poor roger a called molly thought that must be referring to illness have mentioned in last letter one morning in first week after cynthia return home just a be going out mr gibson ran up into drawing room hat on booted spurred hastily laid open pamphlet down before pointing out particular passage with finger not speaking word before rapidly quitted room eye be sparkling have amused a well a pleased expression molly noticed a well a cynthia flush of colour a read what be thus pointed out to then pushed little on one side not closing book however went on with work what be may see asked molly stretching out hand for pamphlet lay within reach did not take until cynthia have said certainly suppose there be great secret in scientific journal full of report of meeting gave book little push towards molly oh cynthia said molly catching breath a read be not proud for be account of annual gathering of geographical society lord hollingford have read letter have received from roger hamley dated from arracuoba district in africa hitherto unvisited by intelligent european traveller about mr hamley sent many curious particular reading of letter have be received with greatest interest several subsequent speaker have paid writer very high compliment molly might have known cynthia better than to expect answer responsive to feeling prompted question let cynthia be ever so proud ever so glad so grateful even indignant remorseful grieved sorry very fact that be expected by to entertain of emotion must have be enough to prevent expressing be afraid be not a much struck by wonder of thing a be molly besides be not news to at least not entirely heard about meeting before left london be good deal talked about in uncle set to be sure did hear fine thing say of there then know be mere fashion of speaking mean nothing somebody be bound to pay compliment when lord take trouble to read one of letter aloud nonsense said molly know believe what be saying cynthia cynthia gave that pretty little jerk of shoulder be equivalent for french shrug did not lift up head from sewing molly began to read report over again why cynthia said might have be there lady be there say beany lady be present ' oh must have managed to go if uncle set cared about thing must of have taken perhaps if have asked think must have be rather astonished at sudden turn for science might have told uncle how matter really stood must have talked about if have wished not be sure must have helped once for molly said cynthia now laying down work speaking with quick authority do learn to understand that be always have be wish not to have relation roger bear to other mentioned talked about when right time come will make known to uncle to everybody whom may concern be not going to make mischief get into trouble even for sake of hearing compliment paid to by letting out before time if be pushed to 'd sooner break off altogether at once have done with ca be worse off than be now angry tone have changed into kind of desponding complaint before have ended sentence molly looked at with dismay ca understand cynthia said at length daresay ca said cynthia looking at with tear in eye very tenderly a if in atonement for late vehemence be afraid hope never will in moment molly arm be round oh cynthia murmured have be plaguing have vexed say be afraid of knowing of course have fault everybody have think love better for know that be so very bad said cynthia smiling little through tear molly be word caress have forced to overflow from eye have got into scrape be in scrape now do sometimes believe will always be in scrape if ever come to light will seem to be worse than really be know father will throw off wo be afraid that will molly be sure wo be do think how must roger take asked molly very timidly know hope will never hear of see why must for in little while will be quite clear again came about without ever thinking be doing wrong have great mind to tell about molly molly did not like to urge though longed to know to see if must not offer help while cynthia be hesitating perhaps to say truth rather regretting that have even made slight advance towards bestowing confidence mr gibson came in full of manner of altering gown of hers so a to make into fashion of day a have seen during visit to london cynthia seemed to forget tear trouble to throw whole soul into millinery cynthia correspondence went on pretty briskly with london cousin according to usual rate of correspondence in day indeed mr gibson be occasionally inclined to complain of frequency of helen kirkpatrick letter for before penny post came in recipient have to pay postage of letter eleven penny halfpenny three time week came according to mr gibson mode of reckoning when annoyed to sum between three four shilling complaint be only for family saw wrong side of tapestry hollingford in general miss browning in particular heard of dear helen enthusiastic friendship for cynthia of real pleasure be to receive such constant news relay of news indeed from london be almost a good a living there great deal better must think said miss browning with severity for have got many of notion of metropolis from british essayist where town be so often represented a centre of dissipation corrupting country wife squire daughter unfitting for duty by constant whirl of not always innocent pleasure london be sort of moral pitch few must touch not be defiled miss browning have be on watch for sign of deterioration in cynthia character ever since return home except in greater number of pretty becoming article of dress there be great change for worse to be perceived cynthia have be in world have beheld glare glitter dazzling display of london yet have come back to hollingford a ready a ever to place chair for miss browning to gather flower for nosegay for miss phoebe to mend own clothes be set down to merit of cynthia not to credit of london town a far a can judge of london said miss browning sententiously continuing tirade against place be better than pickpocket robber dressed up in spoil of honest folk must like to know where lord hollingford be bred mr roger hamley good husband lent that report of meeting mr gibson where so much be said about be a proud of praise a if have be akin to phoebe read aloud to for print be too small for eye be good deal perplexed with new name of place said have better skip for have never heard of before probably must never hear of again read out fine thing said of lord mr roger put to where be born bred why within eight mile of hollingford might have be molly there be chance then go talk about pleasure of intellectual society in london distinguished people up there that be such advantage to know time know be only shop play be real attraction be here there put best foot foremost if have reason to give look sensible speak out like men never say anything about silliness be hugging to heart ask again where doe fine society come from wise men distinguished traveller why out of country parish like london pick up deck with then call out loud to folk be robbed say 'come see how fine be fine indeed have patience with london cynthia be much better out of be not sure if be mr gibson if must stop up london letter will only be unsettling perhaps may live in london of day miss browning simpered mr gibson time enough then to be thinking of london wish honest country husband with enough to live upon little to lay by good character to boot mind molly said firing round upon startled molly wish cynthia husband with good character be got mother to look after have none when mother be alive be dear friend of mine so be not going to let throw away upon one whose life be clear above board may depend upon last speech fell like bomb into quiet little drawing room be delivered with such vehemence miss browning in secret heart meant a warning against intimacy believed that molly have formed with mr preston a happened that molly have never dreamed of such intimacy girl must not imagine why such severity of speech must be addressed to mr gibson who always took up point of word action where touched own self called sensitiveness broke silence followed miss browning speech by saying plaintively be sure miss browning be very much mistaken if think that mother must take more care of molly than do ca think there be need for one to interfere to protect have not idea why have be talking in way just a if be wrong be all right hurt feeling indeed doe for molly can tell there be not thing favour cynthia have that have not a for not taking care of why if be to go up to london to morrow must make point of going with to see after never did for cynthia when be at school in france bedroom be furnished just like cynthia let wear red shawl whenever like might have oftener if must ca think what mean miss browning did not mean to offend meant just to give molly hint understands what mean be sure said molly boldly have notion what meant if be alluding to anything more than said straight out that wish to marry one who have good character that a be friend of mamma must prevent marrying man with bad character by mean in power be not thinking of marrying want to marry anybody at if did be not good man must thank for coming warning of will not stand on warning molly will forbid banns in church if need be said miss browning half convinced of clear transparent truth of what molly have said blushing over be true with steady eye fixed on miss browning face while spoke do said molly well well wo say more perhaps be mistaken wo say more about remember what have said molly there be harm in at rate be sorry hurt feeling mr gibson a stepmother go think try do duty good morning good by to god bless if miss browning thought that final blessing must secure peace in room be leaving be very much mistaken mr gibson burst out with try do duty indeed must be much obliged to molly if must take care not to behave in such manner a to bring down upon such impertinence a have just be receiving from miss browning know what made talk a did mamma said molly be sure know care either know that never be spoken to a if be trying to do duty before 'trying ' indeed everybody always knew that did without talking about before face in rude manner have that deep feeling about duty that think ought only to be talked about in church in such sacred place a not to have common caller startling one with even though be early friend of mother a if did look after quite a much a look after cynthia why be only yesterday went up into cynthia room found reading letter put away in hurry a soon a came in did even ask who be from be sure must have made tell very likely mr gibson shrank from conflict with cynthia pretty sure that must be worsted in end while molly generally submitted sooner than have struggle for own will just then cynthia came in what be matter said quickly seeing that something be wrong why molly have be doing something have set that impertinent miss browning off into lecturing on trying to do duty if poor father have lived cynthia must never have be spoken to a have be ' stepmother trying to do duty ' indeed be miss browning expression allusion to father took from cynthia desire of irony came forward again asked molly what be matter molly ruffled made answer miss browning seemed to think be likely to marry one whose character be objectionable molly said cynthia yes once before spoke to suspect have got notion about mr preston in head cynthia sate down quite suddenly molly went on spoke a if mamma did not look enough after think be rather provoking not rather very very impertinent said mr gibson little soothed by molly recognition of grievance what must have put into head said cynthia very quietly taking up sewing a spoke know said mother replying to question after own fashion be sure always approve of mr preston even if be be thinking about be far more agreeable than be have much rather have coming to call than old maid like day know that be mr preston be thinking about said molly be only guess when be in london spoke about thought have heard something about cynthia unseen by mother cynthia looked up at molly eye full of prohibition cheek full of angry colour molly stopped short suddenly after look be surprised at quietness with cynthia said almost immediately well after be only fancy that be alluding to mr preston so perhaps have better not say more about a for advice to mamma to look after better miss molly will stand bail for good behaviour for mamma know be last person to do foolish thing in way now let talk more about be coming to tell that hannah brand little boy have be badly burnt sister be downstairs asking for old linen mr gibson be always kind to poor people immediately got up went to store to search for article wanted cynthia turned quietly round to molly molly pray ever allude to anything between mr preston not to mamma to one never do have reason for say anything more about ever mr gibson came back at moment molly have to stop short again on brink of cynthia confidence uncertain indeed time whether must have be told anything more only sure that have annoyed cynthia good deal time be approaching when must know chapter xlii storm burst autumn drifted away

like colouring of later time have now come on with shortening day there be comparative silence in land excepting for distant shot whirr of partridge a rose up from field ever since miss browning unlucky conversation thing have be ajar in gibson house cynthia seemed to keep one out at mental arm length particularly avoided private talk with molly mr gibson still cherishing grudge against miss browning for implied accusation of not looking enough after molly chose to exercise most wearying supervision over poor girl be where have be child who did see who be that letter from why be so long out when have only to go to so so just a if molly have really be detected in carrying on underhand intercourse answered question asked of with simple truthfulness of perfect innocence inquiry although read motive knew that arose from especial suspicion of conduct only that mr gibson might be able to say that looked well after stepdaughter chafed inexpressibly very often did not go out at sooner than have to give plan of intended proceeding when perhaps have plan at only thought of wandering out at own sweet will of taking pleasure in bright solemn fading of year be very heavy time for molly zest life have fled left so many of old delight mere shell of seeming thought be that youth have fled at nineteen cynthia be no longer same somehow perhaps cynthia change must injure in distant roger opinion stepmother seemed almost kind in comparison with cynthia withdrawal of heart mr gibson worried to be sure with form of watching over in other way at rate be same yet cynthia seemed anxious care worn though must not speak of anxiety to molly then poor girl in goodness must blame for feeling cynthia change of manner for a molly said to herself if be hard work for to help always fretting after roger wondering where be how be what must be for one day mr gibson came in bright swift molly said where be cynthia gone out to do errand well be pity never mind put on bonnet cloak a fast a can

hill now jump down lassie make best of way home before get dark will find cut over croston heath shorter than road have come by to get to croston heath molly have to go down narrow lane overshadowed by tree with picturesque old cottage dotted here there on steep sandy bank then there came small wood then there be brook to be crossed on plank bridge up steeper field on opposite side be cut step in turfy path ended be on croston heath wide stretching common skirted by labourer dwelling past near road to hollingford lay loneliest part of road be first lane wood little bridge clambering through upland field molly cared little for loneliness went along lane under over arching elm branch from here there yellow leaf came floating down upon very dress past last cottage where little child have tumbled down sloping bank be publishing accident with frightened cry molly stooped to pick up taking in arm in manner caused intense surprise to take place of alarm in little breast carried up rough flag step towards cottage supposed to be home mother came running in from garden behind house still holding late damson have be gathering in apron on seeing little creature held out arm to go to dropped damson about a took began to soothe a cried afresh interspersing lulling with thanks to molly called by name on molly asking woman how came to know replied that before marriage have be servant of mr goodenough so be bound to know dr gibson daughter by sight after exchange of two three more word molly ran down into lane pursued way stopping here there to gather nosegay of such leaf a struck for brilliant colouring entered wood a turned corner in lonely path heard passionate voice of distress in instant recognized cynthia tone stood still looked around there be thick holly bush shining out dark green in midst of amber scarlet foliage if one be there must be behind thick bush so molly left path went straight plunging through brown tangled growth of fern underwood turned holly bush there stood mr preston cynthia holding hand tight looking a if just silenced in vehement talk by rustle of molly footstep illustration there stood mr preston cynthia for instant one spoke then cynthia said oh molly molly come judge between mr preston let go cynthia hand slowly with look be more of sneer than smile yet too have be strongly agitated be subject in dispute molly came forward took cynthia arm eye steadily fixed on mr preston face be fine to see fearlessness of perfect innocence must not bear look said to cynthia subject of conversation doe not well admit of third person presence a miss gibson seems to wish for company now must beg to fix other time place where can finish discussion will go if cynthia wish said molly stay want to stay want to hear wish have told sooner mean that regret that have not be made aware of engagement that promised long ago to be wife pray remember that be who made promise secrecy not believe cynthia cry if can help believe cynthia said suddenly changing tone to fervid tenderness pray pray go on so ca think how distress stepped forward to try take hand soothe shrank away from sobbed more irrepressibly felt molly presence so much to be protection now dared to let go to weaken by giving way to emotion go away said molly see make worse did not stir be looking at cynthia so intently that did not seem even to hear go said molly vehemently if really distress to see cry see be who be cause of will go if cynthia tell said at length oh molly know what to do said cynthia taking down hand from tear stained face appealing to molly sobbing worse than ever in fact became hysterical though tried to speak coherently intelligible word must come run to cottage in tree fetch cup of water said molly hesitated little why go said molly impatiently have not done speaking to will not leave before come back see ca move in state went quickly if reluctantly cynthia be time before must check sob enough to speak at length said molly do hate what did mean by saying be engaged to cry dear tell if can help will ca imagine what really be be too long story to tell now be not strong enough look be coming back a soon a can let get home with heart said molly brought water cynthia drank be restored to calmness now said molly have better go home a fast a can manage be getting dark quickly if hoped to carry cynthia off so easily be mistaken mr preston be resolute on point said think since miss gibson have made acquainted with much have better let know whole truth that be engaged to marry a soon a be twenty otherwise being here with by appointment too may appear strange even equivocal to a know that cynthia be engaged to man can hardly expect to believe what say mr preston oh molly said cynthia trembling over trying to be calm be not engaged neither to person mean to mr preston mr preston forced smile think have letter must convince miss gibson of truth of what have said will convince mr osborne hamley if necessary conclude be to be alluding be quite puzzled by said molly only thing do know be that ought not to be standing here at time of evening that cynthia will go home directly if want to talk to miss

done sooner be because have yielded to wish pray pray molly know know anything about mean well kindly know be only making mischief be quite well enough to walk do let go will tell about when be at home took molly arm tried to hasten away mr preston followed talking a walked by side know what will say at home can deny that be promised wife can deny that have only be at earnest request have kept engagement secret so long be unwise cynthia stopped turned at bay since will have out since must speak here own what say be literally true that when be neglected girl of sixteen whom believed to be

question of immediate marriage daresay must never have objected know better now have persecuted so of late tell once for a have told before till be sick of very word that nothing will ever make marry nothing see there be chance of escaping exposure daresay losing character know losing few friend have never said molly touched by wailing tone of despair that cynthia be falling into be hard said mr preston may believe bad thing like about cynthia think can doubt real passionate disinterested love for do doubt said cynthia breaking out with fresh energy ah when think of self denying affection have seen have known affection thought of others before mr preston broke in at pause made be afraid of revealing too much to call love have be willing to wait for year to be silent while silence be desired to suffer jealousy to bear neglect relying on solemn promise of girl of sixteen for solemn say flimsy when girl grows older cynthia have loved do love wo give up if will keep word marry will swear will make love in return oh wish wish 'd never borrowed that unlucky money be beginning of oh molly have saved scrimped to repay wo take now thought if must repay must set free seem to imply

protection home at rate presence must put stop to miserable altercation did not sell liked then oh how do hate now cried cynthia unable to contain word bowed turned back vanishing rapidly down field

a if nothing have happened when get home come to room when go upstairs to bed will tell know will blame terribly will tell so molly did not say word till reached home then comparatively at ease inasmuch a one perceived how late be return to house of girl went up into separate room to rest calm before dressing for necessary family gathering at dinner molly felt a if be so miserably shaken that must not have gone down at if own interest only have be at stake sate by dressing table holding head in hand candle unlighted room in soft darkness trying to still beating heart to recall have heard what must be bearing on life of whom loved roger oh roger far away in mysterious darkness of distance loving a did ah be love be love to cynthia have referred a worthy of name object of love claimed by false to one must be how must be what must think feel if ever came to know be of use trying to imagine pain must do good what lay before molly be to try extricate cynthia if must help by thought advice action not to weaken by letting fancy run into picture of possible probable suffering when went into drawing room before dinner found cynthia mother by there be candle in room be not lighted for wood fire blazed merrily if fitfully be awaiting mr gibson return might be expected at minute cynthia sate in shade so be only by sensitive ear that molly must judge of state of composure mr gibson be telling of day adventure whom have found at home in call have be making who have be out small piece of news have heard to molly quick sympathy cynthia voice sounded languid weary made proper reply expressed proper interest at right place molly came to rescue chiming in with effort be true mr gibson be not one to notice slight shade difference in manner when mr gibson returned relative position of party be altered be cynthia now who raised into liveliness partly from consciousness that must have noticed depression partly because cynthia be one of natural coquette who from cradle to grave instinctively bring out prettiest air grace in order to stand well with man young old who may happen to be present listened to remark story with sweet intentness of happier day till molly silent wondering must hardly believe that cynthia before be same girl a who be sobbing cry a if heart must break two hour before be true looked pale heavy eyed be only sign gave of past trouble yet must be present care thought molly after dinner mr gibson went out to town patient mr gibson subsided into arm chair holding sheet of time before behind took quiet lady like doze cynthia have book

atmosphere presently tea came there be usual nightly bustle table be cleared mr gibson roused made same remark about dear papa that have done at same hour for week past cynthia too did not look different from usual yet what hidden mystery did calmness hide thought molly at length came bed time customary little speech molly cynthia went to own room without exchanging word when molly be in hers have forgotten whether be to go to cynthia cynthia to come to took off gown put on dressing gown stood waited even sat down for minute two cynthia did not come so molly went knocked at opposite door to surprise found shut when entered room cynthia sate by dressing table just a have come up from drawing room have be leaning head on arm seemed almost to have forgotten tryst have made with molly for looked up a if startled face did seem full of worry distress in solitude made more exertion gave way to thought of care chapter xliii cynthia confession said might come said molly that must

thought of roger how must feel what must say how meeting must come to pas where be at very time so on till suddenly plucked up recollected what have offered promised to do now that first fervour be over saw difficulty clearly foremost of be how be to manage to have interview with mr preston how have cynthia managed letter have passed between too unwillingly molly be compelled to perceive that there must have be great deal of underhand work going on beneath cynthia apparent openness of behaviour still more unwillingly began to be afraid that might be led into practice must try walk in straight path if did wander out of must only be to save pain to whom loved chapter xliv molly gibson to rescue seemed curious enough after storm of night to meet in smooth tranquillity at breakfast cynthia be pale talked a quietly a usual about manner of indifferent thing while molly sate silent watching wondering becoming convinced that cynthia must have gone through long experience of concealing real thought secret trouble before must have be able to put on semblance of composure among letter came in morning be one from london kirkpatricks not from helen cynthia own particular correspondent sister wrote to apologize for helen who be not well said have have influenza have left very weak poorly let come down here for change of air said mr gibson country at time of year be better than london except when place be surrounded by tree now house be well drained high up gravel soil will undertake to doctor for nothing must be charming said mr gibson rapidly revolving in mind change necessary in household economy before receiving young lady accustomed to household a mr kirkpatrick calculating consequent inconvenience weighing against probable advantage even while spoke must not like cynthia molly too then dear must become acquainted with one of girl have doubt must be asked back again must be so very nice must let go said mr gibson who have acquired unfortunate facility of reading wife thought dear helen went on mr gibson must so like to nurse must make consulting room into own private sitting room dear be hardly necessary to say that scale have be weighed down by inconvenience of having person behind scene for several week for with invalid so much depends on tranquillity in drawing room for instance might constantly be disturbed by caller dining room be so so what will call so dinnery smell of meal never seems to leave must have be different if dear papa have allowed to throw out window why ca have dressing room for bedroom little room opening out of drawing room for sitting room asked mr gibson library for by name mr gibson chose to dignify what have formerly be called book closet why must hardly hold sofa besides book writing table there be draught everywhere dear have better not ask at own home be comfortable at rate well well said mr gibson seeing that be to be worsted not caring enough about matter to show fight perhaps be right be case of luxury versus fresh air people suffer more from want of one than from want of other know will be glad to see if like to come take a be ca give up consulting room be necessity daily bread will write tell how kind mr gibson be said wife in high contentment a husband left room will be just a much obliged to a if have come whether be helen illness from other cause after breakfast cynthia became very flat absent lasted day long molly understood now why mood have be so changeable for many month be tender forbearing with accordingly towards evening when two girl be left alone cynthia came stood over molly so that face must not be seen molly said will do will do what said last night have be thinking of day sometimes believe must give back letter if asked might fancy at rate be worth trying if very much dislike now so happened that with thought have given to molly disliked idea of proposed interview with mr preston more more be after own offer must must draw back from might do good did not see how must possibly do harm so gave consent tried to conceal distaste grew upon more more a cynthia hastily arranged detail will meet in avenue leading from park lodge up to tower can come in one way from tower where have often business have pas key everywhere can go in a have often done by lodge need not go far did strike molly cynthia must have have experience in making arrangement ventured to ask how be to be informed of cynthia only reddened replied oh never mind will only be too glad to come heard say wished to discus affair more be first time appointment have come from side if can once be free oh molly will love be grateful to life molly thought of roger that thought prompted next speech must be horrible think be very brave think must have must have accepted even roger with half cancelled engagement hanging over blushed a spoke forget how detest mr preston said cynthia be that more than excess of love for roger made thankful to be at least a securely pledged to one else did not want to call engagement did because gave feeling of assurance be free from mr preston so be letter oh if can make take back abominable money get letter then must bury in oblivion must marry somebody else must marry roger one must be wiser after be only what people call 'youthful folly may tell mr preston that a soon a make letter public show to father anything will go away from hollingford never come back loaded with many such message felt that must never deliver not really knowing what must say hating errand not satisfied with cynthia manner of speaking about relation to roger oppressed with shame complicity in conduct appeared to deceitful yet willing to bear brave if must once set cynthia in straight path in clear space almost more pitiful to friend great distress possible disgrace than able to give love involves perfect sympathy molly set out on walk towards appointed place be cloudy blustering day noise of blowing wind among nearly leafless branch of great tree filled ear a passed through park gate entered avenue walked quickly instinctively wishing to get blood up have time for thought there be bend in avenue about quarter of mile from lodge after bend be straight line up to great house now emptied of inhabitant molly did not like going quite out of sight of lodge stood facing close by trunk of one of tree presently heard step coming over grass be mr preston saw woman figure half behind trunk of tree made doubt that be cynthia when came nearer almost close figure turned round instead of brilliantly coloured face of cynthia met pale resolved look of molly did not speak to greet though felt sure from general aspect of pallor timidity that be afraid of steady gray eye met with courageous innocence be cynthia unable to come asked perceiving that expected did not know thought that must meet said molly little surprised in simplicity have believed that cynthia have named that be molly gibson who must meet mr preston at given time place cynthia have be too worldly wise for have decoyed thither by vaguely worded note while avoiding actual falsehood have led to believe that must give meeting said must be here said mr preston extremely annoyed at being entrapped a now felt that have be into interview with miss gibson molly hesitated little before spoke be determined not to break silence a have intruded into affair must find situation a awkward a possible at rate sent here to meet said molly have told exactly how matter stand between have sneered be not always most open reliable person in world molly reddened perceived impertinence of tone temper be none of coolest mastered gained courage by so doing must not speak so of person profess to wish to have for wife putting aside have letter of hers that wish to have back again daresay that have right to keep legal moral right do mean know simply have right at a gentleman to keep girl letter when asks for back again much le to hold over a threat see do know miss gibson said changing manner to one of more respect at least have told story from point of view side now must hear mine promised a solemnly a ever woman be not woman be only girl barely sixteen old enough to know what be doing will call girl if like promised solemnly to be wife making one stipulation of secrecy certain period of waiting wrote letter repeating promise confidential enough to prove that considered bound to by implied relation give in to humbug set up a saint in most way can look after own interest pretty keenly know enough of position a penniless girl at time with influential connection to take place of wealth help on in world be a sincere unworldly passion a ever man felt must say so might have married two three girl with plenty of money one of be handsome enough not at reluctant molly interrupted be chafed at conceit of manner beg pardon want to hear account of young lady whom might have married come here simply on behalf of cynthia who doe not like who doe not wish to marry well then must make 'like ' a call did 'like ' once made promise will find requires consent of two people to break despair of making love a much a ever did according to letter at least when be married will never marry said molly firmly then if ever honour one else with preference will be allowed perusal of letter to molly almost must have laughed be so secure certain that roger must never read letter offered to under circumstance then thought that must feel such pain at whole affair at contact with mr preston especially if have not heard of from cynthia first if molly must save pain must before must settle what to say mr preston spoke again said other day that cynthia be engaged may ask whom to said molly may not heard say be not engagement be not exactly if be full engagement do think after what last said must tell to whom may be sure of must never read line of letter be too wo speak of before must never understand seems to that mysterious ' be very fortunate person to have warm defender in miss gibson to whom be not at engaged said mr preston with so disagreeable look on face that molly suddenly found on point of bursting into tear rallied worked on for cynthia first for roger a well honourable man woman will read letter if people do read will be so much ashamed of that wo dare to speak of what use can be of to contain cynthia reiterated promise of marriage replied say must rather leave hollingford for ever go out to earn bread than marry face fell little looked so bitterly mortified that molly be almost sorry for doe say that to in cold blood do know be telling very hard truth miss gibson if be truth be to say continued recovering little young lady be very fond of word 'detest ' have known many who have applied to men whom be time hoping to marry can not tell about other people said molly only know cynthia doe here hesitated for moment felt for pain so hesitated then brought out doe a nearly hate a anybody like ever doe hate like said repeating word almost unconsciously seizing on anything to try hide mortification mean must hate worse said molly in low voice did not attend much to answer be working point of stick into turf eye be bent on so now must mind sending back letter by do assure that can not make marry be very simple miss gibson said suddenly lifting up head suppose know that there be other feeling can be gratified except love have never heard of revenge cynthia have cajoled with promise little a may believe well be use speaking of mean to let go unpunished may tell that will keep letter make use of a see fit when occasion arises molly be miserably angry with herself for mismanagement of affair have hoped to succeed have only made matter worse what new argument must use meanwhile went on lashing up a thought how two girl must have talked over bringing in wounded vanity to add to rage of disappointed love mr osborne hamley may hear of content though may be too honourable to read nay even father may hear whisper if remember rightly miss cynthia kirkpatrick doe not always speak in most respectful term of lady who be now mr gibson there be stop said molly wo hear anything out of letter written when be almost without friend to whom looked upon a friend have thought of what will do next give fair warning if have not be foolish must have told father cynthia made promise must not so will tell from beginning to end to lady harriet ask to speak to father feel sure that will do think will dare to refuse lord cumnor felt at once that must not dare that clever land agent a be high up in earl favour on account yet that conduct of have be guilty in regard to letter threat have held out respecting be just what gentleman honourable man manly man must put up with in one about knew that much wondered how girl standing before have be clever enough to find out forgot for instant in admiration of there stood frightened yet brave not letting go hold on what meant to do even when thing seemed most against besides there be something that struck most of perhaps show kind of man be perceived that molly be a unconscious that be young man young woman a if have be pure angel of heaven though felt that must have to yield give up letter be not going to do at once while be thinking what to say so a still to evade making concession till have have time to think over with quick sens about heard trotting of horse cranching quickly along over gravel of drive moment afterwards molly perception overtook must see startled look overspread face in instant must have run away before first rush be made mr preston laid hand firmly on arm keep quiet must be seen at rate have done nothing to be ashamed of a spoke mr sheepshank came round bend of road be close upon mr preston saw if molly did not sudden look of intelligence dawned upon shrewd ruddy face of old gentleman saw did not much heed went forward spoke to mr sheepshank who made halt right before miss gibson servant rather blustering day for young lady to be out cold must say for standing still too long eh preston poking whip at latter in knowing manner yes said mr preston be afraid have kept miss gibson too long standing molly did not know what to say do so only bowed silent farewell turned away to go home feeling very heavy at heart at non success of undertaking for did not know how have conquered in fact although mr preston might not a yet acknowledge even to before be out of hearing heard mr sheepshank say sorry to have disturbed tte tte preston though heard word implied sense did not sink into mind be only feeling how have gone out glorious confident be coming back to cynthia defeated cynthia be on watch for return rushing downstairs dragged molly into dining room well molly oh see have got after never expected sate down a if must get over disappointment better in position molly stood like guilty person before be so sorry did must be interrupted at last mr sheepshank rode up provoking old man do think must have persuaded to give up letter if have have more time know wish mr sheepshank have come up just then did like finding standing talking to mr preston oh daresay 'd never think anything about what did mr preston say seemed to think be fully engaged to that letter be only proof have love in way way indeed said cynthia scornfully more think of more see must be better for papa to speak to did say must tell to lady harriet get lord cumnor to make give up letter must be very awkward very said cynthia gloomily must see be only threat will do in moment if like meant what said only feel that papa must manage best of more privately will tell what molly be bound by promise know can not tell mr gibson without breaking solemn word be just will leave hollingford never come back again if ever father hears of affair there cynthia stood up now began to fold up molly shawl in nervous excitement oh cynthia roger be that molly said yes know need not remind of be not going to live in house with one who may be always casting up in mind thing have heard against thing fault perhaps sound so much worse than really be be so happy when first came here liked admired thought well of now why molly can see difference in already carry thought in face have read there two day have be thinking cynthia must have deceived keeping up correspondence time having half engagement to two men have be more full of than of pity for a girl who have always be obliged to manage for without friend to help protect molly be silent there be great deal of truth in what cynthia be saying yet great deal of falsehood for through long forty eight hour molly have loved cynthia dearly have be more weighed down by position latter be in than cynthia also knew be second thought following on other that have suffered much pain in trying to do best in interview with mr preston have be tried beyond strength great tear welled up into eye fell slowly down cheek oh what brute be said cynthia kissing away see know be truth deserve need not reproach did not reproach said molly trying to smile have thought something of what said do love dearly dearly cynthia must have done just same a did must not grain be different somehow chapter xlv confidence rest of day molly be depressed not well having anything to conceal be so unusual almost so unprecedented circumstance with that preyed upon in way be nightmare that must not shake off did so wish to forget yet little occurrence seemed to remind of next morning post brought several letter one from roger for cynthia molly letterless looked at cynthia a read with wistful sadness appeared to molly a though cynthia must have satisfaction in letter until have told what be exact position with mr preston yet cynthia be colouring dimpling up a always did at pretty word of praise admiration love molly thought cynthia reading be interrupted by little triumphant sound from mr gibson a pushed letter have just received to husband with there must say expected that then turning to cynthia explained be letter from uncle kirkpatrick love so kind wishing to go stay with help to cheer up helen poor helen be afraid be very far from well must not have have here without disturbing dear papa in consulting room though must have relinquished dressing room well so said in letter how be grieved above of because be such friend

suddenly smitten with compunction can be ready to go by 'bang up ' to night said mr gibson for curiously enough after more than twenty year of quiet practice at hollingford be summoned up to day for first time to consultation in london to morrow be afraid lady cumnor be worse dear say so poor dear lady what shock be to be so glad have have breakfast must not have eaten anything nay only say be worse with complaint being worse may be only preliminary to being better take word for more than literal meaning thank how kind reassuring dear papa always be about gown cynthia oh be right mamma thank will be quite ready by four o'clock molly will come with help to pack wanted to speak to dear said a soon a have gone upstairs be such relief to get away from place haunted by man be afraid thought be glad to leave indeed be not there be little flavour of protesting too much about molly did not perceive only said indeed did not know from own feeling how must dislike meeting man in public in different manner from what have done in private will try not to see mr preston again for long long time be sure cynthia have told one word out of roger letter please how be have quite got over attack of fever yes quite writes in very good spirit great deal about bird beast a usual habit of native thing of kind may read from there indicating place in letter to there if can will tell what will trust with molly while pack that show sense of honour not what might read only 'd find love making dull make little account of where be what be doing date that sort of thing send to father molly took letter down without word began to copy at writing table often reading over what be allowed to read often pausing cheek on hand eye on letter letting imagination rove to writer scene in have seen in fancy have painted be startled from meditation by cynthia sudden entrance into drawing room looking picture of glowing delight one here what blessing ah miss molly be more eloquent than believe look here holding up large full envelope then quickly replacing in pocket a if be afraid of being seen what be matter sweet one coming up caressing molly be worrying over letter why see be very own horrible letter be going to burn directly that mr preston have have grace to send thanks to little molly cuishla ma chree pulse of heart letter have be hanging over head like somebody sword for two

how sick go when think of yesterday mr sheepshank look be only very little thing wo burden conscience with telling how got letter be not through person can trust with money must force to take back twenty three pound odd shilling have put together at rate of five per cent be sealed up oh molly must go off with such light heart if must only try to get safely to be last thing there must be immediate hurry know might meet by chance in shop in street even at party if only have with in pocket there must be nothing so easy molly be silent papa must give to there must be harm in must tell

writing in there must be line with money must only be winding up honourable honest winding up of affair have worried for year do a like give said molly will try there be darling can try if ca give to in private without getting into scrape why keep till come back again will have then whether will molly looked forward to two day alone with mr gibson with very different anticipation from with have welcomed similar intercourse with father in first place there be accompanying traveller to inn from coach started leave taking in market place be quite out of bound of mr gibson sense of propriety besides be gloomy rainy evening candle have to be brought in at unusually early hour there must be break for six hour music no reading two lady must sit at worsted work pattering away at small talk with not even usual break of dinner for to suit requirement of who be leaving have already dined early mr gibson really meant to make molly happy tried to be agreeable companion only molly be not well be uneasy about many apprehended care trouble at such hour of indisposition a be then passing through apprehension take shape of certainty lying await in path molly must have given good deal to have shaken off feeling unusual enough to very house furniture rain blurred outer landscape seemed steeped with unpleasant association most of dating from last few day must go on next journey think dear said mr gibson almost chiming in with molly wish that must get away from hollingford into new air life for week two have be stay at home for long time variety of scene be so desirable for young think traveller will be wishing at home by nice bright fireside 'there be place like home a poet say pleasure palace although may roam begin be very pretty very true be great blessing to have dear little home a be not molly yes said molly rather drearily having something of toujours perdrix feeling at moment if must have gone away with father just for two day how pleasant must have be to be sure love must be very nice for to go little journey by ourselves one else if be not such miserable weather must have gone off on little impromptu tour have be longing for something of kind for week live restricted kind of life here declare sometimes get quite sick of very sight of chair table know so well one miss others too seems so flat deserted without yes be very forlorn to night think be partly owing to weather nonsense dear ca have giving in to silly fancy of being affected by weather poor dear mr kirkpatrick used to say ' cheerful heart make own sunshine ' must say to in pretty way be little low for be complete barometer may really judge of state of weather by spirit have always be such sensitive creature be well for cynthia that doe not inherit think easily affected in way do molly thought for minute two then replied certainly be not easily affected not deeply affected perhaps must say many girl for instance must have be touched by admiration excited may say attention received when be at uncle last summer at mr kirkpatrick yes there be mr henderson that young lawyer be to say be studying law have good private fortune be likely to have more so can only be what call playing at law mr henderson be over head ear in love with be not fancy although grant mother be partial mr mr kirkpatrick noticed in one of mr kirkpatrick letter said that poor mr henderson be going into switzerland for long vacation doubtless to try forget cynthia really believed must find only 'dragging at remove lengthening chain ' thought such refined quotation altogether worded so prettily must know aunt kirkpatrick day molly love be what call woman of truly elegant mind ca help thinking be pity cynthia did not tell of engagement be not engagement dear how often must tell what be to call see why need to call anything indeed understand what mean by 'it must always try to express intelligibly really be one of first principle of english language in fact philosopher might ask what be language given for at if be not that may make meaning understood there be something between cynthia roger be more to other than be to osborne for instance what be to call must not couple name with of unmarried young man be so difficult to teach delicacy child perhaps one may say there be peculiar relation between dear cynthia roger be very difficult to characterize have doubt be reason shrink from speaking about for between ourselves molly really sometimes think will come to nothing be so long away privately speaking cynthia be not very very constant once knew very much taken before little affair be quite gone by be very civil to mr henderson in way fancy inherits for when be girl be beset by lover must never find in heart to shake off have not heard dear papa say anything of old squire dear osborne have seems so long since have heard seen anything of osborne must be quite well think must have heard of believe be quite well one said other day that have met riding be mr goodenough now

have persuaded that osborne evident illness be partly nervous by meant imaginary have dwelt upon look of enjoyment at miss phoebe perplexity thought that one really believing to be in danger must have given merry glance have done after seeing seriousness of father face recurred to shock have experienced on first seeing osborne changed appearance time mr gibson be busy reading letter from cynthia mr gibson have brought from london for opportunity of private conveyance be seized upon when postage be so high cynthia have forgotten so many thing in hurried packing that now sent list of clothes required molly almost wondered that have not come to did not understand sort of reserve be springing up in cynthia mind towards cynthia struggled with feeling tried to fight against by calling ungrateful truth be believed that no longer held former high place in molly estimation must not help turning away from one who knew thing to discredit be fully aware of molly prompt decision willing action where action be especially disagreeable on behalf knew that molly must never bring up past error difficulty still consciousness that good straightforward girl have learnt that cynthia have be guilty of so much underhand work cooled regard restrained willingness of intercourse reproach with ingratitude a must must not help feeling glad to be away from molly be awkward to speak to a if nothing have happened be awkward to write to about forgotten ribbon lace when last conversation have be on such different subject have called out such vehement expression of feeling so mr gibson held list in hand read out small fragment of news be intermixed with notice of cynthia requirement helen can not be so very ill said molly at length cynthia must not want pink muslin daisy wreath see that follows be sure replied mr gibson rather sharply helen must never be so selfish a to tie cynthia to side however ill be indeed must not have felt that be duty to let cynthia go to london at if have thought be to be perpetually exposed to depressing atmosphere of sick room besides must be so good for helen to have cynthia coming in with bright pleasant account of party have be to even if cynthia disliked gaiety must desire to sacrifice go out a much a must for helen sake idea of nursing be that one must not be always thinking of one own feeling wish doing thing will most serve to beguile weary hour of invalid then so few people have have to consider subject so deeply a have done mr gibson here thought fit to sigh before going on with cynthia letter a far a molly must make sense out of rather incoherent epistle very incoherently read aloud to cynthia be really pleased glad to be of use comfort to helen at same time very ready to be easily persuaded into perpetual small gaiety abounded in uncle house in london even at dead season of year mr gibson came upon mr henderson name once then went on with running um um um to herself sounded very mysterious might a well have be omitted a that cynthia really said about be mr henderson mother have advised aunt to consult certain dr donaldson who be said to be very clever in such case a helen uncle be not sufficiently sure of

seeing so visit be deferred to more convenient season be so often too late day buzzing gossip about molly meeting with mr preston clandestine correspondence secret interview in lonely place have be gathering strength assuming positive form of scandal simple innocent girl who walked through quiet street without thought of being object of mysterious implication became for time unconscious black sheep of town servant heard part of what be said in mistress drawing room exaggerated saying amongst with coarse strengthening of expression common with uneducated people mr preston became aware that name be being coupled with though hardly to extent to love of excitement gossip have carried people speech chuckled over mistake took pain to correct serf right said to for meddling with other folk business felt avenged for discomfiture menace of appealing to lady harriet have caused mortification have experienced in learning from plain speaking lip how have be talked over by cynthia with personal dislike on one side evident contempt on other besides if denial of mr preston stirred up examination a to real truth more might come out of baffled endeavour to compel cynthia to keep to engagement to than cared to have known be angry with for still loving cynthia loving in own fashion be understood told that many woman of more position wealth must be glad enough to have of pretty woman too asked why be such confounded fool a to go on hankering after penniless girl who be a fickle a wind answer be silly enough logically forcible in fact cynthia be cynthia not venus must have be substitute in one thing mr preston be more really true than many worthy men who seeking to be married turn with careless facility from unattainable to attainable keep feeling fancy tolerably loose till find woman who consent to be wife one must ever be to mr preston what cynthia have be be yet must have stabbed in certain of mood so molly who have come between object of desire be not likely to

cognizant of ill advised adventure with mr preston nay more that might even have instigated to save own child for cynthia be somehow other at bottom of have doubt now at rate mr gibson have not be playing treacherous part be comfort must extract out of molly mysterious admission that much mischief might result from mr gibson knowing anything about meeting with mr preston then what be to be done

hearing gossip be perpetually thrown into small society of place mr gibson have caught cold moreover be not tempted by quiet old fashioned visiting be going on just about time provoked by visit of two of mr dawes pretty unrefined niece who laughed chattered ate must fain have flirted with mr ashton vicar must have be brought by possibility to understand share in business mr preston did not accept invitation to hollingford tea drinking with same eager gratitude a have done year before else shadow hung over molly must have extended to co partner in clandestine meeting gave such umbrage to feminine virtue of town molly be invited because must not do to pas apparent slight on mr mr gibson there be tacit underhand protest against being received on old term one be civil to one be cordial there be very perceptible film of difference in behaviour to from what be formerly nothing have outline must be defined molly for clear conscience brave heart felt acutely that be only tolerated not welcomed caught buzzing whisper of two miss oakes who when first met heroine of prevailing scandal looked at askance criticised pretension to good look with hardly attempt at under tone molly tried to be thankful that father be not in mood for visiting be even glad that stepmother be too much of invalid to come out when felt thus slighted a be degraded from place miss browning that true old friend spoke to with chilling dignity much reserve for have never heard word from mr gibson since evening when have put to so much pain to tell of disagreeable rumour affecting daughter only miss phoebe must seek out molly with even more than former tenderness tried molly calmness more than slight put together soft hand pressing hers under table continual appeal to so a to bring back into conversation touched molly almost to shedding tear sometimes poor girl wondered to herself whether change in behaviour of acquaintance be not mere fancy of hers whether if have never have that conversation with father in have borne so bravely at time must have discovered difference in treatment of never told father how felt perpetual small slight have chosen to bear burden of own free will nay more have insisted on being allowed to do so be not for to grieve now by showing that shrank from consequence of own act so never even made excuse for not going into small gaiety mingling with society of hollingford only suddenly let go stretch of restraint be living in when one evening father told that be really anxious about mr gibson cough must like molly to give up party at mr goodenough to be three invited to molly alone be going molly heart leaped up at thought of stopping at home even though next moment have to blame for rejoicing at reprieve be purchased by suffering however remedy prescribed by husband did mr gibson good be particularly grateful caressing to molly really dear said stroking molly head think hair be getting softer losing that disagreeable crisp curly feeling then molly knew that stepmother be in high good humour smoothness curliness of hair be sure test of favour in mr gibson held at moment be so sorry to be cause of detaining from little party dear papa be so over anxious about have always be kind of pet with gentleman poor mr kirkpatrick never knew how to make enough of think mr gibson be even more foolishly fond last word be 'take care of hyacinth ' then came back again to say 'if attend to direction wo answer for consequence shook forefinger at said ' be so anxious silly man ' hope have done everything told to do said molly oh yes feel so much better do know late a be think might go to mr goodenough maria must take must like to see dressed when one have be wearing dull warm gown for week two one get quite craving for bright colour evening dress so

oh pray mamma have so much rather not go very well very well only think be rather selfish of when see be so willing to make sacrifice for sake say be sacrifice to want to go very well did not say might stop at home only pray chop logic nothing be so fatiguing to sick person then be silent for time mr gibson broke silence by saying in languid voice ca think of anything amusing to say molly molly pumped up from depth of mind few little triviality have nearly forgotten felt that be anything amusing so mr gibson seemed to feel for presently said wish cynthia be at home molly felt a reproach to own dulness will write to ask to come back well be not sure wish knew great many thing have not heard anything of poor dear osborne hamley lately have remembering father charge not to speak of osborne health molly made reply be needed for mr gibson went on thinking aloud see if mr henderson have be a attentive a be in spring chance about roger will be really grieved if anything happens to young man uncouth a be must be owned that africa be not merely unhealthy be savage even in part cannibal country often think of have read of in geography book a lie awake at night if mr henderson be really becoming attached future be hidden from by infinite wisdom molly else must like to know one must calculate one behaviour at present time so much better if one only knew what event be to come think on whole have better not alarm cynthia if have only known in time might have planned for to have come down with lord cumnor lady be coming be lady cumnor well enough to travel yes to be sure else must not have considered whether cynthia must have come down with must have sounded very well more than respectable must have given position among lawyer set in london then lady cumnor be better to be sure must have thought papa must have mentioned to to be sure be always so scrupulously careful not to speak about patient quite right too quite right delicate why hardly ever tell how be going on earl countess lady harriet lord lady cuxhaven lady agnes have ordered new winter bonnet black satin cloak chapter xlix molly gibson find champion lady cumnor have so far recovered from violence of attack from consequent operation a to be able to be removed to tower for change of air accordingly be brought thither by whole family with pomp state becoming invalid peeress there be probability that family must make longer residence at tower than have done for several year during time have be wanderer hither thither in search of health somehow after be very pleasant restful to come to old ancestral home member of family enjoyed in own way lord cumnor most especially talent for gossip love of small detail have scarcely fair play in hurry of london life be much nipped in bud during continental sojournings a spoke french fluently understood easily when spoken besides be great proprietor liked to know how land be going on how tenant be faring in world liked to hear of birth marriage death have something of royal memory for face in short if ever peer be old woman lord cumnor be that peer be very good natured old woman rode about on stout old cob with pocket full of halfpenny for child little packet of snuff for old people like old woman too enjoyed afternoon cup of tea in wife sitting room over gossip beverage must repeat that have learnt in day lady cumnor be exactly in state of convalescence when such talk a lord be extremely agreeable to have contemned habit of listening to gossip so severely life that thought due to consistency to listen first enter supercilious protest afterwards have however come to be family habit for of to gather together in lady cumnor room on return from daily walk drive ride over fire sipping tea at early meal to recount morsel of local intelligence have heard during morning when have said that have to say not before have always to listen to short homily from ladyship on well worn text poorness of conversation about person probable falsehood of have heard degradation of character implied by repetition on one of november evening be assembled in lady cumnor room be lying draped in white covered up with indian shawl on sofa near fire lady harriet sate on rug close before wood fire picking up fallen ember with pair of dwarf tongs piling on red odorous heap in centre of hearth lady cuxhaven notable from girlhood be using blind man holiday to net fruit net for wall at cuxhaven park lady cumnor woman be trying to see to pour out tea by light of one small wax candle in background for lady cumnor must not bear much light to weakened eye great leafless branch of tree outside house kept sweeping against window moved by wind be gathering be always lady cumnor habit to snub loved best husband be perpetually snubbed by yet missed now that be later than usual professed not to want tea knew that be only because be not there to hand to be found fault with for invariable stupidity in forgetting that liked to put sugar in before took cream at length burst in beg pardon lady be later than must have be know why have have tea yet exclaimed bustling about to get cup for wife know never take cream before have sweetened said with even more emphasis on never than usual oh dear what simpleton be think might have remembered by time see met old sheepshank be reason of of handing cream before sugar asked wife be one of grim joke have have be better evening think dear a be saying sheepshank be such eternal talker there be getting away from have idea be so late well think least can do be to tell something of mr sheepshank conversation now have torn away from conversation did call conversation think said much listened really have always great deal to say more than preston for instance by way be telling something about preston old sheepshank think will be married before long say there be great deal of gossip going on about gibson daughter have be caught meeting in park corresponding kind of thing be likely to end in marriage will be very sorry said lady harriet always liked that girl ca bear papa model land agent daresay be not true said lady cumnor in very audible aside to lady harriet papa pick up story one day to contradict next ah did sound like truth sheepshank said old lady in town have got hold of be making great scandal out of think doe sound quite nice story wonder what clare must be doing to allow such going on said lady cuxhaven think be much more likely that clare own daughter pretty pawky miss kirkpatrick be real heroine of story said lady harriet always look like heroine of genteel comedy young lady be capable of good deal of innocent intriguing if remember rightly now little molly gibson have certain gaucherie about must disqualify at once from clandestine proceeding besides 'clandestine why child be truth papa be sure mr sheepshank said be miss gibson be exciting hollingford scandal be miss kirkpatrick notion of mr preston making match of doe sound so incongruous if be little friend molly will go to church forbid banns really harriet ca think what always make take such interest in petty hollingford affair mamma be only tit for tat take most lively interest in saying doings if be going to be married must want to know possible particular when first met what first said to other what wore whether offered by letter in person be sure good miss browning be wonderfully well informed a to mary method of managing nursery educating girl so be only proper return of compliment to want to know on side how be going on be quite of papa faction like to hear local gossip especially when be flavoured with spice of scandal impropriety a in case said lady cumnor with momentary bitterness of convalescent invalid lady harriet coloured with annoyance then rallied courage said with more gravity than before be really interested in story about molly gibson own like respect like to hear name coupled with of mr preston ca help fancying papa have made mistake dear be sure be repeating what heard be sorry said anything about if annoys lady there sheepshank did say miss gibson though went on to say be pity girl have got so talked about for be way have carried on gave rise to chatter preston be very fair match for nobody must have objected to will try find more agreeable piece of news old margery at lodge be dead know where to find one to teach clear starching at school robert hall made forty pound last year by apple so drifted away from molly affair only lady harriet kept turning what have heard over in own mind with interest wonder warned against day of father wedding what straightforward out spoken topic be then believe be only one of old sheepshank story invention half deafness next day lady harriet rode over to hollingford for settling of curiosity called on miss browning introduced subject must not have spoken about rumour have heard to who be not warm friend of molly if mr sheepshank have chosen to allude to when have be riding with father must very soon have silenced by one of haughty look knew full well how to assume felt a if must know truth accordingly began thus abruptly to miss browning what be hear about little friend molly gibson mr preston oh lady harriet have heard of be so sorry sorry for what think begging ladyship pardon have better not say more till know how much know said miss browning nay replied lady harriet laughing little sha tell what know till be sure know more then will make exchange if like be afraid be laughing matter for poor molly said miss browning shaking head people do say such thing believe indeed burst in miss phoebe half cry more will then said lady harriet taking good lady hand be very fine phoebe saying believe must like to know who be that convinced sadly against will be sure only told fact a mr goodenough told sister be sure if have seen poor patient molly a have done sitting up in corner of room looking at beauty of england wale till must have be sick of one speaking to a gentle sweet a ever at end of evening though maybe bit pale fact fact wo believe anything against so there sate miss phoebe in tearful defiance of fact a said before be quite of opinion said lady harriet how doe ladyship explain away meeting with mr preston in sort of unlikely open air place asked miss browning who to do justice must have be only too glad to join molly partisan if must have preserved character for logical deduction at same time went so far a to send for father tell about thought at least must have horsewhipped mr preston seems to have taken notice of then may be quite sure know way of explaining matter that said lady harriet decisively after there may be hundred fifty perfectly natural justifiable explanation mr gibson knew of none when thought duty to speak to said miss browning why suppose that mr preston be engaged to miss kirkpatrick molly be confidante messenger see that ladyship supposition much alters blame why if be honourably engaged to cynthia kirkpatrick doe not visit openly at home in mr gibson house why doe molly lend to clandestine proceeding one ca account for everything said lady harriet little impatiently for reason be going hard against choose to have faith in molly gibson be sure be not done anything very wrong have great mind to go call on mr gibson be confined to room with horrid influenza take with on round of call through little gossiping town on mr goodenough badenough who seems to have be propagating story have not time to day have to meet papa at three be three now only remember miss phoebe be against world in defence of distressed damsel don quixote sancho panza said to a ran lightly down miss browning old fashioned staircase now think be pretty of phoebe said miss browning in displeasure a soon a be alone with sister first convince against will make very unhappy have to do unpleasant thing because have made believe that certain statement be true then turn round cry say believe word of making out regular ogre backbiter be of use sha listen to so left miss phoebe in tear locked up in own room lady harriet meanwhile be riding homewards by father side apparently listening to chose to say in reality turning over probability possibility might account for strange interview between molly preston be case of parler de l'ne et l'on en voit le oreilles at turn in road saw preston little way before coming towards on good horse point device in riding attire earl in thread bare coat on old brown cob called out cheerfully aha here preston good day to be just wanting to ask about slip of pasture land on home farm john brickkill want to plough up crop be not two acre at best while be talking over bit of land lady harriet came to resolution a soon a father have finished said mr preston perhaps will allow to ask one two question to relieve mind for be in little perplexity at present illustration lady harriet asks one two question certainly will only be too happy to give information in power moment after have made polite speech recollected molly speech that must refer case to lady harriet letter have be returned affair be now wound up have come off conqueror vanquished surely must never have be so ungenerous a to appeal after there be report about miss gibson current among gossip of hollingford be to congratulate on engagement to young lady ah by way preston ought to have done before interrupted lord cumnor in hasty goodwill daughter said quietly mr preston have not yet told if report be well founded papa looked at with air of person expecting answer expecting truthful answer be not so fortunate replied trying to make horse appear fidgety without incurring observation then may contradict report asked lady harriet quickly be there reason for believing that in time may come true ask because such report if unfounded do harm to young lady keep other sweetheart off put in lord cumnor looking good deal pleased at own discernment lady harriet went on take great interest in miss gibson mr preston saw from manner that be in for a expressed to question be how much how little did know have expectation hope of ever having nearer interest in miss gibson than have at present will be glad if straightforward answer relief ladyship from perplexity must not help touch of insolence accompanied last word be not in word in tone in be spoken in look accompanied be in implied doubt of lady harriet right to question a did there be something of defiance in a well touch of insolence put lady harriet mettle up be not one to check in course for opinion of inferior then sir be aware of injury may do to young lady reputation if meet detain in long conversation when be walking by unaccompanied by one give rise have given rise to report dear harriet be not going too far know mr preston may have intention unacknowledged intention lord have intention with regard to miss gibson may be very worthy young lady have doubt be lady harriet seems determined to push into position can not acknowledge to be be not enviable not pleasant to own be in fact jilted man jilted by miss kirkpatrick after tolerably long engagement interview with miss gibson be not of most agreeable kind a may conclude when tell be believe instigator certainly be agent in last step of miss kirkpatrick be ladyship curiosity with emphasis on last word satisfied with rather mortifying confession of mine harriet dear have gone too far have right to pry into mr preston private affair more have said lady harriet with smile of winning frankness first smile have accorded to mr preston for many long day ever since time year ago when presuming on handsomeness have assumed tone of gallant familiarity with lady harriet paid personal compliment a must have done to equal will excuse hope continued still in gracious manner made feel that now held much higher place in esteem than have have at beginning of interview when learns that busy tongue of hollingford lady have be speaking of friend miss gibson in most unwarrantable manner drawing unjustifiable inference from fact of intercourse with mr preston nature of have just conferred real obligation on by explaining think need hardly request lady harriet to consider explanation of mine a confidential said mr preston of course of course said earl one will understand rode home told wife lady cuxhaven whole conversation between lady harriet mr preston in strictest confidence of course lady harriet have to stand good many stricture on manner proper dignity for few day after however consoled by calling on gibson finding that mr gibson who be still invalid be asleep at time experienced difficulty in carrying off unconscious molly for walk lady harriet so contrived that twice passed through length of principal street of town loitered at grinstead for hour wound up by lady harriet calling on miss browning who to regret be not at home perhaps be a well said after minute consideration will leave card put name down underneath molly molly be little puzzled by manner in have be taken possession of like inanimate chattel for afternoon exclaimed please lady harriet never leave card have not got on miss browning of people why be in out whenever like never mind little one to day will do everything properly according to full etiquette now tell mr gibson to come out to tower for long day will send carriage for whenever will let know that be strong enough to come indeed have better come for few day at time of year doe do for invalid to be out in evening even in carriage so spoke lady harriet standing on white door step at miss browning holding molly hand while wished good by will tell dear that came partly to see that finding asleep ran off with forget about coming to stay with for change of air mamma will like be sure carriage now good by have done good day work better than be aware of continued still addressing molly though latter be quite out of hearing hollingford be not place take to be if doe veer round in miss gibson favour after to day trotting of child about chapter l cynthia at bay mr gibson be slow in recovering strength after influenza before be well enough to accept lady harriet invitation to tower cynthia came home from london if molly have thought manner of departure be scarcely a affectionate considerate a might have be if such thought have crossed molly fancy for instant be repentant for a soon a ever cynthia returned girl met together face to face with old familiar affection going upstairs to drawing room with arm round other waist sitting there together hand in hand cynthia whole manner be more quiet than have be when weight of unpleasant secret rested on mind made alternately despondent flighty after said cynthia there be look of home about room be very pleasant wish must see looking stronger mamma be only unpleasant thing molly why did send for wanted to do began molly must let said mr gibson be much better in london than here for must have done good letter be very agreeable to read now helen be better be nearly well have come home just at right time for everybody be full of charity ball be not going year mamma said cynthia decidedly be on th be be sure will never be well enough to take really seem determined to make out worse than be child said mr gibson rather querulously being one of who when malady be only trifling exaggerate when be really of consequence be unwilling to sacrifice pleasure by acknowledging be well for in instance that husband have wisdom authority enough to forbid going to ball on have set heart consequence of prohibition be increase of domestic plaintiveness low spirit seemed to tell on cynthia bright gay cynthia be often hard work for molly to keep up spirit of two other people a well a own ill health might account for mr gibson despondency why be cynthia so silent not to say so sighing molly be puzzled to account for more perplexed because from time to time cynthia kept calling upon for praise for unknown mysterious virtue that have practised molly be young enough to believe that after exercise of virtue spirit rose cheered up by approving conscience such be not case with cynthia however sometimes said such thing a when have be particularly inert desponding ah molly must let goodness lie fallow for while have borne wonderful crop year have be so pretty behaved if knew really molly virtue must come down from cloud be strained to utmost in london find be like kite after soaring aloft for time suddenly come down get tangled in sort of briar bramble thing be allegory unless can bring to believe in extraordinary goodness while be away giving sort of right to fall foul of mamma briar bramble now molly have have experience of cynthia whim of perpetually hinting at mystery did not mean to reveal in mr preston day although be occasionally piqued into curiosity cynthia allusion at something more in background fell in general on rather deaf ear one day mystery burst shell came out in shape of offer made to cynthia by mr henderson refused under circumstance molly must not appreciate heroic goodness so often alluded to revelation of secret at last took place in way mr gibson breakfasted in bed have done so ever since have have influenza consequently own private letter always went up on breakfast tray one morning came into drawing room earlier than usual with open letter in hand have have letter from aunt kirkpatrick cynthia sends dividend uncle be so busy what doe mean by cynthia holding out letter to with certain paragraph indicated by finger cynthia put netting on one side looked at writing suddenly face turned scarlet then became of deadly white looked at molly a if to gain courage from strong serene countenance mean mamma may a well tell at once mr henderson offered to while be in london refused refused never told let hear by chance really cynthia think be very unkind pray what made refuse mr henderson fine young man gentleman uncle told have very good private fortune besides mamma do forget have promised to marry roger hamley said cynthia quietly of course how can with molly always dinning word 'engagement ' into ear really when one considers uncertainty after be not distinct promise seemed almost a if might have looked forward to something of sort of what sort mamma said cynthia sharply why of more eligible offer must have known might change mind meet with one liked better so little a have seen of world cynthia made impatient movement a if to stop mother never said liked better how can talk so mamma be going to marry roger there be end of will not be spoken to about again got up left room going to marry roger be very fine who be to guarantee coming back alive if doe what have to marry upon must like to know wish to have accepted mr henderson though be sure liked true love ought to have course not be thwarted need not have quite finally refused until well until have seen how matter turn out such invalid a be too have given quite palpitation at heart do call quite unfeeling of cynthia certainly began molly then remembered that stepmother be far from strong unable to bear protest in favour of right course without irritation so changed speech into suggestion of remedy for palpitation curbed impatience to speak out indignation at contemplated falsehood to roger when be alone cynthia began upon subject molly be le merciful cynthia said well molly now know have be longing to tell yet somehow must not suppose be repetition of mr coxe said molly gravely be agreeable took for something more know sighed cynthia mean know if be agreeable not be very kind very pleasant did not expect to end a did however be of use thinking of said molly simply for to mind pleasantest kindest person in world put in comparison with roger be a nothing stood by cynthia next word did not come very soon be on different subject spoken in rather pettish tone did allude again in jesting sadness to late effort at virtue in little while mr gibson be able to accept often repeated invitation from tower to go stay there for day two lady harriet told that must be kindness to lady cumnor to come bear company in life of seclusion latter be still compelled to lead mr gibson be flattered gratified with dim unconscious sense of being really wanted not merely deluding into pleasing fiction lady cumnor be in state of convalescence common to many invalid spring of life have begun again to flow with flow returned old desire project plan have become mere matter of indifference during worst part of illness a yet bodily strength be not sufficient to be agent to energetic mind difficulty of driving ill matched pair of body will one weak languid other strong stern made ladyship often very irritable mr gibson be not quite strong enough for souffre douleur visit to tower be not on whole quite so happy one a have anticipated lady cuxhaven lady harriet aware of mother state of health temper only alluding to a slightly a be absolutely necessary in conversation with other took care not to leave clare too long with lady cumnor several time when one other went to relieve guard found clare in tear lady cumnor holding forth

deathly silence opened door squire be sitting alone at side of bed holding dead man hand looking straight before at vacancy did not stir move even so much a eyelid at molly entrance truth have entered soul before knew that doctor be ever so cunning must with striving put breath into body again molly came up to with softest step most hushed breath that ever must did not speak for did not know what

almost overturning basin molly held by passionate gesture a pointed to bed will never eat again never then threw across corpse wept in such terrible manner molly trembled lest also must die must break heart there then took more notice of word of tear of presence than did of of moon looking through unclosed window with passionless stare father stood by before of be aware go downstairs molly said gravely stroked head tenderly a rose go into dining room now felt reaction from self control trembled with fear a went along moonlit passage seemed to a if must meet osborne hear explained how came to die what now felt thought wished to do did get down to dining room last few step with rush of terror senseless terror of what might be behind there found supper laid out candle lit robinson bustling about decanting wine wanted to cry to get into quiet place weep away over excitement must hardly do so there only felt very much tired to care for nothing in world more vividness of life came back when found robinson holding glass to lip a sat in great leather easy chair to have gone instinctively a to place of rest drink miss be good old madeira papa said a how be to eat bit say bey daughter may have to stay here mr robinson be young for work persuade to eat something will break down utterly be very word molly did not say anything have not energy enough for resistance drank ate at old

letter molly doubted if mother must consent so easily a squire seemed to expect to be parted from child letter be not very wise perhaps though of molly never thought heart full of love spoke tender word in line still be not for molly to talk of doubt of hers just then rather to dwell on probable grace charm of little roger stephen osborne hamley let squire exhaust in wondering a to particular of event helping out in conjecture of from imperfect knowledge of possibility made most curious fantastic improbable guess at truth so that day passed over night came there be not many people who have claim to be invited to funeral of mr gibson squire hereditary man of business have taken charge when mr gibson came early on following morning molly referred question to have suggested to mind though apparently not to squire what intimation of loss must be sent to widow living solitary near winchester watching waiting if not for coming who lay dead in distant home at least for letter one from have already come in foreign handwriting to post office to communication be usually sent of course at hall knew nothing of must be told said mr gibson musing must replied daughter how day two of waiting

to cynthia dismissal of roger indeed be quite a well for of though of course will be long time before think so be not suited to other poor roger be hard work writing to yesterday who know what may

be sent off molly heart began to bleed for poor creature bereft of husband in foreign land at distance from dead buried without ever having have chance of printing dear feature on memory by one last long lingering look with thought full of unknown aime molly talked much about day to squire must listen for ever to conjecture however wild about grandchild perpetually winced away from discourse about frenchwoman a called not unkindly to mind be simply frenchwoman chattering dark eyed demonstrative possibly even rouged must treat with respect a son widow must try even not to think upon female inveiglement in believed must make allowance to extent of duty hoped trusted might never be called upon to see solicitor gibson anybody everybody must be called upon to form phalanx of defence against danger time little young grey eyed woman be making way not towards towards dead son whom a yet believed to be living husband knew be acting in defiance of expressed wish have never dismayed with expression of own fear about health bright with life have never contemplated death coming to fetch away one so beloved be ill very ill letter from strange girl said that aime have nursed parent knew what illness be french doctor have praised skill neat handedness a nurse even if have be clumsiest of woman be not husband be not wife whose place be by pillow so without even a much reasoning a have

aime spoke to food bread milk for baby when brought food only shrank away turned face to wall without word in hurry child have be left with robinson squire for unknown most fortunate reason took dislike to robinson red face hoarse voice showed most decided preference for grandfather when molly came down found squire feeding child with more of peace upon face than there have be for day boy be now then leaving off taking bread milk to show dislike to robinson by word gesture proceeding only amused old servant while highly delighted more favoured squire be lying very still will neither speak

extorted from short answer at first then longer one from time to time plied with little drop of wine until further nourishment must be at hand molly be struck by father low tone of comfort sympathy although must not follow what be said quickly enough to catch meaning of what passed by by however when father have done that must be once more downstairs told more about journey than yet knew hurry sense of acting in defiance of prohibition over mastering anxiety broken night fatigue of journey have ill prepared for shock at last mr gibson be seriously alarmed for consequence have wandered

carte blanche engaged two efficient hospital nurse to watch over unconscious aime molly be needed to receive finer direction a to treatment diet be not that be wanted for care of little boy squire be too jealous of child exclusive love for one of housemaid be employed in actual physical charge of needed one to listen to incontinence of language when passionate regret for dead son came uppermost also when have discovered extraordinary charm in son child again when be oppressed with uncertainty of aime long continued illness molly be not so good so bewitching listener to ordinary conversation a cynthia where heart be interested sympathy be deep unfailing in case only wished that squire must really feel that aime be not encumbrance evidently considered to be not that must have acknowledged

to leave hall until be perfectly strong when one be even contemplating remotest chance of leaving child excepting only molly once twice asked father if might not speak to squire represent hardship of sending away improbability that must consent to quit boy so on mr gibson only replied wait quietly time enough when nature circumstance have have chance have failed be well that molly be such favourite with old servant for have frequently to restrain to control to be sure have father authority to back be aware that where own comfort ease pleasure be concerned never interfered submitted to will if squire have known of want of attendance to submitted with most perfect meekness a far a be only sufferer must have gone into towering rage molly hardly thought of so anxious be to do must for

have sent blood out coursing at full gallop cynthia mr henderson have come in sight eagerly talking to a bent forward to look into face look half averted in pretty shyness be evidently coquetting about flower must not give must not take just then for lover have emerged from shrubbery into comparatively public life maria be seen approaching apparently have feminine tact enough to induce cynthia

rain be altogether gloomy day for august there be small fire of scented wood burning cheerfully in sitting room appropriated to high up commanded wide pleasant view over park from must be seen spire

many year standing to cousin lady harriet who did not care for in least although be marriage very earnestly desired for by mother lady harriet be however on friendly term with ordered about told what to do what to leave undone without having even doubt a to willingness of obedience have given cue about molly now charles girl want to be interested amused without having to take trouble for herself be too delicate to be very active in mind body just look after when house get full place where can hear see everything everybody without fuss responsibility so sir charles began day at luncheon by taking molly under quiet protection did not say much to what did say be thoroughly friendly sympathetic molly began a lady harriet intended that must to have kind of pleasant reliance upon then in evening while rest of family be at dinner after molly tea hour of quiet repose parkes came dressed in of new clothes prepared for kirkpatrick visit did hair in new pretty way so that when molly looked at in cheval glass scarcely knew elegant reflection to be that of be fetched down by lady harriet into great long formidable drawing room a interminable place of pacing have haunted dream ever since childhood at further end sat lady cumnor at tapestry work light of fire candle seemed concentrated on one bright part where presently lady harriet made tea lord cumnor went to sleep sir charles read passage aloud from edinburgh review to three lady at work when molly went to bed be constrained to admit that staying at tower a visitor be rather pleasant than otherwise tried to reconcile old impression with new one until fell asleep there be comparatively quiet day before expected guest began to arrive in evening lady harriet took molly drive in little pony carriage for first time for many week molly began to feel delightful spring of returning health dance of youthful spirit in fresh air cleared by previous day rain chapter lviii reviving hope brightening prospect if can without fatigue dear do come down to dinner to day will then see people one by one a appear instead of having to encounter crowd of stranger hollingford will be here too hope will find pleasant so molly made appearance at dinner that day got to know by sight at least of most distinguished of visitor at tower next day be thursday cynthia wedding day bright fine in country whatever might be in london there be several letter from home people awaiting molly when came downstairs to late breakfast for day hour be gaining strength health be unwilling to continue invalid habit longer than be necessary looked so much better that sir charles noticed to lady harriet several of visitor spoke of morning a very pretty lady like graceful girl be thursday on friday a lady harriet have told visitor from more immediate neighbourhood be expected to stay over sunday have not mentioned name when molly went down into drawing room before dinner be almost startled by perceiving roger hamley in centre of group of gentleman who be talking together eagerly a seemed to making object of attention made hitch in conversation lost precise meaning of question addressed to answered rather hastily made way to where molly be sitting little behind lady harriet have heard that be staying at tower be almost a much surprised by hers a be by unexpected appearance for have only seen once twice since return from africa then in guise of invalid now in pretty evening dress with hair beautifully dressed delicate complexion flushed little with timidity yet movement manner bespeaking quiet ease roger hardly recognized although acknowledged identity began to feel that admiring deference most young men experience when conversing with very pretty girl sort of desire to obtain good opinion in manner very different to old familiar friendliness be annoyed when sir charles whose especial charge still be came up to take in to dinner must not quite understand smile of mutual intelligence passed between two being aware of lady harriet plan of sheltering molly from necessity of talking acting in conformity with wish a much a with own roger found puzzling watching from time to time during dinner again in evening sought out found again pre occupied with one of young men staying in house who have have advantage of two day of mutual interest acquaintance with daily event joke anxiety of family circle molly must not help wishing to break off trivial talk to make room for roger have so much to ask about everything at hall be have be stranger to for last two month more though wanted to speak to other more than to one else in room so happened that everything seemed to conspire to prevent lord hollingford carried off roger to cluster of middle aged men be wanted to give opinion upon scientific subject mr ernulphus watson young man referred to above kept place by molly a prettiest girl in room almost dazed by never ceasing flow of clever small talk looked so tired pale at last that ever watchful lady harriet sent sir charles to rescue after few word with lady harriet roger saw molly quietly leave room sentence two heard lady harriet address to cousin made know that be for night sentence might bear interpretation than obvious one really charles considering that be in charge think might have saved from chatter patter of mr watson can only stand when be in strongest health why be molly in sir charles charge why then roger remembered many little thing might serve to confirm fancy have got into head went to bed puzzled annoyed seemed to incongruous hastily got up sort of engagement if engagement really be on saturday be more fortunate have long tte tte in most public place in house on sofa in hall where molly be resting at lady harriet command before going upstairs after walk roger be passing through saw came to standing before making pretence of playing with gold fish in great marble basin close at hand be very unlucky said wanted to get near last night be quite impossible be

not at according to molly primitive home keeping notion made answer must like very much time must go home first will want more than ever now again felt touching on sore subject stopped short roger became annoyed at so constantly conjecturing what must be feeling on subject of cynthia marriage with sympathetic perception have discerned that idea must give pain perhaps also knew that must dislike to show pain have not presence of mind ready wit to give skilful turn to conversation annoyed roger must hardly tell why determined to take metaphorical bull by horn until be done footing with molly

deal to consult about separated then molly went upstairs very happy very full warm at heart be so pleasant to have roger talking to in way like friend have once thought that must never look upon great brown bearded celebrity in former light of almost brotherly intimacy now be coming right there be opportunity for renewed confidence afternoon molly went quiet decorous drive a fourth with two dowager one spinster be very pleasant to think that must see again at dinner again to morrow on sunday evening a be sitting loitering on lawn before dinner roger went on with what have to say about position of sister in law in father house mutual bond between mother grandfather being child who be also through jealousy bone of contention severance there be many little detail to be given in order to make molly quite understand difficulty of situation on side young man girl became absorbed in what be talking about wandered away into shade of long avenue lady harriet separated from group came up to lord

child torture of dismay forlornness with new fresh conception have gained health have have pleasure faint fragrance of new unacknowledged hope have stolen into life wonder that mr gibson be struck with improvement in look mr gibson impressed with increased grace ah molly said be really wonderful to see what little good society will do for girl even week of association with such people a one meet with at tower be a somebody said of lady of rank whose name have forgotten ' polite education in there be something quite different about je ne sais quoi must tell at once that have be mingling with aristocracy with charm be what darling cynthia wanted not that mr henderson thought so for more devoted lover can hardly be conceived absolutely bought parure of diamond be obliged to say to have studied to preserve simplicity of taste that must not corrupt with too much luxury be rather disappointed at going off without maid be one blemish in arrangement spot in sun dear cynthia when think of do assure molly make nightly prayer that may be able to find just such husband time have never told who met at tower molly ran over list of name roger hamley came last upon word that young man be pushing way up hamleys be far older family than cumnors said molly flushing up now molly ca have democratic rank be great distinction be quite enough to have dear papa with democratic tendency wo begin to quarrel now that be left alone ought to be bosom friend hope will be roger hamley did not say much about unfortunate little osborne hamley suppose on contrary say father dotes on child seemed very proud of thought squire must be getting very much infatuated with something daresay french mother take care of why have scarcely taken notice of for month more before that be everything be about six week since cynthia engagement have become publicly known that might have have something to do with squire desertion molly thought said squire have sent invitation to go stay there next week if have objection mamma seem to want companion for mr osborne hamley who be not very strong can hardly tell what to say like having to associate with frenchwoman of doubtful rank ca bear thought of losing child only daughter now did ask helen kirkpatrick ca come for time house be going to be altered papa have consented to build room at last for cynthia mr henderson will of course come see will have many more visitor expect bedroom will make capital lumber room maria want week holiday be always so unwilling to put obstacle in way of one pleasure weakly unwilling believe certainly must be very convenient to have out of house for few day so for once will waive own wish for companionship plead cause with papa miss browning came to call hear double batch of news mr goodenough have called very day on have returned from miss hornblower to tell astounding fact of molly gibson having gone on visit to tower not to come back at night to sleep there to be there for two three day just a if be young lady of quality so miss browning came to hear detail of wedding from mr gibson history of molly visit at tower a well mr gibson did not like divided interest of old jealousy of molly intimacy at tower have returned now molly said miss browning let hear how behaved among great folk must not be set up with attention remember that pay to for good father sake molly be think quite aware put in mr gibson in most soft languid tone owes privilege of visiting at house to lady cumnor kind desire to set mind quite at liberty at time of cynthia marriage a soon a ever have returned home molly came back indeed must not have thought right to let intrude upon kindness beyond what be absolutely necessary molly felt extremely uncomfortable at though perfectly aware of entire inaccuracy of statement well molly said miss browning never mind whether went there on own merit worthy father merit mr gibson merit tell what did when be there so molly began account of saying doings must have made far more interesting to miss browning miss phoebe if have not be conscious of stepmother critical listening have to tell with mental squint surest way to spoil narration be also subject to mr gibson perpetual correction of little statement knew to be fact what vexed most of be mr gibson last speech before miss browning left molly have fallen into rambling way with visit of hers of make so much a if nobody have ever be in great house be going to hamley hall next week getting quite dissipated in fact yet to mr goodenough next caller on same errand of congratulation mr gibson tone be quite different there have always be tacit antagonism between two conversation now ran a follows mr goodenough began well mr gibson suppose must wish joy of miss cynthia marriage must condole with mother a have lost daughter be not one of sort reckon now a mr gibson be not quite sure to sort of mother greatest credit be to be attached found little difficult how to frame reply dear cynthia said one ca rejoice in happiness yet ended sentence by sighing ay be young woman a must always have follower for to tell truth be a pretty creature a ever saw in life more needed skilful guidance be sure for one be a glad a can be be done so well by folk say mr henderson have handsome private fortune over above what make by law there be fear that cynthia will have everything world can give said mr gibson with dignity well well be always bit of favourite of mine a be saying to grand daughter there for be accompanied by young lady who looked keenly to prospect of wedding cake be never one of who ran down called flirt jilt be glad to hear be like to be so well off now suppose will be turning mind to doing something for miss molly there if mean by doing anything can by hastening marriage deprive of company of one who be like own child be very much mistaken mr goodenough pray remember be last person in world to match make cynthia made mr henderson acquaintance at uncle in london ay thought cousin be very often ill needing nursing be very keen must be of use be not saying what be right in mother be only putting in word for miss molly thank mr goodenough said molly half angry half laughing when want to be married will not trouble mamma will look out for molly be becoming so popular hardly know how will keep at home said mr gibson miss sadly a said to mr gibson let young people have change see little of world while be young have be great advantage to being at tower while so many clever distinguished people be there can already see difference in tone of conversation elevation in choice of subject now be going to hamley hall can assure feel quite proud mother when see how be sought after other daughter cynthia writing such letter from paris thing be deal changed since day for sure said mr goodenough so perhaps be judge when be married first went in postchaise to father house matter of twenty mile off at outside sate down to a good supper amongst friend relation a 'd wish to see be first wedding jaunt second be when better knowed worth a bride thought that now never must see london be reckoned very extravagant sort of body to go so far spend money though harry have left uncommon well off now young folk go off to paris think nothing of cost be well if wilful waste make woeful want before die be thankful somewhat be being done for miss molly chance a said afore be not quite what must have liked to have done for annabella though time be changed a said just now chapter lix molly gibson at hamley conversation ended there for time wedding cake wine be brought in be molly duty to serve out last word of mr goodenough tingled in ear tried to interpret to own satisfaction in way obvious one that too be destined to be confirmed for directly after mr goodenough took leave mr gibson desired molly to carry away tray to table close to open corner window where thing might be placed in readiness for future caller underneath open went path from house door to road molly heard goodenough saying to grand daughter mr gibson be deep 'un there be mr roger hamley a like a not to have hall estate sends molly visiting then passed out of hearing molly must have burst out cry with full sudden conviction of what mr goodenough have be alluding to sense of impropriety of molly going to visit at hall when roger be at home to be sure mr goodenough be commonplace unrefined woman mr gibson did not seem to have even noticed allusion mr gibson took all a matter of course molly must go to hall a simply now a have done before roger have spoken of in so straightforward manner a showed have conception of being impropriety visit visit until now so happy subject of anticipation molly felt a if must never speak to one of idea to mr goodenough word have given rise a if must never be first to suggest notion of impropriety presupposed what blushed to think of then tried to comfort by reasoning if have be wrong forward indelicate really improper in slightest degree who must have be so ready a father to put veto upon reasoning be of use after mr goodenough word have put fancy into molly head more bade fancy begone more answered a daniel o'rourke did man in moon when bade dan get off seat on sickle go into empty space more ye ask more wo stir one may smile at young girl misery of kind be very real stinging misery to molly must do be to resolve on single eye to dear old squire mental bodily comfort to try heal up breach might have occurred between aime to ignore roger a much a possible good roger kind roger dear roger must be very hard to avoid a much a be consistent with common politeness must be right to do when be with must be a natural a possible might observe difference what be natural how much ought avoid being with must even notice if be more chary of company more calculating of word ala simplicity of intercourse be spoilt henceforwards made law for resolved to devote to squire to aime to forget mr goodenough foolish speech perfect freedom be gone with half chance be to say half chance must have be lost over stranger who have not known before must probably have thought stiff awkward apt to say thing then retract be so different from usual self roger noticed change in a soon a arrived at hall have carefully measured out day of visit be to be exactly same number a have spent at tower feared lest if stayed at hall shorter time squire might be annoyed yet how charming place looked in early autumnal glow a drove up there be roger at hall door waiting to receive watching for coming now retreated apparently to summon sister in law who came now timidly forward in deep widow mourning holding boy in arm a if to protect shyness struggled down ran towards carriage eager to greet friend coachman to obtain promised ride roger did not say much wanted to make aime feel place a daughter of house be too timid to speak much only took molly by hand led into drawing room where a if by sudden impulse of gratitude for tender nursing have received during illness put arm round molly kissed long well after came to be friend be nearly lunch time squire always made appearance at meal more for pleasure of seeing grandson eat dinner than for hunger of own to day molly quickly saw whole state of family affair thought that even have roger said nothing about at tower must have seen that father daughter in law have a yet found clue to other character although have now be living for several month in same house aime seemed to forget english in nervousness to watch with jealous eye of dissatisfied mother proceeding of squire towards little boy be not of wisest kind must be owned child sipped strong ale with evident relish clamoured for everything saw others enjoying aime must hardly attend to molly for anxiety a to what boy be doing eating yet said nothing roger took end of table opposite to at sat grandfather grandchild after boy first want be gratified squire addressed to molly well so can come here visiting though have be among grand folk thought be going to cut miss molly when heard be gone to tower must find other place to stay at while father mother be away earl eh asked went said molly now have asked have come here think might have known 'd be always welcome here without waiting for asking why molly look upon a kind of daughter more than madam there dropping voice little perhaps supposing that child babble must drown signification of word nay need look at so pitifully doe follow english readily think doe said molly in low voice not looking up however for fear of catching glimpse at aime sudden forlornness of expression deepened colour felt grateful a if for personal favour when heard roger speaking to aime moment afterwards in tender tone of brotherly friendliness presently two be sufficiently engaged in separate conversation to allow molly squire to go on talking be sturdy chap be said squire stroking little roger curly head can puff four puff at grandpapa pipe without being sick ca s'ant puff more puff said boy resolutely mamma say ' s'ant be just like said squire dropping voice time however a if must do child harm molly made point of turning conversation from personal subject after kept squire talking about progress of drainage during rest of lunch offered to take to see acceded to proposal thinking meantime how little need have anticipated being thrown too intimately with roger who seemed to devote to sister in law in evening when aime have gone upstairs to put boy to bed squire be asleep in easy chair sudden flush of memory brought goodenough word again to mind be virtually tte tte with roger a have be dozen of time before now must not help assuming air of constraint eye did not meet in old frank way took up book at pause in conversation left puzzled annoyed at change in manner so went on during time of visit if sometimes forgot let go into old naturalness by by checked became comparatively cold reserved roger be pained at more pained day after day more anxious to discover cause aime too silently noticed how different molly became in roger presence one day must not help saying to molly like roger must if only knew how good be be learned be nothing be goodness that one admires love be very good said molly have known long enough to know think agreeable be not like poor husband to be sure knew well too ah tell about once again when first knew when mother be alive molly have grown very fond of aime when latter be at ease have very charming attaching way feeling uneasy in position in squire house be almost repellent to too put on worst side to roger be most anxious to bring together have several consultation with molly a to best mean of accomplishing end a long a talked upon subject spoke to in quiet sensible manner inherited from father when discussion on point be ended fell back into piquant assumption of dignified reserve be very difficult for to maintain strange manner especially when once twice fancied that gave pain must go into own room suddenly burst into tear on occasion wish that visit be ended that be once again in eventless tranquillity of own home yet presently fancy changed clung to swiftly passing hour a if must still retain happiness of for unknown to roger be exerting to make visit pleasant be not willing to appear a instigator of little plan for day for felt a if somehow did not hold same place in regard a formerly still one day aime suggested nutting expedition day gave little roger unheard of pleasure of tea out of door there be something else agreeable for third be roger who arranged simple pleasure such a knew molly must enjoy to only appeared a ready forwarder of aime device week be nearly gone when one morning squire found roger sitting in old library with book before be true so deep in thought that be evidently startled by father unexpected entrance thought must find thee here lad will have old room done up again before winter smell musty enough yet see be place for thee want thee to go with round five acre be thinking of laying down in grass be time for to be getting into fresh air look quite wobegone over book book book there never be thing like for stealing man health out of so roger went out with father without saying many word till be at distance from house then brought out sentence with such abruptness that repaid father for start latter have given quarter of hour before father remember be going out again to cape next month spoke of doing up library if be for will be away winter ca get off pleaded father thought maybe 'd forgotten about not likely said roger half smiling well might have found man to finish up work one can finish besides engagement be engagement when wrote to lord hollingford to tell must come home promised to go out again for six month ay know perhaps will put out of thy mind will always be hard on to part from thee daresay be best for roger colour deepened be alluding to to miss kirkpatrick mr henderson mean father let tell once for think that be

for instant be on point of pretending to misunderstand at length however said in low voice will never try father let talk more about a said before be too late squire be like child to whom toy have be refused from time to time thought of disappointment in matter recurred to mind then took to blaming cynthia a primary cause of roger present indifference to womankind so happened that on molly last morning at hall received first letter from cynthia mr henderson be just before breakfast time roger be out of door aime have not a yet come down molly be alone in dining room where table be already laid have just finished reading letter when squire came in immediately joyfully told what morning have brought to when saw squire face must have bitten tongue out for having named cynthia name to

offence to either lassie know love wench if will take old man word be worth score of wish young men must think so too muttered a went to side table to carve ham while molly poured out tea heart very hot time effectually silenced for space be with greatest difficulty that must keep tear of mortification from falling felt altogether in wrong position in house have be like home to until last visit what with mr goodenough remark now speech of squire implying at least to susceptible imagination that father have proposed a wife to roger that have be rejected be more glad than must express even think that be going home very morning roger came in from walk while be in state of feeling saw in instant that something have distressed molly longed to have old friendly right of asking what be have effectually kept at too great distance during last few day for to feel at liberty to speak to in old straightforward brotherly way especially now when perceived effort to conceal feeling way in drank tea in feverish haste accepted bread only to crumble about plate untouched be that must do to make talk under circumstance backed up effort a well a must until aime came down grave anxious boy have not have good night did not seem well have fallen into feverish sleep now must not have left immediately whole table be in ferment squire pushed away plate must eat more roger be trying to extract detail fact out of aime who began to give way to tear molly quickly proposed that carriage have be ordered to take home at eleven must come round immediately have everything ready packed up said bring back father at once by leaving directly said be probable might catch after have returned from morning visit in town before have set off on more distant round proposal be agreed to went upstairs to put on thing came down ready into drawing room expecting to find aime squire there during absence word have be brought to anxious mother grandfather that child have wakened up in panic have rushed up to darling roger be in drawing room awaiting molly with large bunch of choicest flower look molly said a be on point of leaving room again on finding there alone gathered flower for before breakfast came to meet reluctant advance thank said be very kind be very much obliged to then must do something for said determined not to notice restraint of manner making re arrangement of flower held sort of link between so that must not follow impulse leave room tell honestly a know will if speak at have done something to vex since be so happy at tower together voice be so kind true manner so winning yet wistful that molly must have be thankful to tell believed that must have helped more than one to understand how ought to behave rightly must have disentangled fancy if only have not lain at very core centre of perplexity dismay how must tell of mr goodenough word troubling maiden modesty how must ever repeat what father have said that morning assure that more than wished that old friendliness must be troubled by thought of nearer relationship never vexed in whole life roger said looking straight at for first time for many day believe because say so have right to ask further molly will give back one of flower a pledge of what have said take whichever like said eagerly offering whole nosegay to choose from must choose must give just then squire came in roger must have be glad if molly have not gone on so eagerly to ransack bunch for choicest flower in father presence exclaimed oh please mr hamley do know be roger favourite flower rose daresay carriage be at door molly dear want to hurry know here roger here be rose red a rose be will find papa a soon a ever get home how be little boy be afraid be beginning of kind of fever squire took to carriage talking way of little boy roger following hardly heeding what be doing in answer to question kept asking too late not can ever forget that first foolish love be given to one so different while a carriage rolled away kept saying to herself be friend again believe will remember what dear squire took into head to suggest for many day be so pleasant to be on old term again what lovely flower chapter lx roger hamley confession roger have great deal to think of a turned away from looking after carriage a long a must be seen day before have believed that molly have come to view symptom of growing love for symptom thought have be so patent a disgusting inconstancy to inconstant cynthia that have felt that attachment must be so soon transferred to be not worth having that have desired to mark by changed treatment of so to nip in bud morning old sweet frank manner have returned in last interview at rate puzzled hard to find out what must have distressed at breakfast time even went so far a to ask robinson whether miss gibson have received letter that morning when heard that have have one tried to believe that letter be in way cause of sorrow so far so good be friend again after unspoken difference be not enough for roger felt day more more certain that alone must make happy have felt have partly given up hope while father have be urging upon very course most desired to take need for trying to love said to be already done yet be very jealous on behalf be that love worthy of have once be given to cynthia be not affair too much mocking mimicry of last again just on point of leaving england for considerable time if followed now to own home in very drawing room where have once offered to cynthia then by strong resolve determined on course be friend now kissed rose be pledge of friendship if went to africa ran deadly chance knew better what be now than have done when went before until return must not even attempt to win more of love than already have once safe home again weak fancy a to what might might not be answer must prevent running chance to gain woman who be to one who excelled be not poor vanity think more of possible mortification of refusal than of precious jewel of bride may be won somehow please god to send back safe must put fate to touch till then must be patient be no longer boy to rush at coveted object be man capable of judging abiding molly sent father a soon a must find to hall then sate down to old life in home drawing room where missed cynthia bright presence at turn mr gibson be in rather querulous mood fastened upon injury of cynthia letter being addressed to molly not to herself considering trouble have with trousseau think might have written to did first letter be to mamma said molly real thought still intent upon hall upon sick child upon roger begging for flower yes just first letter three page long with account of crossing while to can write about fashion how bonnet be worn in paris sort of interesting thing poor mother must never expect confidential letter have found that out may see letter mamma said molly there be really nothing in to think of writing crossing to who value while poor heart be yearning after lost child really life be somewhat hard to bear at time then there be silence for while do tell something about visit molly be roger very heart broken doe talk much about cynthia no doe not mention often hardly ever think never thought have much feeling if have have must not have let go so easily see how must help when came to see after return be already engaged to mr henderson have come down very day said molly with perhaps more heat than occasion required poor head said mr gibson putting hand up to head one may see have be stopping with people of robust health excuse saying molly of friend of unrefined habit have got to talk in so loud voice do remember head molly so roger have quite forgotten cynthia have oh what inconstant creature men be will be falling in love with grandee next mark word be making pet lion of be just kind of weak young man to have head turned by to propose to fine lady of rank who must no more think of marrying than of marrying footman think be likely said molly stoutly roger be too sensible for anything of kind be just fault always found with sensible cold hearted now be kind of character may be very valuable revolt give warmth of heart even with little of extravagance of feeling misleads judgment conduct into romance poor mr kirkpatrick be just character used to tell that love for be quite romantic think have told about walking five mile in rain to get muffin once when be ill yes said molly be very kind of so imprudent too just what one of sensible cold hearted commonplace people must never have thought of doing with cough hope did suffer for replied molly anxious at cost to keep off subject of hamleys upon stepmother always disagreed on found difficult to keep temper yes indeed did think ever got over cold caught that day wish have known molly sometimes wonder what must have happened if have be real daughter cynthia dear papa mr kirkpatrick own dear mother have lived people talk good deal about natural affinity must have be question for philosopher began to think on impossibility have suggested wonder how poor little boy be said molly after pause speaking out thought poor little child when one think how little prolonged existence be to be desired one feel that death must be boon mamma what do mean asked molly much shocked why one care for life a most precious thing have never seen be bonniest sweetest little fellow can be what do mean must have thought that squire must have desired better born heir than offspring of servant with idea about descent blood family must have thought that be little mortifying to roger who must naturally have looked upon a brother heir to find little interloping child half french half english stepping into shoe know how fond be of squire look upon a apple of eye molly molly pray let hear using such vulgar expression when will teach true refinement refinement consists in never even thinking vulgar commonplace thing proverb idiom be never used by people of education 'apple of eye ' be really shocked well mamma be very sorry after what wanted to say a strongly a must be that squire love little boy a much a own child that roger oh what shame to think that roger stopped suddenly short a if be choked wonder at indignation dear said mr gibson be just what must have felt at age one learns baseness of human nature with advancing year be wrong though to undeceive so early depend upon thought alluded to have crossed roger hamley mind sort of thought cross one mind depends upon whether one give harbour encouragement said molly dear if must have last word let be truism let talk on more interesting subject asked cynthia to buy silk gown in paris said must send word what colour fixed upon think dark blue be most becoming to complexion what do say molly agreed sooner than take trouble of thinking about thing at be far too full of silent review of trait in roger character have lately come under notice gave lie direct to stepmother supposition just then heard mr gibson step downstairs be time before made entrance into room where be sitting how be little roger said molly eagerly beginning with scarlet fever be afraid be well left when did molly have never have must stop up intercourse with hall for time if there be one illness dread be go come back to papa yes always take plenty of precaution however need to talk about risk lie in way of one duty be unnecessary risk that must avoid will have badly asked molly ca tell will do best for wee laddie whenever mr gibson feeling be touched be apt to recur to language of youth molly knew now that be much interested in case for day there be imminent danger to little boy for week there be more chronic form of illness to contend with when immediate danger be over warm daily interest be past molly began to realize that from strict quarantine father evidently thought necessary to establish between two house be not likely to see roger again before departure for africa oh if have made more of uncared for day that have passed with at hall worse than uncared for day on have avoided refused to converse freely with given pain by change of manner for have read in eye heard in voice that have be perplexed pained now imagination dwelt on exaggerated expression of tone look one evening after dinner father said a country people say have done stroke of work to day roger hamley have laid head together have made plan by mr osborne boy will leave hall what did say other day molly said mr gibson interrupting giving molly look of extreme intelligence go into lodging at jennings farm not four hundred yard from park field gate continued mr gibson squire daughter in law have got to be much better friend over little fellow sick bed think see now how impossible must be for mother to leave child go be happy in france have be notion running in head time to buy off in fact that one night when be very uncertain whether must bring through took to cry together condoling with other be just like tearing down curtain have be between have be rather friend than otherwise ever since still roger molly cheek grew warm eye soft bright be such pleasure to hear name agree that mother know much better how to manage boy than grandfather doe suppose be one good thing got from hard hearted mistress of hers certainly have be well trained in management of child make impatient annoyed unhappy when see squire giving child nut ale sort of silly indulgence spoiling in possible way yet be coward doe speak out mind now by being in lodging having own servant nice pretty room be too went to see mr jennings promise to attend well to mr osborne hamley be very much honoured sort of thing not ten minute walk from hall too so that little chap may easily go backwards forward a often a like yet may keep control over child discipline diet in short think have done good day work continued stretching little then with shake rousing making ready to go out again to see patient who have sent for in absence good day work repeated to a ran downstairs know when have be so happy for have not told molly have passed between roger roger have begun fresh subject of conversation just a mr gibson be hastening away from hall after completing new arrangement for aime child know that set off next tuesday mr gibson said roger little abruptly to be sure hope will be a successful in scientific object a be last time have sorrow awaiting when come back thank yes hope so think there be danger of infection now do if disease be to spread through household think must have have sign of before now one be never sure remember with scarlet fever roger be silent for minute two must be afraid said at length of seeing at house thank think must rather decline pleasure of society there at present be only three week month since child began besides will be over here again before go be always on guard against symptom of dropsy have known supervene then will not see molly again said roger in tone with look of great disappointment mr gibson turned keen observant eye upon young man looked at in a penetrating manner a if have be beginning with unknown illness then doctor father compressed lip gave vent to long intelligent whistle whew said roger bronzed cheek took deeper shade will take message to from wo message of farewell pleaded not be not going to be message carrier between young man young woman will tell womenkind forbade to come near house that be sorry to go away without bidding good by be will say disapprove see guess why oh mr gibson just speak to one word of what must be in heart though be pretending not to understand why must give world to see molly again before go dear boy said mr gibson more affected than liked to show laying hand on roger shoulder then pulled up said gravely enough mind molly be not cynthia if be to care for be not one who must transfer love to next comer mean not a readily a have done replied roger only wish must know what different feeling be to boyish love for cynthia be thinking of when spoke however a might have remembered afterwards that be not model of constancy let hear what have to say for not much did love cynthia very much manner beauty bewitched letter short hurried letter sometimes showing that really have taken trouble to read mine through can not tell pain gave twelve month solitude in frequent danger of one life face to face with death sometimes age man like many year experience still longed for time when must see sweet face again hear speak then letter at cape still hoped know how found when went to have interview trusted might end in renewal of relation engaged to mr henderson saw walking with in garden coquetting with about flower just a used to do with can see pitying look in molly eye a watched can see now must beat for being such blind fool a to what must think of how must despise choosing false duessa come come cynthia be so bad a be very fascinating faulty creature know know will never allow one to say word against if called false duessa be because wanted to express sense of difference between molly a strongly a must must allow for lover exaggeration besides wanted to say be do think that molly after seeing knowing have loved person so inferior to herself must ever be brought to listen to know ca tell even if must must only if be comfort to may say what experience have taught woman be queer unreasoning creature be just a likely a not to love man who have be throwing away affection thank sir said roger interrupting see mean to give encouragement have resolved never to give molly hint of what felt till returned then to try win by mean in power determined not to repeat former scene in former place in drawing room however might be tempted perhaps after avoided when be here last now roger have listened to long enough if have nothing better to do with time than to talk about daughter have when come back will be time enough to inquire how far father must approve of such engagement urged upon other day then be in despair thought be too late what mean be likely to have of maintaining wife always thought that point be passed too lightly over when formed hurried engagement to cynthia be not mercenary molly have money independently of that by way know nothing of not much can allow something thing must be left till return then sanction attachment know what mean by sanctioning ca help suppose losing one daughter be necessary evil still seeing disappointed expression on roger face be fair to to say 'd rather give child only child remember to than to man in world thank said roger shaking hand with mr gibson almost against will of latter may see just once before go decidedly not there come in a doctor a well a father will take message at rate to wife to conjointly will not separate will not in slightest way be go between very well said roger tell a strongly a can how regret prohibition see must submit if come back will haunt for having be so cruel come like give wise man of science in love one beat in folly good by good by will see molly afternoon to be sure will see father heave such portentous sigh at thought mr gibson gave roger message to wife to molly that evening at dinner be what latter have expected after father have said of very great danger of infection now that expectation came in shape of final decision took away appetite submitted in silence observant father noticed that after speech of only played with food on plate concealed good deal of under knife fork lover versus father thought half sadly lover win too became indifferent to remained of dinner mr gibson pattered on nobody listened day of roger departure came molly tried hard to forget in working away at cushion be preparing a present to cynthia people did worsted work in day one two three one two three four five six seven wrong be thinking of something else have to unpick be rainy day too mr gibson who have planned to go out pay call have to stay indoors made restless fidgety kept going backwards forward to different window in drawing room to look at weather a if imagined that while rained at one window might be fine weather at molly come here who be that man wrapped up in cloak there near park wall under beech tree have be there half hour more never stirring looking at house time think be very suspicious molly looked in instant recognized roger under wrap first instinct be to draw back next to come forward say why mamma be roger hamley look now be kissing hand be wishing good by in only way can responded to sign be not sure if perceived modest quiet movement for mr gibson became immediately so demonstrative that molly fancied that eager foolish pantomimic motion must absorb attention call so attentive of said mr gibson in midst of volley of kiss of hand really be quite romantic reminds of former day will be too late must send away be half past twelve took out watch held up tapping with forefinger occupying very centre of window molly must only peep here there dodging now up now down now on side now on of perpetually moving arm fancied saw something of corresponding movement on roger part at length went away slowly slowly often looking back in spite of tapped watch mr gibson at last retreated molly quietly moved into place to see figure once more before turn of road hid from view too knew where last glimpse of mr gibson house be to be obtained once more turned white handkerchief floated in air molly waved hers high up with eager longing that must be seen then be gone molly returned to worsted work happy glowing sad content thinking to herself how sweet be friendship when came to sense of present mr gibson be saying upon word though roger hamley have never be great favourite of mine little attention of have reminded very forcibly of very charming young man soupirant a french must call lieutenant harper must have heard speak of molly think have said molly absently well remember how devoted be to when be at mr duncombe first situation only seventeen when recruiting party be ordered to town poor mr harper came stood opposite schoolroom window for nearly hour know be doing that band played 'the girl left behind ' when marched out next day poor mr

in cynthia character be week since heard from did write so particularly to ask for autumn fashion before bought new bonnet rich be great snare be thankful be spared temptation dear be not everybody like to be tempted after be very easy to resist temptation if one wish find so easy said husband here medicine for mamma said molly entering with letter held up in hand letter from cynthia oh dear

understand wish of other people still on whole be dear sweet girl only wish well know what wish only dear papa doe not like to be talked about now cover up close let go to sleep dream about dear cynthia new shawl concluding remark by editor of cornhill magazine here story be broken off can never be finished what promised to be crowning work of life be memorial of death few day longer must have be triumphal column crowned with capital of festal leaf flower now be sort of column one of sad white pillar stand broken in churchyard if work be not quite complete little remains to be added to little have be distinctly reflected into mind know that roger hamley will marry molly be what be most concerned about indeed there be little else to tell have writer lived must have sent hero back to africa forthwith scientific part of africa be long way from hamley there be not much to choose between long distance long time how many hour be there in twenty four when be alone in desert place thousand mile from happiness might be yours to take if be there to take how many when from source of topinambo heart fly back ten time day like carrier pigeon to one only source of future good for ten time day return with message undelivered many more than be counted on calendar so roger found day be week separated from time when molly gave certain little flower month from time divorced from cynthia whom have begun to doubt before knew for certain that be never much worth hoping for if such be day what be slow procession of actual week month in remote solitary place be like year of stay at home life with liberty leisure to see that nobody be courting molly meanwhile effect of be that long before term of engagement be ended cynthia have be to be departed from roger mind molly be might be to filled full returned when saw molly again remembered that to time of absence might not have seemed so long be oppressed with old dread that must think fickle therefore young gentleman so self reliant so lucid in scientific matter found difficult after to tell molly how much hoped loved might have blundered if have not thought of beginning by showing flower be plucked from nosegay how charmingly that scene must have be drawn have mr gaskell lived to depict can only imagine that must have be charming especially in what molly did looked said know roger molly be married if one of be happier than other be molly husband have need to draw upon little fortune be to go to poor osborne boy for becomes professor at great scientific institution win way in world handsomely squire be almost a happy in marriage a son if one suffers for be mr gibson take partner so a to get chance of running up to london to stay with molly for few day now then to get little rest from mr gibson of what be to happen to cynthia after marriage author be not heard to say much indeed doe not seem that anything need to be added one little anecdote however be told of by mr gaskell be very characteristic one day when cynthia husband be on visit to hollingford mr henderson learned for first time through innocent casual remark of mr gibson that famous traveller roger hamley be known to family cynthia have never happened to mention how well little incident too must have be described be useless to speculate upon what must have be done by delicate strong hand can create more molly gibson more roger hamleys have repeated in brief note be known of design for story must have be completed in chapter there be not so much to regret then so far a novel be concerned indeed regret of who knew be le for loss of novelist than of woman one of kindest wisest of time yet for own sake a novelist alone untimely death be matter for deep regret be clear in novel of wife daughter in exquisite little story preceded cousin phillis in sylvia lover that mr gaskell have within five year started upon new career with freshness of youth with mind seemed to have put off clay to have be born again that put off clay must be taken in very narrow sense mind be tinctured more le with muddy vesture in be contained few mind ever showed le of base earth than mr gaskell be so at time lately even original slight tincture seemed to disappear while read one of last three book have named feel caught out of abominable wicked world crawling with selfishness reeking with base passion into one where there be much weakness many mistake suffering long bitter where be possible for people to live calm wholesome life what be more feel that be at least a real world a other kindly spirit think ill look out of page irradiate while read breathe purer intelligence prefers to deal with emotion passion have living root in mind within pale of salvation not with rot without spirit be more especially declared in cousin phillis wife daughter author latest work seem to show that for end of life be not descent amongst clod of valley ascent into purer air of heaven aspiring hill be saying nothing now of merely intellectual quality displayed in later work twenty year to come may be thought more important question of two in presence of grave can not think so be true same that a mere work of art observation later novel of mr gaskell be among finest of time there be scene in cousin phyllis where holman making hay with men end day with psalm be not excelled a picture in modern fiction same may be said of chapter of last story in roger smoke pipe with squire after quarrel with osborne there be little in of scene in score of others succeed other like gem in cabinet ordinary novel maker must seize there be material for in dozen farming men singing hymn in field discontented old gentleman smoking tobacco with son still le must avail of misery of little girl sent to be happy in fine house full of fine people be just in such thing a that true genius appears brightest most unapproachable be same with personage in mr gaskell work cynthia be one of most difficult character have ever be attempted in time perfect art always obscures difficulty overcomes be not till try to follow process by character a tito of romola be created for instance that begin to understand what marvellous piece of work be to be sure cynthia be not so difficult be nearly so great creation a splendid achievement of art thought of rarest art of profoundest thought also belongs to kind of character be conceived only in mind large clear harmonious just can be portrayed fully without flaw only by hand obedient to finest motion of mind viewed in light cynthia be more important piece of work even than molly delicately a be drawn true harmonious a picture be also what have said of cynthia may be said with equal truth of osborne hamley true delineation of character like be a fine test of art a painting of foot hand also seems so easy in perfection be most rare in case work be perfect mr gaskell have drawn dozen character more striking than osborne since wrote mary barton not one show more exquisite finish thing may be permitted to notice because have great general significance may be true that be not exactly place for criticism since be writing of osborne hamley can not resist pointing out peculiar instance of subtler conception underlie really considerable work here be osborne roger two men who in particular can be seized for description be totally different creature body mind be quite unlike have different taste take different way be men of two sort in society sense never know other yet never did brotherly blood run more manifest than in vein of two to make manifest without allowing effort to peep out for single moment must be triumph of art be touch beyond reach of art to make likeness in unlikeness so natural thing that more wonder about than wonder at seeing fruit bloom on same bramble have always seen there together in blackberry season wonder about think about at inferior writer even writer who be highly accounted must have revelled in contrast persuaded that be doing fine anatomical dramatic thing by bringing out at opportunity to author of wife daughter sort of anatomy be mere dislocation began by having people of story born in usual way not built up like frankenstein monster thus when squire hamley took wife be then provided that two boy must be a naturally one diverse a fruit bloom on bramble go without speaking difference be precisely what might have be expected from union of squire hamley with town bred refined delicate minded woman whom married affection of young men kindness to use word in old new meaning at once be nothing reproduction of impalpable thread of love bound equally diverse father mother in bond faster than tie of blood will not permit ourselves to write more in vein be unnecessary to demonstrate to who know what be what be not true literature mr gaskell be gifted with of choicest faculty bestowed upon mankind that grew into greater strength ripened into greater beauty in decline of day have gifted with of truest purest work of fiction in language be what work show to have be wise good woman
