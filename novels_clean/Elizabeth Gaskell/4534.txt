'funeral discourse to be narrated did not recognize daily fault temptation under grand alias befitting appearance from preacher mouth knew old oft repeated word praying for deliverance from familiar

at sea beupposed to have perished in greenland sea behipwrecked in baltic 'drowned off coast of iceland ' there be strange sensation a if cold sea wind must bring with dim phantom of lost sailor who have died far from home from hallowed ground where father lay flight of step up to churchyard ended in small flat space on wooden seat be placed on particular sunday seat be filled by aged people breathless with unusual exertion of climbing must see church stair a be called from nearly part of town figure of numerous climber diminished by distance looked like busy ant hill long before bell began to ring for afternoon service who must manage have put on bit of black in token of mourning might be very little old ribbon rusty piece of crape sign of mourning be shown by one down to little

flag mast high crew be making way through high street gentlefolk of monkshaven full of indignation at interference with ship full of sympathy with family who have lost son brother almost within sight of home came in unusual number lack of pattern for sylvia thought be far otherwise more suitably occupied unwonted sternness solemnity visible on countenance of whom met awed affected did not speak in reply to molly remark on dress appearance of who struck felt a if speech jarred on annoyed almost to irritation yet molly have come way to monkshaven church in service deserved forbearance accordingly two mounted step alongside of many people few word be exchanged even at breathing place so often little centre of gossip looking over sea there be not sail to be seen seemed bared of life a if to be

numerous tablet of black white marble intermixed usual ornamentation of style of memorial a erected in last century of weeping willow urn drooping figure with here there ship in full sail anchor where seafaring idea prevalent through place have launched out into little originality there be wood work church have be stripped of most probably when neighbouring monastery have be destroyed there be large square pew lined with green baize with name of family of most flourishing ship owner painted white on door there be pew not so large not lined at for farmer shopkeeper of parish numerous heavy oaken bench by united effort of several men might be brought within earshot of pulpit be being removed into most convenient situation when molly sylvia entered church after two three whispered sentence took seat on one of vicar of monkshaven be kindly peaceable old man hating strife troubled water above everything be vehement tory in theory a became cloth in day have two bugbear to fear french dissenter be difficult to say of have worst opinion most intense dread perhaps hated dissenter most because came nearer in contact with than french besides french have excuse of being papist while dissenter might have belonged to church of england if have not be utterly depraved yet in practice dr wilson did not object to dine with mr fishburn who be personal friend follower of wesley then a doctor must say 'wesley be oxford man that make gentleman be ordained minister of church of england so grace can never depart from ' know what excuse must have alleged for sending vegetable to old ralph thompson rabid independent who have be given to abusing church vicar from dissenting pulpit a long a ever must mount stair however that inconsistency between dr wilson theory practice be not generally known in monkshaven so have nothing to do with dr wilson have have very difficult part to play still more difficult sermon to write during last week darley who have be killed be son of vicar gardener dr wilson sympathy a man have be all on bereaved father side then have received a oldest magistrate in neighbourhood letter from captain of aurora explanatory exculpatory darley have be resisting order of officer in majesty service what must become of due subordination loyalty interest of service chance of beating confounded french if such conduct a darley be to be encouraged poor darley be past evil effect of human encouragement now so vicar mumbled hastily over sermon on text 'in midst of life be in death ' might have done a well for baby cut off in convulsion fit a for strong man shot down with eager blood hot within by men a hot blooded a once when old doctor eye caught up turned straining gaze of father darley seeking with soul to find grain of holy comfort in chaff of word conscience smote have nothing to say must calm anger revenge with spiritual power breath of comforter to soothe repining into resignation again discord between law of man law of christ stood before gave up attempt to do more than be doing a beyond power though hearer went away a full of anger a have entered church with dull feeling of disappointment a to what have got there yet one felt anything kindly towards old vicar simple happy life led amongst for forty year open to men in daily course sweet tempered cordial way practical kindness made beloved by thought much cared much for admiration of talent respect for office be respect thought of be conceded to from old traditional hereditary association in looking back to last century appears curious to see how little ancestor have power of putting two thing together perceiving discord harmony thus produced be because be farther off from time have consequently greater range of vision will descendant have wonder about such a have about inconsistency of forefather surprise at blindness that perceive that holding such such opinion course of action must be so so that logical consequence of particular opinion must be conviction at present hold in abhorrence seems puzzling to look back on men such a vicar who almost held doctrine that king must do wrong yet be ever ready to talk of glorious revolution to abuse stuart for having entertained same doctrine tried to put in practice such discrepancy ran through good men life in day be well for that live at present time when everybody be logical consistent little discussion must be taken in place of dr wilson sermon of one must remember more than text hour after be delivered even doctor have recollection of word have uttered swept out of mind a having doffed

large family mother daughter hardly spoke at when sat down at last cheerful click of knitting needle made pleasant home sound in occasional snatch of slumber overcame mother sylvia must hear long rushing boom of wave down below rock for haytersbank gulley allowed sullen roar to come up so far inland might have be about eight o'clock though from monotonous course of evening seemed much later when sylvia heard father heavy step cranching down pebbly path more unusual heard voice talking to companion curious to see who must be with lively instinctive advance towards event might break

to be that daily concern of buying selling eating drinking whatsoever do be more tested by real practical standard of religion than be in day of grandfather sylvia mother be in advance of age listened with admiration to ingenious device acted a well a spoken lie be talked about a fine spirited thing yet if sylvia have attempted one tithe of deceit in day life must have half broken mother heart when

increased by tax upon a to make expensive sometimes unattainable luxury to working man government did more to demoralise popular sense of rectitude uprightness than heap of sermon must undo same

settled that must not be settled until saw molly again so by strong gulping effort resolutely determined to think more about only about marvel have told might think little about when sat at night spinning in silence by household fire when went out in gloaming to call cattle home to be milked sauntered back behind patient slow gaited creature at time on future summer day when a in past took knitting out for sake of freshness of faint sea breeze dropping down from ledge to ledge of rock faced blue ocean established in perilous nook have be haunt ever since parent have come to haytersbank farm from thence have often seen distant ship pas to fro with certain sort of lazy pleasure in watching swift tranquillity of motion thought a to where be bound to what strange place must penetrate to before turned again homeward bound chapter x refractory pupil sylvia be still full of specksioneer story when hepburn came up to give next lesson prospect of little sensible commendation for writing whole page full of flourishing 'abednegos have lost slight charm have ever possessed be much more inclined to try elicit sympathy in interest in peril adventure of northern sea than to bend control mind to right formation of letter unwisely enough endeavoured to repeat one of narrative that have heard from kinraid when found that hepburn if indeed did not look upon whole a silly invention considered only a interruption to real business in hand to must try to listen a patiently a must in hope of sylvia applying diligently to copy book when have cleared mind contracted pretty lip a if to check from making further appeal for sympathy set about writing lesson in very rebellious frame of mind only restrained by mother presence from spoken mutiny 'after said throwing down pen opening

charred wood on aunt dresser have asked aunt leave before beginning what sylvia called 'dirty work ' by by even became little interested in starting from great black spot called monkshaven in shaping of land sea around one centre sylvia held round chin in palm of hand supporting elbow on dresser looking down at progress of rough drawing in general now then glancing up at with sudden inquiry all along be not so much absorbed in teaching a to be unconscious of sweet proximity be in best mood towards neither mutinous saucy be striving with might to retain interest speaking better than ever have done before such brightness did love call forth understanding what must care to hear to know when in middle of attempt at explaining cause of long polar day of have heard from childhood felt that attention be no longer that discord have come in between mind that have passed out of power certainty of intuition lasted for instant have time to wonder to speculate a to what have affected so adversely to wish before door opened kinraid came in then hepburn knew that must have heard coming footstep recognized angrily stiffened up into coldness of demeanour almost to surprise sylvia greeting to new comer be a cold a own stood rather behind so perhaps did not see hand kinraid stretched out towards for did not place own little palm in a have done to philip hour ago hardly spoke began to pore over rough black map a if seized with strong geographical curiosity determined to impress philip lesson deep on memory still philip be dismayed by seeing warm welcome kinraid received from master of house who came in from back premise almost at same time a specksioneer entered at front hepburn be uneasy too at finding kinraid take seat by fireside like one accustomed to way of house pipe be soon produced philip disliked smoking possibly kinraid did so too took pipe at rate lighted though hardly used at kept talking to farmer robson on sea affair have conversation pretty much to philip sat gloomily by sylvia aunt be silent old robson smoked long clay pipe from time to time taking out of mouth to spit into bright copper spittoon to shake white ash out of bowl before replaced must give short laugh of relishing interest in kinraid conversation now then put in remark sylvia perched sideways on end of dresser made pretence to sew philip must see how often paused in work to listen by by aunt spoke to kept up little side conversation more because bell robson felt that nephew own flesh blood be put out than for special interest of felt in what be saying perhaps also of disliked showing that have great faith in story kinraid be telling mr robson at rate knew so little a to be afraid of believing too much philip be sitting on side of fire be nearest to window to sylvia opposite to specksioneer at length turned to cousin said in low voice suppose ca go on with spell at geography till that fellow gone ' colour came into sylvia cheek at word fellow ' only replied with careless air be one a think enough be a good a feast have have enough of geography one night thank kindly same philip took refuge in offended silence be maliciously pleased when aunt made so much noise with preparation for supper a quite to prevent sound of sailor word from reaching sylvia ear saw that be glad to perceive that effort to reach remainder of story be baulked nettled determined not to let have malicious triumph still more to put stop to attempt at private conversation began to sing to herself a sat at work till suddenly seized with desire to help mother dexterously slipped down from seat passed hepburn be on knee toasting cake right in front of fire just close to father kinraid now noise hepburn have so rejoiced in proved foe must not hear little merry speech darted backwards forward a specksioneer tried to take toasting fork out of sylvia hand 'how come that sailor chap here ' asked hepburn of aunt none fit to be where sylvia be 'nay dunnot know said 'the corneys made acquaint first master be quite fain of company 'and do like too aunt ' asked hepburn almost wistfully have followed mr robson into dairy on pretence of helping `` m none

what must did not recover temper evening be uncomfortable put out not enjoying yet must not go be determined to assert greater intimacy in house by outstaying kinraid at length latter got up to go before went must need bend over sylvia say something to in so low tone philip must not hear seized with sudden fit of diligence never looked up from sewing only nodded head by way of reply at last took departure after many little delay many quick return to suspicious philip seemed only pretence for taking stolen glance at sylvia a soon a be decidedly gone folded up work declared that be so much tired that must go to bed there then mother too have be dozing for last half hour be only too glad to see sign that might betake to natural place of slumber glass philip ' said farmer robson hepburn refused offer rather abruptly drew near to sylvia instead wanted to make speak to saw that wished to avoid took up readiest pretext be unwise one a proved for deprived of chance of occasionally obtaining undivided attention think care much for learning geography sylvie ' 'not much to night ' said making pretence to yawn yet looking timidly up at countenance of displeasure 'nor at time ' said with growing anger 'nor for kind of learning did bring book last time came meaning to teach many thing now will just trouble for book put on yon shelf by bible have mind that must bring to that at rate must have pleasure of receiving out of hand sylvia did not reply went took down book with languid indifferent air 'and so wo learn more geography ' said hepburn something in tone struck looked up in face there be mark of stern offence upon countenance yet in there be also air of wistful regret sadness that touched 'yo be niver angry with philip sooner than vex yo ' will try learn only be just stupid mun be such trouble to ' hepburn must fain have snatched at half proposal that lesson must be continued be too stubborn proud to say anything turned away from sweet pleading face without word to wrap up book in piece of paper knew that be standing quite still by side though made a if did not perceive when have done abruptly wished 'good night ' took leave there be tear in sylvia eye although feeling in heart be rather one of relief have made fair offer have be treated with silent contempt few day afterwards father came in from monkshaven market dropped out among other piece of news that have met kinraid who be bound for own home at cullercoats have desired respect to mr robson daughter have bid robson say that must have come up to haytersbank to wish good by that a be pressed for time hoped must excuse robson did not think while to give long message of mere politeness indeed a did not relate to business be only sent to woman robson forgot about pretty nearly a soon a be uttered so sylvia went about fretting for one two day at hero apparent carelessness of who have at rate treated more like friend than acquaintance of only few week standing then anger quenching incipient regard went about daily business pretty much a though have never be have gone away out of sight into thick mist of unseen life from have emerged gone away without word might never see again still there be chance of seeing when came to marry molly corney perhaps must be bridesmaid then what pleasant merry time wedding day must be corneys be such kind people in family there never seemed to be check restraint by own mother hedged round then there came overwhelming self reproaching burst of love for 'own mother ' humiliation before slightest wish a penance for moment unspoken treason thus sylvia be led to request cousin philip to resume lesson in so meek manner that slowly graciously acceded to request be yearning to fulfil time during ensuing winter went on in monotonous regularity at haytersbank farm for many week hepburn came went thought sylvia wonderfully improved in docility sobriety perhaps also noticed improvement in appearance for be at age when girl change rapidly generally for better sylvia shot up into tall young woman eye deepened in colour face increased in expression sort of consciousness of unusual good look gave slight tinge of coquettish shyness with few stranger whom ever saw philip hailed interest in geography a sign of improvement have brought back book of map to farm there sat on many evening teaching cousin who have strange fancy respecting place about wished to learn be coolly indifferent to very existence of other town country sea far more famous in story be occasionally wilful at time very contemptuous a to superior knowledge of instructor in spite of philip went regularly on appointed evening to haytersbank through keen black east wind driving snow slushing thaw for liked dearly to sit little behind with arm on back of chair stooping over outspread map with eye must have seen good deal fixed on one spot in map not northumberland where kinraid be spending winter wild northern sea about have told such wonder one day towards spring saw molly corney coming towards farm companion have not met for many week for molly have be from home visiting relation in north sylvia opened door stood smiling shivering on threshold glad to see friend again molly called out when few pace off 'why sylvia be that thee why how thou'rt growed to be sure what bonny lass thou be ' 'dunnot talk nonsense to lass ' said bell robson hospitably leaving ironing coming to door though mother tried to look a if thought nonsense must hardly keep down smile shone out of eye a put hand on sylvia shoulder with fond sense of proprietorship in what be being praised 'oh be ' persisted molly be grown quite beauty sin ' saw if tell so men will ' 'be quiet wi ' thee ' said sylvia more than half offended turning away in huff at open barefaced admiration
