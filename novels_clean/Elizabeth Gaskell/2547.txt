of consciousness perception be not sharp enough to observe sad change have taken place in willie bodily strength returned appetite be something enormous eye wandered continually regard must not be arrested speech became slow impeded incoherent people began to say that fever have taken away little wit willie dixon have ever possessed that feared that must end in being natural a call idiot in dale habitual affection obedience to susan lasted longer than other feeling that boy have have previous to illness perhaps made be last to perceive what one else have long anticipated felt awakening rude when did come be in wise one june evening sat out of door under yew tree knitting be pale still from recent illness languor joined to fact of black dress made look more than usually interesting

susan have succeeded to guardianship of brother michael be to be married a soon a be strong enoughso perhaps authoritative manner be justified labourer did not like although said little remembered stripling on farm knowing far le than did often glad to shelter ignorance of agricultural matter behind superior knowledge must have taken order from susan with far more willingness nay willie might have commanded from old hereditary feeling toward owner of land must have obeyed with far greater cordiality than now showed to michael susan be tired with even three round of knitting seemed not to notice to care how thing went on around williepoor williethere stood lounging against door sill enormously grown developed to be sure with restless eye ever open mouth now then setting up strange kind of howling cry then smiling vacantly to at sound have made a two old labourer passed looked at other ominously shook head willie darling said susan dont make noiseit make head ache spoke feebly willie did not seem to hear at rate continued howl from time to time hold thy noise wilta said michael roughly a passed near threatening with fist susans back be turned to pair expression of willies face changed from vacancy to fear came shambling up to susan who put arm round a if protected by shelter began making face at michael susan saw what be going on a if now first struck by strangeness of brother manner looked anxiously at michael for explanation michael be irritated at willies defiance of did not mince matter just that fever have left sillyhe never be a wise a other folk now doubt if will ever get right susan did not speak went very pale lip quivered looked long wistfully at willies face a watched motion of duck in great stable pool laughed softly to now then willie like to see duck go overhead said susan instinctively adopting form of speech must have used to young child willie boo willie boo replied clapping hand avoiding eye speak properly willie said susan making strong effort at self control trying to arrest attention know who amtell name grasped arm almost painfully tight to make attend now looked at for instant gleam of recognition quivered over face exertion be evidently painful began to cry at vainness of effort to recall name hid face upon shoulder with old affectionate trick of manner put gently away went into house into own little bedroom locked door did not reply at to michael call for hardly spoke to old peggy who tried to tempt out to receive homely sympathy through open easement there still came idiotic sound of willie boo willie boo chapter iii after stun of blow came realization of consequence susan must sit for hour trying patiently to recall piece together fragment of recollection consciousness in brother mind must let go pursue senseless bit of play wait until must catch eye attention again when must resume self imposed task michael complained that never have word for minute of time to spend with now only said must try while there be yet chance to bring back brother lost wit a for marriage in state of uncertainty have heart to think of then michael stormed absented for two three day be of use when came back saw that have be cry till eye be swollen up gathered from peggys scolding did not spare that susan have eaten nothing since went away be a inflexible a ever not just yet only not just yet dont say again that love said suddenly hiding in arm so matter went on through august crop of oat be gathered in wheat field be not ready a yet when one fine day michael drove up in borrowed shandry offered to take willie ride

before night be at home again willie in high delight at little rattling paper windmill that michael have bought for in street striving to imitate new sound with perpetual buzzings michael too looked pleased susan knew look although afterwards remembered that have tried to veil from have assumed grave appearance of sorrow whenever caught eye put up horse for although have three mile further to go

lancaster asylum theyve way there of keeping such people in order making happy only tell what said continued seeing gathering storm in face there be harm in saying replied with great self constraint forcing to speak coldly instead of angrily folk be welcome to opinion sat silent for minute two breast heaving with suppressed feeling he counted very clever man said michael at length may be he none of clever men be going to be guided by may think dont thank went took poor lad to have such harsh notion formed about if id be there must have called out sense be in well ill not say more to night

lad never there knowing where must take thee to what must do with thee a say in bible nought death will part thee country side be full in day of story of brutal treatment offered to insane story be in fact too well founded truth of one of only must have be sufficient reason for strong prejudice existing against such place succeeding hour that susan passed alone with poor affectionate lad for sole companion served to deepen solemn resolution never to part with so when michael came be annoyed surprised by calm way in spoke a if following dr prestons advice be utterly entirely out of question have expected nothing le than consent reluctant might be still consent be extremely irritated must have repressed anger chose rather to give way to thinking that must thus best work upon susans affection so a to gain point somehow over reached now be astonished in turn at passion of indignation that burst into thou wilt not bide in same house with sayst thou there need for thy biding a far a
