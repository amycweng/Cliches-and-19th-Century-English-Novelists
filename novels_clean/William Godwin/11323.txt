quote one remarkable passage voice opinion of many among godwin be most eminent contemporary in letter of charles lamb sir tn talfourd say indifferent altogether to politics of age lamb must not help being struck with production of newborn energy so remarkable a work character of godwin seemed to realise in what wordsworth long afterwards described 'the central calm at heart of agitation through

situation fearful event be to be evolved making pretty clear that purpose somewhat vaguely cautiously outlined in earliest preface be rather of nature of afterthought falkland be not intended to be personification of evil caused by social system be put forward a inevitable product of system reader attention be chiefly absorbed by extraordinary contest between caleb williams falkland in tragic situation that involves compared with denunciation of social system be matter of secondary interest be natural that author of political justice with mind preoccupied by defect of english social system must make defect evil agency of plot a essential condition of series of event a machinery by everything be brought about defect be of utmost importance to story be accused system award to tyrrel

strife begin between well matched antagonist man of wealth station utilizing advantage granted by state of society to crush enemy godwin then be justified in declaring that book comprehended general view of mode of domestic unrecorded despotism by man becomes destroyer of man such be word of original preface be suppressed for short time owing to fear caused by trial of horne tooke thomas holcroft other revolutionist with whom godwin be in profound sympathy have intended caleb williams however from first inception to be imaginative version of political justice must have have to invent different plan different character argument of sociological novel lack cogency unless character be fairly representative of average mankind godwin principal actor be to say least exceptional be lofty idealization of certain virtue power of mind falkland be like jean valjean superhuman creature indeed caleb williams may well be compared on one side with le miserables for victor hugo avowed purpose

rank of society be truth highly worthy to be communicated to person whom book of philosophy science be never likely to reach accordingly be proposed in invention of following work to comprehend a far a progressive nature of single story must allow general review of mode of domestic unrecorded despotism by man becomes destroyer of man if author will have taught valuable lesson without subtracting from interest passion by performance of sort ought to be characterised will have reason to congratulate upon vehicle have chosen may preface be withdrawn in original edition in compliance with alarm

close of year terror be order of day be feared that even humble novelist might be shown to be constructively traitor october author latest preface london november caleb williams have always be regarded by public with unusual degree of favour proprietor of standard novel have therefore imagined that even account of concoction mode of writing of work must be viewed with interest finished enquiry concerning political justice first work may be considered a written by in certain degree in maturity of intellectual power bearing name early in january about middle of following month book be published be fortune at time to be obliged to consider pen a sole instrument for supplying current expense by liberality of bookseller mr george robinson of paternoster row be enabled then for nearly

imagine that delivered thing of sort with more than usual point elegance world believed must accept nothing from with distinguishing favour did not bear upon face of undoubted stamp of originality having long ruminated upon principle of political justice persuaded must offer to public in treatise on subject thing at once new true important in progress of work became more sanguine confident talked over idea with few familiar friend during progress gave generous encouragement happened that fame of book in inconsiderable degree got before publication certain number of person be prepared to receive with favour must be false modesty in to say that acceptance when published did not nearly come up to everything must soberly have be expected by in consequence of tone of mind during period in

powerful interest pursuing idea invented first third volume of tale then second last of first bent to conception of series of adventure of flight pursuit fugitive in perpetual apprehension of being overwhelmed with worst calamity pursuer by ingenuity resource keeping victim in state of most fearful alarm be project of third volume be next called upon to conceive dramatic impressive situation adequate to account for impulse that pursuer must feel incessantly to alarm harass victim with inextinguishable resolution never to allow least interval of peace security apprehended must best be effected by secret murder to investigation of innocent victim must be impelled by unconquerable spirit of curiosity murderer must thus have sufficient motive to persecute unhappy discoverer that might deprive of peace character credit have for ever in power constituted outline of second volume subject of first volume be still to be invented to account for fearful event of third be necessary that pursuer must be invested with advantage of fortune with resolution that nothing must defeat baffle with extraordinary resource of intellect must purpose of giving overpowering interest to tale be answered without appearing to have be originally endowed with mighty store of amiable disposition virtue so that being driven to first act of murder must be judged worthy of deepest regret must be seen in measure to have arisen out of virtue be necessary to make so to speak tenant of atmosphere of romance so reader must feel prompted almost to worship for high quality here be ample material for

to fear despotic unforgiving propensity stimulated to degree little short of madness at same time habit be pensive gloomy led to meditate variety of scheme to punish obstinacy began to suspect that there be little hope of succeeding by open force therefore determined to have recourse to treachery found in grime instrument sufficiently adapted to purpose fellow without atom of intentional malice be fitted by mere coarseness of perception for perpetration of greatest injury regarded injury advantage merely a related to gratification of appetite considered essential in true wisdom to treat with insult effeminacy of who suffer to be tormented with ideal misfortune believed that happier destiny must befal young woman than to be wife conceived that termination must amply compensate for calamity might suppose to undergo in interval be therefore easily prevailed upon by certain temptation mr tyrrel knew how to employ to take part in plot into miss melville be meant to be betrayed matter being thus prepared mr tyrrel proceeded through mean of gaoler for experience already have of personal discussion did not incline to repeat visit to play upon fear of prisoner woman sometimes under pretence of friendship sometimes with open malice informed emily from time to time of preparation be making for marriage one day squire have rode over to look at neat little farm be destined for habitation of new married couple at quantity of live stock household furniture be procured that thing might be ready for reception then told of licence be bought parson in readiness day fixed for nuptials when emily endeavoured though with increased misgiving to ridicule proceeding a absolutely nugatory without consent artful gouvernante related several story of forced marriage assured that protestation

undermined grime in pursuance of instruction took care in next interview to throw out insinuation that for own part have never cared for match since be so averse to must be better pleased that must never take place between one other however be got into scrape now supposed must marry will nill two squire must infallibly ruin upon least appearance of backwardness on part a be accustomed to do inferior resisted will emily be rejoiced to find admirer in so favourable disposition earnestly pressed to give effect to humane declaration representation be full of eloquence energy grime appeared to be moved at fervency of manner objected resentment of mr tyrrel landlord at length however suggested project in consequence of might assist in escape without ever coming to knowledge a indeed there be likelihood that suspicion must fix upon to be sure said have refused in disdainful sort of way a man may say mayhap thought be better 'an brute bear malice will show that be more kind hearted 'an

in condition to follow own inclination emily listened to suggestion at first with eagerness approbation fervency somewhat abated when came to discus minute part of undertaking be necessary a grime informed that escape must be effected in dead of night must conceal for purpose in garden be provided with false key by to deliver from prison circumstance be by mean adapted to calm perturbed imagination to throw into arm of man whose intercourse be employing method to avoid whom under idea of partner for life must least of men endure be doubt extraordinary proceeding attendant circumstance of darkness solitude aggravated picture situation of tyrrel place be uncommonly lonely be three mile from nearest village not le than seven from in mr jakeman sister resided under whose protection miss melville be desirous of placing ingenuous character of emily did not allow once to suspect grime of intending to make ungenerous brutal advantage of circumstance mind involuntarily revolted against idea of committing alone to disposal of man whom have lately be accustomed to consider a instrument of treacherous relation after having for time revolved consideration thought of expedient of desiring grime to engage mr jakeman sister to wait for at outside of garden grime peremptorily refused even flew into passion at proposal showed very little gratitude to desire to disclose to other people concern in dangerous affair for part be determined in consideration of own safety never to appear in to living soul if miss did not believe when made proposal out of pure good nature must not trust single inch might even see to consequence herself be resolved to condescend further to whim of person who in treatment of have shown a proud a lucifer emily exerted to appease resentment eloquence of new confederate must not prevail upon instantly to give up objection desired till next day to consider of day after be fixed by mr tyrrel for marriage ceremony in mean time be pestered with intimation in thousand form of fate so nearly awaited preparation be so continued methodical regular a to produce in most painful aching anxiety if heart attained moment intermission upon subject female attendant be sure by sly hint sarcastical remark to put speedy termination to tranquillity felt a afterwards remarked alone uninstructed just broken loose a be from trammel of infancy without one single creature to concern in fate who till then never knew enemy have now for three week not seen glimpse of human countenance that have not good reason to consider a wholly estranged to at least if not unrelentingly bent on destruction now for first time experienced anguish of never having known parent being cast upon charity of people with whom have too little equality to hope to receive from office of friendship succeeding night be filled with most anxious thought when momentary oblivion stole upon sens distempered imagination conjured up thousand image of violence falsehood saw in hand of determined enemy who did not hesitate by most daring treachery to complete ruin waking thought be not more consoling struggle be too great for constitution a morning approached resolved at hazard to put into hand of grime determination be sooner made than felt heart sensibly lightened must not conceive evil must result from proceeding deserved to be put in balance against under roof of kinsman appeared unavoidable when communicated determination to grime be not possible to say whether received pleasure pain from intimation smiled indeed smile be accompanied by certain abrupt ruggedness of countenance so that might equally well be smile of sarcasm of congratulation however renewed assurance of fidelity to engagement punctuality of execution meanwhile day be interspersed with nuptial present preparation indicating firmness a well a security of director of scene emily have hoped that a crisis approached might have remitted something of usual diligence be resolved in case if fair opportunity have offered to give slip to jailor to new reluctantly chosen confederate though extremely vigilant for purpose found execution of idea impracticable at length night so critical to happiness approached mind of emily must not fail on occasion to be extremely agitated have first exerted perspicacity to elude vigilance of attendant insolent unfeeling tyrant instead of relentings have only sought to make sport of anxiety accordingly in one instance hid suffering emily to suppose that coast be clear met at end of gallery near top of staircase how do do dear said with insulting tone so little dear thought cunning enough to outwit did oh be sly little gipsy go go back love troop emily felt deeply trick be played upon sighed disdained to return answer to low vulgarity being once more in chamber sat down in chair remained buried in reverie for more than two hour after went to drawer turned over in hurrying confused way linen clothes having in mind provision must be necessary to make for elopement jailor officiously followed from place to place observed what did for present in silence be now hour of rest good night child said saucy girl in act of retiring be time to lock up for few next hour time be own make best use of do'ee think ee can creep out at key hole lovey at eight o'clock see again then then added clapping hand be over sun be not surer to rise than honest man to be made one there be something in tone with slut uttered farewell suggested question to emily what doe mean be possible that must know what have be planned for few next hour be first moment that suspicion have offered continuance be short with aching heart folded up few necessary intended to take with instinctively listened with anxiety must almost have enabled to hear stirring of leaf from time to time thought ear be struck with sound of foot treading if treading be be so soft that must never ascertain whether be real sound mere creature of fancy then be still a if universal motion have be at rest by by conceived overheard noise a of buzzing low muttered speech heart palpitated for second time began to doubt honesty of grime suggestion be now more anxious than before be too late presently heard sound of key in chamber door rustic made appearance started cried be discovered did not hear speak grime advanced on tiptoe with finger to lip replied be safe took by hand led in silence out of house then across garden emily examined with eye door passage a proceeded looked on side with fearful suspicion thing be a vacant still a must have wished grime opened back door of garden already unlocked that led into unfrequented lane there stood two horse ready equipped for journey fastened by bridle to post not six yard distant from garden grime pushed door after by gemini said heart be in mouth a comed along to saw coachey pop along from back door to stable be within hop step jump of have lanthorn in hand did not see being a be darkling saying assisted miss melville to mount troubled little during route on contrary be remarkably silent contemplative circumstance by mean disagreeable to emily to whom conversation have never be acceptable after having proceeded about two mile turned into wood through road led to place of destination night be extremely dark at same time that air be soft mild being now middle of summer under pretence of exploring way grime contrived when have already penetrated into midst of gloomy solitude to get horse abreast with of miss melville then suddenly reaching out hand seized hold of bridle think may a well stop here bit said stop exclaimed emily with surprise why must stop mr grime what do mean come come said never trouble to wonder did think be goose to take trouble merely to gratify whim ' faith nobody will find pack horse to go of other folk errand without knowing reason why can not say that much minded to have at first way be enough to stir blood of grand dad far fetched dear bought be always relishing consent be so hard to gain that squire thought be surest asking in dark ' said however ' must have such doings in house so do ye see be comed here for god sake mr grime think what be about can not be base enough to ruin poor creature who have put under protection ruin will make honest woman of when be done nay none of air trick upon traveller have here a safe a horse in pound there be not house shed within mile of if miss opportunity call spade faith be delicate morsel there be time to be lost miss melville have instant in to collect thought felt that there be little hope of softening obstinate insensible brute in whose power be placed presence of mind intrepidity annexed to character did not now desert grime have scarcely finished harangue when with strong unexpected jerk disengaged bridle from grasp at same time put horse upon full speed have scarcely advanced twice length of horse when grime recovered from surprise pursued inexpressibly mortified at being so easily overreached sound of horse behind served to rouse more completely mettle of of emily whether by accident sagacity animal pursued without fault narrow winding way chase continued whole length of wood at extremity of wood there be gate recollection of softened little cutting disappointment of grime a thought secure of putting end by assistance to career of emily be very probable that body must appear to interrupt design in such place in dead silence of night by most extraordinary accident however found man on horseback in wait at gate help help exclaimed affrighted emily thief murder help man be mr falkland grime knew voice therefore though attempted sort of sullen resistance be feebly made two other men whom by reason of darkness have not at first seen who be mr falkland servant hearing bustle of rencounter alarmed for safety of master rode up then grime disappointed at loss of gratification admonished by conscious guilt shrunk from farther parley rode off in silence may seem strange that mr falkland must thus second time have be saviour of miss melville that under circumstance most unexpected singular in instance be easily to be accounted for have heard of man who lurked about wood for robbery other bad design that be conjectured man be hawkins of victim of mr tyrrel rural tyranny whom will immediately have occasion to introduce mr falkland compassion have already be strongly excited in favour of hawkins have in vain endeavoured to find do good easily conceived that if conjecture have be made in instance proved true might have in power not only to do what have always intended further to save from perilous offence against law society man who appeared to have strongly imbibed principle of justice virtue took with two servant because going with express design of encountering robber if robber must be found believed must be inexcusable if did not go provided against possible accident have directed at same time that kept within call to be out of reach of being seen be only eagerness of zeal have brought up thus early in present encounter new adventure promised something extraordinary mr falkland did not immediately recognise miss melville person of grime be that of total stranger whom did not recollect to have ever seen be easy to understand merit of case propriety of interfering resolute manner of mr falkland conjoined with dread grime oppressed with sense of wrong entertained of opposition of so elevated personage speedily put ravisher to flight emily be left alone with deliverer found much more collected calm than must reasonably have be expected from person who have be moment before in most alarming situation told of place to desired to be conveyed immediately undertook to escort a went along recovered that state of mind inclined to make person to whom have such repeated obligation who be so eminently object of admiration acquainted with event have recently befallen mr falkland listened with eagerness surprise though have already known various instance of mr tyrrel mean jealousy unfeeling tyranny surpassed must scarcely credit ear while heard tale brutal neighbour seemed to realise have be told of passion of fiend miss melville be obliged to repeat in course of tale kinsman rude accusation against of entertaining passion for mr falkland did with most bewitching simplicity charming confusion though part of tale be source of real pain to deliverer yet be not to be supposed that flattering partiality of unhappy girl increased interest felt in welfare indignation conceived against infernal kinsman arrived without accident at house of good lady under whose protection emily desired to place here mr falkland willingly left a in place of security such conspiracy a of be intended to have be victim depend for success upon person against whom be formed being out of reach of help moment be detected be annihilated such reasoning will doubt be generally found sufficiently solid appeared to mr falkland perfectly applicable to present case be mistaken chapter ix mr falkland have experienced nullity of expostulation with mr tyrrel be therefore content in present case with confining attention to intended victim indignation with thought of neighbour character be now grown to such height a to fill with reluctance to idea of voluntary interview there be indeed affair have be contemporary with have once more brought mortal enemy into state of contest have contributed to raise into temper little short of madness already inflamed corrosive bitterness of mr tyrrel there be tenant of mr tyrrel one hawkins can not mention name without recollecting painful tragedy be annexed to hawkins have originally be taken up by mr tyrrel with view of protecting from arbitrary proceeding of neighbouring squire though have now in turn become object of persecution to mr tyrrel first ground of connection be hawkins beside farm rented under above mentioned squire have small freehold estate that inherited from father of course entitled to vote in county election warmly contested election having occurred be required by landlord to vote for candidate in whose favour have engaged hawkins refused to obey mandate soon after received notice to quit farm at time rented happened that mr tyrrel have interested strongly in behalf of opposite candidate a mr tyrrel estate bordered upon seat of hawkins present residence ejected countryman must think of better expedient than of riding over to gentleman mansion relating case to mr tyrrel heard through with attention well friend said be very true that wished mr jackman to carry election know be usual in case for tenant to vote just a landlord please think proper to encourage rebellion be very right please replied hawkins must have voted at landlord bidding for other man in kingdom squire marlow must know one day huntsman rode over fence so through best field of standing corn be not above dozen yard about if have kept cart road fellow have served same sauce please honour three four time before so only asked what did that for whether have not more conscience than to spoil people crop o ' that fashion presently squire came up be poor weazen face chicken of gentleman saving honour reverence so flew into woundy passion threatened to horsewhip will do a much in reason to pleasure landlord a arr tenant have will not give vote to man threatens to horsewhip so honour wife three child be to be turned out of house home what be to do to maintain god know have be hard working man have always lived well do think case be main hard squire underwood turn out of farm if honour take in know none of neighbouring gentry will for fear a say of encouraging own tenant to run rusty too representation be not without effect upon mr tyrrel well well man replied will see what can be done order subordination be very good thing people must know how much to require a tell story can not see that be greatly to blame marlow be coxcombical prig be truth o if man will expose why must even take what follows do hate frenchified fop with soul can not say that be much pleased with neighbour underwood for taking part of rascal hawkins think be name may call on barnes steward to morrow will speak to while mr tyrrel be speaking recollected that have farm vacant of nearly same value a hawkins at present rented under mr underwood immediately consulted steward finding thing suitable in respect hawkins be installed out of hand in catalogue of mr tyrrel tenant mr underwood extremely resented proceeding indeed a being contrary to understood convention of country gentleman few people mr tyrrel must have ventured upon there be end said mr underwood to regulation if tenant be to be encouraged in such disobedience be not question of that candidate seeing that gentleman who be true friend to country must rather lose election than do thing if once established into practice must deprive for ever of power of managing election labouring people be sturdy resolute enough of own accord became day more difficult to keep under subordination if gentleman be so ill advised a to neglect public good encourage in insolence there be foreseeing where must end mr tyrrel be not of stamp to be influenced by remonstrance general spirit be sufficiently conformable to sentiment entertained be of too vehement temper to maintain character of consistent politician however wrong conduct might be must by mean admit of being set right by suggestion of others more patronage of hawkins be criticised more inflexibly adhered to be at loss in club other assembly to overbear silence if not to confute censurers beside hawkins have certain accomplishment qualified to be favourite with mr tyrrel bluntness of manner ruggedness of temper gave resemblance to landord a quality be likely to be more frequently exercised on such person a have incurred mr tyrrel displeasure than upon mr tyrrel be not observed without degree of complacency in word day received new mark of distinction from patron after time be appointed coadjutor to mr barnes under denomination of bailiff be about same period that obtained lease of farm of be tenant mr tyrrel determined a occasion offered to promote part of family of favoured dependent hawkins have son lad of seventeen of agreeable person ruddy complexion of quick lively part lad be in uncommon degree favourite of father who seemed to have nothing so much at heart a future welfare of son mr tyrrel have noticed two three time with approbation boy being fond of sport of field have occasionally followed hound displayed various instance of agility sagacity in presence of squire one day in particular exhibited with uncommon advantage mr tyrrel without further delay proposed to father to take into family make whipper in to hound till must provide with more lucrative appointment in service proposal be received by hawkins with various mark of mortification excused with hesitation for not accepting offered favour said lad be in many way useful to hoped honour must not insist upon depriving of assistance apology might perhaps have be sufficient with other man than mr tyrrel be frequently observed of gentleman when have once formed determination however slight in favour of measure be never afterwards known to give up that only effect of opposition be to make eager inflexible in pursuit of to have before be nearly indifferent at first seemed to receive apology of hawkins with good humour to see nothing in what be reasonable afterwards time saw boy desire of retaining in service be increased more than once repeated to father good disposition in felt towards at length observed that lad be more to be seen mingling in favourite sport began to suspect that originated in determination to thwart in project roused by suspicion to man of mr tyrrel character be not of nature to brook delay sent for hawkins to confer with hawkins said in tone of displeasure be not satisfied with have spoken to two three time about lad of yours whom be desirous of taking into favour what be reason sir that seem unthankful averse to kindness ought to know be not to be trifled with will not be contented when offer favour to have rejected by such fellow a made what be if please can make more helpless miserable than be when found have care please honour said hawkins have be very good master to will tell whole truth hope will na be angry lad be favourite comfort stay of age well what then be that reason must hinder preferment nay pray honour hear may be very weak for aught know in case can not help father

know honour that be main foolish of to talk to thus honour have be good master to can not bear to tell lie mr tyrrel have heard whole of harangue in silence because be too much astonished to open mouth if thunderbolt have fallen at foot must not have testified greater surprise have thought that hawkins be so foolishly fond of son that must not bear to trust out of presence have never in slightest degree suspected what now found to be truth oh ho be gentleman be pretty gentleman truly father be clergyman family be too good to enter into service why impudent rascal be for took up when mr underwood dismissed for insolence to have be nursing viper in bosom pretty master manner will be contaminated truly will not know what be due to will be accustomed to obey order insufferable villain get out of sight depend upon will have gentleman on estate will off with root branch bag baggage so do hear sir come to to morrow morning bring son ask pardon take word for will make so miserable will wish have never be born treatment be too much for hawkins patience there be need honour must come to again about affair have taken up determination time can make change in be main sorry

must gain indie by not so fast honour answered hawkins sturdily hope will think better of see have not be to blame if must not there be harm that can do harm that can not though be plain working man honour do see yet be man still have got lease of farm will not quit o ' thaten hope there be law for poor folk a well a for rich mr tyrrel unused to contradiction be provoked beyond bearing at courage independent spirit of retainer there be not tenant upon estate at least not one of hawkins mediocrity of fortune whom general policy of landowner still more arbitrary uncontrollable temper of mr tyrrel did not effectually restrain from act of open defiance excellent upon soul god damn blood be rare fellow have lease have will not quit not pretty pas thing be come to if lease can protect such fellow a against lord of manor be for trial of skill oh very well friend very well with soul since be come to will show pretty sport before have done get out of sight rascal have not word to say to never darken door again hawkins to borrow language of world be guilty in affair of double imprudence talked to landlord in more peremptory manner than constitution practice of country allow dependent to assume above having be thus hurried away by resentment ought to have foreseen consequence be mere madness in to think of contesting with man of mr tyrrel eminence fortune be fawn contending with lion nothing must have be more easy to predict than that be of avail for to have right on side when adversary have influence wealth therefore must so victoriously justify extravagancy that might think proper to commit maxim be completely illustrated in sequel wealth despotism easily know how to engage law a coadjutor of oppression be perhaps at first intended witless miserable precaution for safeguard of poor from moment mr tyrrel be bent upon hawkins destruction left mean unemployed must either harass injure object of persecution deprived of appointment of bailiff directed barnes other dependent to do ill office upon occasion mr tyrrel by tenure of manor be impropriator of great tithe circumstance afforded frequent opportunity of petty altercation land of one part of hawkins farm

harvest laid whole under water ordered servant to pull away fence of higher ground during night to turn in cattle to utter destruction of crop expedient however applied to only one part of property of unfortunate man mr tyrrel did not stop here sudden mortality took place among hawkins live stock attended with very suspicious circumstance hawkins vigilance be strongly excited by event at length succeeded in tracing matter so accurately that conceived must bring home to mr tyrrel hawkins have hitherto carefully avoided notwithstanding injury have suffered attempting to right by legal process being of opinion that law be better adapted for weapon of tyranny in hand of rich than for shield to protect humbler part of community against usurpation in last instance however conceived that offence be so atrocious a to make impossible that rank must protect culprit against severity of justice in sequel saw reason to applaud for former inactivity in respect to repent that motive have be strong enough to persuade into contrary system be very point to mr tyrrel wanted to bring must scarcely credit good fortune when be told that hawkins have entered action congratulation upon occasion be immoderate a now conceived that ruin of late favourite be irretrievable consulted attorney urged by motive must devise to employ whole series of subterfuge in present affair direct repelling of charge exhibited against be least part of care business be by affidavit motion plea demurrer flaw appeal to protract question from term to term from court to court must a mr tyrrel argued be disgrace of civilized country if gentleman when insolently attacked in law by scum of earth must not convert cause into question of longest purse stick in skirt of adversary till have reduced to beggary mr tyrrel however be by mean so far engrossed by law suit a to neglect other method of proceeding offensively against tenant among various expedient suggested there be one though tended rather to torment than irreparably injure sufferer be not rejected be derived from particular situation of hawkins house barn stack outhouse be placed at extremity of slip of land connecting with rest of farm be surrounded on three side by field in occupation of one of mr tyrrel tenant most devoted to pleasure of landlord road to market town ran at bottom of largest of field be directly in view of front of house inconvenience have yet arisen from circumstance a there have always be broad path intersected field led directly from hawkins house to road path private road be now by concert of mr tyrrel obliging tenant shut up so a to make hawkins sort of prisoner in own domain oblige to go near mile about for purpose of traffic young hawkins lad who have be original subject of dispute between father squire have much of father spirit felt uncontrollable indignation against successive act of despotism of be witness resentment be greater because suffering to parent be exposed of flowed from affection to at same time that must not propose removing ground of dispute a by so doing must seem to fly in face of father paternal kindness upon present occasion without asking counsel of own impatient resentment went in middle of night removed obstruction have be placed in way of old path broke padlock have be fixed threw open gate in operation did not proceed unobserved next day warrant be issued for apprehending be accordingly carried before meeting of justice by committed to county gaol to take trial for felony at next assize mr tyrrel be determined to prosecute offence with greatest severity attorney having made proper enquiry for purpose undertook to bring under clause of act geo commonly called black act declares that person armed with sword other offensive weapon having face blackened being otherwise disguised appearing in warren place where hare cony have be will be usually kept being thereof duly convicted will be adjudged guilty of felony will suffer death a in case of felony without benefit of clergy young hawkins seemed have buttoned cape of great coat over face a soon a perceived to be observed be furnished with wrenching iron for purpose of breaking padlock attorney further undertook to prove by sufficient witness that field in question be warren in hare be regularly fed mr tyrrel seized upon pretence with inexpressible satisfaction prevailed upon justice by picture drew of obstinacy insolence of hawkins fully to commit lad upon miserable charge be by mean so certain a paternal affection must have desired that same overpowering influence must not cause in sequel penal clause to be executed in strictness be finishing stroke to hawkins misery a be not deficient in courage have stood up against other persecution without flinching be not unaware of advantage law custom give to rich over poor in contention of kind being once involved there be stubbornness in nature must not allow to retract suffered to hope rather than expect favourable issue in last event be wounded in point be nearest heart have feared to have son contaminated debased by servile station now saw transferred to seminary of gaol be even uncertain a to issue of imprisonment trembled to think what tyranny of wealth might effect to blast hope for ever from moment heart died within have trusted to persevering industry skill to save wreck of little property from vulgar spite of landlord have now no longer spirit to exert effort situation more than ever required mr tyrrel proceeded without remission in machination hawkins affair day grew more desperate squire watching occasion took earliest opportunity of seizing upon remaining property in mode of distress for rent be precisely in stage of affair mr falkland mr tyrrel accidentally met in private road near habitation of latter be on horseback mr falkland be going to house of unfortunate tenant who seemed upon point of perishing under landlord malice have be just made acquainted with tale of persecution have indeed be additional aggravation of hawkins calamity that mr falkland whose interference might otherwise have saved have be absent from neighbourhood for considerable time have be three month in london from thence have gone to visit estate in part of island proud confident spirit of poor fellow always disposed to depend a long a possible upon own exertion have avoided applying to mr falkland indeed indulging in manner in communicating bewailing hard hap in beginning of contention when extremity grew more urgent must have be willing to recede in degree from stubbornness of measure found no longer in power after absence of considerable duration mr falkland at length returned somewhat unexpectedly having learned among first article of country intelligence distress of unfortunate yeoman resolved to ride over to house next morning surprise with relief be in power to bestow at sight of mr tyrrel in unexpected rencounter face reddened with indignation first feeling a afterwards said be to avoid finding that must pas conceived that must be want of spirit not to acquaint with feeling on present occasion mr tyrrel said somewhat abruptly be sorry for piece of news have just heard pray sir what be sorrow to great deal sir be caused by distress of poor tenant of yours hawkins if steward have proceeded without authority think right to inform what have done if have have authority must gladly persuade to think better of mr falkland must be quite a well if must mind own business leave to mind mine want monitor will have none mistake mr tyrrel be minding own

not estate own what signifies calling mine if be not to have direction of sir pay for what have owe man penny will not put estate to nurse to best wear head be very true said mr falkland avoiding direct notice of last word of mr tyrrel that there be distinction of rank believe that distinction be good thing necessary to peace of mankind however necessary may be must acknowledge that put hardship upon lower order of society make one heart ache to think that one man be born to inheritance of superfluity while whole share of without demerit of be drudgery starving that be indispensable be rich mr tyrrel must do thing in power to lighten yoke of unfortunate people must not use advantage accident have given with unmerciful hand poor wretch be pressed almost beyond bearing a be if unfeelingly give turn to machine will be crushed into atom picture be not without effect even upon obdurate mind of mr tyrrel well sir be tyrant know very well that tyranny be bad thing infer from thence that people be to do a please never meet with desert mr tyrrel see that be shaken in animosity suffer to hail new born benevolence of nature go with to hawkins let talk of desert poor fellow have suffered almost that human nature can endure let forgiveness upon occasion be earnest of good neighbourhood friendship between sir will not go own there be something in what say always knew have wit to make good own story tell plausible tale will not be come over thus have be character when have once conceived scheme of vengeance never to forego will not change that character took up hawkins when body forsook made man of ungrateful rascal have only insulted for pain curse if ever forgive must be good jest indeed if be to forgive insolence of own creature at desire of man like have be perpetual plague for god sake mr tyrrel have reason in resentment let suppose hawkins have behaved unjustifiably insulted be that offence that never can be expiated must father be ruined son hanged to

nobody entreaty own sir never will if family be at foot must order to be hanged next minute if power be a good a will be decision be mr tyrrel be ashamed of almighty god to hear talk give one loathing for institution regulation of society must induce one to fly very face of man society cast out man abominates wealth rank can buy out stain will live deserted in midst of specie will go into crowded society one will deign so much a to salute will fly from glance a must from gaze of basilisk where do expect to find heart of flint that will sympathise with yours have stamp of misery incessant

neighbour a wretch with whom be impossible even to enter into contention for latter remained for present motionless petrified glowing enthusiasm of mr falkland be such a might well have unnerved stoutest foe mr tyrrel in spite of be blasted with compunction of guilt unable to string for contest picture mr falkland have drawn be prophetic described what mr tyrrel chiefly feared what in commencement thought already felt be responsive to whispering of own meditation simply gave body voice to spectre haunted to terror of be hourly prey by by however recovered more have be temporarily confounded fiercer be resentment when came to such hatred never existed in human bosom without marking progress with violence death mr tyrrel however felt inclination to have recourse to personal defiance be furthest in world from coward genius sunk before genius of falkland left vengeance to disposal of circumstance be secure that animosity must never be forgotten diminished by interposition

representation even by authority to compel to quit apartment of patient be uncontrollable at length found that must probably do more injury by violence must be necessary to separate from suffering innocent than by allowing to follow inclination eye be thousand time turned with most eager curiosity upon countenance of doctor wilson without daring to breathe question respecting opinion lest must answer by communication of most fatal tidings in mean time listened with deepest attention to thing dropped either from physician nurse hoping to collect a be from oblique hint intelligence have not courage expressly to require towards morning state of patient seemed to take favourable turn dozed for near two hour when awoke appeared perfectly calm sensible understanding mr falkland have brought physician to attend be in neighbourhood requested to see mr falkland have gone in mean time with one of tenant to bail debt now entered prison to enquire whether young lady might be safely removed from present miserable residence to more airy commodious apartment when appeared sight of revived in mind of miss melville imperfect recollection of wandering of delirium covered face with finger

must not contrive to outlive trifling misfortune to have be subjected while said be still extremely weak tried to assume cheerful countenance be faint effort feeble state of frame did not seem sufficient to support mr falkland doctor joined to request to keep quiet avoid for present occasion of exertion encouraged by appearance mr hammond ventured to follow two gentleman out of room in order to learn from physician what hope entertained doctor wilson acknowledged that found patient at first in very unfavourable situation that symptom be changed for better that be not without expectation of recovery added however that must answer for nothing that next twelve hour must be exceedingly critical that if did not grow worse before morning must then undertake for life mr hammond who have hitherto seen nothing despair now became frantic with joy burst into tear of transport blessed physician in most emphatic impassioned term uttered thousand extravagancy doctor wilson seized opportunity to press to give little repose to consented bed being first procured for in room next to miss melville having charged nurse to give notice of alteration in state of patient mr hammond enjoyed uninterrupted sleep of several hour be already night when be awaked by unusual bustle in next room listened for few moment then determined to go discover occasion of a opened door for purpose

short duration calm of morning proved to be only sort of lightening before death in few hour patient grew worse bloom of countenance faded drew breath with difficulty eye became fixed doctor wilson came in at period immediately perceived that be over be for time in convulsion subsiding addressed physician with composed though feeble voice thanked for attention expressed most lively sense of obligation to mr falkland sincerely forgave cousin hoped might never be visited by too acute recollection of barbarity to must have be contented to live few person have sincerer relish of pleasure of life be well pleased to die rather than have become wife of grime a mr hammond entered turned countenance towards with affectionate expression repeated name be last word in le than two hour from time breathed last in arm of faithful friend chapter xi such be fate of miss emily melville perhaps tyranny never exhibited more painful memorial of detestation in deserves to be held idea irresistibly excited in spectator of scene be that of regarding mr tyrrel a most diabolical wretch have ever dishonoured human form very attendant upon house of oppression for scene be acted upon too public stage not to be generally understood expressed astonishment disgust at unparalleled cruelty if such be feeling of men bred to commission of injustice be difficult to say what must have be of mr falkland

indignation against law of universe did not permit to crush such reptile at blow a must crush so many noxious insect be necessary to guard like madman whole office of judging what be proper to be done under present circumstance devolved upon doctor wilson doctor be man of cool methodical habit of acting one of first idea suggested to be that miss melvile be branch of family of tyrrel did not doubt of willingness of mr falkland to discharge expense might be further incident to melancholy remains of unfortunate victim conceived that law of fashion decorum required notification of event to be made to head of family perhaps too have eye to interest in profession be reluctant to expose to resentment of person of mr tyrrel consideration in neighbourhood with weakness have feeling in common with rest of world must have suffered considerable violence before must have persuaded to be messenger beside did not think right in present situation to leave mr falkland doctor wilson sooner mentioned idea than seemed to make sudden impression on mr hammond earnestly requested that might be permitted to carry intelligence proposal be unexpected doctor did not very obstinately refuse assent be determined said to see what sort of impression catastrophe must make upon author of promised to comport with moderation civility journey be soon performed be come sir said to mr tyrrel to inform that

a pleased reproach of mr hammond be first instance in mr tyrrel be made to drink full cup of retribution be however only specimen of long series of contempt abhorrence insult be reserved for word of mr hammond be prophetic evidently appeared that though wealth hereditary elevation operate a apology for many delinquency there be so irresistibly address to indignation of mankind that like death level distinction reduce perpetrator to equality with most indigent squalid of specie against mr tyrrel a tyrannical unmanly murderer of emily who dared not venture unreserved avowal of sentiment muttered curse deep not loud while rest joined in universal cry of abhorrence execration stood astonished at novelty of situation accustomed a have be to obedience trembling homage of mankind have imagined must be perpetual that excess on part must ever be potent enough to break enchantment now looked round saw sullen detestation in face with difficulty restrained upon slightest provocation

embraced opportunity trusting if must now effect re establishment that must easily preserve ground have gained even in face of formidable rival mr tyrrel be not deficient in courage conceived present to be too important epoch in life to allow to make unnecessary risk in chance for future ease importance there be sort of bustle took place at entrance into assembly having be agreed by gentleman of assembly mr tyrrel be to be refused admittance a person with whom did not choose to associate vote have already be notified to by letter by master of ceremony intelligence be rather calculated with man of mr tyrrel disposition to excite defiance than to overawe at door of assembly be personally met by master of ceremony who have perceived arrival of equipage who now endeavoured to repeat prohibition be thrust aside by mr tyrrel with air of native authority ineffable contempt a entered eye be turned upon presently gentleman in room assembled round endeavoured to hustle others began to expostulate found secret effectually to silence one set to shake off other muscular form well known eminence of intellectual power long habit to man be formed of acknowledging ascendancy be in favour considered a playing desperate stake have roused energy possessed to enable to do justice to so interesting transaction disengaged from insect at first pestered paced up down room with magisterial stride flashed angry glance on side then broke silence if one have thing to say to must know where how to answer must advise such person however to consider well what be about if man imagined have thing personally to complain of be very well did expect that nobody there must be ignorant raw enough to meddle with what be business of theirs intrude into concern of man private family being sort of defiance one gentleman advanced to answer be first began to speak mr tyrrel by expression of countenance peremptory tone by well timed interruption pertinent insinuation caused first to hesitate then to be silent seemed to be fast advancing to triumph have promised whole company be astonished felt same abhorrence condemnation of character must not help admiring courage resource displayed upon present occasion must without difficulty have concentred afresh indignant feeling seemed to want leader at critical moment mr falkland entered room mere accident have enabled to return sooner than expected mr tyrrel reddened at sight of other advanced towards mr tyrrel without moment pause in peremptory voice asked what did there here what do mean by place be a free to a be last person to whom will deign to give account of sir place be not free to know have be voted out be right infamous conduct have forfeited mr what do call if have anything to say to choose proper time place think to put on bullying air under shelter of company will not endure be mistaken sir public scene be only place where can have thing to say to if must not hear universal indignation of mankind must not come into society of men miss melville shame upon inhuman unrelenting tyrant can hear name not sink into earth can retire into solitude not see pale patient ghost rising to reproach can recollect virtue

pitiful figure do make at moment do think that thing must bring so hardened wretch a be to shrink from reproach if conscience be not in confederacy with reproached be fool enough to believe that obstinacy however determined must enable to despise keen rebuke of justice go shrink into miserable self begone let never be blasted with sight again here incredible a may appear mr tyrrel began to obey imperious censurer look be full of wildness horror limb trembled tongue refused office felt power of resisting impetuous torrent of reproach be poured upon hesitated be ashamed of own defeat seemed to wish to deny struggle be ineffectual attempt perished in moment be made general voice be eager to abash a confusion became more visible outcry increased swelled gradually to hootings tumult

with intention of dragging along floor passed in moment gentleman present have not time to recover surprise now interfered mr tyrrel once more quitted apartment be difficult to conceive event more terrible to individual upon whom fell than treatment mr falkland in instance experienced passion of life be calculated to make feel more acutely have repeatedly exerted uncommon energy prudence to prevent misunderstanding between mr tyrrel from proceeding to extremity in vain be closed with catastrophe exceeding that have feared that most penetrating foresight must have suggested to mr falkland disgrace be worse than death slightest breath of dishonour must have stung to very soul what must have be with complication of ignominy base humiliating public must mr tyrrel have understood evil

of following day endeavoured to take advice slumber be unrefreshing disturbed suffered however reduction of courage singularity of situation conjecture with respect to present eagerness for future did not allow to sink into languid inactive state next morning first person saw be mr forester told that did not yet know what mr falkland have to allege against for that have refused to know have arrived at house of brother by appointment on preceding day to settle indispensable business intention having be to depart moment business be finished a knew that conduct on part must be most agreeable to mr falkland be sooner come than found whole house in confusion alarm of elopement having be given few hour before mr falkland have despatched servant in direction in pursuit of servant from market town arrived at same moment with mr forester with intelligence that person answering description gave have be there very early in morning enquiring respecting stage to london mr falkland seemed extremely disturbed at information exclaimed on with acrimony a unthankful unnatural villain mr forester replied have more command of sir villain be serious appellation must not be trifled with englishman be free man be to be charged with villainy because change one source of subsistence for mr falkland shook head with smile expressive of acute sensibility said brother be dupe of art always considered with eye of suspicion be aware of depravity have just discovered stop sir interrupted mr forester own thought that in moment of acrimony might be employing harsh epithet in sort of random style if have serious accusation to state must not be told of till be known whether lad be within reach of hearing be indifferent about good opinion of others be what world bestows retracts with so little

inflexible in treatment of offender severity exercise in sequel must be accompanied with impartiality caution in what be preliminary while mr forester related to particular observed ready to break out into of expression narrative suggested must not suffer to speak said must not hear mr falkland against can not hear in defence come to at present to speak not to hear thought right to warn of danger have nothing more to do now reserve what have to say to proper time make best story can for true if truth a hope will serve purpose if not most plausible ingenious can invent be what self defence requires from man where a always happens to man upon trial have whole world against have own battle to fight against world farewell god send good deliverance if mr falkland accusation whatever be will appear premature depend upon having more zealously friend than ever if not be last act of friendship will ever receive from may be believed that address so singular so solemn so big with conditional menace did not greatly tend to encourage be totally ignorant of charge to be advanced against not little astonished when be in power to be in most formidable degree accuser of mr falkland to find principle of equity so completely reversed a for innocent instructed individual to be party accused suffering instead of having a be natural real criminal at mercy be still more astonished at superhuman power mr falkland seemed to posse of bringing object of persecution within sphere of authority reflection attended with check to eagerness boldness of spirit now constituted ruling passion of mind be time for meditation to sufferer course of event be taken out of direction be hurried along with irresistible force without finding within compass of effort to check rapidity be allowed only short time to recollect when trial commenced be conducted to library where have passed so many happy so many contemplative hour found there mr forester three four of servant already assembled in expectation of accuser thing be calculated to suggest to that must trust only in justice of party concerned have nothing to hope from indulgence mr falkland entered at one door almost a soon a entered at other chapter x began have be principle of life never to inflict wilful injury upon thing life need not express regret when find obliged to be promulgator of criminal charge how gladly must pas unnoticed evil have sustained owe to society to detect offender prevent other men from being imposed upon a have be by appearance of integrity must be better interrupted mr forester to speak directly to point ought not though unwarily by apologising for ourselves to create at time prejudice against individual against whom criminal accusation will always be prejudice enough strongly suspect continued mr falkland young man who have be peculiarly object of kindness of having robbed to considerable amount what replied mr forester be ground of suspicion first of be actual loss have sustained in note jewel plate have missed bank note to amount of nine hundred pound three gold repeater of considerable value complete set of diamond property of late mother several other article why continued arbitrator astonishment grief desire to retain self possession strong contending in countenance voice do fix on young man a instrument of depredation found on coming home upon day when thing be in disorder from alarm of fire in very act of quitting private apartment where article be deposited be confounded at seeing hastened to withdraw a soon a possibly must did say nothing to take notice of confusion sudden appearance produced asked what be errand in place be at first so terrified overcome that must not answer afterwards with good deal of faltering said that when servant be engaged in endeavouring to save most valuable part of property have come hither with same view that have a yet removed nothing did immediately examine to see thing be safe be accustomed to confide in honesty be suddenly called away in present instance to attend to increasing progress of flame therefore only took out key from door of apartment having first locked putting in pocket hastened to go where presence seemed indispensably necessary how long be before missed property same evening hurry of scene have driven circumstance entirely out of mind till going by accident near apartment whole affair together with singular equivocal behaviour of williams rushed at once upon recollection immediately entered examined trunk in thing be contained to astonishment found lock broken property gone what step did take upon discovery sent for williams talked to very seriously upon subject have now perfectly recovered self command calmly stoutly denied knowledge of matter urged with enormousness of offence made impression did not discover surprise indignation one must have expected from person entirely innocent uneasiness generally attends upon guilt be rather silent reserved then informed must proceed in manner different from what might perhaps expect must not a be too frequent in such case make general search for have rather lose property for ever without redress than expose multitude of innocent person to anxiety injustice suspicion for present unavoidably fixed upon in matter of so great consequence be determined not to act upon suspicion must neither incur possibility of ruining being innocent be instrument of exposing others to depredation if guilty must therefore merely insist upon continuing in service might depend upon must be well watched trusted whole truth must eventually appear since avoided confession now advised to consider how far be likely must come off with impunity at last determined on that moment attempted escape must consider that a indication of guilt proceed accordingly what circumstance have occurred from time to present none upon can infer certainty of guilt several agree to favour suspicion from time williams be perpetually uneasy in situation always desirous a now appears to escape afraid to adopt measure without certain precaution be not long after that mr forester became visitor observed with dissatisfaction growing intercourse between reflecting on equivocalness of character attempt must probably make to render dupe of hypocrisy accordingly threatened severely believe observed change presently after occurred in behaviour with relation to did appeared at time mysterious extraordinary time after a well know rencounter took place between whether accidental intentional on part be not able to say when confessed to uneasiness of mind without discovering cause openly proposed to to assist in flight stand in case of necessity between resentment offered seems to take into service nothing a acknowledged must answer purpose did not place retreat wholly out of power to discover did not appear extraordinary to that must hope for effectual protection from while remained perpetually in power to satisfy of unworthiness perhaps have hope must not proceed to step at least so long a place of retreat must be unknown to of consequence event of proceeding dubious perhaps confided in own power be far from contemptible to construct plausible tale especially a have taken care to have first impression in favour after protection on part be merely reserved in case other expedient failed doe not appear to have have other sentiment upon subject than if be defeated in project for placing beyond reach of justice be better to have bespoken place in patronage than to be destitute of resource mr falkland having thus finished evidence called upon robert valet to confirm part of related to day of fire robert stated that happened to be coming through library day few minute after mr falkland being brought home by sight of fire that have found standing there with mark of perturbation fright that must not help stopping to notice that have spoken to two three time before must obtain answer that must get from at last be be most miserable creature alive further said that in evening of same day mr falkland called into private apartment adjoining to library bid bring hammer nail then showed trunk standing in apartment with lock fastening broken ordered to observe remember what saw not to mention to one robert did not at time know what mr falkland intended by direction be given in manner uncommonly solemn significant entertained doubt that fastening be broken wrenched by application of chisel such like instrument with intention of forcibly opening trunk mr forester observed upon evidence that a much of a related to day of fire seemed indeed to afford powerful reason for suspicion that circumstance have occurred since strangely concurred to fortify suspicion meantime that nothing proper to be done might be omitted asked whether in flight have removed box to see whether by mean trace must be discovered to confirm imputation mr falkland treated suggestion slightly saying that if be thief have doubt taken precaution to obviate so palpable mean of detection to mr forester only replied that conjecture however skilfully formed be not always realised in action behaviour of mankind ordered that box trunk if found must be brought into library listened to suggestion with pleasure uneasy confounded a be at appearance combined against trusted in appeal to give new face to cause be eager to declare place where property be deposited servant guided by direction presently produced what be enquired for two box be first opened contained nothing to confirm accusation against in third be found watch several jewel be immediately known to be property of mr falkland production of seemingly decisive evidence excited emotion of astonishment concern person astonishment appeared to be greater than of mr falkland must have left stolen good behind must of have appeared incredible when be considered what secure place of concealment have found for wonder diminished mr forester observed that be by mean impossible might conceive easier to obtain possession of afterwards than to remove at period of precipitate flight here however thought necessary to interfere fervently urged right to fair impartial construction asked mr forester whether be probable if have stolen thing must not have contrived at least to remove along with again whether if have be conscious must found among property must myself have indicated place where have concealed insinuation conveyed against mr forester impartiality overspread whole countenance for instant with flush of anger impartiality young man yes be sure from will experience impartial treatment god send may answer purpose presently will be heard at full in own defence expect to believe innocent because did not remove thing along with money be removed where sir be that can not answer for inconsistences oversight of human mind least of if mind must appear to be disturbed with consciousness of guilt observe that be by own direction box trunk have be found that be indeed extraordinary appears little le than infatuation to what purpose appeal to probability conjecture in face of incontestable fact there sir be box alone knew where be to be found alone have key tell then how watch jewel came to be contained in be silent to rest of person present seemed to be merely subject of detection in reality be of spectator individual who be most at loss to conceive through stage of scene what must come next who listened to word be uttered with most uncontrollable amazement amazement however alternately yielded to indignation horror at first must not refrain from repeatedly attempting to interrupt be checked in attempt by mr forester presently felt how necessary be to future peace must collect whole energy of mind to repel charge assert innocence thing being now produced must be produced against mr forester turned to with look of concern pity told that now be time if chose to allege thing in defence in reply to invitation spoke nearly a follows be innocent be in vain that circumstance be accumulated against there be not person upon earth le capable than of thing of be accused appeal to heart appeal to look appeal to sentiment tongue ever uttered must perceive that fervour with spoke made impression upon one heard in moment eye be turned upon property lay before countenance changed proceeded one thing more must aver mr falkland be not deceived perfectly know that be innocent have sooner uttered word than involuntary cry of indignation burst from person in room mr forester turned to with look of extreme severity said young man consider well what be doing be privilege of party accused to say think proper will take care that will enjoy privilege in utmost extent do think will conduce in respect to benefit to throw out such insolent intolerable insinuation thank most sincerely replied for caution well know what be be doing make declaration not merely because be solemnly true because be inseparably connected with vindication be party accused will be told that be not to be believed in own defence can produce other witness of innocence therefore call upon mr falkland to be evidence ask did never boast to in private of power to ruin did never say that if once brought on weight of displeasure fall must be irreparable did not tell that though must prepare in case tale however plausible however true must take care that whole world must execrate a impostor be not very word did not add that innocence must be of service to that laughed at so feeble defence ask further did not receive letter from morning of day on departed requesting consent to departure must have done that if flight have be that of thief challenge man to reconcile expression of letter with accusation must have begun with stating have conceived desire to quit service if desire reason for have be of nature be now alleged must have dared to ask for what reason be thus subjected to eternal penance saying took out copy of letter laid open upon table mr falkland returned immediate answer to interrogation mr forester turned to said well sir what be reply to challenge of servant mr falkland answered mode of defence scarcely call for reply answer held such conversation never used such word received such letter surely be sufficient refutation of criminal charge that criminal repels what be alleged against with volubility of speech intrepidity of manner mr forester then turned to if said trust vindication to plausibility of tale must take care to render consistent complete have not told be cause of confusion anxiety in robert professes to have found why be so impatient to quit service of mr falkland how account for certain article of property being found in possession sir answered be true there be certain part of story have not told if be told must not conduce to disadvantage must make present accusation appear still more astonishing can not a yet at least prevail upon to tell be necessary to give particular precise reason why must wish to change place of residence of know unfortunate state of mr falkland mind know sternness reservedness distance of manner if have other reason surely must afford small presumption of criminality must wish to change service for question of how article of mr falkland property came to be found in possession be more material be question be wholly unable to answer being found there be at least a unexpected to a to one of person now present only know that a have most perfect assurance of mr falkland being conscious of innocence for observe shrink from assertion reiterate with new confidence therefore firmly from soul believe that being there be of mr falkland contrivance sooner said than be again interrupted by involuntary exclamation from one present looked at with furious glance a if must have torn to piece proceeded have now answered thing be alleged against mr forester be lover of justice conjure not to violate in person be man of penetration look at do see of mark of guilt recollect have ever passed under observation be compatible with mind capable of what be now alleged against must real criminal have shown so unabashed composed firm a have now done fellow servant mr falkland be man of rank fortune be master be poor country lad without friend in world be ground of real difference to certain extent be not sufficient ground for subversion of justice remember be in situation be not to be trifled with decision given against now in case in solemnly assure be innocent will for ever deprive of reputation peace of mind combine whole world in league against determine perhaps upon liberty life if believe if see if know that be innocent speak for suffer pusillanimous timidity to prevent from saving fellow creature from destruction who doe not deserve to have human being for enemy why have power of speech to communicate thought will never believe that man conscious of innocence can not make other men perceive that have that thought feel that whole heart tell be not guilty of what be imputed to to mr falkland have nothing to say know know that be impenetrable at very moment that be urging such odious charge against admire resolution forbearance have nothing to hope from can look upon ruin without pity remorse be most unfortunate indeed in having to do with adversary oblige to say ill thing of appeal to own heart whether language be that of exaggeration revenge thing must be alleged on side being now concluded mr forester undertook to make remark upon whole williams said charge against be heavy direct evidence strong corroborating circumstance numerous striking grant that have shown considerable dexterity in answer will learn young man to cost that dexterity however powerful may be in certain case will avail little against stubbornness of truth be fortunate for mankind that empire of talent have limitation that be not in power of ingenuity to subvert distinction of right wrong
