elegant graceful manner be singularly polite uniformly unembarassed voice be melodious be eminently endowed by nature with gift of eloquence person of penetration will therefore readily imagine that society be courted by fair propensity to tender passion appears to have be very great of consequence lay out in gallantry can by mean approve such dear count appears to to be genuine impartial character of new friend good nature benevolence pliableness of disposition may surely be allowed to compensate for many defect can indeed by mean supply place of st julian can not look up to a guide

cause of virtue will trust be abundantly sufficient to set poor temptation at defiance world before entered appeared to more formidable than really be have filled with bugbear of wild imagination have supposed that mankind made business to prey upon other pardon amiable friend if take liberty to say that st julian be more suspicious than needed to have be when supposed that naples must deprive of simplicity innocence grew up in breast under fostering hand at palermo letter iv count de st julian to marquis of pescara palermo rejoice with sincerely upon pleasure begin to find in city of naples may all day of rinaldo be happy path be strewed with flower must have be truly to be lamented that melancholy must have preyed upon person so young so distinguished by fortune that must have sighed amidst magnificence of naples for uncultivated plainness of palermo so long a reside here absence will constantly make feel uneasy void be earnest wish that not particle of uneasiness may reach friend surely dear marquis there be few correspondent so young a who address personage so distinguished a that deal with so much honest simplicity devote so large share of communication to forbidding seriousness of advice have accepted first effort of friendship with generosity candour will doubt not continue to behold sincerity with favourable eye will venture to say that be sorry have commenced so intimate connexion with marquis of san severino even character of with have favoured represents to wary sight a too agreeable not to be dangerous have heard of from others much more unpleasing account ala friend under how fair outside be most pernicious principle often concealed honest heart must not suspect that appearance of politeness frequently cover most rooted selfishness man who be gentleness compliance abroad be often tyrant among domestic attendant upon court put on face a put on clothes be only after very long acquaintance after having observed in most unguarded hour that can make smallest discovery of real character remember dear rinaldo maxim of incomparable philosopher of geneva man be not naturally amiable if human character shews le pleasing attractive in obscurity of retreat among unfinished personage of college believe native of court be not whit more disinterested have more of reality of friendship true difference be that one wear disguise other appear a be mean however to impute fault have mentioned to marquis of san severino be probably in vulgar sense of word good natured a have already expressed know not how to refuse request contradict present inclination of with whom be connected say rightly that gallantry be such a can by mean approve be if be not greatly misinformed in utmost degree loose debauched in principle greater part of time be spent in haunt of intemperance under roof of courtezan be afraid indeed have gone farther than that have not scrupled to ruin innocence practise art of seduction there be dear rinaldo specie of careless youthful vice assumes appearance of gentleness wear garb of generosity even pretend to name of virtue cast down sacred barrier of religion laugh to scorn suspicious vigilance that trembling sensibility be very characteristic of virtue represents fault of man may be guilty without malignity a innocent endeavour to appropriate to comprehensiveness of view true fortitude liberal generosity believe friend be enemy from have most to fear be not barefaced degeneracy can seduce must be introduced under specious name must disguise like something that nature taught to approve must steal away heart at unawares letter v answer naples can never sufficiently acknowledge friendship appears in line of obliging epistle even where attachment be rouzed without sufficient cause be only upon account more conspicuous took liberty dear count immediately after receiving last to come to explanation with san severino mentioned to circumstance in letter a affair have be casually hinted to told be persuaded must excuse freedom a be certain there be misinformation must not omit opportunity of putting in power to justify marquis expressed utmost astonishment vowed by be sacred that be innocent of most important part of charge told that be ill fortune supposed be not singular to have enemy made business to misrepresent circumstance of conduct have be calumniated cruelly calumniated must discover author of aspersion must vindicate honour with sword in fine explained whole business in manner a though must not entirely approve yet evinced to be by mean subversive of general amiableness of character how deplorable be situation in be placed when even generous candid temper of st julian can be induced to think of young nobleman in light doe not deserve to impute to baseness from heart be free soon after interview be introduced by new friend into society of more mixed equivocal kind than have seen however impute to marquis surprize of be not guilty fairly stated to of what person company be to be composed idle curiosity perhaps particular gaiety of humour under influence of then be induced to accept of invitation if did wrong dear count blame blame without reserve if may judge from disposition in left house only derived new reinforcement to resolution with conversation example first inspired be in evening after opera company be composed of several of young nobility equal number of female performer other lady of same reputation almost immediately broke into tete tetes of consequence one of lady addressed particularly to vulgar familiarity of manner undisguised libidinousness of conversation must own disgusted though pretend to be devoid of passion incident to age be not at pleased with address of female a companion be more active in choice of associate may perhaps be only candid to own be not most pleasing in circle consciousness of eye of whole party embarrassed aukward attempt made to detach from enamorata a proved unsuccessful so served to excite general smile san severino however presently perceived situation observing be by mean satisfied with fortune with utmost politeness broke away from company attended home how be dear friend vice whose property must seem to be to hesitate to tremble must be able to assume air of confidence composure how be that innocence surely must always triumph be thus liable to confusion perplexity of guilt why be virtue chosen because be parent of honour because enables man to look in face aspersion of calumny to remain firm undejected amidst fortune have of adverse capricious be advantage merely imaginary be composure self approbation common to upright wicked do who be most hardened really posse superiority can conscious guilt bid defiance to shame while rectitude be continually liable to hide head in confusion letter vi same to same naples will recollect st julian promised to confess to fault folly to take for umpire director of conduct perhaps have done wrong perhaps though unconscious of error be how other misled need faithful hand to lead back again to road of integrity why be that feel reluctance to state to whole of conduct be sensation to have hitherto be stranger in spite of obliges to mistrust have discovered reason be that educated in solitude immured in wall of college have not learned to make allowance for situation passion of mankind dear count have long agreed that morality of priest be to be distrusted that be too often founded upon sinister view private interest that have none of comprehension of thought that manly enthusiasm be characteristic of genuine moral philosopher what have penance pilgrimage what have bead cross vow made in opposition to instinct of nature obedience subversive of original independency of human mind to do with virtue thus far amiable friend advanced yet be afraid have not advanced far enough be told there be honesty honour preserve man character free from impeachment be perfectly separate from sublime goodness that have always admired to sentiment be by mean reconciled to speak more immediately to subject intended what can be more justifiable reasonable than conformity to original propensity of nature be true propensity may by undue cultivation be so much increased a to be productive of most extensive mischief man who for sake of indulging corporeal appetite neglect valuable pursuit important avocation can not be too warmly censured be le true that passion of sex for other exists in most innocent uncorrupted heart can then be reasonable to condemn moderate indulgence of passion a interrupt employment impedes pursuit indulgence in present civilized state of society requires infringement of order depravation of character legislator of country whose wisdom may surely be considered a somewhat greater than of priest have judiciously overlooked imagined irregularity amongst penalty have ambitiously too often without sentiment humanity heaped together against offence of society have suffered to pas unnoticed why must be more harsh rigorous than be inconsistent with logic candour to argue against use of thing from abuse of what mischief can moderate gratification of appetite be source doe not indeed romantically seek to reclaim class of woman whom sober man acknowledges to be irreclaimable with benevolence be congenial to comprehensive mind pity with error contributes to preserve from misery distress famine from what have now said believe will have already suspected of what nature be particular in conduct set out with intention of confessing may be merit demerit in instance will not hide from that marquis of san severino be original cause of what have done be already sufficiently acquainted with freedom of sentiment upon subject be professed devotee of sex suffers passion to engross much larger share of time than can by mean approve incited by exhortation have in measure imitated conduct at same time have endeavoured not to fall into same excess believe that will treat more regularly in manner of confessor render more master of subject by relating to step by have be led to act to justify formerly used to condemn have already told how aukward felt situation in first society of gayer kind into friend introduced though politely freed from present embarassment must not help rallying upon rustic appearance made apologized for ill fortune have experienced promised to introduce to mistress beautiful a day sprightly ingenious a sappho must do be unwilling to break with most amiable companion have found in city of naples be staggered with reasoning eloquence will acknowledge truth be mortified at singular uncouth figure have made felt actuated with social sympathy made wish to resemble of own rank age in thing be not seriously criminal be involuntarily incited by warm description san severino gave of beauty attraction of lady recommended must not confess st julian setting nature of business quite out of question that there be something highly disinterested in behaviour of marquis upon occasion left companion pleasure to accommodate to weakness managed own character so little a to undertake to recommend to female friend seems to have neglected interest of own pleasure entirely in order to introduce to woman inferior in accomplishment to none of sex letter vii same to same naples must ever have imagined dear count in so short time correspondence between must have be so much neglected have yet received answer to last letter upon subject particularly interesting in have reason to fear disapprobation st julian life in obscurity of retreat in solitude most favourable to literary pursuit what avocation can have called off attention from interest of friend may be permitted however to draw one conclusion from silence that consider situation a critical alarming that although join prudent severity of monitor with candid partiality of friend yet view fault in venial light be disposed to draw over veil of indulgence might perhaps deduce fairer apology for silence on part from new situation avocation incident to rank fortune pleasure abound in city court so celebrated a of naples will not attempt apology novelty of circumstance have diverted attention more than ought from companion of study friend of youth trust will never forget have met with companion more gay consort more obsequious have never found character so worthy friend so sincere since last addressed st julian have be engaged in various scene of pleasurable serious kind think be guilty of undue partiality to own conduct when assure have embarked in lighter pursuit of associate of own age without having at time forgotten what be due to lustre of ancestry favour of sovereign have not injured reputation have mingled business pleasure so a not to sacrifice occupies first place to hold only second trust st julian know too well to suppose must separate philosophy practice reason action from other be by instruction of friend learned to rise superior to power of prejudice to reject truth because be novel to refuse ear to argument because be not backed by pompous venerable name in pursuance of system have ventured in last to suggest reason in favour of moderate indulgence of youthful pleasure perhaps however dear count will think that be going beyond what even reason must authorize in instance be about to relate be not probably to be informed that there be certain kind of necessary people dependent upon such young nobleman a san severino friend upon whom world have bestowed denomination of pimp one of gentleman seemed of late to feel particular partiality to myself endeavoured by several little instance of officiousness to become useful to at length told of young person extremely beautiful innocent whose first favour believed must engage to procure in behalf at idea started do think good friend said because be acquainted with having indulged to of pleasure inseparable from age must presume to ruin innocence be mean of bringing upon young person so much remorse unhappy way of life a must be inevitable consequence of step of kind lord replied parasite pretend to be great casuist in matter honour of san severino doe know seldom give way to scruple of kind in instance have mentioned there be several thing to be said mother of lady who formerly moved in higher sphere than doe at present never maintained very formidable character daughter be fruit of indiscriminate amour though be perfectly satisfied have not yet be blown upon by breath of mortal education have be such a to prepare to follow venerable example of mother lordship therefore see that in case will wrong parent seduce child that will merely gather harvest already ripe will be infallibly reaped by first comer though reason of convenient gentleman made

have opportunity of seeing perhaps conversing little with lady to scheme assented appeared not more than sixteen year of age person be small form be delicate auburn tress hung about neck in great profusion eye sparkled with vivacity even with intelligence dress be elegant graceful not gaudy be impossible that figure must not have have tendency to captivate having contemplated sufficiently at distance approached nearer little gipsey turned up eye askance endeavoured to take sly survey of a advanced accosted behaviour be full of charming hesitation be uniformly offspring of youth inexperience received with pretty complaisance at same time blushed appeared fluttered knew not why involuntarily advanced hand towards gave hers with kind of unreflecting frankness there be good sense simplicity united in appearance few word uttered that pleased even affected such dear friend be present state of amour confess have frequently considered seduction in odious light here think few none of objection against have place mellow fruit be ready to drop from tree seems to solicit friendly hand to gather letter viii count de st julian to marquis of pescara palermo dear lord avocation of agreeable kind with probably will not be long before be sufficiently acquainted have of late entirely engrossed will readily believe that be concern of small importance hindered from proper acknowledgment attention to communication of friend will dismiss own affair for present make few of observation to invite upon content of letter ala rinaldo be so entirely changed since used to wander together among grove vallies along bank of stream now see from window that scarcely know for same where be that simplicity where undisguised attachment to virtue integrity where that unaccommodating system of moral truth used to live in bosom of friend line of character seem to suffer incessant decay will fear that time be hastening when sublime generous spirit will no longer be distinguished from san severinos men of gaiety pleasure of age can look back upon alteration apprehension thus excited say have taken place in six poor month imagine dear lord be that severe monitor rigid censor must give up friend for fault know not how to make allowance for heedless levity of youth can readily suppose man with purest heart most untainted principle drawn aside into temporary error occasion opportunity example accidental dissipation of mind be inlet to vice against perhaps be not in humanity to be always guarded confidence dear friend unsuspicious confidence be first source of error in favour of presumptuous man who wantonly incurs danger brave temptation heaven will not interest there can be mistake more destitute of foundation than supposes man exempt from frailty have not rinaldo trusting too much to own strength laid open to dangerous associate must now have contemplated action have be taught to excuse with disgust horror own heart must never have taught that commodious morality have be induced to patronize feared not felt a assured that firmness of resolution ardour of virtue might set temptation at defiance be ingenuous friend look back acknowledge mistake look back acknowledge that to purest most blameless mind indiscriminate communication be dangerous have much rather dear marquis have once deviated from line of conduct have marked out to than that have undertaken to defend deviation exerted to unlearn principle did honour profess to believe that indulgence of sort be unavoidable temptation to irresistible be man then reduced to par with brute be there single passion of soul doe not then cease to be blameless when be no longer directed restrained by dictate of reason thousand consideration of health of interest of character respecting of

with be exhibited to mind presence of superior must at time restrain from unbecoming action sense of decided interest apprehension of certain very considerable detriment must deprive most flattering temptation of blandishment be not sense apprehension in great degree in power of man tell friend will action in woman be utter extinction of be in man entirely faultless innocent world be not quite so unjust conduct even in sex tends to diminution of character be considered in circle of venerable virtuous a subject of shame concealment if persisted in cause person universally to be considered a alike unfit for arduous pursuit sublime undertaking be possible indeed that society of person in lowest state of profligacy can be desirable for man of family for one who pretend to honour integrity be possible that must not have tendency to pollute idea to debase sentiment to reduce to same rank with if woman have described irreclaimable let at least be remembered that conduct tends to shut up against door of reformation return force upon mode of subsistence might not voluntarily have chosen thus much for first letter second call to subject of greater seriousness magnitude rinaldo make hasty stride indeed scarcely embarked in licentious libertine principle seems to look forward to last consummation of debauchee seduction dear lord be action will yield in horror to crime that ever sprang up in degenerate breast seems action propose to be divested of of aggravation of seduction will acknowledge have friend received crime into bosom in deformity dear a be to must have thrown from
