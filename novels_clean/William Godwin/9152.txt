imogen pastoral romance from ancient british by william godwin preface by william godwin following performance a title import be originally composed in welch language style be elegant pure if translator have not a many of brother have done suffered spirit of original totally to evaporate apprehends will be found to contain much novelty of conception much classical taste great spirit beauty in execution appears under name of cadwallo ancient bard who probably lived at least one hundred year before commencement of common era manner of primitive time seem to be perfectly understood by author be described with air of man who be in utmost degree familiar with be impossible to discover in part of slightest trace of christianity believe will not be disputed that in country so pious a of wale must have be next to impossible for poet though ever so much upon guard to avoid allusion to system of revelation on contrary thing be pagan in perfect conformity with theology be taught to believe prevailed at time reason have induced to admit for long time that be perfectly genuine justly ascribed to amiable druid with respect to difficulty in regard to preservation of so long work for many century by mere force of memory translator together with rest of world have already got over objection in case of celebrated poem of ossian if be not blinded by partiality midwife be apt to conceive for production that be instrument of bringing into world pastoral romance contains a much originality a much poetical beauty be a happily calculated to make deep impression upon memory a fingal temora first thing led to doubt authenticity be striking resemblance appears between plan of work milton celebrated masque at ludlow castle mean however to hold forth circumstance a decisive in condemnation pretension of cadwallo be author of performance be very high to originality if date of romance be previous to of comus may be truly said of author that soared above imitation derived merit from inexhaustible source of own invention milton be well known proposed classical model to in production paradise lost be almost in page imitation of virgil homer lycidas tread closely in step of daphnis gallus of virgil sampson agonistes be formed upon model of sophocles even little piece l'allegro il penseroso have source in song of fletcher two beautiful little ballad be ascribed to shakespeare classical model upon comus be formed have not yet be discovered be infinitely unlike pastoral comedy of italy england if must allow in licence of conjecture be become almost inseparable from character of editor must say that milton having written upon border of wale might have have easy recourse to manuscript whose content be now first given to public that singularity of preserving name of place where be first performed in title of poem be intended for ingenuous well bred acknowledgement of source from whence drew choicest material notwithstanding plausibility of conjecture be now inclined to give up original opinion to ascribe performance to gentleman of wale who lived so late a reign of king third name of amiable person be rice ap thomas romance be certainly at one time in custody be handed down a valuable legacy to descendant among whom present translator have honour to rank rice ap thomas esquire be man of most sweet inoffensive disposition beloved respected by neighbour tenant passing rich with beixty pound year in domestic be elegant hospitable even sumptuous for time country in lived be however naturally of abstemious recluse disposition abounded in singularity be pardoned to harmlessness virtue temper be full of sensibility seriousness melancholy devoted greater part of time to study boasted that have almost complete collection of manuscript remains of welch bard be often heard to prefer even to taliessin merlin aneurim effusion of immortal cadwallo indeed be only subject upon be ever known to dispute with eagerness fervour in midst of controversy must frequently produce passage from pastoral romance a decisive of question to confess truth know not how to excuse piece of jockeyship ill faith even in rice ap thomas whom regard a father of family chief ornament of beloved country reader will probably however be inclined to apologise for conduct of mr thomas to lay equivalent blame to charge will tell that nothing weakest partiality must blind to genuine air of antiquity with composition be where impressed to ascribe to modern writer be conscious to honesty defy malice so far from being sensible of improper bias in favour of ancestor be content to strengthen hand by acknowledging that manuscript be not at desirous of refusing to inspection be richly emblazoned with discoloration rust can possibly desire confess that wording have purity of taliessin expressiveness of aneurim be such a know of modern welchman who must write yet in spite a will probably tell of evidence common sense still aver persuasion that be production of rice ap thomas enough perhaps too much for question of antiquity must be unfair to send into world without saying something of nature of composition be unlike arcadia of sir philip sidney unlike what have just taken trouble of running over daphnis of gessner on one hand leaf behind law of criticism mix together different stage of civilization on other will perhaps be found frigid uninteresting insipid prevailing opinion of pastoral seems to have be that be specie of composition admirably fitted for size of eclogue that nature will not be preserved simplicity will become surfeiting in longer performance accordingly pastoral drama of tasso guarini fletcher however may have be commended by critic admired by credulous train who clap stare whenever be bid have when recommendation of novelty have subsided be little attended to little read great milton have proved that objection be not insuperable comus be master piece of poetical composition be at least equal in kind even to paradise lost be interesting descriptive pathetic fame be continually increasing will be admired wherever name of britain be repeated language of britain be understood if hypothesis respecting date of present performance be admitted must be acknowleged that ingenious mr thomas have taken masque of milton for model reader with whom comus be favourite will certainly trace literal imitation with respect to objection may be made on score to pastoral romance will beg reader to bear in mind that volume before be not original translation recollecting may beside authority of milton others a great poet a ever existed who have imitated homer one at least a much a author have done comus suggest two very weighty apology in first place imitation in certain degree have ever be considered a lawful when made from different language in second imitation come to reader exaggerated by being presented to in english by person who confesses that have long be conversant with greatest poet translator have always admired comus a much a pastoral romance have read together be used to consider a illustrating other verbal coincidence into may have fallen be therefore to be ascribed where be due to not to author upon whole let imperfection of pastoral romance be what will trust will be regarded a making valuable present to connoisseur men of taste agreeable addition to innocent
