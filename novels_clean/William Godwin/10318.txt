still imaged kind of uncertainty in fate must not permit to lay aside thought of damon determined at event to have doubt resolved when there be longer said to herself room for mistake will then know what to do a drew near alcove perceived same figure stretched along bank with eye immoveably fixed upon little fountain rose in corner of scene seemed lost in thought delia approached doubtfully heard
