economy quiet living be frequently upset in time have begun to regard niece with slight feeling of awe yet octavia have not be doing thing at remarkable in own eye considered life pretty dull if elder miss bassett parent grandparent have not be so thoroughly well known so universally respected if social position have not be so firmly established quiet life not quite so highly respectable there be awful possibility that slowbridge might even have gone so far a not to ask out to tea at even lady theobald felt that must not do to slight belinda bassett niece guest to omit customary state tea must have be to crush innocent miss belinda at blow place through medium of young lady who alone deserved condemnation beyond pale of social law be only to be regretted said ladyship that belinda bassett have not arranged thing better relative of such order be certainly to be deplored in secret lucia felt much soft hearted sympathy for miss bassett guest must not help wondering how miss belinda became responsible for calamity have fallen upon really did not seem probable that have be previously consulted a to kind of niece desired that have in distinct manner evinced preference for niece of

party engaged in be afraid octavia observed that never heard much improving conversation be really fonder of masculine society than generality of girl must not help wondering if there must be young men present if indeed there be young men in slowbridge who might possibly be produced upon festive occasion even though ordinarily kept in background have not heard miss belinda mention masculine name so far that of curate of st james when have seen pas house have not found slim black figure faint ecclesiastic whisker especially interesting must be confessed that miss belinda suffered many pang of anxiety in looking forward to young kinswoman first appearance in society tea at lady theobald house constituted formal presentation to slowbridge world young lady within pale of genteel society having arrived at year of discretion on returning home from boarding school be invited to tea at oldclough hall during entire evening be subject of watchful criticism deportment be remarked accomplishment displayed performed last new piece upon piano be drawn into conversation by hostess upon timid modesty of reply reverence of listening attitude depended future social status so be very

matron to daughter a attired must much prefer that must remain near during earlier part of evening before know how young lady may turn out let manner toward be kind not familiar be well to be upon safe side what precise line of conduct be generally anticipated that gold digging silver mining young person must adopt must be difficult to say be sufficient that general sentiment regarding be of distrustful if not timorous nature to miss bassett who felt in very air breathed girl innocence of condition of affair be even little touching with splendor be not at hard to please have quite awakened to interest in impending social event seemed in good spirit talked more than be custom giving miss belinda graphic description of various festal gathering have attended in new york when

manner of young woman from nevada might lead to good result trust conduct will be such a to show that at least have resided in civilized land said men of present day may permit to be amused by young person whose demeanor might bring blush to cheek of woman of forty be not habit to regard with serious intention lucia reddened did not speak though wished very much for courage to utter word rose to lip lately have found that now then at time when be roused to anger speech of quite clever sarcastic nature presented to mind be never equal to uttering aloud felt that in time might because of course be quite advance in spirit to think face even in imagination probability of astounding striking lady theobald dumb with audacity ought to make behave very well be saying now to to have before alternative of not being regarded with serious intention wonder if be mr poppleton francis barold who might not regard seriously wonder if be coarser in america than can be in england when try enjoyed

departure with little silk purse in keeping have carried under clerical vest warmed thrilled heart be heart must be confessed be of most inexperienced susceptible nature little man of affectionate gentle disposition have be given from earliest youth to indulging in timid dream of mild future bliss of bliss represented by lovely being whose ideal be similar to own who preferred wealth of true affection to glitter of giddy throng upon one two occasion have even worshipped from afar a on of occasion hope have be nipped in bud by union of object with hollow worldling dream have so far never attained very serious proportion since have taken up abode in slowbridge have felt little overpowered by circumstance have be source of painful embarrassment to to find innocent presence capable of producing confusion in breast of young lady who be certainly not more guileless than have be conscious that miss egerton did not continue conversation with freedom when chanced to approach group graced have observed same thing in companion additional circumspection of demeanor so to speak touch of new decorum whose object seemed to be to protect from appearance of imprudence be almost a if be afraid of have said to once twice dear hope there be nothing in appearance to lead to be so much alarmed by dreadful thought that have ever afterward approached of young lady with fear trembling have not added either to comfort own consequently path have not be very smooth one respect young lady of slowbridge remarked to octavia very afternoon there be very remarkable young lady here very remarkable indeed be interested in church poor school indeed in thing be most unselfish amiable young lady have usually so much to distract attention from such matter if stay long enough in slowbridge

mr poppleton ardent effort to do credit to teaching that be apparently unconscious of else played with great cleverness carried partner to terminus with eager enjoyment of skill quite pleasant to behold made little dart here there advised directed controlled movement be quite dramatic in small way when made failure mr burnham who be superintending proceeding seated in own easy chair behind window curtain be roused to virtuous indignation by energy there be repose whatever in manner said dignity be game of croquet matter of deep moment seems to that be almost impious to devote one mind so wholly to mere mean of recreation seems to be enjoying mamma said miss laura burnham with faint sigh miss laura have be looking on over parent shoulder seem to be enjoying see how lucia gaston mr burmistone be laughing never saw lucia look like before only one who seems little dull be mr barold be probably disgusted by freedom of manner to be not accustomed replied mr burnham only wonder be that have not be disgusted by before chapter xvii advantage game over octavia deserted partner walked lightly with air of victor to where barold be standing be smiling slightly flushed for moment so

amazed be at once embarrassed delighted at same time must not do to commit to too great seriousness oh answered that be rather good joke thought be said perhaps even tone lower be in earnest then raised eye if told when did thing wrong think might be good thing said felt that be quite possible be also struck with idea that might find task of mentor so long a remained entirely non committal rather interesting still must not afford to descend at once from elevated stand have taken be afraid must find rather tiresome remarked be afraid must answered must have to tell of thing so often do

believe wanted to be at like be very civil speech said barold ironically scarcely thought lady theobald have trained so well meant said octavia may believe did know when people mean thing when wish did said barold octavia turned attention to fan well be waiting said waiting repeated to be told of fault scarcely see of what importance opinion can be be of importance to just now last two word rendered really impatient may be spurred up if be to take lucia gaston a model said lucia gaston must possibly not have be so complaisant in demeanor toward clerical friend complaisant exclaimed opening lovely eye when be actually plunging about garden trying to teach to play well must call that being complaisant lucia gaston replied must not say that have be 'plunging ' about garden gave moment for reflection be true remarked when be over must when compare with slowbridge girl begin to think must say pretty awful thing barold made reply caused to laugh little again dare tell said now do well think want to know very particularly what lady theobald think will last quite good while complaisant be sorry object to word said oh answered like sound so much more polite than to say be flirting being fast be flirting inquired coldly objected to ready serenity very much looked little puzzled be very like aunt belinda said drew up did not think there be point of resemblance at between miss belinda went on without observing movement think thing mean something be of importance said just a aunt belinda say 'what will think ' never occurs to that will think at gracious why must will

very charming person miss bassett be exclaimed after have left gate what very charming person indeed very charming said mr burmistone with much seriousness prettier young person certainly have never seen wonderful gown of hers oh interrupted mr poppleton with natural confusion referred to miss belinda bassett though really what say be very true miss octavia bassett indeed think in fact miss octavia bassett be quite one might almost say even more charming than aunt yes admitted mr burmistone perhaps one might be le ripe be true be objection time will remove there be such delightful gayety in manner said mr poppleton ingenuous frankness such spirit quite carry away with quite walked few step thinking over delightful gayety ingenuous frankness then burst out afresh what remarkable life have have too actually told that once in childhood lived for month in gold digger camp only woman there say men be kind to made pet of have known most extraordinary people in mean time francis barold returned lucia to lady theobald safe keeping having done so made adieu left two to ladyship be must be confessed little at loss to explain to herself what saw fancied saw in manner appearance of young relative be persuaded that have never seen lucia look a looked afternoon have brighter color in cheek than usual pretty figure seemed more erect eye have spirit in be quite new have chatted laughed gayly with francis barold a approached house after departure moved to fro with freedom not habitual to have be making agreeable to said lady with grim pleasure can do if chooses be just man to please girl good looking with fine domineering air how did enjoy asked very much said lucia never more thank oh ejaculated lady of smart new york gown did miss octavia bassett wear be at dinner table instead of looking down at soup lucia looked quietly steadily across table at grandmother wore very pretty one said be pale fawn color fitted like glove made feel very old fashioned badly dressed lady theobald laid down spoon made feel old fashioned badly dressed yes responded lucia always doe wonder what think of thing wear in slowbridge even went to length of smiling little what think of what be worn in slowbridge lady theobald ejaculated may ask what weight opinion of young woman from america from nevada be supposed to have in slowbridge lucia took spoonful of soup in leisurely manner think be supposed to have think mind feel a if must if be in place have always thought very lucky have thought lucky cried lady have envied nevada young woman who dress like actress load with jewel like barbarian girl whose conduct toward men be of character to to chill one blood admire said lucia simply more than admire lydia egerton more than admire do admire demanded lady yes grandmamma replied lucia courageously think do never have lady be so astounded in life for moment must scarcely speak when recovered pointed to door go to room commanded be american freedom of speech suppose go to room lucia rose obediently must not help wondering what ladyship course must be if have hardihood to disregard order really looked quite capable of carrying out forcibly when girl stood at bedroom window few minute later cheek be burning hand trembling be afraid be very badly done said to herself be sure be will be kind of practice be in such hurry to try if be equal to did seem to balance thing quite rightly ought to have waited until have more reason to speak out perhaps there be enough reason then be more aggressive than ought to have be octavia be never aggressive wonder if be at pert think octavia ever mean to be pert felt little a if meant to be pert must learn to balance only be cool frank then looked out of window reflected little be not so very brave after said rather reluctantly did tell mr burmistone be there dare have done be afraid be sly that sound sly be sure chapter xviii contrast lady theobald will put stop to be general remark will certainly not occur again be said upon evening of first gathering upon miss belinda grass plat at same time be prophesied that mr francis barold must soon go away of prophecy proved true mr francis barold did not return to london strange to say lucia be seen again again playing croquet with octavia bassett be even known to spend evening with perhaps might be that appeal made by miss belinda to ladyship have caused to allow of thing miss belinda have in fact made private call upon lady to lay case before feel so very timid about thing said almost with tear so fearful of trusting really find quite trial dear child have kind heart assure have kind heart dear lady theobald be so innocent of intention to do wrong be sure be innocent that seems cruel to judge severely if have have benefit of such training a dear lucia be convinced that conduct must have be most exemplary see that have fault be sure doe said to only last night in odd way of hers have be sitting evidently thinking deeply for minute said ' wonder if must be nicer if be more like lucia gaston see what turn mind must have taken admires lucia so much yesterday evening at dinner said lady theobald severely lucia informed that admired niece feeling seems to be mutual miss belinda colored brightened visibly did indeed exclaimed how pleased octavia will be to hear did indeed then warned by chilliness lack of response in ladyship manner modified delight became apologetic again young people be more be le critical than be sighed be great prettiness think lady theobald interposed that lucia have be taught to feel that body be corruptible subject to decay that mere beauty be of small moment miss belinda sighed again be very true admitted deprecatingly very true indeed be to be hoped that octavia stay in slowbridge will prove beneficial to said ladyship in most judicial manner atmosphere be wholly unlike have surrounded during previous life be sure will prove beneficial to said miss belinda eagerly companionship of well trained refined young people can not fail to be of use to such companion a lucia must be if must kindly permit to spend evening with now then must certainly improve modify greatly mr francis barold be be think of same opinion at least fancied gathered a much from few word let fall francis barold repeated lady theobald what did francis barold say of course be very little hesitated miss belinda must not help seeing that be drawing comparison a be octavia be teaching mr poppleton to play croquet be rather exhilarated perhaps exhibited more freedom of manner in innocent way quite in innocent thoughtless way than be exactly customary saw mr barold glance from to lucia who stood near when said 'you be thinking of contrast between ' answered 'yes differ very greatly be true of course knew that poor octavia must not have advantage in eye feel herself know shocked other day beyond expression by telling that have asked if thought be really fast that be sure did poor child evidently did not comprehend dreadful significance of such term man like francis barold doe understand significance said lady theobald be to be deplored that niece can not be taught what position in society will be if such reputation attache to men of present day fight shy of such character dread clause so impressed poor miss belinda by solemnity that must not forbear repeating to octavia afterward though be to be regretted that did not produce effect have hoped well must say observed that if men fought little shyer than do must mind always do have about dozen dangling around who only bore who will keep asking to go to place sending bouquet asking to dance when ca dance at only tear dress stand on foot if must 'fight shy ' must be splendid to miss belinda who certainly have never be guilty of indecorum of having member of stronger sex dangling about at be very trying dear said say 'you always have ' really seems to make so personal octavia turned around fixed eye wonderingly upon blushing countenance for moment made remark marvellous thought shaping slowly in mind aunt belinda said at length did nobody ever ah dear assure cried miss belinda in greatest possible trepidation ah dear such such thing rarely very rarely happen in slowbridge besides must possibly have thought of must indeed be so overwhelmed with maidenly confusion at appalling thought that did not recover for hour at least octavia feeling that must not be safe to pursue subject only uttered one word of comment gracious chapter xix experiment much to own astonishment lucia found allowed new liberty be permitted to spend afternoon frequently with octavia on several occasion that young lady miss bassett be invited to partake of tea at oldclough in company with other guest than francis barold know what mean think must mean something said lucia to octavia be very pleasant never be allowed to be so intimate with one before perhaps suggested octavia sagely think that if see often enough will get sick of will be lesson to more see of answered lucia with serious little air fonder be of understand better be not at like what thought at first octavia know that there be much to understand in there be great deal to understand in replied be puzzle to often seem so frank yet one know so little about after for instance lucia went on who must imagine that be so affectionate be affectionate asked yes answered lucia be sure be very affectionate have found out gradually must suffer thing for one loved thought matter over yes said at length must be very fond of miss bassett proceeded lucia a if arraigning at bar of justice be very fond of father be sure there be other people be very fond of very fond of indeed octavia pondered seriously again yes there be remarked one must care about here so be not going to make fuss want to make fuss over people l like said lucia be like francis barold in one way be altogether different in francis barold doe not wish to show emotion be so determined to hedge around one ca help suspecting that be always guarding against one seems always to be resenting interference appear to care at so be not natural that one must suspect did not suspect what do suspect of now of thinking great deal answered lucia affectionately of being very clever very good octavia be silent for few moment think said after pause think will find out that be mistake will not returned lucia quite glowing with enthusiasm know will learn great deal from be such startling proposition that octavia felt decidedly uncomfortable flushed rosy red be one who ought to learn thing think said be always doing thing frighten aunt belinda know how rest regard octavia said lucia very naively indeed suppose try to help other if will tell when be wrong will try to to have courage to tell will be good practice for what want most be courage frankness be sure will take courage to make up mind to tell of of mistake octavia regarded with mingled admiration respect think that be splendid idea said be sure faltered lucia be sure wo mind thing may have to say really be quite little thing in hardly worth mentioning tell one of right now said octavia point blank oh exclaimed lucia starting 'd rather not just now well commented octavia sound a if must be pretty unpleasant why want to will be quite a bad to morrow to refuse to tell one be bad beginning look a if be frightened be good practice for to be frightened at little thing lucia felt convicted made effort to regain composure be not said be always way be continually telling will be courageous candid first time thing happens fail will tell one thing stopped short here looked at guiltily be something think must do if if be in place lucia stammered very little thing indeed well remarked octavia anxiously lucia lost breath caught again proceeded cautiously with blush at own daring if be in place said think that perhaps only perhaps know must not wear hair quite so low down over forehead octavia sprang from seat ran to pier glass over mantle glanced at reflection of own startled pretty face then putting hand up to soft blonde bang met brow turned to lucia be becoming asked breathlessly oh yes lucia answered very octavia started then why must wear cried what do mean lucia felt position truly delicate one locked hand braced blushed vividly may sound rather silly when tell why octavia said really do think be sort of reason know in absurd picture of actress bang always seem to be principal feature saw in shop window when went to harriford with grandmamma be such dreadful woman of have so very few clothes on ca help thinking must like to look like doe make look like oh very little answered lucia very little indeed of course be same thing after put in octavia be what mean be so very little faltered lucia that perhaps be reason octavia looked at in glass again be very good reason remarked suppose will do paused looked lucia in face think that be little thing said to be told look like opera bouffe actress did not mean to say so cried lucia filled with most poignant distress beg pardon indeed oh dear be afraid must like felt that be taking great liberty like answered octavia that ca be helped did exactly suppose must be going to say thing about hair when began glancing at poor lucia coiffure though suppose might might say thousand thing about cried lucia piteously know mine be not only in bad taste be ugly unbecoming yes said cruelly be be one other protested lucia know told be pretty octavia octavia walked over to table upon stood miss belinda work basket took therefrom small gleaming pair of scissors returning to mantle glass with how short will cut demanded oh exclaimed lucia for answer octavia raised scissors gave snip be savage snip length width of love lock fell on mantle then gave snip other half fell lucia scarcely dared to breathe for moment octavia stood gazing at with pale face dilated eye then suddenly folly of deed have done seemed to reveal to oh cried out oh how diabolical look turned upon lucia why did make do exclaimed be fault bit of flinging scissors to other end of room threw into chair burst into tear lucia anguish of mind be almost more than must bear for at least three minute felt criminal of deepest dye after three minute have elapsed however began to reason called to mind fact that be failing a usual under crisis be being coward again said to herself be worse than to have said nothing be true that will look more refined now one can see little of forehead be cowardly to be afraid to stand firm when really think so yes will say something to octavia began aloud be sure be making mistake again a decidedly a possible be not very decidedly look very much nicer look ghastly said octavia who began to feel rather absurd forehead have prettiest forehead ever saw octavia said lucia eagerly eyebrow be perfect wish must look at again rather to surprise octavia began to laugh under cover of handkerchief reaction have set in though laugh be trifle hysterical be still laugh next gave eye final little dab rose to go to glass again looked at touched up short waving fringe left on forehead turned to lucia with resigned expression do think that one who be used to seeing other way must must think looked horrid inquired anxiously must think prettier great deal lucia answered earnestly know octavia nothing must be really unbecoming to have kind of face for few second octavia seemed to lose in thought of speculative nature jack always said so remarked at length jack repeated lucia timidly octavia roused smiled with candid sweetness be one knew in nevada explained worked in father mine once must have known very well suggested lucia somewhat awed did replied calmly very well tucked away pocket handkerchief in jaunty pocket at back of basque returned to chair then turned again to lucia well said think have found out that be mistaken have dear suppose tell of something else lucia colored answered be enough for to day chapter xx peculiar to nevada whether not lucia be right in accusing octavia bassett of being clever thinking great deal be riddle who be interested in must unravel a read whether surmise be correct incorrect seemed possible that have thought little after interview when barold saw next be struck by slight distinctly definable change recognized in dress coiffure pretty hair have rather le professional appearance have pleasure of observing for first time how very white forehead be how delicate arch of eyebrow dress have novel air of simplicity diamond ring be nowhere to be seen be better dressed than usual said to be always well dressed rather too well dressed fact be for place like sort of thing be in better form under circumstance be so much better form so far approved of that quite thawed be very amiable very entertaining indeed octavia be entertaining too asked several most interesting question do think inquired that be bad taste to wear diamond mother wear occasionally have sister cousin a young a be a do wear must admit replied that in first place know have in second be under impression that lady beauchamp mamma know must permit if have must permit said octavia suppose always do a tell smiled little must be very courageous young woman if did remarked what must do if tried inquired must beat will never try answered dryly though have never seen beat heard lamentation under chastisement must not like to say that lady beauchamp must not do thing be very determined person for gentlewoman octavia laughed be joking said lady beauchamp be serious subject for joke responded cousin think so at least wonder if be a bad a lady theobald octavia reflected aloud say have right to wear diamond at until be married mind lady theobald added a cheerful afterthought be not fond enough of to care about what say be fond of one barold inquired speaking with languid air at same time glancing at with slight interest from under eyelid lucia say be returned with calmness of young person who wished to regard matter from unembarrassed point of view lucia say be affectionate ah deliberately be turned looked at serenely must think so asked be making such personal matter of question that did not exactly enjoy be certainly not good form to pull man up in such cool style really replied ah have have opportunity of judging have not slightest intention of being amusing to infinite disgust discovered a soon a spoke that be amused laughed outright evidently only checked because looked so furious in consideration for feeling assumed air of mild preternatural seriousness remarked be true have of course be silent did not enjoy being amusing at made pretence of appearing to submit to indignity calmly bent forward little ah exclaimed be mad again mean be vexed be always vexing there be hint of appeal in voice rather pleased have intention of relenting at once confess be at loss to know why laughed said be asked really letting eye rest upon anxiously for moment then actually gave vent to little sigh look at thing so differently that be said suppose be responded still chillingly in spite of suddenly assumed comparatively cheerful aspect happy thought occurred to lucia must beg pardon said be learning good manner from lucia suppose beg pardon be quite unnecessary replied lucia must think so said why must be a well behaved a lucia beg pardon felt rather absurd yet somewhat mollified have way of looking at sometimes when have be unpleasant rather soothed in fact have found of late little to private annoyance that be very easy for to soothe disturb now just a octavia have settled down into one of prettiest least difficult of mood there came knock at front door being answered by mary anne be found to announce curate of st james enter consequently rev arthur poppleton blushing trifle timorous perhaps happy beyond measure to find in miss belinda parlor again with miss belinda niece perhaps least possible shade of joyousness died out when caught sight of mr francis barold certainly mr francis barold be not at all delighted to see doe fellow want that gentleman be saying inwardly what doe come simpering turning pink here for why doe go see of old woman read tract to be business octavia manner toward visitor formed fresh grievance for barold treated curate very well indeed seemed glad to see be wholly at ease with made trying remark to never stopped to fix eye upon in inexplicable style did not laugh when there seemed nothing to laugh at be so gay good humored that rev arthur poppleton beamed flourished under treatment forgot to change color even ventured to talk good deal make diver quite presentable little joke must like to know thought barold growing sulkier a others grew merrier must like to know what find so interesting in why chooses to treat better than treat for certainly doe treat better be hardly fair however that must complain for at time be treated extremely well intimacy with octavia progressed quite rapidly perhaps if truth be told be always who be first mean of checking by suddenly prudent instinct led to feel that perhaps be in rather delicate position have better not indulge in too much of good thing have not be eligible unimpeachable desirable parti for ten year without acquiring of discretion be said to be better part of valor matter of fact air with octavia accepted attention caused to pull up sometimes if have be brown jones even robinson must not have appeared to regard a more entirely natural when have gone so far once twice have deigned to make more than usually agreeable speech to be received with none of charming sensitive tremor to be accustomed octavia blushed dropped eye did not add to barold satisfaction to find a cheerful ready to be amused by mild little curate who blushed stammered be brilliant graceful distinguished must not octavia see wide difference between two regarding matter in light watching octavia a encouraged visitor laughed at joke never once tripped up by asking startling question did not a already have be said improve mr francis barold temper by time visit be over have lapsed into coldest most haughty manner a soon a miss belinda entered engaged mr poppleton for moment rose crossed little room to octavia side must bid good afternoon said octavia did not rise sit down minute while aunt belinda be talking about red flannel nightcap lumbago said wanted to ask something by way what be lumbago be that what wished to ask inquired stiffly just thought of have ever have what be like old people in slowbridge have tell about when go to see aunt belinda say so what wanted to ask be different possibly miss bassett might be able to tell remarked about lumbago well perhaps might will ask do think bad taste in to wear diamond said with most delightful seriousness fixing eye upon with very prettiest look of candid appeal a if be most natural thing in world that must apply to for information felt faltering again how white bit of forehead be how soft that blonde waving fringe of hair what lovely shape eye be how large clear a raised why do ask inquired because think be unprejudiced person lady theobald be not have confidence in tell there be slight pause really said after can scarcely believe that opinion can be of value in eye be can only tell that be hardly customary in in england for young people to wear profusion of ornament wonder if wear profusion need condescended be too young sort of thing glanced down at slim unringed hand for moment expression quite thoughtful lucia almost quarrelled other day said at least almost quarrelled be so nice to be told of thing after must say like a much a thought must kept seat longer than have intended when rose to go rev arthur poppleton be shaking hand with miss belinda so fell out that left house together know miss octavia bassett well suppose remarked barold with condescension a passed through gate clergyman be fortunate fellow wish that others knew a well sir said little gentleman kindling wish knew generosity kindness of heart ready sympathy with misfortune ah commented mr barold twisting mustache with somewhat of incredulous air be not at sort of thing have expected to hear for own part must not have occurred to to suspect of possession of such desirable orthodox quality there be who misunderstand cried curate warming with subject who misunderstand yes apply harsh term to innocent gayety freedom of speech if knew a do must cease to do so must scarcely have thought began barold there be many who scarcely think if will pardon interrupting said curate think must scarcely believe if felt at liberty to tell regret to say be almost breaking word in saying what can not help saying to yourself poor under care be better off since came there be who have seen more than once though did not go a teacher to reprove for fault way of doing what did be new to perhaps much le serious than be accustomed to liked better ah commented barold again flannel under garment sort of thing with much spirit not at sir what a said liked much better be not often meet beautiful creature who come among with open hand natural ungrudging way of giving have sometimes be at loss to understand a well a rest have be used to what be narrower more more exacting have be used to lady theobald observed barold with faint smile must not become to to mention lady theobald in disparaging manner replied curate best most charitable among always carry out good intention in best way dare say lady theobald must consider miss octavia bassett too readily influenced too lavish be a generous with money a with diamond perhaps said barold possibly quality be peculiar to nevada part here mr poppleton believe good morning chapter xxi lord lansdowne one morning in following week mr burnham attired in second best black silk leaving miss burnham practising diligently turned step toward oldclough hall arriving there be ushered into blue drawing room by dobson in character of footman in few minute lucia appeared when mr burnham saw assumed slight air of surprise why dear said a shook hand must scarcely have known though be something of exaggeration there be excuse for exclamation lucia be looking very charming several change might be noted in attire appearance ugly twist have disappeared from delicate head in place be soft loose wave light puff have even ventured on allowing few ringed lock to stray on to forehead white morning dress no longer wore trade mark of miss chickie have be remodelled by one of more taste what pretty gown dear said mr burnham glancing at curiously watteau plait down back be watteau plait little ruffle down front pale pink bow be quite like of miss octavia bassett dress only not so over trimmed think be dress must seem over trimmed if wore in london paris said lucia bravely be only because be so very quiet dress so little in slowbridge that seem so hair remarked mr burnham drew idea of from style of hers suppose very becoming indeed well well how doe lady theobald like dear be not sure that lucia be beginning when ladyship interrupted by entering dear lady theobald cried visitor rising hope be well have just be complimenting lucia upon pretty dress new style of dressing hair miss octavia bassett have be giving benefit of experience appears have not be doing justice who must have believed that have come from nevada to improve miss octavia bassett said lady sonorously have come from nevada to teach young people great many thing new fashion in duty demeanor respect for elder let hope will be benefited if will excuse grandmamma said lucia speaking in soft steady voice will go write letter wished written go said lady with majesty having bidden mr burnham good morning lucia went if mr burnham have expected explanation of ladyship evident displeasure be doomed to disappointment excellent rigorous gentlewoman have stern sense of dignity forbade condescending to confidential weakness of mere ordinary mortal instead of referring to lucia broached more commonplace topic hope rheumatism doe not threaten again mr burnham remarked be very well thank dear said mr burnham so well that be thinking quite seriously of taking dear girl to garden party when come off to garden party repeated ladyship may ask who think of giving garden party in slowbridge be one in slowbridge replied lady cheerfully one who life little out of slowbridge mr burmistone dear lady theobald at new place mr burmistone yes dear most charming affair be to be if be to believe hear surely have heard something of from mr barold mr barold have not be to oldclough for several day then will tell when come for suppose have a much to do with a mr burmistone have heard before announced lady of men of mr burmistone class securing service of person of established position in society when wished to spend money upon entertainment must scarcely have imagined that francis barold must have allowed to be made party to transaction put in mr burnham rather eagerly appears that mr burmistone be not such obscure person after be oxford man came off with honor be quite well born man give entertainment in honor of friend relation lord lansdowne lord lansdowne echoed ladyship sternly son of marquis of lauderdale whose wife be lady honora erroll did mr burmistone give information asked lady theobald with ironic calmness mr burnham colored never so faintly be to say there be sort of acquaintance between one of maid butler at burmistone place when girl be doing lydia hair told story lord lansdowne father be quite fond of mr burmistone be said seems rather singular to mind that must not have known of before how must learn none of know lord lansdowne even marquis think be only second third cousin be little just little set in slowbridge know dear at least have thought so sometimes lately must confess remarked lady have not regarded matter in light be because have better right to to be little set than rest of be amiable response lady theobald did not disclaim privilege felt sentiment extremely correct one be not very warm in manner during remainder of call incongruous a such statement may appear must be confessed that felt that miss octavia bassett must have something to do with defection on side garden party such swerving from established slowbridge custom be natural result of nevada frivolity freedom of manner may be that felt remotely that even lord lansdowne marquis of lauderdale be to be referred to same reprehensible cause for octavia bassett mr burmistone must not have be educated at oxford have come off with honor have turned out to be related to respectable people must have remained in appropriate obscurity suppose said afterward to lucia that friend miss octavia bassett be in mr burmistone confidence if one else have be permitted to have honor have doubt have known of approaching entertainment for week know grandmamma replied lucia putting letter together gaining color a bent over be wondering with inward trepidation what ladyship must say if knew whole truth if knew that be granddaughter not octavia bassett who enjoyed mr burmistone confidence ah thought how must ever dare to tell same day francis barold sauntered up to pay visit then a mr burnham have prophesied lady theobald heard wished to hear indeed great deal more what be be told of mr burmistone francis inquired that intends to give garden party that lord lansdowne be to be one of guest that have caused to be circulated that be cousin that lansdowne have caused to be circulated burmistone be scarcely likely that lord lansdowne beg pardon interrupted fixing single glass dexterously in right eye gazing at ladyship through ca see why lansdowne must object fact be be great deal fonder of burmistone than relation usually be of other now often find that kind of thing bore lansdowne doe seem to be at school together seems at oxford too burmistone be supposed to have behaved pretty well towards lansdowne at one time when be rather wild fellow so father mother say a to burmistone 'causing to be circulated sort of thing be rather absurd man be cad know pray say know ' francis said ladyship know very little what have chanced to see must confess have not be prepossessed in mr burmistone favor why did not choose to inform that be lord lansdowne second cousin knew marquis of lauderdale grandmamma broke in lucia with very pretty spirit must have prepossessed in favor must have forgiven for building mill on lord lansdowne account wish be related to marquis be very bold indeed may ask said ladyship in most monumental manner when became mr burmistone champion chapter xxii have made livelier when have become mr burmistone champion indeed must scarcely have told when unless perhaps have fixed date at first time have heard name introduced at high tea with politely opprobrious epithet affixed have defended in own mind then felt sure that deserved very little be said against very likely nothing at first time have seen spoken to have be convinced that have not made mistake that have be treated with cruel injustice how kind be how manly how clever how well bore under popular adverse criticism only wondered that anybody must be so blind stupid wilful a to assail if have be case in early day imagine what felt now when ah well when friendship have have time opportunity to become much deeper sentiment must be confessed that have seen mr burmistone even oftener than octavia miss belinda knew of of course have be quite accidental have happened that now then when have be taking quiet walk in lane about oldclough have encountered gentleman who have dismounted led horse by bridle a sauntered by side have always be very timid at such time have felt rather like criminal mr burmistone have not be timid at must indeed a soon have met lady theobald a not for courage companion admired more than ever be not very long before to be with hero re assured made feel stronger more self reliant be never afraid to open soft little heart to show innocently goodness ignorance of worldliness warmed brightened under kindly influence be often surprised in secret at own simple readiness of wit speech be odd that be different girl when when be with said to one day even make little joke never must think of making even tiniest joke before grandmamma somehow never seems quite to understand joke never laugh at always laugh be sure be very kind of to encourage so must not encourage too much might forget make little joke at dinner think if did must choke over soup perhaps when dressed hair adorned with pale pink bow like appurtenance artful young person have privately in mind other beholder than mr burnham other commendation than to be bestowed by most excellent matron do mind telling that have put on enchanted garment said mr burmistone first time met when wore one of old new gown thought knew before how mind at said lucia blushing brilliantly rather like reward for industry hair be dressed in new way hope like too grandmamma doe not have be lady theobald habit to treat lucia severely from sense of duty manner toward have always rather tone of implying that be naturally at fault yet ladyship must not have told wherein wished girl changed in good old school in lady have be trained be customary to regard young people a weak foolish if left to own desire frequently sinful lucia have not be left to own desire have be taught to view a rather bad case to feel that be far from being what relative have right to expect to be thrown with person who did not find silly dull commonplace be new experience if have be clever lucia said once to mr burmistone if have be clever perhaps grandmamma must have be more satisfied with have often wished have be clever if have be boy replied mr burmistone rather grimly have squandered money run into debt bullied must have be idol must have pinched starved to supply highness extravagance when garden party rumor began to take definite form there be doubt a to mr burmistone intention discussion arose at once went on in genteel parlor must lady theobald allow lucia to go if did not allow must not such course appear very pointed indeed be universally decided that must appear pointed that lady theobald must not mind that in least perhaps must rather enjoy than otherwise be thought lucia must not go be very likely that lucia must have remained at home if have not be for influence of mr francis barold making call at oldclough found august relative in very majestic mood applied to again for information perhaps said may be able to tell whether be true that belinda bassett belinda bassett with emphasis have be invited by mr burmistone to assist to receive guest yes be true be reply think advised burmistone be fond of be great friend man need woman at such time chose belinda bassett in first place be on friendly term with a said before replied barold in second be just what want well bred kind hearted not likely to make row et caetera there be slight pause before finished adding quietly be not man to submit to being refused burmistone lady theobald did not reply raise eye from work knew be looking at with calm fixedness through glass held in place so cleverly detested more than thing else perhaps because be invariably quelled by found have nothing to say did not address again immediately turned to lucia dropping eyeglass resuming normal condition will go of course said lucia glanced across at lady know grandmamma oh interposed barold must go there be reason for refusing invitation unless wish to imply something unpleasant be of course out of question there may be reason began ladyship burmistone be friend put in barold in coolest tone be relative must make position in house delicate one if have offended when lucia saw octavia again be able to tell that have received invitation to fete that lady theobald have accepted have not spoken word to about have accepted said lucia quite understand lately octavia must be very fond of francis barold never give way to in least always seems to submit to know must not have let go if have not insisted on in taking for granted way of naturally mr burmistone fete caused great excitement miss chickie be never so busy in life there be rumor that feeling have be outraged by discovery that mr burnham have sent to harriford for costume for daughter slowbridge be changing mem said miss chickie with brilliant sarcasm lady be led in fashion by nevada young person be improving most rapid more rapid than 'd ever have dared to hope do prefer frill flounce mem octavia be in great good spirit at prospect of gayeties in question have be in remarkably good spirit for week have received letter from nevada containing good news said share have gone up again father have almost settled affair must not be long before must come to england looked so exhilarated over matter lucia felt little aggrieved will be so glad to leave octavia asked will not be so glad to let go have grown very fond of will be sorry to leave aunt belinda be going with expect to be very fond of slowbridge do to be sorry ca take mr burnham rest barold be present when made speech rather rankled be one of 'the rest ' inquired first time found alone with be sufficiently piqued to forget usual hauteur discretion must like to be said oh very much very much naturally replied severely be standing near rose bush in garden plucked rose regarded with deep interest well said next must say think must have have good time if have be here have made livelier tha anks remarked be most kind oh answered be true if be must say mr burmistone mr poppleton have certainly made livelier went home in such bad humor that host who be rather happier than usual commented upon grave aspect at dinner look a if have heard ill news old fellow said what be up oh nothing be answered sardonically nothing whatever unless have be rather snubbed by young lady from nevada ah with great seriousness be rather cool be be little way said barold seems to be one of custom of nevada in fact be very savage indeed felt that have condescended good deal lately seldom bestowed time on woman when did so at rare interval chose who must do most honor to taste at least cost of trouble be obliged to confess to that have broken rule in case upon analyzing motif necessity found that after must have extended visit simply because chose to see more of young woman from nevada really upon whole have borne good deal from sometimes have be much pleased with very well entertained often enough in fact rather too often have made exceedingly uncomfortable manner be not what be accustomed to did not consider that men be not to be regarded from same point of view perhaps did not put into definite word noble patriotic sentiment that englishman be not to be regarded from same point of view a american that though sort of thing might do with fellow in new york be scarcely what englishman must stand perhaps a say have not put sentiment into word be quite certain that have be uppermost in mind upon more occasion than one a thought acquaintance over evening be rather severe upon octavia even be roused so far a to condescend to talk over with burmistone if have be well brought up said must have be different creature very different have doubt said burmistone thoughtfully when say well brought up by way do mean brought up like cousin miss gaston there be medium said barold loftily regret to say lady theobald have not hit upon well a say commented mr burmistone suppose there be medium charming wife must make for man with position to maintain remarked barold with short somewhat savage laugh octavia bassett queried burmistone be true be afraid must enjoy if be supposing man to be englishman brought up in regulation groove ah exclaimed barold impatiently be not looking at from point of view from mr burmistone slipped hand in pocket jingled key slightly a did once before in earlier part of narrative ah from repeated not from hers point of view must differ from hers naturally barold flashed little took cigar from mouth to knock off ash man be not necessarily snob said because be cool enough not to lose head where woman be concerned ca marry woman who will make mistake attract universal attention by conduct have struck that octavia bassett must inquired burmistone must do a chose said barold petulantly must do thing be unusual be not referring to in particular why must ah said burmistone only thought of because did not strike that one must ever feel have exactly blundered be not easily embarrassed there be sang froid about carry thing off ah deigned barold have sang froid enough to spare be silent for time afterward sat smoking later than usual when be about to leave room for night made announcement for host be not altogether prepared when fete be over dear fellow said must go back to london will be deucedly sorry to do look here said burmistone be new idea be old one have be putting thing off from day to day by jove did not think likely must put off day landed here laughed rather uneasily chapter xxiii may go very day after octavia opened fourth trunk have have brought down from garret when there came summons on door lucia gaston appeared lucia be very pale large soft eye wore decidedly frightened look seemed to have walked fast be out of breath evidently something have happened octavia said mr dugald binnie be at oldclough who be be grand uncle explained lucia tremulously have great deal of money grandmamma stopped short colored drew slight figure up quite understand grandmamma octavia said last night came to room to talk to morning came again oh broke out indignantly how must speak to in manner what did say inquired octavia said great many thing with great spirit took long time to say wonder at must have taken hundred year if have be in place be wrong to say did not understand did before have finished what did understand be afraid to tell in plain word never saw afraid before be afraid have be arranging future for doe not occur to dare object be because know be coward despises for be what deserve if make marriage chooses think mr binnie will leave money be to run after man who doe not care for make attractive in hope that will condescend to marry because mr binnie may leave money do wonder that took even lady theobald long time to say well remarked octavia wo do suppose must worry want to marry mr barold suppose lucia started how did guess exclaimed oh always knew did guess smiled ever so faintly be one of reason why loathes so added lucia thought deeply for moment recognized at once several thing have be mystified by before oh be be said have thought of time when never suspected octavia smiled little again lucia sat thinking hand clasped tightly be glad came here said at length be angry now see thing more clearly if have only thought of because mr binnie came must have forgiven more easily have be making coarse plan time treating with contempt octavia added turning upon with flushing cheek sparkling eye think that for first time in life be in passion real passion think will never be afraid of more delicate nostril be dilated held head up breath came fast there be hint of exultation in tone yes said be in passion be not afraid of at will go home tell what think be quite probable that must have done so for trifling incident occurred before reached ladyship walked very fast after left house wanted to reach oldclough before one whit of anger cooled down though somehow felt quite sure that even when anger died out courage must not take flight with mr dugald binnie have not proved to be very fascinating person be acrid dictatorial old man contradicted lady theobald flatly five minute bullied man servant be not against that lucia indignation be aroused felt that lady theobald be quite capable of suggesting to that francis barold must be good match for if have done so be scarcely fault if have accepted idea understood now why have be allowed to visit octavia why diver other thing have happened have be sent to walk with francis barold have be almost reproached when have not called perhaps ladyship have be good enough to suggest to that be duty to further plan be a capable of a of thing else must assist to gain point girl cheek grew hotter hotter eye brighter at step because step brought new thought hand trembled heart beat will never be afraid of again said a turned corner into road never never at very moment gentleman stepped out of wood at right stopped before started back with cry mr burmistone said mr burmistone wondered if have heard last word fancied have took hold of shaking little hand looked down at excited face be glad waited for said in quietest possible tone something be matter knew there must be use in trying to conceal truth be not in mood to make effort scarcely knew gave quite fierce little laugh be angry said have never seen angry before be on way to to lady theobald held hand a calmly a before understood great deal more than must have imagined what be going to say to asked laughed again be going to ask what mean be going to tell have made mistake be going to prove to be not such coward after be going to tell dare disobey be what be going to say to concluded decisively held hand rather closer let take stroll in copse talk over said be deliciously cool there want to be cool said drew gently with few step took into shade of young oak pine there paused have made very angry said then almost before knew what be doing be pouring forth whole of story even more of than have told octavia have not at intended to do did nevertheless be to marry mr francis barold if will take said with bitter little smile mr francis barold who be so much in love with a know mother approves of match sent here to make love to have done a have seen have money of own if make marriage plea dugald binnie will probably leave be thought will be inducement to cousin who need one if marry rather marries lady theobald think mr binnie will be pleased doe not even matter whether francis be pleased not of course be out of question be hoped that will please mr binnie two lady have talked over decided matter dare say have offered to francis who have very likely refused though perhaps may be persuaded to relent in time if be very humble be shown advantage of having mr binnie money added to own have doubt will have to be very humble indeed be what learned from lady theobald last night be what be going to talk to about be enough to make one angry do think be enough did not tell whether thought enough not looked at with steady eye lucia said wish must let go talk with lady theobald said with little start yes answered let go to let tell instead of marrying francis barold will marry if will say yes to think can promise that need never be afraid of more fierce color died out of cheek tear rushed to eye raised face with pathetic look oh whispered must be very sorry for think have be sorry for from first be desperately in love with answered in quietest way have be desperately in love with from first may go looked at for moment incredulously then faltered still looked up at then in spite of happiness perhaps because of suddenly began to cry softly forgot have be angry at a took into strong kind arm chapter xxiv garden party morning of garden party arose bright clear slowbridge awakened in great state of excitement miss chickie having worked until midnight that order might be completed be so overpowered by labor a to have to take tea toast in bed at oldclough varied sentiment prevailed lady theobald manner be chiefly distinguished by implacable rigidity have chosen a appropriate festal costume funereal black moire antique enlivened by massive fringe ornament of jet jewelry being chain manacle of latter rattled a moved with sound somewhat suggestive of bone mr dugald binnie who have received invitation have a yet amiably forborne to say whether must accept not have be out when mr burmistone called have not seen when lady theobald descended to breakfast found growling over newspaper glanced up at with polite scowl going to funeral demanded accompany granddaughter to entertainment ladyship responded be scarcely joyous occasion to mind need to dress like if be ejaculated mr binnie why stay at home if want to go man right be once knew man by name of burmistone one of few decent fellow have met if be sure be same man 'd go when find fellow who be knave fool stick to believe will send to find out where lucia what opinion of lucia be be difficult to discover have agreeable habit of staring at over top of paper over dinner only time have made comment upon be first time saw in dress have copied

prospect of wearing at garden party call on grandmamma until after wednesday have said to mr burmistone perhaps must let go will be very angry be sure be not afraid answered be not afraid at will not be afraid again in fact have perfectly confounded ladyship by demeanor bore fiercest glance without quailing in least making effort to evade under most scathing comment be composed unmoved on first occasion of lady referring to plan for future received blow fairly stunned girl rose from chair looked straight in face unflinchingly with suggestion of hauteur not easy to confront beg will not speak to of again said will not listen turning about walked out of room ladyship have said in sepulchral tone when recovered breath be one of result of miss octavia bassett nothing more have be said on subject since one in slowbridge be in more brilliant spirit than octavia on morning of fete before breakfast miss belinda be startled by arrival of telegram ran a follows arrived to day per 'russia '

way must have be so anxious must not have slept at well remarked octavia suppose must have be advantage suddenly approached miss belinda kissed disappeared out of room a if by magic not returning for quarter of hour looking rather soft moist brilliant about eye when did return octavia be marked figure upon ground at garden party dress dear remarked mr burnham what charming color have declare be usually paler perhaps owe to lord lansdowne dress be becoming at event privately remarked miss lydia burnham whose taste have not be consulted about own be who be becoming said sister be not dress so much though clothes always have look way be prettier than ever to day be enjoying be enjoying mr francis barold observed rather gloomily a stood apart be enjoying so much that did not seem to notice that have avoided instead of going up to claim attention dozen men be standing about making agreeable be apparently quite equal to emergency of occasion young men from broadoaks have at once attached to train say barold have said to why did tell about jolly good fellow be to come mooning here for couple of month keep to then have come lord lansdowne who in crossing lawn to shake hand with host

octavia said miss belinda be not sure that follow mood be more affectionate than people fancy have very pretty way be very fond of be not a frivolous a appears to who know well barold stood gnawing mustache made reply be not very comfortable felt ill used by fate rather wished have returned to london from broadoaks instead of loitering in slowbridge have amused at first in time have be surprised
