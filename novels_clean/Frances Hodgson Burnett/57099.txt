with bright eye rose ready good nature have found soft spot in lisbeths rather hard heart miss crespigny must not have explained why be have taken fancy to georgie esmond liked wanted feeling to be mutual one must have experienced something very like pang even thus early in acquaintance if have thought that sweet honest young creature must ever see with hector anstruthers eye men be always disproportionately bitter said to herself be way to make heard when be hurt seem to have kind of pride in pain ordinarily clever woman must see that lord of studio have grievance lisbeth said mr despard breaking in upon reverie isnt rather astonishing how boy have improved have improved said lisbeth because have ceased to be boy be man in day very personable entertaining man must say returned

repulsion be over now said why must such woman trouble indeed what greater proof of security must give than fact that must meet almost daily still feel indifferent must be confessed that rather prided upon indifference be drawn also into greater familiarity with household through georgie esmond for in expressing wish to make friend with lisbeth georgie have be sincere a be habit very short time after luncheon first visit be made first visit be harbinger of many others mamma who be daughter chief admiration came with mamma be a much charmed in way a georgie have be in hers be impossible for lisbeth to help pleasing people when be in right mood mr esmond georgie invariably put in right mood must not help showing best side to two sweet nature chapter vi song thus friendship arose in course of time became very close one colonel esmonds house be luxurious pleasant everybodys heart opened to favorite of georgies accordingly lisbeths niche in family be soon found be rather agreeable to go among people who admired be ready to love so went pretty often in fact georgie kept firm hold upon there appeared always reason why be specially necessary that lisbeth must be with have visitor be alone wanted company have new music wanted lisbeths help have found old song lisbeth must try lisbeth whose voice be so exquisite indeed be lisbeth lisbeth lisbeth from week to week until more than one of miss esmonds admirer wished that there have be no such person a miss crespigny in world a anstruthers have said miss georgie esmond be quite belle in first year of reign if have be so inclined be generally believed that might have achieved very brilliant social triumph indeed be afraid that have bad taste not to aspire a might have done dont want to be uncharitable have said innocently to friend dont in least believe thing people often say about society thing hector say for instance really lisbeth have sometimes thought that life behind glare glitter be just least bit stupid hollow know must get dreadfully tired of if have nothing else to satisfy real home life true single hearted close friend to love like mamma made lisbeth wince pretty speech georgie esmond often made wince mr hector anstruthers discovered fact before great length of time have passed discovery awakened in diver new sensation have looked on at growing friendship with secret sneer sneer be not at georgie honestly liked girl something better for affectionate credulity nothing must contaminate not even lisbeth crespigny sometimes just now then found trifle difficult to control resist impulse to be openly sarcastic encountered difficulty in special force one evening about month after studio luncheon girl have spent afternoon together dinner being over lisbeth be singing one of georgies favorite song be love song too for though miss georgie have a yet have practical experience in matter of love have very pretty idea of tender passion be very fond of love song poem love story such a touched

what be life what rest can find if have not love world be garden love be queen of rose fairest bloom let gather what flower may oh let gather rose first tend most delicately will give higher beauty to life will make more fit for heaven will shame selfishness help to forget sordid longing for love world well lost so on through three four verse with very sweet accompaniment georgie played with great taste lisbeth be singing a have trick of doing be quite forgetting exquisite full toned voice rose fell with wondrous fervor immense dark eye glared small pale face glowed little pathetic shadow seemed to rest upon so well did sing indeed that one might have fancied that have done nothing life sing just such sweetly sentimental song believe word of implicitly when have finished georgies eye be full of tear oh lisbeth cried looking up at affectionately make everything sound so beautiful true must never never sing in way must be because can feel beautiful tender thing so deeply so much more deeply than other people do lisbeth awoke from dream suddenly hector anstruthers who have be standing at other side of piano looked at with significance must have roused at time eye met pair flashed with very intensity of contempt hers with defiance dear georgie said admire enthusiasm scarcely think quite understand miss crespigny be one of fortunate people who can not help doing thing well be habit have acquired sentiment must suffer in hand even sentiment quite opposite to one have just illustrated force of so artistically georgie looked little amazed did not liked to be chilled when gentle emotion be in full play apart from did not speech sound a if suggested doubt of sincerity of beloved lisbeth people can not teach to be innocent loving said almost indignantly at least can not be artistically loving innocent can not make art of truth faith can not be generous kind through nothing habit heart must be good before can be good at least be belief must rather have belief than cynicism so must lisbeth be sure even if be not so brilliant popular be too sarcastic sir have quite spoiled pretty song did not mean to spoil answered forgive beg with satirical bow pray favor with may learn to believe perhaps will be inclined to think miss crespigny must convince man of anything dont deserve said georgie doe lisbeth hardly said lisbeth who be turning over music with indifferent face sang again nevertheless quite a well a have done before though must be admitted that influenced georgie to choice of song of le arcadian nature following morning anstruthers called to see mr despard found that lady absent miss crespigny in drawing room consequently fell to miss crespignys lot to entertain during brief visit made a brief a possible when rose to take leave to surprise lisbeth detained there be something must like to say to began after have risen with paused hat in hand be about georgie miss esmond added be very kind to speak to of a did last night be very generous feel ought to thank for trying to make despise eye flashed with expression not easy to face ask pardon returned loftily if have understood that friendship be of such nature if object have be man instead of innocent girl must have understood easily enough have doubt interposed angrily bowed with suspicion of sneer upon face perhaps answered thank said however since need matter explained will explain be fond of georgie esmond be fond of choose to lose affection so must resort to poor expedient of asking to deny gratification of treating contemptuously in presence say what please when be alone a be sometimes forced to be when be with cousin be good enough to remember that be friend trust be so like girl lisbeth daring summary course confronting settling matter at once without least sign of hesitation reluctance that began to feel very uncomfortable have really behaved so badly indeed be possible that have allowed to appear rampant brute a word implied who so prided upon thoroughbred impassibility treat contemptuously exclaimed be not care for answered be georgie esmond have resource left to accept position very humiliating position of man whose apology if offered must be coolly set aside whose humiliation be of consequence who be expected to receive punishment like culprit whose sensation be not for moment to be regarded left house feeling angry helpless returning to chamber wrote stinging criticism of new book poor blanke who have written book received benefit of sentiment miss crespigny have roused on part lisbeth resorted to one of humor to use mr despards expression be out of patience with have lost temper almost a soon a have spoken first word have be so sure of perfect self control before began be secret irritant why must not have managed better be not usual with to give way when be sure of herself somebody have be here said mr despard when came in found sitting alone with sewing one like one who have said something awkward unpleasant to hector anstruthers have be here be lisbeths answer deigned further explanation did not even lift eye a spoke chapter vii new experience next time georgie found alone with mr anstruthers read very severe little lecture on subject of shortcoming knew that liked to be satirical make fine cutting speech said with prettiest indignation did not think must have gone so far a to be openly rude to lisbeth of people lisbeth who be so good unselfish kind who be dearest friend hector anstruthers looked at sweet face almost mournfully be good unselfish kind said question be not satire only asked in tender wonder at girl innocent faith there be one like one so good unless be mamma exclaimed miss georgie with warmth lisbeths be not common surface goodness suppose be reason that can not see too who be so far sighted clever for one be glad be not genius if to be genius one must be blind to everything failing of one friend ah hector sudden pity kindling in gentle breast a met eye ah hector people often envy call fortunate there be time when be sorry for sorry from heart georgie answered young man not quite able to control tremor in voice there be more time than dream of when be sorry for sorry

misfortune that need be very sorry to see be marvel that georgie esmond be popular be one of charming girl who invariably have good effect upon people be so good so innocent so honest so trustful that actually seemed to create sweeter atmosphere wherever went worst of men while listening to gentle bright speech felt that world be not so bad after that there be still sweetness purity left to render more shameful by white contrast fellow want to forget worst side when be with said one make man feel that must like to hide shadiness even from effect upon hector anstruthers be curious rather dangerous one made ashamed of too filled heart with tender longing regret have not be for experience with lisbeth must have loved girl passionately a be affection for must never be more than brotherly though intensely admiring one be constantly wishing that fate have given georgie to georgie who seemed to purest loveliest of young home goddess georgie who must have made life happy pure peaceful if

of that can not help being sorry that have fallen into be sort of fashion in day returned lisbeth longed to add scorching little sneer to brief comment restrained for georgies sake positively such thing have become possible who have never restrained impulse before have gradually learned to control for simple girl sake on one two occasion early in acquaintance when have let evil spirit get better of sudden pain wonder in georgies face have stung so quickly that have resolved to hide iniquity at least in presence sometimes have even wished that have be softer at heart le selfish be so unpleasant to see just a be when breathed that sweet atmosphere of have spoken georgie esmond caused to lose patience with lisbeth crespigny upon more than one occasion be hypocrite said to herself if

trifle more affectionate than have be wont poor little effort to have made dear simple soul at penyllan greeted change with tenderest joy aunt millicent aunt clarissa aunt hetty shed tear of ecstasy in secret in secret because to have shed openly must have be to admit to one that have felt dear lisbeths former letter to be cold at least not absolutely must be desired so like dear dear philip own child said miss clarissa who be generally family voice know how often have remarked sister henrietta that dear lisbeth be like brother philip in respect even though at time be perhaps little more little more reserved a be nature be sure be most affectionate that fortunate much caressed young man mr hector anstruthers not only met miss crespigny frequently heard much of imperfect a may appear to who sit in judgment upon name of admirer be legion intimacy with esmonds led into very gay distinguished society far more illustrious society than mr despards patronage have be able to afford having little peculiarity did rest immense dusky eye small pale piquant face self possession wit numerous capability attracted people wondrously even battered old beau who have outlived two three generation of beauty who be fastidious accordingly found indescribable charm in caustic clever young person who be really not beauty at if measured according to usual standard be too small too pale

up rle of ingnue be be bad through through felt sincerely night when heard men praising be savage accordingly chapter viii will tell truth for once how be very next night when dropped in to see mr despard surprised syren reading letter of miss clarissas reading in strangest of mood reading with pale face heavy wet lash did not pretend to hide trace of mental disturbance did not condescend to take trouble evidently resented appearance a untimely greeted with indifferent composure mr despard will come down a soon a hears that be here said then proceeded to fold letter replace in envelope thus saw that bore penyllan post mark what did whim a mean asked impatiently taking in at glance new expression in face heaviness of gloomy eye be not one of trick there be one here to see even if there have be what end must serve by cry over letter from penyllan what on earth have be cry for have never seen shed tear before in life have often thought that thing be impossible be so hard must be that be not really so hard after that three innocent old woman must reach heart next minute laughed at absurdity of idea lisbeth chancing to raise eye coolly fixing on face at moment saw smile what be matter asked demon took possession of at once what if must tell see how must answer knew other why must keep up pretense of being nothing ordinary acquaintance with unpleasant little drama behind be thinking what amusing blunder have be on verge of making said did not answer still kept eye fixed upon be trying to account for sadness on same ground must account for sadness in woman be almost inclined to believe that something in letter have touched heart a might have touched georgie esmonds checked in time checked in time said slowly be good thing there be brief silence during felt that a usual have gained nothing by sarcasm then suddenly held out mite of hand with miss clarissas letter in rather taking aback must like to read said suppose do aunt clarissa be old friend of yours speaks of a affectionately a ever must not comprehend look wore when said be queer calculating look have meaning of own be riddle must not read take said seeing that hesitated mean what say want to read may do good so feeling uncomfortable enough took before have read two page have affected just a lisbeth have intended that must worst of must be touched by pure unselfish goodness miss clarissas simple affectionate outpouring to dear lisbeth be somewhat pathetic in way be so grateful for tenderness of dear girl last letter so sweet tempered be ready excuse for rather late arrival kind old heart be plainly so wholly dedicated to perfection of dear girl in question that by time anstruthers have reached conclusion of epistle found indescribably softened in mind though really must not have told why did not think that have softened toward lisbeth be true nevertheless that have softened toward in secretly puzzled way lisbeth have risen from seat be standing before when handed back letter met eye just a have done before be very fond of see said even believe have real affection for think be capable of just a georgie esmond doe poor georgie poor aunt clarissa poor aunt millicent poor everybody indeed suddenly ended turned away from toward fire in minute more spoke again wonder if be capable of said wonder if be must only see side face something in tone roused to vehement reply god know said understand never will turned to abruptly then let see whole face pale with strange excited pallor eye wide sparkling wet be true said understand understand well have told lie enough before when have suited now will tell truth for once blunder be not such blunder after heart have be touched just a better woman might have be almost a georgies might have be letter touched effusion of poor aunt clarissas be why be cry when came into room why be cry now having made unlooked for confession walked out of room just a mr despard came in on next visit to friend esmonds mr anstruthers found pretty head of lovely miss georgie full of new project have not heard news be going to penyllan with lisbeth be to stay with miss tregarthyn miss clarissa have written kindest letter dearest most affectionate letter a affectionate a if have known life wasnt delightful so much nicer know than going to stupid fashionable place said miss georgie with bright eye brightest of fresh rose on cheek not that be so ungrateful a to abuse poor old brighton rest will be something new new thing be always better than old one suggested anstruthers new thing always be answered georgie with spirit new virtue for instance be better than old folly new resolution to be charitable instead of old tendency to be harsh new give up interposed hector will agree with always agree with georgie in softer tone poor pretty face bloomed into blush rose color sweet eye met with innocent trouble not always said georgie dont agree with when tell that be not a good a ought to be a might be if must try be bad fellow then drawing nearer to ah georgie etc etc until in fact wandered off in spite of into most dangerous ground of have already spoken actually within last few day idea have occurred to that perhaps possibly just possibly must not be going so far wrong if let drift into gentle passion for georgie perhaps after must give better love than have ever given to lisbeth crespigny must be quieter love be not man second love always quieter than first at same time be not always more endurable deep perhaps must make love worthy of mind be not willow coarse enough to think that anything must do mock sentiment semblance of affection be only that longed to anchor somehow admired trusted warm souled young creature so earnestly that instinctively turned toward be far too good for told be only goodness must help to overlook many fault perhaps must overlook perhaps in time out of ash of wretched passion of youth might arise phnix fair enough to be worthy of womanhood so be something more tender so new tenderness showed in handsome face in certain regret that be to lose what penyllan miss be to gain will let come to see asked at last will there stopped remembering lisbeth how must like plan why must not said georgie with pleased blush have heard say that miss tregarthyn have asked again again seem so fond of be sure mamma papa must be quite glad if must run down look at then run back tell news a to lisbeth lisbeth never object to anything think like well enough when be good come by mean seemed to regard proposition a so natural pleasant that have alternative to profess to regard a such so be agreed upon in course of time must follow to penyllan chapter ix must always be true indeed drifted so far evening that there be knowing how sad story of mine might have be if fate have not be kinder to pretty georgie esmond than be to generality of people surely must have be because deserved something better than fortune of disappointed woman chance interposed in behalf before went to sleep night have enjoyed very much during hector visit have sung sweetest song have be in brightest of good spirit indeed have be very happy perhaps have felt innocent warm heart stirred little once twice by young man tender speech though be very far from being in frame of mind to analyze reason for gentle pleasure when visitor have taken departure came to colonel arm chair possibly feeling somewhat conscience stricken because have left papa to own resource for so long time applied to task of petting in most seductive manner be very quiet papa said settling upon footstool at side hope be not going to have gout again darling mamma what will do with if insists on having gout when be going to penyllan will have to stay at home so will lisbeth can not possibly dispense with when have gout be not going to have gout protested colonel stoutly be quite well dear fact be fact be be thinking of discovery made evening discovery about anstruthers hector exclaimed georgie half unconsciously then turned bright eye upon shining fender yes proceeded colonel esmond hector believe have found out what have changed so so deucedly not to put too fine point upon during last four five year remember what frank warm hearted lad be at three twenty jennie to mr esmond papa interposed georgie do really think have changed for worse in heart mean have not changed for better answered colonel heart be all right dear be sure said georgie little piteously be sure be good at heart of course be said colonel have altered very much in many respect jennie dear have discovered that trouble be one hinted at in beginning there be woman in case woman who treated shamefully must have be very heartless said georgie poor hector colonel warmed up be shamefully heartless be disgracefully unnaturally heartless such cold blooded selfish cruelty must have be unnatural in mature woman be nothing more than school girl mere child congratulate did not learn name man who told story have not heard if knew must ever chance to meet by george with virtuous indignation dont see how man of honor must remain in same room with woman then poured out what have heard of story unpleasant enough sound have when related with additional coloring confidential report have given be bad enough to begin with be worse for having passed through hand of men who have gathered together by scrap odds end joined a thought best worst of be ended colonel esmond that have not lived down a fancy have done at least there be who think so be said girl be here in town now though be not friend anstruthers can not keep away from altogether be always most savage reckless when have seen poor fellow said georgie in low quiet voice poor hector did not look up at one a spoke indeed have not looked up even once during time in unpleasant story have be told having heard confronted very sensibly when indeed be not sweet sensible while listened hundred past incident rushed back upon remembered thing have heard hector say thing have seen do remembered certain restless mood of certain desperate whim fancy began to comprehend what meaning be vague fancy of unhappiness found firm foundation be wretched broken in faith because cruel girl have robbed of honest belief in love truth goodness ah poor hector did not say very much while colonel mr esmond discussed matter be thinking very deeply when bade good night went up to room there be sad sort of thoughtfulness in face did not begin to undress at once sat down by toilet table rested fresh cheek on hand wonder who be said softly who must be whom did know when be three twenty surely fate guided eye just at moment guided to small half opened note lying at elbow note so opened that signature alone presented to glance affectionate lisbeth gave little start then flushed up with queer agitation lisbeth said lisbeth then with self reproach in tone oh not lisbeth how must say not lisbeth put out hand took up note protestingly must not bear to think said might be one else not lisbeth yet next minute new thought forced upon memory of word of lisbeths own be nothing couple of child when met at penyllan that young lady have said few day before trifle cavalierly be only three twenty a for what be child school girl not much more than sixteen protested georgie eye shining piteously moisture forcing into might not have be if be lisbeth loved

between right wrong have nobody miss tregarthyn people who be good be not always wise be not very wise poor loving little soul at least be not worldly wise must not bear thought of connecting that cruel story with most precious lisbeth in whom have never yet found fault if must be connected with what excuse might there not be oh be so sure that be exaggerated story that if truth be known lisbeths fault have only risen out of lisbeths youth innocence be so disturbed about friend that be quite long time before remembered that have quiet little pain of own to contend with only ghost of pain a yet ghost for timely check might have be very much harder to deal with than be think said at last blushing little at sound of own word think that perhaps be beginning to care for hector more than for one else be glad that papa told before before be too late think must have be more sorry after little time than be now ought to be thankful if did not mean to be sensible instead of sentimental perhaps must try to believe that what be said be not true that have really lived trouble down must rather be sensible believe that only mean to think of a friend a have done life must think that thought eagerly must remember always when be with must be best if be lisbeth have loved love yet must try to help to forgive other here bent face a touched note lightly with lip bright drop like jewel fell upon paper must always be true to other whispered tremulously must be sad world if people be not true to other ready to make little sacrifice for sake of love thus be that innocent

interesting being might be brought to might be induced to well not to put too fine point upon to think better of other unfortunate past world generally must not be dreadful to think that so much poetic material have be lost that two who might have be so happy must drift entirely apart leave romance incomplete a most unsatisfactory of novel probably having sensibly even if with little pang given up that bud of romance of own girl felt need of loving plot to occupy mind if so be quite natural very charming that must turn to friend hector must make appearance one of fine day then perhaps penyllan old familiar scene must soften heart a have idea have softened lisbeths surely old memory must touch tenderly make more ready to forgive injury in fact miss georgie painted for very pretty

accordingly miss be restored to perfect peace of mind rendered happy be plain thought that miss esmond have be right there be need for fear how spinster trio enjoyed that evening to be sure used to sing very pretty song for love said miss clarissa wonder if remember one hector be so fond of something very sweet about drinking to somebody with eye must not ask for wine really forget rest lisbeth

fancy must like to learn raised eyebrow gave shoulder puzzled little shrug be welcome to commented be not article of value thanks rather sardonically folded sheet slipped into pocket life at penyllan be scarcely exciting notwithstanding found by mean unenjoyable even now when first week so have accustomed to took long stretch of walk sunned on sand sailed rowed read studied other in secret georgie who studied lisbeth anstruthers by turn found that made more progress with latter than former lisbeth never easy to read be even more incomprehensible than usual shared amusement be prolific in plan to add to manner toward ex adorer be merely reasonably civil hospitable certainly did not encourage comment to friend be manner simply inscrutable can care at wondered georgie doe not look a if have ever be sorry in life yet cried that day with anstruthers be different must not pursue even tenor of way without feeling sometimes sting at first controlled pretty well held own against circumstance even almost calmly then sting came only at rare interval afterward experienced more frequently be not so callous after found more difficult to conceal restlessness when old memory rushed upon with sudden force such memory began to bring bitter rebellious mood with once twice such mood revealed in bitter speech sometimes be silent half gloomy sometimes recklessly gay at time held to georgie a safeguard whatever mood might be drew comfort from presence gave sense of security kind little hand of hers held back from many indiscretion surely day be drawing near when must open heart to ask to let kind young hand be safeguard forever be sorely tempted many day somehow always ended in not yet not quite yet tender admiration for showed so undisguisedly in action that miss tregarthyn looked on

tregarthyn have never yet seen even when thought at worst yet in minute more smiled with actual grimness be being punished now said aloud be being punished now for everything have ever done in life now begin to understand there be humiliation enough in soul then to have made grovel in sand at foot if have be prone to heroic drama yes be beginning to understand be turn now oh to have come to to have learned be characteristic of nature unfortunate nature at time passing through new experience battling fiercely against that when immediately afterward tear began to fill eye roll down cheek be bitter bitter tear of passionate mortification anger must almost have killed for very self contempt shame what reason be there in said none what have brought to nothing be a worthy now a be then isnt sheer madness yes be spoke truly too there be reason in be madness have done nothing to touch heart have made effort to reach yet have reached touched must not have be like to love man because be good because have made love to indeed because of anything action be generally without cause own peremptory fancy here strange sudden caprice of emotion have be too much for how have suffered since discovered weakness one must ever know have writhed under burned under loathed yet be conquered by almost blade of penyllan grass reminded of wrong have done to kindly impetuous young fellow who have loved in past almost grain of penyllan sand taunted with wanton selfishness cruelty must be remembered by man who must have nothing dislike for in present must be grateful now cried bitterly yes grateful for tithe of what once have under foot be eating dirt with vengeance might well frighten miss clarissa with pallor wretched look intensity of misery humiliation be wearing out robbing of sleep appetite wanted to leave penyllan how must suggest georgie be so happy told with vindictive pleasure in pain that must be pity to disturb walked up down beach for hour before returned home when went way be so tired a to be fairly exhausted at side door by entered house met georgie who held open letter in hand whom from asked lisbeth for lack of something to say mamma be girl answer wonder when be going home be enjoying penyllan so much paused blushed just lately have occurred to that might be possible that lisbeth misunderstood relation to hector something in lisbeths face made stop

be sorry for past cruelty must be that remorse have developed into stronger feeling must be that be more than sorry now that be beginning to value love have thrown away even to long for a have said thought frightened little have seen so much to admire in hector anstruthers that have often wondered innocently how be possible that lisbeth must have resisted numerous charm perfection how indeed must woman whom loved be so hard to please a not to appreciate have appreciated told blushing even though have not loved at a have loved lisbeth yet felt now a if must be almost dreadful to think that lisbeth cool self controlled lisbeth have given way in spite of coolness self control then if be true state of affair how much more dreadful became to feel that be misunderstood that lisbeth saw in rival something must be done be plain be difficult matter to decide what something must be ah if have only be matter must have talked over with mamma who knew everything must always advise be lisbeths secret lisbeths hector so must be loyal to trust be quite sad in midst of labyrinth afternoon so sad that when anstruthers came in from village to partake of miss clarissas tea marked change in at once be in gloomy mood so be not to be wondered at that small party around table be not nearly so gay a usual lisbeth have headache eye be heavy said little disappeared a soon a meal be at end georgie

day than have done before have hold upon heart string nevertheless old witchery be exercising full power upon have be so strong at last that have be maddened into making coward effort to free if georgie must stretch out hand might save fatal weakness so even while despised for selfish folly have resolved to throw upon georgies mercy here be end of georgie be wiser than clearer of sight truer of soul stronger with brave simplicity have proved to what shameful folly be georgie must have none of yet how sweet be god bless will leave penyllan in morning said there be nothing to keep here now since want say that forgive georgie will bid other good by for present must not think have anything to forgive answered say that will be wrong in going believe will be best quite understand yet go

what exclaimed new feeling giving time to check think time will ever come when when might feel too think said girl in grave almost reverent voice think time have come now when returned to house lisbeth seeing from parlor window made mental comment judging from face observed must say that have asked to marry have be accepted judging from hers must say answer have be no be not easy to read for once georgie what doe mean georgie came into house with more composed look than face have worn for several day laid garden hat upon hall table walked straight into parlor to dear lisbeth have very shrewd idea that dear lisbeth knew nothing of guest intended departure wanted to be first to break news to must not matter if little secret be betrayed to herself so went to window laid hand on lisbeths shoulder did hector tell that be going asked a if having done so must have be most natural thing in world that be going repeated lisbeth georgie gazed considerately out into garden yes back to london know to morrow suppose think have be idle long enough lisbeth shrugged shoulder rather sudden isnt commented think have be first to hear news gentleman always do thing suddenly remarked georgie astutely have need to have be so discreet lisbeth have be very cool under information indifferent observer might have easily concluded that cared very little about that interest in hector anstruthers going coming be extremely well controlled feeling when came into room few minute later be quite composed enough to touch upon subject with polite regret aunt clarissa will positively mourn ended with one of incomprehensible smile have be almost radiant during visit there share in matter seemed to terminate said nothing when three old lady hearing news poured forth affectionate plaint from first course at dinner until last listened composedly without remark though once twice looked at georgie with rather interested air be turn to feel curious now be curious enough georgie blushed when be looked at scrutinizingly manner be decidedly not that of girl who have just accepted lover said lisbeth examining coolly must not refuse must be fond of if be fond of be too sweet natured straightforward to coquet with yet well be decidedly puzzling found evening rather bore upon whole how be that dragged so in spite of effort thought must never come to end when with long suffering good nature hector drew out chess table challenged delighted miss clarissa to game patience fairly gave way turned to piano for refuge sang song after song until must sing more then when georgie took place made furtive exit slipped out through hall side door into garden what made turn step toward miss clarissas rose thicket did not know went there there have bidden boy lover good by broken heart there have sung little song to georgie hector on occasion have be warm balmy moonlight now be warm balmy moonlight again stood looked through tree catching silvery glimpse of sea in minute so moved hand in impatient gesture be sick of cried breaking silence be sick of whole world of more than rest how wish be like aunt clarissa began to wander about restlessly pulling at rose with particular object because must not keep still bud blossom red cream white be torn from stem ruthlessly until hand be full then stopped again half wondering at what be thinking of said what do want for poor thing remembering parable bitterly might have be very sweet to morrow held cool fresh thing close up to face breathing in fragrance eagerly when took away blossom be bright here there perhaps with dew certainly with dew if be dew that wet fevered cheek softened eye so strangely scarcely three minute later turned with start then stood listening one have left house be coming across lawn toward waited few second to make sure that be not mistaken then bent down over bush began leisurely to gather more rose though be overloaded already where be georgie asked calmly of intruder when reached side georgie returned rather constrained voice be talking to miss hetty miss clarissa sent here to remind that dew be falling that be not strong enough to bear night air miss clarissa be very good lisbeth answered so be dear miss clarissa have be threatening with untimely grave a result of night air ever since be six month old so perhaps be not so grateful a ought to be love darkness rather than light upon whole dont find that disagrees with perhaps because deed be evil perhaps dryly for fully two minute gathered flower in silence while anstruthers waited looked at at last stood upright eye met be beautiful night remarked sententiously yes have have great number of lovely night lately yes busied with rose for little while to exclusion of everything else then gave up well said suppose go into house can hing with here fact be dont know why gathered unless be from impulse of destructiveness let go stop moment said nay almost commanded paused not seeming in least disturbed however must have cut off right hand almost before must have exhibited emotion have reason of own for coming here went on apart from miss clarissas command want to bid good by must be going commented very early in morning yet heart be beating like trip hammer be not be reply though be going early have whim remember whim about song fancy must like to say good by here where said good by once before be easily said answered lisbeth held out one of hand good by took with pretense at coolness a masterly a own must not keep up gave way to swift passionate inexplicable prompting in instant have covered with kiss have even fiercely kissed slender wrist snatched from grasp breathless with anger forgetting resolve to control do mean cried be mad how dare drew back step confronting defiantly know what mean answered unless a say be mad think be mad so being madman will not ask to pardon be farewell be over now however will let take rose carry to house vouchsafed answer turned away left to follow if chose helplessness against drove fairly wild nothing must say do must ever wipe out memory of mad kiss either loved despised utterly remembering manner toward georgie must only conclude that despised have offered deadly insult blood shot into cheek like rush of fire eye blazed ominously dear lisbeth bleated good little miss clarissa moment saw have caught fresh cold be convinced be in high fever fever indeed have never be in such fever in life be fever of anger humiliation think probable said seriously that be going to have measles scarlatina aunt clarissa must prefer georgie came up stair long after have shut in room to find sitting by open window looking worn out wretched lisbeth ventured be possible that be going to be ill probably georgie esmond have never be so spoken to in life a be when dear lisbeth turned upon at simple remark georgie dear said if ask such question again believe will turn out of room lock door georgie regarded for moment in mute amazement after managed to recover beg pardon lisbeth faltered then discreetly turned attention to performance of nightly toilet preparatory to going to bed in morning be lisbeth to whose share meekness fell mood have changed altogether be so astoundingly humble that georgie be alarmed have more patience with than have with georgie said must know be not worth while to say word to do have pity on well be out of sort something have horrible temper really demon might have departed from night showed more temper became almost a amiable a more commonplace young woman made so few caustic speech that miss tregarthyn began to fear that delicate health have affected usual flow of spirit accordingly mourned over in secret not feeling discreet to do so openly used to be so spirited sighed miss hetty over sewing to georgie dont observe alteration in love sister clarissa sister millicent really know what to think must be such comfort to if must only be persuaded to see dr puddifoot be such dear man so extremely talented because have be trying to behave decently think be ill said lisbeth smiling little mournfully just think how must have treated georgie be so used to humor that if be not making actively unpleasant fancy be because have not strength to do if be to snub aunt hetty snap at aunt clarissa believe must shed tear of joy chapter xviii think have secret week so after anstruthers departure georgie decided that visit must come to end mamma be not so very well poor papa have touch of old enemy gout really have be away from home long time did not lisbeth think that have better return to london even though penyllan be still a delightful a ever then have surprise indeed lisbeth who have be listening in rather absent manner aroused to astonish think said that if mind making journey alone georgie must like to stay in penyllan winter in penyllan cried georgie winter lisbeth at penyllan here with cried miss millicent miss hetty miss clarissa in chorus yes answered lisbeth in most non committal fashion at penyllan aunt hetty here aunt millicent with aunt clarissa miss tregarthyn became quite pale glanced at other shook head ominously portended something dreadful indeed love faltered miss clarissa what interposed lisbeth wont let stay be tired of told that must be know before came oh dear protested miss clarissa how can tired of sister hetty sister millicent tired of only thought love that must be so dull to one used to to brilliant vortex of london society ended miss millicent rather grandly if think that will not said lisbeth be tired of brilliant vortex of london society got up from chair went stood by georgie at window looking out yes said almost a if speaking to herself think must like to stay end of be that did stay wrote to mr despard very day announcing intention of remaining georgie in packing trunk actually shed few silent tear among ruff ribbon to mind be sad termination to happy visit knew that must mean something serious that there must be powerful motive at bottom of resolution if lisbeth must only not be so reserved if be only little easier to understand will miss very much lisbeth ventured mournfully not more than will miss answered lisbeth who at time stood near watching a knelt before box be packing georgie paused in task to look up doubtfully then why will do said must have reason yes said lisbeth have reason girl eye still appealed to so went on with rather melancholy smile have two reason perhaps more penyllan agrees with want to go back to town yet be going to take rest must need one aunt clarissa must not find so much fault with appearance dont want to go off on look before time know be always telling be pale thin be pale thin georgie yes confessed georgie be gave troubled look then returned there be more reason must rusticate perhaps by spring will be red fat like miss rosamond puddifoot with little laugh will have taken to tract soup kitchen given up world wear yellow bonnet call london vortex of sinful pleasure a doe why dear georgie what be matter fact be that certain incongruity in beloved lisbeths look tone have so frightened georgie touched susceptible heart that tear have rushed to eye be filled with dolorous pity be not be not happy cried at once be not must not speak in queer satirical way wish must be little little more kind lisbeth lisbeths look be positively guilty one kind exclaimed kind georgie having gone so far georgie must not easily draw back be fain to go on though became conscious that have placed in very trying position be not kind to keep everything to so closely said tremulously a if did not care for must not comprehend stopped because lisbeth frightened again became so pale that be impossible to say anything more great dark eye dilated a if with kind of horror at something think have secret interrupted with hollow sounding laugh be determined to make heroine out of instead of allowing to enjoy nerve in peace dont comprehend nerve be clear be running at red rag georgie dear be astonishing how prone good tender hearted people be to run at red rag toss worry be plain that must never betray must hold at arm length even creature who loved best be most worthy of confidence be useless to try to win to revelation of feeling georgie fell to at packing again with very melancholy consciousness of fact that have done no good by losing control over innocent emotion might have done harm have pained inexpressibly to see that quick dread of self betrayal have announced in sudden loss of color odd expression in friend eye doe not love a love her be pathetic mental conclusion if did must not be so afraid of when lisbeth bade good by at little railway station girl heart quite failed what will say to mamma papa asked tell penyllan agrees with so well that dont like to leave for present be lisbeths answer tell mr esmond will write to myself in timid desperation hector lisbeth hector rather sharply why hector what have to do with matter stay shrugging shoulder suppose must be only civil tell tell aunt clarissa sends love hope will take care of lung yet though irreverent speech be last made in most malicious manner delicate dark face light small figure have strangely desolate look to georgie a when train bore away caught last farewell glimpse of on platform of small station lisbeth stood before mirror that night slowly brushing up hair feeling silence of small chamber acutely must never have done said to herself must never have done at be better way better by far be hard enough to face be fantastic enough to think that have really determined to face in minute so sat down with brush in hand hair loose upon shoulder to confront fact once more be going to spend winter at penyllan have given up flesh pot of egypt be going to breakfast at eight dine at two when there be company take five oclock tea spend evening with miss tregarthyn must stroll in garden walk on beach take miss clarissas medicine meekly at point new view of case presented to began to laugh mustard bath dr puddifoots prescription in incongruous connection with own personal knowledge of thing appeared at once so ludicrous that got better of laughed until found cry then angry a be at own weakness tear got better of too for short time if have never be emotional before be emotional enough in day must not pride upon immovability now felt constantly either passionate anger against passionate contempt passionate eagerness to retrieve lost self respect what must do how must rescue must not do must not do must make new struggle sort of thing be saying feverishly from morning until night secretly have almost learned to detest penyllan penyllan told have be cause of folly be safer at present than london if stayed at penyllan long enough surely must wear out rather wear out fancy le resolute young woman must in likelihood have trifled weakly with danger be not so with lisbeth have not trifled with from first have held stubbornly aloof from little self indulgence now be harder upon than ever must have died cheerfully rather than have betrayed if must die surely must endure dull winter moral condition be so far improved however that did not visit small misery upon aunt a must have done in olden day behavior be really creditable under circumstance played chess with miss clarissa in evening read aloud sung for began to take whimsical pleasure in delight at condescension be so easily delighted that felt many sting of shame at former delinquency have almost morbid longing to be good like georgie practiced being good upon three spinster with persistence at herself laughed cried when be alone first letter to georgie puzzled girl indescribably yet touched somehow who believed beloved lisbeth to be perfect among woman must not quite understand psychological crisis through be passing yet must not fail to feel that something unusual be happening take aunt clarissas medicine with mild regularity alarm letter announced think must be going into consumption tearfully consults dr puddifoot in private cook be ordered to prepare particularly nourishing soup for dinner if appetite be not something startling everybody turn pale yet doe not seem to a good joke a must have done year ago see side to wonder how be that can be so fond of for part be sure must never have be fond of lisbeth crespigny chapter xix be end of rose fell one by one in miss clarissas flower bed so at last did palest autumn bloom leaf dropped from tree wind from sea began to blow across sand in chilly gust lisbeth stayed bravely on rainy day dragged by wearily enough cold one made appearance did not give up even when mr despard wondered georgie implored in weekly epistle winter routine of tregarthyn household be not exciting be sort of safeguard better dullness than something worse perhaps in time by spring might be different yet must not say that found state of mind improving a to body well miss clarissa might well sigh over in secret if have be pale thin before have not gained flesh color persisted in long walk in desperation came home after looking haggard hollow eyed wandered about garden in self defense be le tired followed dr puddifoots direction to letter to miss tregarthyns dismay be not improved in fact a great man dr puddifoot observed something be radically wrong be unequal miserable enough struggle have termination like such termination be abrupt unexpected almost fantastic one lisbeth have never thought of such end to self inflicted penance such possibility have presented to mind be not way to romance have confined to reality sitting at bedroom window one chill uncomfortable december day arrived at fanciful caprice be a raw miserable day a one must rather must not wish to see wind blew over sea in gust gull flew languidly under gray sky few dead leaf swirled about in eddy in road yet caprice took possession of lisbeth a looked out appreciated perfection of desolateness since georgie have left penyllan have never once be near old trysting place walk have always be in opposite direction now suddenly occurred to that must like to go see how thing must look in present mood in five minute from time fancy seized miss clarissa caught glimpse of something through parlor window made utter exclamation lisbeth said out again on such day dear do trust be well wrapped up lisbeth made way against damp chill wind with touch of positively savage pleasure in own discomfort sand be wet unpleasant to walk on be not sorry what did matter be in frame of mind to experience sort of malicious enjoyment of outward misery tryst looked melancholy enough when reached made way to nook behind sheltering rock stood there looking out to sea have not expected to find place wearing summer aspect be scarcely prepared to face such desolateness everything be gray gray tossing sea gray screaming gull gray lowering sky must have be better to have stayed at home said still must not make up mind to turn back at once lingered little leaning against rock shivering feeling dreary so be that man who be approaching first caught sight of figure lisbeth did not see man did not care to see man woman at present gull suited better than human being believed to be utterly alone until footstep upon sand quite near made turn with impatient start man be not yard from side raised hat stood still man be hector anstruthers for moment neither uttered word lisbeth thought heart must have stopped beating have turned cold a marble when must control sufficiently to think at thought of georgie what be matter exclaimed be somebody ill georgie georgie be quite well answered then came close held out hand with strange melancholy smile ask pardon for alarming said ask pardon for coming without excuse have excuse wont shake hand with lisbeth got through ceremony a quickly a possible then drew back folding shawl about be shivering with something besides cold if have only be safe at home if nobody be in danger what on earth have come for be little startled said penyllan be not very attractive to people a rule in winter seemed most natural thing that georgie be ill have sent to then after little pause sidelong glance at look a if have be ill certainly did be thin haggard care worn eye be dangerously bright have restless air be not so sublime dandy either a have be there be even kind of negligence about aunt clarissa must have be very much alarmed when saw lisbeth proceeded trying to get up creditable smile have not seen miss clarissa answered came here first be so ominous that lisbeth succumbed knew when said that did not intend to keep up appearance made one more poor effort then perhaps have better go home remarked returned quickly have something to say felt losing strength what did matter let say what must perhaps be something about georgie have dreary feeling that be ready for anything go on said oh cried in bitter impatient resignation of stoicism arm against know will do sneer at folly be prepared for too will speak be fate be fool must speak be to say came here interposed lisbeth came because must not stay away be fate tell almost angrily will not let rest when kissed hand that last night gave up to madness have tried to persuade have love for that cured showed how have deceived have never ceased to love from first word died upon lip looked a have never seen look before leaned against rock a if needed support suddenly eye lash be wet began to tremble slightly checked full of swift remorse what rough brute be dont said did not mean to frighten lifted eye piteously lip parted a if be going to speak did not speak be even weaker than have thought have never be so helpless shaken before shrank from drooping face upon rock burst into hysterical tear did not pause to ask what meant did not understand woman nerve only comprehended that have given way that everything be changed that be unstrung weeping in moment have in arm exclaiming passionately lisbeth lisbeth then little straw hat with blue ribbon slipping away from small pale face lay upon breast bent covered small pale tear wet face with reckless kiss for moment did not care what came next what doom brought upon be so mad with long pent up love misery found little hand under shawl too fell to kissing that also must not let go dont be cruel to lisbeth pleaded when tried to draw away be forced to let remain dont be cruel to said still held hand when released at last stood up miserable shame faced yet far le miserable than have be be who be cruel faltered what be to say to have left nothing to say hung back half afraid of vehemence have begun with bitter raving in five minute have ended by crushing in arm be punishment that must be so humbled brought down say nothing cried let say love be fate must not help seeing fantastic side of smiled little daring smile though hung head be proposing to ventured hoping to retrieve must not stand that must not let burst out again leave chance to assert privilege to struggle at retaining upper hand told that came in spite of because must not stay away be true asked yes must not help feeling glow of triumph shone in eye be glad of said be glad save so much may stay exclaimed in old impetuous fashion lisbeth though held hand fast managed to stoop down under pretense of rescuing blue ribboned hat from sand need not go answered be end of three miss tregarthyn looked at in blank dismay when two walked into parlor hour after hector grasped nettle with matter of fact boldness for lisbeth intensely admired in secret went out on beach to find miss crespigny found announced here be miss clarissa miss millicent miss hetty have promised to marry oblige with blessing trio fell upon beloved lisbeth embraced a have done on previous
