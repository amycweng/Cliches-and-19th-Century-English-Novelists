glance at beginning of next week there occurred event changed materially ordinary routine of life in cabin heretofore two sojourner among mountain fastness have walked climbed under escort of small tow headed harney one evening a sat sketching on favorite flat seat of rock miss noble somewhat alarmed youth by dropping paper starting to foot orlander harney sat stared at with black eye opened mouth red came went under fair skin breathed quickly oh cried softly how must be mistaken that be not mistaken became evident immediately at very moment spoke advancing horseman whose appearance have so roused glanced upward along path caught sight of figure lifted hat in gay greeting struck horse lightly with whip rebecca bent down picked up portfolio may go home said quietly to boy will be there soon may tell miss thorne that mr lennox have come be at base of rock when stranger drew rein how be asked with bright uplifted eye did not think occurred to lennox that have never recognized peculiar charm so fully a did at moment rebecca noble though not beauty possessed subtle grace of look air be not easily resisted just now a held out hand clear sweetness of face shadowed by piquantly plain hat of rough straw felt influence of element more strongly than ever before there be reason why must not come said since did not forbid at sunset returned to cabin lennox led rather sorry looking

acceptable to temporary hermit outside moon shone with light a clear a day though softer tender night breeze stirred pine top nestled among laurel inside by beautiful barbarous light of flaring pine knot on hearth two talker at least found hour fly swiftly when two bade other good night be only natural that must reach point toward have be veering for twelve month miss thorne remained in room drawing nearer fire with amiable little shiver well excused by mountain coolness rebecca be beguiled into stepping out into moonlight brightness of moon blackness of shadow cast by tree rock undergrowth seemed somehow to heighten effect of intense utter stillness reigning around even occasional distant cry of wandering wild creature marked rather than broke in upon silence rebecca glance about be half nervous be very beautiful said move one strongly be not sure that be not in of one mood just little oppressive be possible lennox did not hear be looking down at with eager eye suddenly have caught hand to lip kissed know why be here rebecca said surely hoping be not vain looked pale little startled lifted face did not draw away be asked again have come on hopeless errand answered have not word came freely enough then with fire when rebecca reentered cabin large eye shone in small sweet face lip wore charming curve miss thorne turned in chair to look at be betrayed into smile mr lennox have gone of course said yes then after brief silence in rebecca pushed pine knot with foot elder lady spoke again think may a well tell about beck child said beck looked down shook head with very charming gravity why must asked when when know lennox rode mildly disposed violently gaited steed homeward in reposeful state of bliss known only to accepted lover have plucked flower at

saw in flood of moonlight almost caused to doubt for moment evidence of sens how be possible for to believe that there really must stand in such spot girl attired in black velvet of stagy cut trimming must not comprehend few foot from there certainly stood such girl who bent lithe round shape over spring gazing into depth with eagerness of insatiable vanity ca see nothing heard say impatiently ca see nothin nohow despite beauty first glance must not help showing be figure so incongruous inconsistent a to be almost bizarre when stood upright revealing fully tall figure in shabby finery felt something like resentment made restive movement heard bit of broken looking glass held in hand fell into water uttered shamefaced angry cry what d want exclaimed what be doin ' did know a one be
