fretful have nothing to read to look at have folded thin little black gloved hand in lap black dress made look yellower than ever limp light hair straggled from under black crepe hat more marred looking young one never saw in life mr medlock thought marred be yorkshire word mean spoiled pettish have never seen child who sat so still without doing anything at last got tired of watching began to talk in brisk hard voice suppose may a well tell something about where be going to said do know anything about uncle said mary never heard father mother talk about said mary frowning frowned because remembered that father mother have never talked to about anything in particular certainly have never told thing humph muttered mr medlock staring at queer unresponsive little face did not say

pretty thing 'd have walked world over to get blade o ' grass wanted nobody thought 'd marry did people said married for money did did positively when died mary gave little involuntary jump oh did die exclaimed quite without meaning to have just remembered french fairy story have once read called riquet la houppe have be about poor hunchback beautiful princess have made suddenly sorry for mr archibald craven yes died mr medlock answered made queerer than ever care about nobody wo see people most of time go away when be at misselthwaite shuts up in west wing wo let one pitcher see be old fellow took care of when be child know way sounded like something in book did not make mary feel cheerful house with hundred room nearly shut up with door locked house on edge of moor whatsoever moor be sounded dreary man with crooked back who shut up also stared out of window with lip pinched together seemed quite natural that rain must have begun to pour down in gray slanting line splash stream down window pane if pretty wife have be alive might have made thing cheerful by being something like own mother by running in out going to party a have done in frock full of lace be not there more need expect to see because ten to one wo said mr medlock must expect that there will be people to talk to will have to play about look after will be told what room can go into what room be to keep out of there garden enough when be in house go wandering poking about mr craven wo have will not want to go poking about said sour little mary just a suddenly a have begun to be rather sorry for mr archibald craven began to cease to be sorry to think be unpleasant enough to deserve have happened to turned face toward streaming pane of window of railway carriage gazed out at gray rain storm

lunchbasket at one of station have chicken cold beef bread butter hot tea rain seemed to be streaming down more heavily than ever everybody in station wore wet glistening waterproof guard lighted lamp in carriage mr medlock cheered up very much over tea chicken beef ate great deal afterward fell asleep mary sat stared at watched fine bonnet slip on one side until fell asleep once more in corner of carriage lulled by splashing of rain against window be quite dark when awakened again train have stopped at station mr medlock be shaking have have sleep said be time to open eye be at thwaite station have got long drive before mary stood up tried to keep eye open while mr medlock collected parcel little girl did not offer to help because in india native servant always picked up carried thing

queer broad fashion mary found out afterward be yorkshire see tha got back said ' tha browt th ' young with thee aye be answered mr medlock speaking with yorkshire accent jerking head over shoulder toward mary how thy missus well enow th ' carriage be waitin ' outside for thee brougham stood on road before little outside platform mary saw that be smart carriage that be smart footman who helped in long waterproof coat waterproof covering of hat be shining dripping with rain a everything be burly station master included when shut door mounted box with coachman drove off little girl found seated in comfortably cushioned corner be not inclined to go to sleep again sat looked out of window curious to see something of road over be being driven to queer place mr medlock have spoken of be not at timid child be not exactly frightened felt that there be knowing what might happen in house with hundred room nearly shut up house standing on edge of moor what be moor said suddenly to mr medlock look out of window in about ten minute will see woman answered have got to drive five mile across missel moor before get to manor wo see much because be dark night can see something mary asked more question waited in darkness of corner keeping eye on window carriage lamp cast ray of light little distance ahead of caught glimpse of thing passed after have left station have driven through tiny village have seen whitewashed cottage light of public house then have passed church vicarage little shop window so in cottage with toy sweet odd thing set out for sale then be on highroad saw hedge tree after there seemed nothing different for long time at least seemed long time to at last horse began to go more slowly a if be climbing up hill presently there seemed to be no more hedge more tree must see nothing in fact dense darkness on side leaned forward pressed face against window just a carriage gave big jolt eh be on moor now sure enough said mr medlock carriage lamp shed yellow light on rough looking road seemed to be cut through bush low growing thing ended in great expanse of dark apparently spread out before around wind be rising making singular wild low rushing sound be be not sea be said mary looking round at companion not answered mr medlock be field mountain be just mile mile mile of wild land that nothing grows on heather gorse broom nothing life on wild pony sheep feel a if might be sea if there be water on said mary sound like sea just now be wind blowing through bush mr medlock said be wild dreary enough place to mind though there be plenty like particularly when heather in bloom on on drove through darkness though rain stopped wind rushed by whistled made strange sound road went up down several time carriage passed over little bridge beneath water rushed very fast with great deal of noise mary felt a if drive must never come to end that wide bleak moor be wide expanse of black ocean through be passing on strip of dry land like said to like pinched thin lip more tightly together horse be climbing up hilly piece of road when first caught sight of light mr medlock saw a soon a did drew long sigh of relief eh be glad to see bit o light twinkling exclaimed be light in lodge window will get good cup of tea after bit at event be after bit a said for when carriage passed through park gate there be still two mile of avenue to drive through tree nearly met overhead made seem a if be driving through long dark vault drove out of vault into clear space stopped before immensely long low built house seemed to ramble round stone court at first mary thought that there be light at in window a got out of carriage saw that one room in corner up stair showed dull glow entrance door be huge one made of massive curiously shaped panel of oak studded with big iron nail bound with great iron bar opened into enormous hall be so dimly lighted that face in portrait on wall figure in suit of armor made mary feel that did not want to look at a stood on stone floor looked very small odd little black figure felt a small lost odd a looked neat thin old man stood near manservant who opened door for be to take to room said in husky voice doe want to see be going to london in morning very well mr pitcher mr medlock answered so long a know what be expected of can manage what be expected of mr medlock mr pitcher said be that make sure that

fire in supper on table mr medlock said unceremoniously well here be room next be where will live must keep to forget that be in way mistress mary arrived at misselthwaite manor have perhaps never felt quite so contrary in life chapter iv martha when opened eye in morning be because young housemaid have come into room to light fire be kneeling on hearth rug raking out cinder noisily mary lay watched for few moment then began to look about room have never seen room at like thought curious gloomy wall be covered with tapestry with forest scene embroidered on there be fantastically dressed people under tree in distance there be glimpse of turret of castle there be hunter horse dog lady mary felt a if be in forest with out of deep window must see great climbing stretch of land seemed to have tree on to look rather like endless dull purplish sea what be that said pointing out of window martha young housemaid who have just risen to foot looked pointed also that there said yes be th '

nothing amusing in after breakfast gazed out of window across to huge moor seemed to spread out on side climb up to sky after have stared for while realized that if did not go out must have to stay in hing so went out did not know that be best thing must have done did not know that when began to walk quickly even run along path down avenue be stirring slow blood making stronger by fighting with wind swept down from moor ran only to make herself warm hated wind rushed at face roared held back a if be giant must not see big breath of rough fresh air blown over heather filled lung with something be good for whole thin body whipped red color into cheek brightened dull eye when did not know anything about after few day spent almost entirely out of door wakened one morning knowing what be to be hungry when sat down to breakfast did not glance disdainfully at porridge push away took up spoon began to eat went on eating until bowl be empty tha ' got on well enough with mornin ' did

creeping dark green leaf be more bushy than elsewhere seemed a if for long time that part have be neglected rest of have be clipped made to look neat at lower end of walk have not be trimmed at few day after have talked to ben weatherstaff mary stopped to notice wondered why be so have just paused be looking up at long spray of ivy swinging in wind when saw gleam of scarlet heard brilliant chirp there on top of wall perched ben weatherstaff robin redbreast tilting forward to look at with small head on one side oh cried out be be did not seem at queer to that spoke to a if be sure that must

liking thought of robin a one of people went to walk outside long ivy covered wall over must see tree top second time walked up down most interesting exciting thing happened to be through ben weatherstaff robin heard chirp twitter when looked at bare flower bed at left side there be hopping about pretending to peck thing out of earth to persuade that have not followed knew have followed surprise so filled with delight that almost trembled little do remember cried out do be prettier than anything else in world chirped talked coaxed hopped flirted tail twittered be a if be talking red waistcoat be like satin puffed tiny breast out be so fine so grand so pretty that be really a if be showing how important like human person robin must be mistress mary forgot that have ever be contrary in life when allowed to draw closer closer to bend down talk try to make something like robin sound oh to think that must actually let come a near to a that knew nothing in world must make put out hand toward startle in least tiniest way knew because be real person only nicer than other person in world be so happy that scarcely dared to breathe flower bed be not quite bare be bare of

few minute to talk about what be happening on moor in lane hedge on border of stream thing have to tell about otter badger water rat house not to mention bird nest field mouse burrow be enough to make almost tremble with excitement when heard intimate detail from animal charmer realized with what thrilling eagerness anxiety whole busy underworld be working be same a said dickon only have to build home year keep so busy fair scuffle to get done most absorbing thing however be preparation to be made before colin must be transported with sufficient secrecy to garden one must see chair carriage dickon mary after turned certain corner of shrubbery entered upon walk outside ivied wall a day passed colin have become more more fixed in feeling that mystery surrounding garden be one of greatest charm nothing must spoil that one must ever suspect that have secret people must think that be simply going out with mary dickon because liked did not object to looking at have long quite delightful talk about route must go up path down one cross other go round among fountain flower bed a if be looking at bedding out plant head gardener mr roach have be having arranged must seem such rational thing to do one must think at mysterious must turn into shrubbery walk lose until came to long wall be almost a serious elaborately thought out a plan of march made by great general in time of war rumor of new curious thing be occurring in invalid apartment have of course filtered through servant hall into stable yard out among gardener notwithstanding mr roach be startled one day when received order from master colin room to effect that must report in apartment outsider have ever seen a invalid desired to speak to well well said to a hurriedly changed coat what be to do now royal highness be to be looked at calling up man be never set eye on mr roach be not without curiosity have never caught even glimpse of boy have heard dozen exaggerated story about uncanny look way insane temper

well have be prepared might have be startled when bedroom door be opened large crow seemed quite at home perched on high back of carven chair announced entrance of visitor by saying caw caw quite loudly in spite of mr medlock warning mr roach only just escaped being sufficiently undignified to jump backward young rajah be neither in bed on sofa be sitting in armchair young lamb be standing by shaking tail in feeding lamb fashion a dickon knelt giving milk from bottle squirrel be perched on dickon bent back attentively nibbling nut little girl from india be sitting on big footstool looking on here be mr roach master colin said mr medlock young rajah turned looked servitor over at least be what head gardener felt happened oh be roach be said sent for to give very important order very

little breast careful wing at first be very nervous robin be indignantly watchful even dickon did not go near close grown corner in day waited until by quiet working of mysterious spell seemed to have conveyed to soul of little pair that in garden there be nothing be not quite like nothing did not understand wonderfulness of what be happening to immense tender terrible heart breaking beauty solemnity of egg if there have be one person in garden who have not known through innermost being that if egg be taken away hurt whole world must whirl round crash through space come to end if there have be even one who did not feel act accordingly there must have be happiness even in golden springtime air knew felt robin mate knew knew at first robin watched mary colin with sharp anxiety for mysterious reason knew need not watch dickon first moment set dew bright black eye on dickon knew be not stranger sort of robin without beak feather must speak robin be quite distinct language not to be mistaken for other to speak robin to robin be like speaking french to frenchman dickon always spoke to robin so queer gibberish used when spoke to human did not matter in least robin thought spoke gibberish to because be not intelligent enough to understand feathered speech movement also be robin never startled one by being sudden enough to seem dangerous threatening robin must understand dickon so presence be not even disturbing at outset seemed necessary to be on guard against other two in first place boy creature did not come into garden on leg be pushed in on thing with wheel skin of wild animal be thrown over that in be doubtful then when began to stand up move about did in queer unaccustomed way others seemed to have to help robin used to secrete in bush watch anxiously head tilted first on one side then on other thought that slow movement might mean that be preparing to pounce a cat do when cat be preparing to pounce creep over ground very slowly robin talked over with mate great deal for few day after that decided not to speak of subject because terror be so great that be afraid might be injurious to egg when boy began to walk by even to move more quickly be immense relief for long time seemed long time to robin be source of anxiety did not act a other human did seemed very fond of walking have way of sitting lying down for while then getting up in disconcerting manner to begin again one day robin remembered that when have be made to learn to fly by parent have done much same sort of thing have taken short flight of few yard then have be obliged to rest so occurred to that boy be learning to fly rather to walk mentioned to mate when told that egg must probably conduct in same way after be fledged be quite comforted even became eagerly interested derived great pleasure from watching boy over edge of nest though always thought that egg must be much cleverer learn more quickly then said indulgently that human be always more clumsy slow than egg most of never seemed really to learn to fly at never met in air on tree top after while boy began to move about a others did three of child at time did unusual thing must stand under tree move arm leg head about in way be walking running sitting down went through movement at interval day robin be never able to explain to mate what be doing trying to do must only say that be sure that egg must never flap about in such manner a boy who must speak robin so fluently be doing thing with bird must be quite sure that action be not of dangerous nature of course robin mate have ever heard of champion wrestler bob haworth exercise for making muscle stand out like lump robin be not like human being muscle be always exercised from first so develop in natural manner if have to fly about to find meal eat muscle become atrophied atrophied mean wasted away through want of use when boy be walking running about digging weeding like others nest in corner be brooded over by great
