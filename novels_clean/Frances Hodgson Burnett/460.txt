traffic business have be almost entirely stopped by that accident have happened in street that people having lost way have wandered about turning corner until found far from intended destination obliged to take refuge in hotel house of hospitable stranger curious incident have occurred odd story be told by who have felt obliged by circumstance to go out into baffling gloom guessed that something of like nature have fallen upon town again gas light on landing in melancholy hall burned feebly so feebly that one got vague view of rickety hat stand shabby overcoat head gear hanging upon be well for that have corner so to turn before reached pawnshop in whose window have seen pistol intended to buy when opened street door saw that fog be upon whole perhaps even heavier more obscuring
