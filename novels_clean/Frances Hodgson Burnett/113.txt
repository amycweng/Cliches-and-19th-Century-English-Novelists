daughter guardian child be to be brought here must go to london bring so packed small trunk made journey mary sat in corner of railway carriage looked plain fretful have nothing to read to look at have folded thin little black gloved hand in lap black dress made look yellower than ever limp light hair straggled from under black crpe hat more marred looking young one never saw in life mr medlock thought marred be yorkshire word mean spoiled pettish have never seen child who sat so still without doing anything at last got tired of watching began to talk in brisk hard voice suppose may a well tell something about where be going to said do know anything about uncle said mary never heard father mother talk about said mary frowning frowned because remembered that father mother have never talked to about anything in particular certainly have never told thing humph muttered mr medlock staring at queer unresponsive little face did not say more for few moment then began again suppose might a well be told somethingto prepare be going to queer place mary said nothing at mr medlock looked rather discomfited by apparent indifference after taking breath went on not that grand big place in gloomy way mr craven proud of in wayand thats gloomy enough too house be six hundred year old on edge of moor there near hundred room in though most of thems shut up locked there picture fine old furniture thing thats be there for age there big park round garden tree with branch trailing to groundsome of paused took breath there nothing else ended suddenly mary have begun to listen in spite of herself sounded so unlike india anything new rather attracted did not intend to look a if be interested be one of unhappy disagreeable way so sat still well said mr medlock what do think of nothing answered know nothing about such place made mr medlock laugh short sort of laugh eh said be like old woman dont care doesnt matter said mary whether care not be right enough there said mr medlock doesnt what youre to be kept at misselthwaite manor for dont know unless because easiest way he not going to trouble about thats sure certain never trouble about one stopped a if have just remembered something in time he got crooked back said that set wrong be sour young man got good of money big place till be married mary eye turned toward in spite of intention not to seem to care have never thought of hunchback being married be trifle surprised mr medlock saw a be talkative woman continued with more interest be one way of passing of time at rate be sweet pretty thing hed have walked world over to get blade o grass wanted nobody thought shed marry did people said married for money didntshe didnt positively when died mary gave little involuntary jump oh did die exclaimed quite without meaning to have just remembered french fairy story have once read called riquet la houppe have be about poor hunchback beautiful princess have made suddenly sorry for mr archibald craven yes died mr medlock answered made queerer than ever care about nobody wont see people most of time go away when be at misselthwaite shuts up in west wing wont let anyone see pitcher old fellow took care of when be child know way sounded like something in book did not make mary feel cheerful house with hundred room nearly shut up with door lockeda house on edge of moorwhatsoever moor wassounded dreary man with crooked back who shut up also stared out of window with lip pinched together seemed quite natural that rain must have begun to pour down in gray slanting line splash stream down window pane if pretty wife have be alive might have made thing cheerful by being something like own mother by running in out going to party a have done in frock full of lace be not there more neednt expect to see because ten to one wont said mr medlock mustnt expect that there will be people to talk to youll have to play about look after youll be told what room can go into what room youre to keep out of there garden enough when youre in house dont go wandering poking about mr craven have will not want to go poking about said sour little mary just a suddenly a have begun to be rather sorry for mr archibald craven began to cease to be sorry to think be unpleasant enough to deserve have happened to turned face toward streaming pane of window of railway carriage gazed out at gray rain storm looked a if must go on forever ever watched so long steadily that grayness grew heavier heavier before eye fell asleep chapter iii across moor slept long time when awakened mr medlock have bought lunchbasket at one of station have chicken cold beef bread butter hot tea rain seemed to be streaming down more heavily than ever everybody in station wore wet glistening waterproof guard lighted lamp in carriage mr medlock cheered up very much over tea chicken beef ate great deal afterward fell asleep mary sat stared at watched fine bonnet slip on one side until fell asleep once more in corner of carriage lulled by splashing of rain against window be quite dark when awakened again train have stopped at station mr medlock be shaking have have sleep said time to open eye be at thwaite station weve got long drive before mary stood up tried to keep eye open while mr medlock collected parcel little girl did not offer to help because in india native servant always picked up carried thing seemed quite proper that other people must wait on one station be small one nobody seemed to be getting out of train station master spoke to mr medlock in rough good natured way pronouncing word in queer broad fashion mary found out afterward be yorkshire see thas got back said thas browt th young un with thee aye thats answered mr medlock speaking with yorkshire accent jerking head over shoulder toward mary hows thy missus well enow th carriage be waitin outside for thee brougham stood on road before little outside platform mary saw that be smart carriage that be smart footman who helped in long waterproof coat waterproof covering of hat be shining dripping with rain a everything be burly station master included when shut door mounted box with coachman drove off little girl found seated in comfortably cushioned corner be not inclined to go to sleep again sat looked out of window curious to see something of road over be being driven to queer place mr medlock have spoken of be not at timid child be not exactly frightened felt that there be knowing what might happen in house with hundred room nearly shut upa house standing on edge of moor what be moor said suddenly to mr medlock look out of window in about ten minute see woman answered weve got to drive five mile across missel moor before get to manor wont see much because dark night can see something mary asked more question waited in darkness of corner keeping eye on window carriage lamp cast ray of light little distance ahead of caught glimpse of thing passed after have left station have driven through tiny village have seen whitewashed cottage light of public house then have passed church vicarage little shop window so in cottage with toy sweet odd thing set out for sale then be on highroad saw hedge tree after there seemed nothing different for long timeor at least seemed long time to at last horse began to go more slowly a if be climbing up hill presently there seemed to be no more hedge more tree must see nothing in fact dense darkness on side leaned forward pressed face against window just a carriage gave big jolt eh be on moor now sure enough said mr medlock carriage lamp shed yellow light on rough looking road seemed to be cut through bush low growing thing ended in great expanse of dark apparently spread out before around wind be rising making singular wild low rushing sound itsits not sea be said mary looking round at companion not answered mr medlock isnt field mountain just mile mile mile of wild land that nothing grows on heather gorse broom nothing life on wild pony sheep feel a if might be sea if there be water on said mary sound like sea just now thats wind blowing through bush mr medlock said wild dreary enough place to mind though there plenty that like itparticularly when heather in bloom on on drove through darkness though rain stopped wind rushed by whistled made strange sound road went up down several time carriage passed over little bridge beneath water rushed very fast with great deal of noise mary felt a if drive must never come to end that wide bleak moor be wide expanse of black ocean through be passing on strip of dry land dont like said to herself dont like pinched thin lip more tightly together horse be climbing up hilly piece of road when first caught sight of light mr medlock saw a soon a did drew long sigh of relief eh be glad to see bit o light twinkling exclaimed light in lodge window will get good cup of tea after bit at event be after bit a said for when carriage passed through park gate there be still two mile of avenue to drive through tree nearly met overhead made seem a if be driving through long dark vault drove out of vault into clear space stopped before immensely long low built house seemed to ramble round stone court at first mary thought that there be light at in window a got out of carriage saw that one room in corner upstairs showed dull glow entrance door be huge one made of massive curiously shaped panel of oak studded with big iron nail bound with great iron bar opened into enormous hall be so dimly lighted that face in portrait on wall figure in suit of armor made mary feel that did not want to look at a stood on stone floor looked very small odd little black figure felt a small lost odd a looked neat thin old man stood near manservant who opened door for be to take to room said in husky voice doesnt want to see he going to london in morning very well mr pitcher mr medlock answered so long a know whats expected of can manage whats expected of mr medlock mr pitcher said be that make sure that he not disturbed that doesnt see what doesnt want to see then mary lennox be led up broad staircase down long corridor up short flight of step through corridor until door opened in wall found in room with fire in supper on table mr medlock said unceremoniously well here be room next be where youll liveand must keep to dont forget that be in way mistress mary arrived at misselthwaite manor have perhaps never felt quite so contrary in life chapter iv martha when opened eye in morning be because young housemaid have come into room to light fire be kneeling on hearth rug raking out cinder noisily mary lay watched for few moment then began to look about room have never seen room at like thought curious gloomy wall be covered with tapestry with forest scene embroidered on there be fantastically dressed people under tree in distance there be glimpse of turret of castle there be hunter horse dog lady mary felt a if be in forest with out of deep window must see great climbing stretch of land seemed to have tree on to look rather like endless dull purplish sea what be that said pointing out of window martha young housemaid who have just risen to foot looked pointed also

fine young lady maid must have be more subservient respectful must have known that be business to brush hair button boot pick thing up lay away be however only untrained yorkshire rustic who have be brought up in moorland cottage with swarm of little brother sister who have never dreamed of doing anything waiting on on younger one who be baby in arm just learning to totter about tumble over thing if mary lennox have be child who be ready to be amused must perhaps have laughed at marthas readiness to talk mary only listened to coldly wondered at freedom of manner at first be not at all

with old gray fountain in midst flower bed be bare wintry fountain be not playing be not garden be shut up how must garden be shut up must always walk into garden be just thinking when saw that at end of path be following there seemed to be long wall with ivy growing over be not familiar enough with england to know that be coming upon kitchen garden where vegetable fruit be growing went toward wall found that there be green door in ivy that stood open be not closed garden evidently must go into went through door found that be garden with wall round that be only one of several walled garden seemed to open into one saw open green door revealing bush pathway between bed containing winter vegetable fruit tree be trained flat against wall over of bed there be glass frame place be bare ugly enough mary thought a stood stared about might be nicer in summer when thing be green there be nothing pretty about now presently old man with spade over shoulder walked through door leading from second garden looked startled when saw mary then touched cap have surly old face did not seem at pleased to see herbut then be displeased with garden wore quite contrary expression certainly did not seem at pleased to see what be place asked one o th kitchen garden answered what be said mary pointing through other green door of em shortly there on tother side o th wall there th orchard tother

feel a if there be one left in world if have be affectionate child who have be used to being loved must have broken heart even though be mistress mary quite contrary be desolate bright breasted little bird brought look into sour little face be almost smile listened to until flew away be not like indian bird liked wondered if must ever see again perhaps lived in mysterious garden knew about perhaps be because have nothing whatever to do that thought so much of deserted garden be curious about wanted to see what be like why have mr archibald craven buried key if have liked wife so much why did

to sky after have stared for while realized that if did not go out must have to stay in hingand so went out did not know that be best thing must have done did not know that when began to walk quickly even run along path down avenue be stirring slow blood making stronger by fighting with wind swept down from moor ran only to make herself warm hated wind rushed at face roared held back a if be giant must not see big breath of rough fresh air blown over heather filled lung with something be good for whole thin body whipped red color into cheek brightened dull eye when did not know anything about after few day spent almost entirely out of door wakened one morning knowing what be to be hungry when sat down to breakfast did not glance disdainfully at porridge push away took up spoon began to eat

picked up spade turned away a if did on purpose one place went to oftener than to other be long walk outside garden with wall round there be bare flower bed on side of against wall ivy grew thickly there be one part of wall where creeping dark green leaf be more bushy than elsewhere seemed a if for long time that part have be neglected rest of have be clipped made to look neat at lower end of walk have not be trimmed at few day after have talked to ben weatherstaff mary stopped to notice wondered why be so have just paused be looking up at long spray of ivy swinging in wind when saw gleam of scarlet heard brilliant chirp there on top of wall perched ben weatherstaffs robin redbreast tilting forward to look at with small head on one side oh cried out be youis did not seem at queer to that spoke to a if be sure that must understand answer did answer twittered chirped hopped along wall a if be telling sort of thing seemed to mistress mary a if understood too though be not speaking

little stayed out of door nearly day when sat down to supper at night felt hungry drowsy comfortable did not feel cross when martha chattered away felt a if rather liked to hear at last thought must ask question asked after have finished supper have sat down on hearth rug before fire why did mr craven hate garden said have made martha stay with martha have not objected at be very young used to crowded cottage full of brother sister found dull in great servant hall downstairs where footman upper housemaid made fun of yorkshire speech looked upon a common little thing sat whispered among martha liked to talk strange child who have lived in india be waited upon by black be novelty enough to attract sat down on hearth without waiting to be asked art tha thinkin about garden yet said

if be out on tonight mary did not know what wutherin meant until listened then understood must mean that hollow shuddering sort of roar rushed round round house a if giant one must see be buffeting beating at wall window to try to break in one knew must not get in somehow made one feel very safe warm inside room with red coal fire why did hate so asked after have listened intended to know if

be beginning to like martha too seemed good many people to likewhen be not used to liking thought of robin a one of people went to walk outside long ivy covered wall over must see tree top second time walked up down most interesting exciting thing happened to be through ben weatherstaffs robin heard chirp twitter when looked at bare flower bed at left side there be hopping about pretending to peck thing out of earth to persuade that have not followed knew have followed surprise so filled with delight that almost trembled little do remember cried out do be prettier than anything else in world chirped talked coaxed hopped flirted tail twittered be a if be talking red waistcoat be like satin puffed tiny breast out be so fine so grand so pretty that be really a if be showing how important like human person robin must be mistress mary forgot that have ever be contrary in life when allowed to draw closer closer to bend down talk try to make something like robin sound oh to think that must actually let come a near to a that knew nothing in world must make put out hand toward startle in least tiniest way knew because be real persononly nicer than other person in world be so happy that scarcely dared to breathe flower bed be not quite bare be bare of flower because perennial plant have be cut down for winter rest there be tall shrub low one grew together at back of bed a robin hopped about under saw hop over small pile of freshly turned up earth stopped on to look for worm earth have be turned up because dog have be trying to dig up mole have scratched quite deep hole mary

permission consult elder about thing thought about key be that if be key to closed garden must find out where door be must perhaps open see what be inside wall what have happened to old rose tree be because have be shut up so long that wanted to see seemed a if must be different from other place that something strange must have happened to during ten year besides that if liked must go into day shut door behind must make up play of own play quite alone because nobody must ever know where be must think door be still locked key buried in earth thought of pleased very much living a be by in

great deal to do with just a have given appetite fighting with wind have stirred blood so same thing have stirred mind in india have always be too hot languid weak to care much about anything in place be beginning to care to want to do new thing already felt le contrary though did not know why put key in pocket walked up down walk one ever seemed to come there so must walk slowly look at wall rather at ivy growing on ivy be baffling thing howsoever carefully looked must see nothing thickly growing glossy dark green leaf be very much disappointed something of contrariness came back to a paced walk looked over at tree top inside seemed so silly said to herself to be near not be able to get in took key in pocket when went back to house made up mind that must always carry with when went out so that if ever must find hidden door must be ready mr medlock have allowed martha to sleep night at cottage be back at work in morning with cheek redder than ever in best of spirit got up at four

talk about what be happening on moor in lane hedge on border of stream thing have to tell about otter badger water rat house not to mention bird nest field mouse burrow be enough to make almost tremble with excitement when heard intimate detail from animal charmer realized with what thrilling eagerness anxiety whole busy underworld be working theyre same a said dickon only have to build home year keep em so busy fair scuffle to get em done most absorbing thing however be preparation to be made before colin must be transported with sufficient secrecy to garden one must see chair carriage dickon mary after turned certain corner of shrubbery entered upon walk outside ivied wall a day passed colin have become more more fixed in feeling that mystery surrounding garden be one of greatest charm nothing must spoil that one must ever suspect that have secret people must think that be simply going out with mary dickon because liked did not object to looking at have long quite delightful talk about route must go up path down one cross other go round among fountain flower bed a if be looking at bedding out plant head gardener mr roach have be having arranged must seem such rational thing to do one must think at mysterious must turn into shrubbery walk lose until came to long wall be almost a serious elaborately thought out a plan of march made by great general in time of war rumor of new curious thing be occurring in invalid apartment have of course filtered through servant hall into stable yard out among gardener notwithstanding mr roach be startled one day when received order from master colins room to effect that must report in apartment outsider have ever seen a invalid desired to speak to well well said to a hurriedly changed coat whats to do now royal highness wasnt to be looked at calling up man he never set eye on mr roach be not without curiosity have never caught even glimpse of boy have heard dozen exaggerated story about uncanny look way insane temper

perhaps well have be prepared might have be startled when bedroom door be opened large crow seemed quite at home perched on high back of carven chair announced entrance of visitor by saying cawcaw quite loudly in spite of mr medlocks warning mr roach only just escaped being sufficiently undignified to jump backward young rajah be neither in bed on sofa be sitting in armchair young lamb be standing by shaking tail in feeding lamb fashion a dickon knelt giving milk from bottle squirrel be perched on dickons bent back attentively nibbling nut little girl from india be sitting on big footstool looking on here be mr roach master colin said mr medlock young rajah turned looked servitor overat least be what head gardener felt happened oh be roach be said sent for to give very

unchanging majesty of rising of sunwhich have be happening morning for thousand thousand thousand of year one know then for moment so one know sometimes when one stand by in wood at sunset mysterious deep gold stillness slanting through under branch seems to be saying slowly again again something one can not quite hear however much one try then sometimes immense quiet of dark blue at night with million of star waiting watching make one sure sometimes sound of far off music make true sometimes look in someone eye be like with colin when first saw heard felt springtime inside four high wall of hidden garden afternoon whole world seemed to devote to being perfect radiantly beautiful kind to one boy perhaps out of pure heavenly goodness spring came crowded everything possibly must into one

mother creatureand have never be more so than when said play actin must be joy colin mary found one of most thrilling source of entertainment idea of protecting from suspicion have be unconsciously suggested to first by puzzled nurse then by dr craven appetite be improving very much master colin nurse have said one day used to eat nothing so many thing disagreed with nothing disagrees with now replied colin then seeing nurse looking at curiously suddenly remembered that perhaps ought not to appear too well just yet at least thing dont so often disagree with fresh air perhaps be said nurse still looking at with mystified expression must talk to dr craven about how stared at said mary when went away a if thought there must be something to find out wont have finding out thing said colin one must begin to find out yet when dr craven came that morning seemed puzzled also asked number of question to colins great annoyance stay out in garden great deal suggested where do go colin put on favorite air of dignified indifference to opinion will not let anyone know where go answered go to place like everyone have order to keep out of way wont be watched stared at know that seem to be out day think have done harmi think so nurse say that eat much more than have ever done before perhaps said colin prompted by sudden inspiration perhaps be unnatural appetite think so a food seems to agree with said dr craven be gaining flesh rapidly color be better perhapsperhaps be bloated feverish said colin assuming discouraging air of gloom people who be not going to live be oftendifferent dr craven shook head be holding colins wrist pushed up sleeve felt arm be not feverish said thoughtfully such flesh a have gained be healthy if can keep up boy need not talk of dying father will be happy to hear of remarkable improvement wont have told colin broke forth fiercely will only disappoint if get worse againand may get worse very night might have raging fever feel a if might be beginning to have one now wont have letter written to fatheri wonti wont be making angry know be bad for feel hot already hate being written about being talked over a much a hate being stared at hush h boy dr craven soothed nothing will be written without permission be too sensitive about thing must not undo good have be done said more about writing to mr craven when saw nurse privately warned that possibility must not be mentioned to patient boy be extraordinarily better said advance seems almost abnormal of course be doing now of own free will what must not make do before still excites very easily nothing must be said to irritate mary colin be much alarmed talked together anxiously from time dated plan of play actin may be obliged to have tantrum said colin regretfully dont want to have one im not miserable enough now to work into big one perhaps couldnt have one at lump doesnt come in throat now keep thinking of nice thing instead of horrible one if talk about writing to father will have to do something made up mind to eat le unfortunately be not possible to carry out brilliant idea when wakened morning with amazing appetite table near sofa be set with breakfast of home made bread fresh butter snow white egg raspberry jam clotted cream mary always breakfasted with when found at tableparticularly if there be delicate slice of sizzling ham sending forth tempting odor from under hot silver coverthey must look into others eye in desperation think will have to eat morning mary colin always ended by saying can send away of lunch great deal of dinner never found must send away anything highly polished condition of empty plate returned to pantry awakened much comment do wish colin must say also do wish slice of ham be thicker one muffin be not enough for anyone enough for person who be going to die answered mary when first heard not enough for person who be going to live sometimes feel a if must eat three when nice fresh heather gorse smell from moor come pouring

stuffed with bun drank milk out of pail in copious draught in manner of hungry little boy who have be taking unusual exercise breathing in moorland air whose breakfast be more than two hour behind be

garden bloomed bloomed morning revealed new miracle in robin nest there be egg robin mate sat upon keeping warm with feathery little breast careful wing at first be very nervous robin be indignantly watchful even dickon did not go near close grown corner in day waited until by quiet working of mysterious spell seemed to have conveyed to soul of little pair that in garden there be nothing be not quite like themselvesnothing did not understand wonderfulness of what be happening to themthe immense tender terrible heart breaking beauty solemnity of egg if there have be one person in garden who have not known through innermost being that if egg be taken away hurt whole world must whirl round crash through space come to endif there have be even one who did not feel act accordingly there must have be happiness even in golden springtime air knew felt robin mate knew knew at first robin watched mary colin with sharp anxiety for mysterious reason knew need not watch dickon first moment set dew bright black eye on dickon knew be not stranger sort of robin without beak feather must speak robin be quite distinct language not to be mistaken for other to speak robin to robin be like speaking french to frenchman dickon always spoke to robin so queer gibberish used when spoke to human did not matter in least robin thought spoke gibberish to because be not intelligent enough to understand feathered speech movement also be robin never startled one by being sudden enough to seem dangerous threatening robin must understand dickon so presence be not even disturbing at outset seemed necessary to be on guard against other two in first place boy creature did not come into garden on leg be pushed in on thing with wheel skin of wild animal be thrown over that in be doubtful then when began to stand up move about did in queer unaccustomed way others seemed to have to help robin used to secrete in bush watch anxiously head tilted first on one side then on other thought that slow movement might mean that be preparing to pounce a cat do when cat be preparing to pounce creep over ground very slowly robin talked over with mate great deal for few day after that decided not to speak of subject because terror be so great that be afraid might be injurious to egg when boy began to walk by even to move more quickly be immense relief for long timeor seemed long time to robinhe be source of anxiety did not act a other human did seemed very fond of walking have way of sitting lying down for while then getting up in disconcerting manner to begin again one day robin remembered that when have be made to learn to fly by parent have done much same sort of thing have taken short flight of few yard then have be obliged to rest so occurred to that boy be learning to flyor rather to walk mentioned to mate when told that egg must probably conduct in same way after be fledged be quite comforted even became eagerly interested derived great pleasure from watching boy over edge of nestthough always thought that egg must be much cleverer learn more quickly then said indulgently that human be always more clumsy slow than egg most of never seemed really to learn to fly at never

traveled far wide since day saw mistress mary in study told might have bit of earth have be in most beautiful place in europe though have remained nowhere more than few day have chosen quietest remotest spot have be on top of mountain whose head be in cloud have looked down on other mountain when sun rose touched with such light a made seem a if world be just being born light have never seemed to touch until one day when realized that for first time in ten year strange thing have happened be in wonderful valley in austrian tyrol have be walking alone through such beauty a might have lifted man soul out of shadow have walked long way have not lifted at last have felt tired have thrown down to rest on carpet of moss by stream be clear little stream ran quite merrily along on narrow way through luscious damp greenness sometimes made sound rather like very low laughter a bubbled over round stone saw bird come dip head to drink in then flick wing fly away seemed like thing alive yet tiny voice made stillness seem deeper valley be very very still a sat gazing into clear running of water archibald craven gradually felt mind body grow quiet a quiet a valley wondered if be going to sleep be not sat gazed at sunlit water eye began to see thing growing at edge there be one lovely mass of blue forget nots growing so close to stream that leaf be wet at found looking a remembered have looked at such thing year ago be actually thinking tenderly how lovely be what wonder of blue hundred of little blossom be did not know just that simple thought be slowly filling mindfilling filling until other thing be softly pushed aside be a if sweet clear spring have begun to rise in stagnant pool have risen risen until at last swept dark water away of course did not think of only knew that valley seemed to grow quieter quieter a sat stared at bright delicate blueness did not know how long sat there what be happening to at last moved a if be awakening got up slowly stood on moss carpet drawing long deep soft breath wondering at something seemed to have be unbound released in very quietly what be said almost in whisper passed hand over forehead almost feel a ifi be alive know enough about wonderfulness of undiscovered thing to be able to explain how have happened to neither doe anyone else yet did not understand at himselfbut remembered strange hour month afterward when be at misselthwaite again found out quite by accident that on very day colin have cried out a went into secret garden be going to live forever ever ever singular calmness remained with rest of evening slept new reposeful sleep be not with very long did not know that must be kept by next night have opened door wide to dark thought have come trooping rushing back left valley went on wandering way again strange a seemed to there be minutessometimes half hourswhen without knowing why black burden seemed to lift again knew be living man not dead one slowlyslowlyfor reason that knew ofhe be coming alive with garden a golden summer changed into deep golden autumn went to lake of como there found loveliness of dream spent day upon crystal blueness of lake walked back into soft thick verdure of hill tramped until be tired so that might sleep by time have begun to sleep better knew dream have ceased to be terror to perhaps thought body be growing stronger be growing stronger butbecause of rare peaceful hour when thought be changedhis soul be slowly growing stronger too began to think of misselthwaite wonder if must not go home now then wondered vaguely about boy asked what must feel when went stood by carved four posted bed again looked down at sharply chiseled ivory white face while slept black lash rimmed so startlingly close shut eye shrank from one marvel of day have walked so far that when returned moon be high full world be purple shadow silver stillness of lake shore wood be so wonderful that did not go into villa lived in walked down to little bowered terrace at water edge sat upon seat breathed in heavenly scent of night felt strange calmness stealing over grew deeper deeper until fell asleep did not know when fell asleep when began to dream dream be so real that did not feel a if be dreaming remembered afterward how intensely wide awake alert have thought be thought that a sat breathed in scent of late rose listened to lapping of water at foot heard voice calling be sweet clear happy far away seemed very far heard a distinctly a if have be at very side archie archie archie said then again sweeter clearer than before archie archie thought sprang to foot not even startled be such real voice seemed so natural that must hear lilias lilias answered lilias where be in garden came back like sound from golden flute in garden then dream ended
