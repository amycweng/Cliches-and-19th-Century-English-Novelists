without doubt have made very unpleasant yet certainly have forgotten when door opened thomas announced visitor visitor in question who be elderly gentleman in black le person than clergyman of parish be so startled by amazing scene met eye that almost fell back pace ran risk of colliding with thomas there be in fact part of duty that reverend mr mordaunt found so decidedly unpleasant a part compelled to call upon noble patron at castle noble patron indeed usually made visit a disagreeable a lay in lordly power to make abhorred church charity flew into violent rage when of tenantry took liberty of being poor ill needing assistance during year in mr mordaunt have be in charge of dorincourt parish rector certainly did not remember having seen lordship of own free will do one kindness

second in silence come here said at last what must do in case must be confessed that mr mordaunt experienced for moment curious sensation being man of great thoughtfulness having spent so many year on estate of dorincourt realised very strongly what power for good evil must be given in future to one small boy standing there brown eye wide open hand deep in pocket thought came to also that great deal of power might perhaps through caprice of proud self indulgent old man be given to now that if young nature be not simple generous one might be worst thing must happen not only for others for what must do in case demanded earl fauntleroy drew little nearer laid one hand on knee with most confiding air of good comradeship if be very rich said not only just little boy must let stay give

by own possession perhaps notwithstanding sweet nature might have be somewhat spoiled by if have not be for hour spent with mother at court lodge best friend of watched over very closely tenderly two have many long talk together never went back to castle with kiss on cheek without carrying in heart simple pure word worth remembering there be one thing be true puzzled little fellow very much thought over mystery of much oftener than one supposed even mother did not know how often pondered on earl for long time never suspected that did so at being quick to observe little boy must not help wondering why be that mother grandfather never seemed to meet have noticed that never did meet yet day fruit flower be sent to court lodge from hot house at castle one virtuous action of earl have set upon pinnacle of perfection in cedric eye be what have done soon after first sunday when mr errol have walked home from church unattended about week later when cedric be going one day to visit mother found at door instead of large carriage prancing pair pretty little brougham handsome bay horse be present from to mother earl said abruptly can not go walking about country need carriage man who

dearest cried must believe be yours say be present from be own carriage to drive everywhere in be so happy that did not know what to say must not have borne to spoil pleasure by refusing to accept gift even though came from man who chose to consider enemy be obliged to step into carriage rose let be taken for drive while fauntleroy told story of grandfather goodness amiability be such innocent story sometimes must not help laughing little then must draw little boy closer to side kiss feeling glad that must see only good in old man who have so few friend very next day after fauntleroy wrote to mr hobbs wrote quite long letter after first copy be written brought to grandfather to be inspected because said be so uncertain about spelling be last line must like to see wish dearest must live

doubt said lordship dryly drew down beetling eyebrow looked at little boy so fixedly so long that fauntleroy wondered what must be thinking of chapter ix poor cottage fact be lordship earl of dorincourt thought in day of many thing of have never thought before thought be in one way connected with grandson pride be strongest part of nature boy gratified at point through pride began to find new interest in life began to take pleasure in showing heir to world world have known of disappointment in son so there be agreeable touch of triumph in exhibiting new lord fauntleroy who must disappoint one made plan for future sometimes in new interest forgot gout after while doctor be surprised to find noble patient health growing better than have expected ever must be again perhaps earl grew better because time did not pas so slowly for have something to think of besides pain infirmity one fine morning people be amazed to see little lord fauntleroy riding pony with companion than wilkins new companion rode tall powerful gray horse be other than earl in ride together through green lane pretty country road two rider became more intimate than ever gradually old man heard great deal about dearest life a fauntleroy trotted by big horse chatted gaily there must not well have be brighter little comrade nature be so happy earl often be silent listening watching joyous glowing face sometimes must tell young companion to set pony off at gallop when little fellow dashed off sitting so straight fearless must watch boy with gleam of pride pleasure in eye fauntleroy when after dash came back waving cap with laughing shout always felt that grandfather be very good friend indeed one thing that earl discovered be that son wife did not lead idle life be not long before learned that poor people knew very well indeed when there be sickness sorrow poverty in house little brougham often stood before door have not displeased earl to find that mother of heir have beautiful young face looked a much like lady a if have be duchess in one way did not displease to know that be popular beloved by poor yet be often conscious of hard jealous pang when saw how filled child heart how boy clung to a best beloved old man must have desired to stand first have rival felt to be almost incredible that who have never really loved one in life must find growing so fond of little fellow a without doubt be at first have only be pleased proud of cedric beauty bravery there be something more than pride in feeling now laughed grim dry laugh to sometimes when thought how liked to have boy near how liked to hear voice how in secret really wished to be liked thought well of by small grandson be only about week after ride when after visit to mother fauntleroy came into library with troubled thoughtful face sat down in high backed chair in have sat on evening of arrival for while looked at ember on hearth earl watched in silence wondering what be coming be evident that cedric have something on mind at last looked up doe newick know about people asked be business to know about said lordship be neglecting have contradictory a may seem there be nothing entertained edified more than little fellow interest in tenantry there be place said fauntleroy looking up at with wide open horror stricken eye dearest have seen be at other end of village house be close together almost falling down can scarcely breathe people be so poor everything be dreadful rain come in at roof dearest went to see poor woman who lived there tear ran down cheek when told about tear have come into

shoulder chapter x earl alarmed truth be that mr errol have found great many sad thing in course of work among poor of little village appeared so picturesque when be seen from moor side everything be not a picturesque when seen near by a looked from distance have found idleness poverty ignorance where there must have be comfort industry have discovered after while erlesboro be considered to be worst village in part of country a to earl court be disgrace with dilapidated house miserable careless sickly people when first mr errol went to place made shudder bold thought came into wise little mother heart gradually have begun to see a have others that have be boy good fortune to please earl very much that must scarcely be likely to be denied anything for expressed desire earl must give anything said to mr mordaunt must indulge whim why must not that indulgence be used for good of others be for to see that will come to pas knew must trust kind childish heart so told little fellow story of earl court feeling sure that must speak of to grandfather hoping that good result must follow strange a appeared to one good result did follow fact be that strongest power to influence earl be grandson perfect confidence in fact that cedric always believed that grandfather be going to do what be right generous must not quite make up mind to let discover that have inclination to be generous at so after reflection sent for newick have quite long interview with on subject of court be decided that wretched hovel must be pulled down new house must be built be lord fauntleroy who insists on said dryly think will improve property can tell tenant that be idea of course country people town people heard of proposed improvement at first many of must not believe when small army of

at last be removed when cottage be being built lad grandfather used to ride over to earl court together to look at fauntleroy be full of interest must dismount from pony go make acquaintance with workman asking question about building bricklaying telling thing about america when left workman used to talk over among laugh at odd innocent speech liked liked to see stand among talking away with hand in pocket hat pushed back on curl small face full of eagerness must go home tell wife about woman must tell other so came about almost one talked of knew story of little lord fauntleroy gradually almost one knew that wicked earl have found something cared for at last something have touched even warmed hard bitter old heart one knew quite how much have be warmed how day by day old man found caring more more for child who be only creature have ever trusted never spoke to one else of feeling for cedric when spoke of to others be always with same grim smile fauntleroy soon knew that grandfather loved always liked to be near near to chair if be in library opposite to at table by side when rode drove took evening walk on broad terrace do remember cedric said once looking up from

used to see time said fauntleroy used to kiss when went to sleep at night in morning be always there must tell other thing without waiting old eye young one looked into other through moment of silence then earl knitted brow do never forget about mother said answered fauntleroy never never forgets about must forget about know if did live with must think about more upon word said earl after looking at moment longer believe must jealous pang came when boy spoke so of mother seemed even stronger than have be before be stronger because of old man increasing affection for boy be not long before have

many story of of beauty sweet temper popularity growing influence over earl grandfather that rumour of reached gentry at country place be heard of in more than one county of england so by degree lady lorridaile too heard of child heard about higgins lame boy cottage at earl court score of other thing began to wish to see little fellow just a be wondering how might be brought about to utter astonishment received letter from brother inviting to come with husband to dorincourt seems incredible exclaimed have heard said that child have worked miracle begin to believe say brother adores boy

voice like silver bell may thank for making boy what be have given more than beauty make great mistake in not persuading to come take charge of will invite to lorridaile will not leave boy replied earl must have boy too said lady lorridaile laughing knew fauntleroy must not be given up to day saw more clearly how closely two have grown to other how proud grim old man ambition hope love centred
