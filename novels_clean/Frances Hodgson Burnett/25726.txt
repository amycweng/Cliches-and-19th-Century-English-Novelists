for hot blood swift veering impulsive nature have just given final stroke be panting glowing people be shouting rising in seat repeating name with caressing applauding epithet attached to chance have brought near seat in sat with jovita jose others near be applauding with rest pepita who only sat smiled in midst of sebastiano made swift movement so swift that be scarcely to be understood mere

mysterious tenderness with night one breathed rose orange blossom jasmine pepita sat under rose sang talked jose smoked be happy still in state of bewilderment though stillness beauty of night soothed made content to ruminate without word jovita fell asleep always fell asleep out of door on warm summer night in door by fire when be winter pepita ceased to talk sang one little song after then even ceased to sing only touched guitar softly now then after while jose who have stretched upon bench fell asleep also pepita ceased to touch guitar looked out at flower sleeping in moonlight for few
