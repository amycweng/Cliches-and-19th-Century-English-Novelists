tantalisingly wonder what cora be saying said mr brooke to group at large always make men laugh so emily fox seton felt interest merriment sounded so attractive wondered if perhaps to man who have be

process understood before call be half over emily intention be to remain with lady maria bayne that lady maria intention be to keep scene between three be far too subtle to be of least use upon stage be good scene expression be chiefly perhaps matter of inclusion exclusion may also have be largely telepathic after be over lady maria chuckled several time softly to like elderly bird of much humour lady malfry went home feeling exceedingly cross be in so perturbed humour that dropped eyelid looked rather coldly down bridge of nose when stupidly cheery little elderly husband said to well geraldine beg pardon replied quite understand of course do how about emily fox seton seems very well of course be well satisfied must not be possible for to be otherwise lady maria bayne have taken up

rather given to matter of fact analysis of own emotion at mallowe have once twice asked if be not disagreeably possible that first moderate glow of st martin summer might die away leave feeling slightly fatigued embarrassed by new aspect of previously regular entirely self absorbed existence might think that must like to marry woman then might realise that there be objection even woman with desirable quality might be objection in end that woman might be objection in fact that required effort to reconcile to fact of woman being continually about of course arriving at conclusion after one have committed must be annoying walderhurst have in fact only reflected upon possible aspect of affair before have driven over heath to pick emily up afterwards have in remote portion of mentality vaguely awaited development when saw emily day by day at south audley street found continued to like be not clever enough to analyse must only watch always looked on at with curiosity novel sensation

lovelier thought seemed even fairer more willowy forget not eye be of happier blue a forget nots growing by clear water side be bluer than grown in mere garden appeared perhaps even little taller small head have if such thing be possible prettier flower like poise at least emily thought found own happiness added to by belief in fancy felt that nothing be to be wondered at when heard agatha speak of sir bruce must not utter name refer to act of without sound in voice have parallel in light floating haze of blush on cheek in intercourse with world in general must have be able to preserve customary sweet composure emily fox seton be not world represented something be so primitively of emotion that one heart spoke listened to agatha be conscious that miss fox seton have seen at mallowe

heavenly relieved look died away exclamation have be involuntary have sprung from memory of day when have dutifully accepted a portion possibility of being smiled upon by walderhurst who be two year older than father swift realisation of fact troubled be indelicate to have referred to mental image even ever so vaguely emily fox seton be glad too that sir bruce be young that be young that happiness have come before have have time to tire of waiting for be so happy herself that questioned nothing yes be nice answered glowed with honest sympathy will want to do same thing be so agreeable when people who be married like to do same thing perhaps will want to go out great deal to travel must not enjoy if sir bruce did not be not reflecting in least upon domestic circle whose male head be capable of making extremely nasty under stress of invitation bore to accept inclination of wife daughter to desire acceptance be not contemplating with premonitory regret future in when walderhurst did not wish to go out to dinner disdained ball must stay at home far from simply rejoiced with lady agatha who be twenty two marrying twenty eight be not like explained further have have to work so hard contrive so closely that everything will be pleasure to just to know never need starve to death go into workhouse be such relief oh exclaimed lady agatha quickly involuntarily laying hand on hers startled by fact that spoke a if referring to wholly matter of fact possibility emily smiled realising feeling perhaps ought not to have said that forgot such thing be possible when one be too old to work have nothing to depend on must scarcely understand when one be very poor one be frightened because occasionally one can not help thinking of now now oh how different exclaimed agatha with heartfelt earnestness yes now need never be afraid make so grateful to lord walderhurst neck grew pink a said just a lady maria have seen grow pink on previous occasion moderate a word be expressed ardour lord walderhurst came in hour later found standing smiling by window look particularly well emily be that white frock suppose ought to wear good deal of white said will emily answered observed that wore nice flush soft appealing look a well a white frock wish here stopped feeling little foolish what do wish wish must do more to please than wear white black when like gazed at always through single eyeglass even vaguest approach to emotion sentiment invariably made feel stiff shy realising did not quite understand why rather liked in case of emily fox seton though only liked remotely felt own inaptness shade absurd wear yellow pink occasionally said with brief awkward laugh what large honest eye creature have like fine retriever of nice animal one saw in zoo will wear anything like said nice eye meeting not least stupidly reflected though woman who be affectionate often looked stupid will do anything like know what have done for lord walderhurst moved trifle nearer to other inarticulate pair dropped eyeglass patted shoulder say 'walderhurst 'james bey dear ' said be going to be married know found going to length of kissing cheek with warmth sometimes wish said feelingly that be fashion to say bey lord ' a lady castlewood used to do in 'esmond ' always thought nice woman be not so respectful to husband in day answered with short laugh men be not so dignified lord

manor be ancient most beautiful nothing walderhurst owned be a perfect example of olden time beauty a wonderful for reason emily almost wept before loveliness of though must not have be possible for to explain particularise ground for emotion knew nothing whatever of venerable wonder of architecture to place looked like immense low built rambling fairy palace palace of sleeping beauty during whose hundred year of slumber rich dark green creeper have climbed overgrown wall tower enfolding festooning with leaf tendril actual branch huge park held enchanted forest of tree long avenue of giant lime writhen limb arching interlocking writhen root deep in velvet moss be approach suited to fairy story during first month at palstrey emily went about still in dream became more dream day old house be part of endless room wonderful corridor garden with revelation of winding walk labyrinth of evergreen grass path leading into beautiful unexpected place where one suddenly came upon deep clear pool where water plant grew slow carp have dreamed century away garden caused emily to disbelieve in existence of mortimer street house at time caused to disbelieve in picture gallery especially have effect upon men woman once a alive a everyday self now gazing down at from picture frame sometimes made heart beat a if stood in presence of thing eerie strange rich ugly beautiful garment stolid fervid ugly beautiful face seemed to demand something of at least have just enough imagination to feel somewhat a if did walderhurst be very kind to be afraid might bore by exceeding ignorance of question about people whom have known from childhood a own kith kin be not unlikely that one might have become so familiar with man in armour woman in farthingale that question connected with might seem silly person whose ancestor have always gazed intimately at from wall might not unnaturally forget that there be other people to whom might wear only far away aspect of number in catalogue of academy exhibition of order there be very interesting catalogue of palstrey picture emily found studied with deep interest cherished touching secret desire to know what might be discoverable concerning woman who have be marchioness of walderhurst before none of gathered have come to husband from bed sitting room in obscure street there have be noble hyrsts in reign of henry period since then elapsed have afforded time for numerous bridal lady walderhurst be overcome at moment by reflection upon what lay behind before not being complex person of fervid imagination be spared by nature fever of complex emotion in fact after few week have passed came out of dream found happiness enduring endurable day awakening be delight to must probably be so to end of existence absolutely because be so sane uncomplex creature to be deftly assisted in dressing by jane cupp to know that morning might be fittingly becomingly attired without anxiety a to where next gown be to come from be lovely thing to enjoy silent perfect working of great household to drive be driven to walk read to loiter through walled garden hothouse at will such thing to healthy woman with unobscured power of enjoyment be luxury must not pall walderhurst found actual addition to comfort be never in way seemed to have discovered trick of coming going undisturbingly be docile affectionate not in least sentimental have known men whose first year of marriage not to speak of first month have be rendered unbearable by fact that wife be constantly demanding expecting expression of sentiment unsentimental male have not at finger end so men have be annoyed bored woman have be dissatisfied emily demanded nothing of sort be certainly not dissatisfied looked very handsome happy look positively improved when people began to call to pay visit be very much liked have certainly be quite right in deciding to ask to marry if have son must congratulate greatly more saw of osborn more disliked appeared that there be prospect of child there last be indeed true emily have be much touched awakened to sympathy have gradually become revealed to that osborns be poorer than must decently admit emily have discovered that must not even remain in lodging in duke street though did not know reason be that captain osborn have be obliged to pay certain money to stave off scandal not entirely unconnected with young woman arm have encircled day walderhurst have seen on top of bus be very well aware that if be to obtain anything from lord walderhurst there be several thing must be kept entirely dark even scandal belonging to past must be made a unpleasant a error of to day also young woman of bead cape knew how to manage must remove to cheaper lodging room in duke street have be far from desirable lady came in one morning from walk with fresh colour bright eye before taking off went to husband study may come in walderhurst have be writing uninteresting letter looked up with smile certainly answered what colour have exercise agrees with ought to ride be what captain osborn said if mind must like to ask something mind be reasonable woman emily one safe with be something connected with osborns indeed chilling

more respectable fellow circumstance must have be different rather stiffly emily felt alarmed have not dreamed of temerity of remark suggestive of criticism yes hastily of course be sure know best thought perhaps walderhurst liked timidity to see fine tall upstanding creature colour in way be not disagreeable when one realised that coloured because feared might offend one did think 'perhaps be

inside seems pity that place must not be lived in well thought how kind must be of to lend to osborns while be in england must indeed be kind remarked lordship without fervour momentary excitement led emily to take liberty of putting out hand to touch always felt a if connubial familiarity be rather liberty at least have not so far be able to overcome feeling rather of order be thing walderhurst by mean disliked be not aware that be man with good deal of internal vanity enjoyed soothing food in fact have not sufficiently large brain to know very much about to be able to analyse reason for liking disliking people thing thought knew reason for like dislike be frequently very far away from clear impersonal truth about only brilliant logic sensitiveness of genius really approach knowledge of a result be usually extremely unhappy walderhurst be never unhappy be sometimes dissatisfied annoyed be a far a emotion went being pleased by warm touch of emily hand patted wrist looked agreeably marital place be built originally for family huntsman pack be kept there be why be called kennel farm when last lease fell out remained unlet because care for ordinary tenant be kind of house be

reason why kind hearted woman like must be specially good to just now do anything wish for while be in neighbourhood a for fact that man be one heir presumptive be not enough in alone to endear to one

to might have scouted idea of giving room to be sure change must come about slowly at first must seem too mad ridiculous sort of angry joke then angry joke must return again again until at last let stay did not laugh at thought over such thing always happened because one wanted did not want something very much something drove mad to think of being forced to live without with men who hated woman must not rid of who hated sight of face eye hair sound of voice step be rendered insane by nearness thought that never must be free from of thing have before now commonplace comparatively agreeable men by degree reached point where knife shot heavy blow seemed not only possible inevitable people who have be ill treated people who have faced horror through want desire have reached moment in took by force what fate must not grant brain so whirled that wondered if be not little delirious a sat in stillness thinking such strange thing for week have be living under strain so intense that feeling have seemed to cease to have connection with what be normal have known too much yet have be certain of nothing at alec be like people who began with bad joke then be driven driven be impossible not to

have be over in few minute say be really painful lip quivered pressed hand tightly between knee be murderer thought muttered querulously yet be bad girl to begin with began to see thing chief thing be sort of vision of how emily must have looked lying in depth of water among weed brown hair must have broken loose perhaps tangled over white face must her eye be open glazed half shut childish smile smile looked so odd on face of full grown woman must have be fixed seemed to confront world of life with meek question a to what have done to people why have be drowned hester felt sure be what helpless stillness must have expressed how happy woman have be to see go about with unconsciously joyous eye have sometimes be maddening yet poor thing why have not right to be happy be always trying to please people help be so good that be almost silly day have brought little thing from london to kennel farm hester remembered that despite own morbid resentment have ended by kissing with repentant

something have always before lacked emily recognised in for first time desire to ask friendly question to verge on confidential talked long without reserve how pretty be of girl emily thought to care so much about health spirit to be so interested in detail of day life even in simple matter of preparation serving of food a if merest trifle be of consequence have be unfair too to fancy that felt interest in walderhurst absence return have noticed everything closely actually thought ought to come back at once send for said quite suddenly send for now there be eagerness expressed in dark

sleep in dressing room emily felt dreary chill creep over that have felt in air when have slowly turned amazed face upon jane in lime avenue sense of strangeness of thing again closed in will do a wish answered before next day closed be made plain to awfulness cruel inhuman truth of thing seemed to lose possibility in exaggeration of proportion made incongruousness almost grotesque very prettiness of flowered boudoir very softness of peace in velvet spread of garden before window made even more unreal that day second one emily have begun to note new thing hester be watching hester be keeping guard a realised sense of abnormalness of thing grew fear grew with began to feel a if wall be rising around built by unseen hand afternoon afternoon of deeply golden sun have spent together

unclenching hand have drunk of demanded emily answered have not hester osborn dropped into chair leaned forward covering face with hand looked like woman on verge of outbreak of hysteria only to be held in check by frenzied effort lady walderhurst quite slowly turned colour of milk did nothing sit still gaze at hester wait minute girl be trying to recover breath wait till can hold still be going to tell now be going to tell yes emily answered faintly seemed to that waited twenty minute before word be spoken that sat quite that long looking at thin hand seemed to clutch hidden face be mistake arising from intensity of strain upon nerve be scarcely five minute before mr osborn lowered hand laid pressed tightly palm to palm between knee spoke in low voice voice a listener outside must not have heard do know demanded what represent to to to husband a sit there emily shook head movement of disclaimer be easier than speech felt sort of exhaustion believe do said hester seem to realise anything perhaps be because be so innocent perhaps be because be so foolish represent thing that have right to hate most on earth do hate asked emily trying to adjust mentally to mad extraordinariness of situation at same time scarcely understanding why asked question sometimes do when wonder at girl paused second looked down a if questioningly at carpet then lifting eye again went on in dragging half bewildered voice when actually believe be because be woman together before be different look walderhurst have compared to of nice animal in zoo came into emily eye a two honest drop fell from must hurt faltered must let other people hurt hester leaned further forward in chair widening upon such hysterically insistent terrible young eye a made shudder see cried ca see for son must be what walderhurst be son not yours understand said emily understand listen mr osborn went on through teeth even for there be thing have nerve to stand have thought must stand ca doe not matter why be going

something of waiting for answer to letter written to foreign land seems impossible to calculate correctly a to what length of time must elapse before reply to letter one sent by last mail can reach one who wait be always premature in calculation make mail must be due at certain date one be so sure letter must be written on such day posted at once date calculated for arrives pass answer have not come who doe not remember emily walderhurst have passed through experience knew well previously letter have sent have be of le vital importance when reply to have lingered on way have be true watched

something afternoon said be afraid looked like good child in great trouble think will speak before long looked more more like good child in trouble a time passed mail after mail came in received letter did not understand fresh colour died away spent time now in inventing reason for non arrival of letter none of comprised explanation must be disparaging in sense to walderhurst chiefly clung to fact that have not be well anything must be considered reason for neglecting letter writing if man be not well if illness have become serious must of course have heard from doctor must not allow to contemplate if be languid feverish might so easily put off writing from day to day be more plausible a reason since have not be profuse correspondent have only written when have found have leisure with decent irregularity so to speak at last however on day when have felt strain of waiting greater than have courage for have counted moment of hour must elapse before jane must return from mission of inquiry a rested on sofa heard girl mount stair with step whose hastened lightness wakened in excited hopefulness sat up with brightened face eager eye how foolish have be to fret now now

new anxiety in connection with patient lordship required extreme care absolute freedom from excitement everything medical science perfect nursing must do must be done writer asked lady walderhurst collaboration with in effort at keeping invalid a far a possible in unperturbed spirit for time seemed probable that letter writing reading must be out of question if when correspondence might be

afraid of scandal might annoy husband be deeply in awe of lord walderhurst deeply in love with when one realises how unnecessary quality charm seem to be to awakening of tender emotion be rather dull perhaps to ask why yet one weakly asks be mr warren summation one can not supply answer mere devotion in nice creature be thing to be respected will control even anxiety reveal nothing while writes

service in felt private pride not one among have escaped becoming attached to lady walderhurst away from palstrey away from mortimer street emily began to find reality in fact that everything have already become quite simple after fine room looked so well ordered decent in stately way melodramatic plotting ceased to exist a looked at certain dignified sofa impressive candelabra such thing became even more impossible than have become before convincingness of first floor front bedroom in mortimer street began to give good deal of thought to summer at mallowe there be extraordinary luxury in living again day of morning when have taken third class carriage provided with hot labouring men in corduroy a companion that fleeting moment when tall man with square face have passed carriage

unaware of value of gift thought of be so beautiful very often be favourite reflection though always have that composed way of saying thing what say seems more valuable because be like in truth composed way of saying thing be seemed to incomparable even when without understanding own longing for thing lacked heart have felt little unsustained have never ceased to feel fascination of entire freedom from shadow of interest in mental attitude of others towards when stood gazed at people through glass neatly screwed into eye one felt that be whose opinion be of importance not other person through sheer chill imperviousness seemed entirely detached from power of criticism what people said thought of fixed opinion on subject be not of least consequence in fact did not exist entity of person who cavilled at such opinion ceased to exist so far a be concerned be immovable temperament did not snub people cut cord of mental communication with dropped into space emily thought firmness reserved dignity quailed before thought of erring in such manner a must cause to so send soul adrift greatest terror during past month have be fear of making ridiculous of putting in position might annoy by objectionable publicity now have further fear must wait in safety dwell in peace upon memory hope even began to gain kind of courage in thought of atmosphere of berkeley square mansion be good for have never felt so much mistress before staff of servant of whose existence be centre who so plainly served with careful pleasure who considered least wish inclination a royal command increased realisation of security power warren who understood dignity meaning of mere worldly fact nature did not grasp added subtly to support gradually learned to reveal in simple talk to mr warren who found when so revealed case more extraordinary than have be when enshrouded in dubious mystery be absolutely delicious mr warren said to husband that adoration such a hers must exist in nineteenth century be almost degenerate laughed perhaps be regenerate reflecting who know nothing earthly heavenly must induce to cast doubt upon seated opposite to portrait of james hear opinion of when be not

very happy there soul be uplifted by gratitude for peace have reached report of lord walderhurst physician be never alarming generally of reassuring nature knew that must exercise great caution time must elapse before must confront return voyage must come back a soon a be quite safe in meantime world held that must desire lacking emotion expressed in earnest performance of reverent daily devotion read many chapter of bible often sat happily absorbed in study of book of common prayer found solace happiness in such thing spent sunday morning after ringing of church bell quite alone in walderhurst study following service reading collect lesson room used to seem so beautifully still even berkeley square wearing church hour aspect suggested devout aloofness from worldly thing sit at window think explained to mr warren be so nice there wrote letter to india in room did not know how far new courage in thought of husband expressed in letter when walderhurst read however felt sense of change in woman be sometimes spoken of a coming out amazingly began to feel that emily be in measure at least coming out perhaps gradually increasing feeling of accustomedness to change in life be doing for said more in letter said in more interesting way be perhaps rather suggestive of development of girl who be on verge of becoming delightful sort of woman lying upon back in bed rendered may be trifle susceptible by weakness of slow convalescence found certain habit growing upon habit of reading letter several time of thinking of a have not be nature to think of woman also slowly awakened to interest in arrival of english mail letter actually raised spirit have excellent physical effect doctor always found in good condition after have heard from wife letter dear emily walderhurst once wrote be great pleasure to be to day exactly a be at mallowe creature of amiable good cheer comfort stimulates how dear how dear emily cried to silence of study kissed letter with impassioned

up have be watching for day always liked particularly clear large eye recall trying to describe to myself finding difficult seemed to then to resemble something between eye of very nice boy eye of delightful sheep dog may not appear so romantic comparison a really be emily began most softly sweetly to cry nothing more romantic must possibly have imagined thought of in spite of a drove across moor must scarcely express to how angry be at maria seemed to that have brutally imposed on only because have known might impose on woman with pair of eye be angry sentimental at one same time to find sitting by wayside absolutely worn out with fatigue in tear moved really more than have anticipated being moved when mistook meaning stood up nice eye looking into mine in such ingenuous appeal fear trouble have never forgotten dear never will mood of sentiment did not sit easily upon meant real interesting quite human thing emily sat alone in room brooded over a mother might brood over new born child be full of tremulous bliss dwelling with reverent awe upon wonder of great thing drawing nearer to hour wept for happiness a sat same afternoon lady maria bayne arrived have be abroad taking in dull fashion various cure involved drinking mineral water while promenading to sound of strain of outdoor music comparing symptom wittily with friend equal to amazing repartee in connection with subject dr warren be old acquaintance a be on point of leaving house a entered stopped to shake hand with be rather unfortunate for man when one can only be glad to see in house of enemy greeted with must know what be doing here be not possible that lady walderhurst be fretting into fiddle string because husband chooses to have fever in india be behaving beautifully in respect may have few minute talk with lady maria before see few minute talk with mean something amusing portentous let walk into morning room led way with rustle of silk petticoat suggestion of lifted eyebrow be inclined to think that thing sounded more portentous than amusing thank heaven be not possible for emily to have involved in annoying muddle be not that kind of woman when came out of room twenty minute later did not look quite like smart bonnet set le well upon delicate little old face be agitated cross pleased be ridiculous of walderhurst to leave be saying be ridiculous of not to order home at once be exactly like dear ridiculous in spite of agitation felt little grotesque a went upstairs to see emily grotesque because be obliged to admit to herself that have never felt so curiously excited in life

lovely smile lady maria made quick movement forward caught hold of hand good emily broke forth kissed excellent emily kissed again be completely turned upside down never heard insane story in life

to rubbish said lady maria at rate a remarked before be going to stay here until walderhurst come back man will be quite mad with gratified vanity chapter twenty three be damp depressing day on lord walderhurst arrived in london a carriage turned into berkeley square sat in corner of rather huddled in travelling wrap looking pale thin be wishing that london have chosen to show more exhilarating countenance to be conscious of being possessed by something more nearly approaching mood of eagerness than remembered experiencing at period of previous existence have found voyage home long have be restless wanted to see wife how agreeable must be to meet when looked across dinner table smile in happy eye must grow pink with pleasure like girl when confessed that have missed be curious to see in

very stupidly trying child have not lived hour have liked emily from first now be absolute truth that felt slight movement in cardiac region when carriage turned into berkeley square house must look very pleasant when entered emily must in subtle way have arranged that must wear festal greeting air have number of nice little feminine emotion about bright fire many flower must picture childlike grown up face a must look when stepped into room where met one be ill in berkeley square evidently very ill straw be laid thick along one side of depressing damp fresh straw over carriage rolled with dull drag of wheel lay before door of own house observed a stepped out be very thickly scattered door swung open a carriage stopped crossing threshold glanced at face of footman nearest to man looked like mute at funeral expression be so little in accord with mood that stopped with feeling of irritation have not time to speak however before new sensation arrested attention faint odour filled place house smell like hospital exclaimed in great annoyance what doe mean man addressed did not answer turned perturbed awkward face to superior in rank older man who be house steward in house of mortal pain death there be one thing more full of suggestion than faint smell of antiseptic gruesome cleanly unpleasant odour be unnatural sound of whispering of hushed voice lord walderhurst turned cold

to know slowly be very hard on there be something feel must tell lord walderhurst dr warren kept keen eye on having in fact felt far from attracted by man in past wondering how much must be moved by certain truth if must be moved at before lady walderhurst illness be very explicit with in expression of one desire begged to give word must not have done without permission that whatsoever circumstance if life must be sacrificed must be hers dusky red shot through walderhurst leaden pallor asked that said yes at worst did not forget when became delirious heard that be praying gathered that seemed to be praying to a to deity whom implored to remember fervent pleading when brain be clear be wonderful saved son by supernatural endurance mean to say that if have cared more for le for safety of child need not have be a be now warren bent head lord walderhurst eyeglass have be dangling weakly from cord picked up stuck in eye to stare doctor in face action be singular spasmodic hard one hand be shaking by god cried out if have be here must not have be so got up supported against table with shaking hand be very plain said that have be willing to be torn to piece upon rack to give thing wanted now good god in heaven feel must have strangled boy with own hand rather than lose in manner seemed did rigid self encased conventional elderly nobleman reach emotion looked uncanny stiff dignity hung about in rag tatter cold sweat stood on forehead chin twitched just now poured forth care whether there be child not want care for nothing else want to look at want to speak to whether be alive dead if there be spark of life in believe will hear dr warren sat watched wondering knew curious thing of human creature thing most of confrere did not know knew that life be mysterious thing that even dying flame of might sometimes be fanned to flickering anew by power more subtle than science usually regard a applicable influence knew nature of half dead woman lying on bed upstairs comprehended what soul of life have be divinely innocent passion for self centred man have seen in tortured courage of eye in hour of mortal agony forget have said father art in heaven let anyone forget hallowed be thy name man leaning upon shaking hand before stood there for moment at least harrowed thing not single individual of acquaintance must have known want to see before breath leaf gave forth in harsh broken whisper want to speak let see dr warren left chair slowly out of thousand chance against might one chance be for chance of hearing being called back to shore be drifting from by stiff conventional fellow voice there be knowing wondrousness of loving human thing even when shackle be loosening to set free will speak to in charge with said will control outward expression of feeling yes adjoining lady walderhurst sleeping apartment be small boudoir where medical men consulted together two of be standing near window conversing in whisper walderhurst merely nodded went to wait apart by fire ceremony have ceased to exist dr warren joined pair at window lord walderhurst only heard one two sentence be afraid that nothing now can matter at moment who know from experience what saw when entered next room have reason to give thanks to such power a put trust in there ruled in large dim chamber awful order silence faint flickering of fire be marked sound there be other fainter even more irregular one heard a one neared bed sometimes seemed to stop then with weak gasp begin again nurse in uniform stood in waiting elderly man sat on chair at bedside listening looking at watch something white lifeless lying in grasp emily walderhurst be waxen unmoving hand odour of antiseptic filled nostril lord walderhurst drew near speaking sign of moment be that nurse doctor stirred emily lay low upon pillow face be a bloodless a wax be little turned aside shadow be hovering over touched closed lid droop of cheek corner of mouth be far far away be what walderhurst

breast scarcely stirred with faintness of breath emily emily doctor slightly raised eye to glance at be used to death bed scene be curious because knew usual outward aspect of lord walderhurst alteration at moment suggested abnormal thing have not flexibility of mind revealed to dr warren that there be perhaps abnormal moment for most normal inelastic personage emily said lordship emily did not cease from saying in low yet reaching whisper at regular interval for at least hour did not move from knee so intense be absorption that presence of who came near be a nothing what hoped intended to do did not explain to be of order of man who coldly wave aside wandering on subject of occult claim believed in proven fact in professional aid in abolition of absurdity whole narrow being concentrated on one thing wanted woman back wanted to speak to what power unknowingly drew from depth of what exquisite answering thing reached at must not be said perhaps be only remote subtle turn of tide of life death chanced to come to aid emily said again after many time dr warren at moment met lifted eye of doctor who be counting pulse in response to look went to seems slightly stronger dr forsythe whispered slow faint breathing changed shade there be heard breath slightly very slightly deeper le flickering then lady walderhurst slightly stirred remain where be whispered dr warren to

soft cool water lapped lip a knew without fear must soon cover quiet face hiding for ever heard from far very far away across whiteness floating about faint sound at first only fell upon stillness without meaning everything silence have be left behind aeon ago nothing remained soundless white sea slow drifting sinking a one swayed be more than sleep still peace because there be thought of waking to shore far off sound repeated again again again again monotonously something be calling to something be so given up to soft drifting that have thought to give gave none in drifting so one did not think thought be left in far off place white sea carried one from sank quietly little deeper water touched lip something be calling to something something be calling something to come back call be low low strange so regular so unbroken insistent that arrested knew not what did arrest floating swaying in enfolding sea be drifting slower must not rouse to think wanted to go on did no longer feel water lapping against lip something be calling to something still once aeon ago before white sea have borne away must have understood emily emily emily yes once must have known what sound meant once
