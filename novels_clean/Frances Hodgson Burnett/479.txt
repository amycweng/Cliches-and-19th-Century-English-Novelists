with innocent anxious expression in childish eye saw that be not changed at be simply a have be day before just handsome cheerful brave little fellow in blue suit red neck ribbon information about nobility bewildered be more bewildered because cedric gave with such ingenuous simplicity plainly without realizing how stupendous be wha what did say name be mr hobbs inquired be cedric errol lord fauntleroy answered cedric be what mr havisham called said when went into room 'and so be little lord fauntleroy well said mr hobbs will be jiggered be exclamation always used when be very much astonished excited must think of nothing else to say just at puzzling moment cedric felt to be quite proper suitable ejaculation respect affection for mr hobbs be so great that admired approved of remark have not seen enough of society a yet to make realize that sometimes mr hobbs be not quite conventional knew of course that be different from mamma then mamma be lady have idea lady be always different from gentleman looked at mr hobbs wistfully england be long way off be asked be across atlantic ocean mr hobbs answered be worst of said cedric perhaps will not see again for long time like to think of mr hobbs best of friend must part said mr hobbs well said cedric have be friend for great many year have ever since be born mr hobbs answered be about six week old when be first walked out

got over first shock mr hobbs be not so rancorous a might have be expected endeavored to resign to situation before interview be at end have asked great many question a cedric must answer few of endeavored to answer being fairly launched on subject of earl marquis lordly estate explained many thing in way must probably have astonished mr havisham must that gentleman have heard then there be many thing astonished mr havisham have spent life in england be not accustomed to american people american habit have be connected professionally with family of earl of dorincourt for nearly forty year knew about grand estate great wealth importance in cold business like way felt interest in little boy who in future be to be master owner of future earl of dorincourt have known about old earl disappointment in elder son about fierce rage at captain cedric american marriage knew how still hated gentle little widow must not speak of except with bitter cruel word insisted that be only common american girl who have entrapped son into marrying because knew be earl son old lawyer have more than half believed be true have seen great many selfish mercenary people in life have not good opinion of american when have be driven into cheap street coupe have stopped before cheap small house have felt actually shocked seemed really quite dreadful to think that future owner of dorincourt castle wyndham tower chorlworth other stately splendor must have be born brought up in insignificant house in street with sort of green grocery at corner wondered what kind of child must be what kind of mother have rather shrank from seeing have sort of pride in noble family whose legal affair have conducted so long must have annoyed very much to have found obliged to manage woman who must seem to vulgar money loving person with respect for dead husband country dignity of name be very old name very splendid one mr havisham have great respect for though be only cold keen business like old lawyer when mary handed into small parlor looked around critically be plainly furnished have home like look there be cheap common ornament cheap gaudy picture few adornment on wall be in good taste about room be many pretty thing woman hand might have made not at bad so far have said to perhaps captain taste predominated when mr errol came into room began to think might have have something to do with if have not be quite self contained stiff old gentleman must probably have started when saw looked in simple black dress fitting closely to slender figure more like young girl than mother of boy of seven have pretty sorrowful young face very tender innocent look in large brown eye sorrowful look have never quite left face since husband have died cedric be used to seeing there only time have ever seen fade out have be when be playing with talking to have said old fashioned thing used long word have picked up out of newspaper in conversation with mr hobbs be fond of using long word be always pleased when made laugh though must not understand why be laughable be quite serious matter with lawyer experience taught to read people character very shrewdly a soon a saw cedric mother knew that old earl have made great mistake in thinking vulgar mercenary woman mr havisham have never be married have never even be in love divined that pretty young creature with sweet voice sad eye have married captain errol only because loved with affectionate heart that have never once thought advantage that be earl son saw must have trouble with began to feel that perhaps little lord fauntleroy might not be such trial to noble family after captain have be handsome fellow young mother be very pretty perhaps boy might be well enough to look at when first told mr errol what have come for turned very pale oh said will have to be taken away from love other so much be such happiness to be have have tried to be good mother to sweet young voice trembled tear rushed into eye know what have be to said lawyer cleared throat be obliged to tell said that earl of dorincourt be not be not very friendly toward be old man prejudice be very strong have always especially disliked america american be very much enraged by son marriage be sorry to be bearer of so unpleasant communication be very fixed in determination not to see plan be that lord fauntleroy will be educated under own supervision that will live with earl be attached to dorincourt castle spends great deal of time there be victim to inflammatory gout be not fond of london lord fauntleroy will therefore be likely to live chiefly at dorincourt earl offer a home court lodge be situated pleasantly be not very far from castle also offer suitable income lord fauntleroy will be permitted to visit only stipulation be that will not visit enter park gate see will not be really separated from son assure madam term be not so harsh a a might have be advantage of such surroundings education a lord fauntleroy will have be sure must see will be very great felt little uneasy lest must begin to cry make scene a knew woman must have done embarrassed annoyed to see woman cry did not went to window stood with face turned away for few moment saw be trying to steady captain errol be very fond of dorincourt said at last loved england everything english be always grief to that be parted from home be proud of home of name must wish know must wish that son must know beautiful old place be brought up in such way a must be suitable to future position then came back to table stood looking up at mr havisham very gently husband must wish said will be best for little boy know be sure earl must not be so unkind a to try to teach not to love know even if tried that little boy be too much like father to be harmed have warm faithful nature true heart must love even if did not see so long a may see other ought not to suffer very much think very little of lawyer thought doe not make term for herself madam said aloud respect consideration for son will thank for when be man assure lord fauntleroy will be most carefully guarded effort will be used to insure happiness earl of dorincourt will be a anxious for comfort well being a must be hope said tender little mother in rather broken voice that grandfather will love ceddie little boy have very affectionate nature have always be loved mr havisham cleared throat again must not quite imagine gouty fiery tempered old earl loving one very much knew must be to interest to be kind in irritable way to child who be to be heir knew too that if ceddie be at credit to name grandfather must be proud of lord fauntleroy will be comfortable be sure replied be with view to happiness that earl desired that must be near enough to to see frequently did not think must be discreet to repeat exact word earl have used be in fact polite amiable mr havisham preferred to express noble patron offer in smoother more courteous language have slight shock when mr errol asked mary to find little boy bring to mary told where be sure will foind aisy enough ma'be said for be wid mr hobbs be minnit settin ' on high shtool by counther ' talkin ' pollytics most loikely enj'yin ' among soap candle pertaties a sinsible shwate a ye plase mr hobbs have known life mr errol said to lawyer be very kind to ceddie there be great friendship between remembering glimpse have caught of store a passed having recollection of barrel of potato apple various odds end mr havisham felt doubt arise again in england gentleman son did not make friend of grocerymen seemed to rather singular proceeding must be very awkward if child have bad manner disposition to like low company one of bitterest humiliation of old earl life have be that two elder son have be fond of low company must be thought that boy shared bad quality instead of father good quality be thinking uneasily about a talked to mr errol until child came into room when door opened actually hesitated moment before looking at cedric must perhaps have seemed very queer to great many people who knew if must have known curious sensation passed through mr havisham when looked down at boy who ran into mother arm experienced revulsion of feeling be quite exciting recognized in instant here be one of finest handsomest little fellow have ever seen beauty be something unusual have strong lithe graceful little body manly little face held childish head up carried with brave air be so like father that be really startling have father golden hair mother brown eye there be nothing sorrowful timid in be innocently fearless eye looked a if have never feared doubted anything in life be best bred looking handsomest little fellow ever saw be what mr havisham thought what said aloud be simply so be little lord fauntleroy after more saw of little lord fauntleroy more of surprise found knew very little about child though have seen plenty of in england fine handsome rosy girl boy who be strictly taken care of by tutor governess who be sometimes shy sometimes trifle boisterous never very interesting to ceremonious rigid old lawyer perhaps personal interest in little lord fauntleroy fortune made notice ceddie more than have noticed other child however be certainly found noticing great deal cedric did not know be being observed only behaved in ordinary manner shook hand with mr havisham in friendly way when be introduced to other answered question with unhesitating readiness with answered mr hobbs be shy bold when mr havisham be talking to mother lawyer noticed that listened to conversation with a much interest a if have be quite grown up seems to be very mature little fellow mr havisham said to mother think be in thing answered have always be very quick to learn have lived great deal with grownup people have funny little habit of using long word expression have read in book have heard others use be very fond of childish play think be rather clever be very boyish little boy sometimes next time mr havisham met saw that last be quite true a coupe turned corner caught sight of group of small boy who be evidently much excited two of be about to run race one of be young lordship be shouting making a much noise a noisiest of companion stood side by side with boy one little red leg advanced step one to make ready yelled starter two to be steady three away mr havisham found leaning out of window of coupe with curious feeling of interest really never remembered having seen anything quite like way in lordship lordly little red leg flew up behind knickerbockers tore over ground a shot out in race at signal word shut small hand set face against wind bright hair streamed out behind hooray ced errol boy shouted dancing shrieking with excitement hooray billy williams hooray ceddie hooray billy hooray really believe be going to win said mr havisham way in red leg flew flashed up down shriek of boy wild effort of billy williams whose brown leg be not to be despised a followed closely in rear of red leg made feel excitement really really ca help hoping will win said with apologetic sort of cough at moment wildest yell of went up from dancing hopping boy with one last frantic leap future earl of dorincourt have reached lamp post at end of block touched just two second before billy williams flung at panting three cheer for ceddie errol yelled little boy hooray for ceddie errol mr havisham drew head in at window of coupe leaned back with dry smile bravo lord fauntleroy said a carriage stopped before door of mr errol house victor vanquished be coming toward attended by clamoring crew cedric walked by billy williams be speaking to elated little face be very red curl clung to hot moist forehead hand be in pocket see be saying evidently with intention of making defeat easy for unsuccessful rival guess won because leg be little longer than yours guess be see be three day older than give 'vantage be three day older view of case seemed to cheer billy williams so much that began to smile on world again felt able to swagger little almost a if have won race instead of losing somehow ceddie errol have way of making people feel comfortable even in first flush of triumph remembered that person who be beaten might not feel so gay a did might like to think that might have be winner under different circumstance that morning mr havisham have quite long conversation with winner of race conversation made smile dry smile rub chin with bony hand several time mr errol have be called out of parlor lawyer cedric be left together at first mr havisham wondered what must say to small companion have idea perhaps must be best to say several thing might prepare cedric for meeting grandfather perhaps for great change be to come to must see that cedric have not least idea of sort of thing be to see when reached england of sort of home waited for there did not even know yet that mother be not to live in same house with have thought best to let get over first shock before telling mr havisham sat in arm chair on one side of open window on other side be still larger chair cedric sat in looked at mr havisham sat well back in depth of big seat curly head against cushioned back leg crossed hand thrust deep into pocket in quite mr hobbs like way have be watching mr havisham very steadily when mamma have be in room after be gone still looked at in respectful thoughtfulness there be short silence after mr errol went out cedric seemed to be studying mr havisham mr havisham be certainly studying cedric must not make up mind a to what elderly gentleman must say to little boy who won race wore short knickerbockers red stocking on leg be not long enough to hang over big chair when sat well back in cedric relieved by suddenly beginning conversation do know said know what earl be said mr havisham replied ceddie think when boy be going to be one ought to know well yes answered mr havisham must mind said ceddie respectfully must mind

never have time to care for own son have not interested when be very young though sometimes remembered having thought cedric father handsome strong little fellow have be so selfish that have missed pleasure of seeing unselfishness in others have not known how tender faithful affectionate kind hearted little child can be how innocent unconscious be simple generous impulse boy have always seemed to most objectionable little animal selfish greedy boisterous when not under strict restraint own two eldest son have given tutor constant trouble annoyance of younger one fancied have heard few complaint because boy be of particular importance have never once occurred to that must like grandson have sent for little cedric because pride impelled to do so if boy be to take place in future did not wish name to be made ridiculous by descending to uneducated boor have be convinced boy must be clownish fellow if be brought up in america have feeling of affection for lad only hope be that must find decently well featured with respectable share of sense have be so disappointed in other son have be made so furious by captain errol american marriage that have never once thought that anything creditable must come of when footman have announced lord fauntleroy have almost dreaded to look at boy lest must find that have feared be because of feeling that have ordered that child must be sent to alone pride must not endure that others must see disappointment if be to be disappointed proud stubborn old heart therefore have leaped within when boy came forward with graceful easy carriage fearless hand on big dog neck even in moment when have hoped most earl have never hoped that grandson must look like seemed almost too good to be true that must be boy have dreaded to see child of woman so disliked little fellow with so much beauty brave childish grace earl stern composure be quite shaken by startling surprise then talk began be still more curiously moved more more puzzled in first place be so used to seeing people rather afraid embarrassed before that have expected nothing else that grandson must be timid shy cedric be more afraid of earl than have be of dougal be not bold be only innocently friendly be not conscious that there must be reason why must be awkward afraid earl must not help seeing that little boy took for friend treated a one without having doubt of at be quite plain a little fellow sat there in tall chair talked in friendly way that have never occurred to that large fierce looking old man must be anything kind to rather pleased to see there be plain too that in childish way wished to please interest grandfather cross hard hearted worldly a old earl be must not help feeling secret novel pleasure in very confidence after be not disagreeable to meet one who did not distrust shrink from seem to detect ugly part of nature one who looked at with clear unsuspecting eye if be only little boy in black velvet suit so old man leaned back in chair led young companion on to telling still more of with odd gleam in eye watched little fellow a talked lord fauntleroy be quite willing to answer question chatted on in genial little way quite composedly told about dick jake apple woman mr hobbs described republican rally in glory of banner transparency torch rocket in course of conversation reached fourth of july revolution be just becoming enthusiastic when suddenly recollected something stopped very abruptly what be matter demanded grandfather why go on lord fauntleroy moved rather uneasily in chair be evident to earl that be embarrassed by thought have just occurred to be just thinking that perhaps might like replied perhaps one belonging to might have be there forgot be englishman can go on said lord one belonging to be there forgot be englishman too oh said cedric quickly be american be englishman said earl grimly father be englishman amused little to say did not amuse cedric lad have never thought of such

if there be war know must have to to be american earl gave grim half laugh be short grim be laugh must must said hated america american amused to see how serious interested small patriot be thought that so good american might make rather good englishman when be man have not time to go very deep into revolution again indeed lord fauntleroy felt delicacy about returning to subject before dinner be announced cedric left chair went to noble kinsman looked down at gouty foot must like to help said politely must lean on know once when mr hobbs hurt foot with potato barrel rolling on used to lean on big footman almost periled reputation situation by smiling be aristocratic footman who have always lived in best of noble family have never smiled indeed must have felt disgraced vulgar footman if have allowed to be led by circumstance into indiscretion a smile have very narrow escape only just saved by staring straight over earl head at very ugly picture earl looked valiant young relative over from head to foot do think must do asked gruffly think must said cedric be strong be seven know must lean on stick on one side on on other dick say have good deal of muscle for boy be only seven shut hand moved upward to shoulder so that earl might see muscle dick have kindly approved of face be so grave earnest that footman found necessary to look very hard indeed at ugly picture well said earl may try cedric gave stick began to assist to rise usually footman did be violently sworn at when lordship have extra twinge of gout earl be not very polite person a rule many time huge footman about quaked inside imposing livery evening did not swear though gouty foot gave more twinge than one chose to try experiment got up slowly put hand on small shoulder presented to with so much courage little lord fauntleroy made careful step forward looking down at gouty foot just lean on said with encouraging good cheer will walk very slowly if earl have be supported by footman must have rested le on stick more on assistant arm yet be part of experiment to let grandson feel burden a light weight be quite heavy weight indeed after few step young lordship face grew quite hot heart beat rather fast braced sturdily remembering muscle dick approval of be afraid of leaning on panted be right if if be very long way be not really very far to dining room seemed rather long way to cedric before reached chair at head of table hand on shoulder seemed to grow heavier at step face grew redder hotter breath shorter never thought of giving up stiffened childish muscle held head erect encouraged earl a limped along doe foot hurt very much when stand on asked did ever put in hot water mustard mr hobbs used to put in hot water arnica be very nice thing tell big dog stalked slowly beside big footman followed several time looked very queer a watched little figure making very most of strength bearing burden with such good will earl too looked rather queer once a glanced sidewise down at flushed little face when entered room where be to dine cedric saw be very large imposing one that footman who stood behind chair at head of table stared very hard a came in reached chair at last hand be removed from shoulder earl be fairly seated cedric took out dick handkerchief wiped forehead be warm night be said perhaps need fire because because of foot seems just little warm to delicate consideration for noble relative feeling be such that did not wish to seem to intimate that of surroundings be unnecessary have be doing rather hard work said earl oh said lord fauntleroy be exactly hard got little warm person will get warm in summer time rubbed damp curl rather vigorously with gorgeous handkerchief own chair be placed at other end of table opposite grandfather be chair with arm intended for much larger individual than indeed everything have seen so far great room with high ceiling massive furniture big footman big dog earl be of proportion calculated to make little lad feel that be very small indeed did not trouble have never thought very large important be quite willing to accommodate even to circumstance rather overpowered perhaps have never looked so little fellow a when seated now in great chair at end of table notwithstanding solitary existence earl chose to live in state be fond of dinner dined in formal style cedric looked at across glitter of splendid glass plate to unaccustomed eye seemed quite dazzling stranger looking on might well have smiled at picture great stately room big liveried servant bright light glittering silver glass fierce looking old nobleman at head of table very small boy at foot dinner be usually very serious matter with earl be very serious matter with cook if lordship be not pleased have indifferent appetite to day however appetite seemed trifle better than usual perhaps because have something to think of beside flavor of entree management of gravy grandson gave something to think of kept looking at across table did not say very much managed to make boy talk have never imagined that must be entertained by hearing child talk lord fauntleroy at once puzzled amused kept remembering how have let childish shoulder feel weight just for sake of trying how far boy courage endurance must go pleased to know that grandson have not quailed have not seemed to think even for moment of giving up what have undertaken to do wear coronet time remarked lord fauntleroy respectfully replied earl with grim smile be not becoming to mr hobbs said always wore said cedric after thought over said supposed must sometimes take off to put hat on yes said earl take off occasionally one of footman suddenly turned aside gave singular little cough behind hand cedric finished dinner first then leaned back in chair took survey of room

good companion might feel lonely sometimes do think will make good companion inquired earl yes replied cedric think will mr hobbs be great friend be best friend have except dearest earl made quick movement of bushy eyebrow who be dearest be mother said lord fauntleroy in rather low quiet little voice perhaps be trifle tired a bed time be nearing perhaps after excitement of last few day be

be best friend boy young mother must not help thinking of more thought of le be inclined to talk by time dinner be at end earl saw that there be faint shadow on face cedric bore with excellent courage when went back to library though tall footman walked on one side of master earl hand rested on grandson shoulder though not so heavily a before when footman left alone cedric sat down upon hearth rug near dougal for few minute stroked dog ear in silence looked at fire earl watched boy eye looked wistful thoughtful once twice gave little sigh earl sat still kept eye fixed on grandson fauntleroy

little body eager gesture simple enjoyment of be pleasant to behold when at last explanation illustration be at end game began in good earnest earl still found entertained young companion be wholly absorbed played with childish heart gay little laugh when made good throw enthusiasm over home run impartial delight over own good luck opponent must have given flavor to game if week before one have told earl of dorincourt on particular morning must be forgetting gout bad temper in child game played with black white wooden peg on gayly painted board with curly headed small boy for companion must without doubt have made very unpleasant yet certainly have forgotten when door opened thomas announced visitor visitor in question who be elderly gentleman in black le person than clergyman of parish be so startled by amazing scene met eye that almost fell back pace ran risk of colliding with thomas there be in fact part of duty that reverend mr mordaunt found so decidedly unpleasant a part compelled to call upon noble patron at castle noble patron indeed usually made visit a disagreeable a lay in lordly power to make abhorred church charity flew into violent rage when of tenantry took liberty of being poor ill needing assistance when gout be at worst did not hesitate to announce that must not be bored irritated by being told story of miserable misfortune when gout troubled le be in somewhat more humane frame of mind must perhaps give rector money after having bullied in most painful manner berated whole parish for shiftlessness imbecility whatsoever mood never failed to make a many sarcastic embarrassing speech a possible to cause reverend mr mordaunt to wish be proper christian like to throw something heavy at during year in mr mordaunt have be in charge of dorincourt parish rector certainly did not remember having seen lordship of own free will do one kindness under circumstance show that thought of one have called to day to speak to of specially pressing case a have walked up avenue have for two reason dreaded visit more than usual in first place knew that lordship have for several day be suffering with gout have be in so villainous humor that rumor of have even reached village carried there by one of young woman servant to sister who kept little shop retailed darning needle cotton peppermint gossip a mean of earning honest living what mr dibble did not know about castle inmate farm house inmate village population be really not worth being talked about of course knew everything about castle because sister jane short be one of upper housemaid be very friendly intimate with thomas way lordship do go on said mr dibble over counter way do use language mr thomas told jane flesh blood a be in livery must stand for throw plate of toast at mr thomas hisself did not more than two day since if be for other thing being agreeable society below stair most genteel warning must have be gave within hour rector have heard for somehow earl be favorite black sheep in cottage farm house bad behavior gave many good woman something to talk about when have company to tea second reason be even worse because be new one have be talked about with most excited interest who did not know of old nobleman fury when handsome son captain have married american lady who did not know how cruelly have treated captain how big gay sweet smiling young man who be only member of grand family one liked have died in foreign land poor unforgiven who did not know how fiercely lordship have hated poor young creature who have be son wife how have hated thought of child never meant to see boy until two son died left without heir then who did not know that have looked forward without affection pleasure to grandson coming that have made up mind that must find boy vulgar awkward pert american lad more likely to disgrace noble name than to honor proud angry old man thought have kept thought did not suppose one have dared to guess at much le talk over what felt dreaded servant watched read face ill humor fit of gloom discussed in servant hall while thought quite secure from common herd thomas be telling jane cook butler housemaid other footman that be opinion that hold man be wuss than usual thinkin ' capting boy ' hanticipatin a wo be credit to fambly ' serve right added thomas hit hown fault wot can iggspect from child brought up in pore circumstance in there low hamerica a reverend mr mordaunt walked under great tree remembered that questionable little boy have arrived at castle only evening before that there be nine chance to one that lordship worst fear be realized twenty two chance to one if poor little fellow have disappointed earl be even now in tearing rage ready to vent rancor on first person who called appeared probable must be reverend self judge then of amazement when a thomas opened library door ear be greeted by delighted ring of childish laughter be two out shouted excited clear little voice see be two out there be earl chair gout stool foot on by small table game on quite close to actually leaning against arm ungouty knee be little boy with face glowing eye dancing with excitement be two out little stranger cried have luck that time have then recognized at once that one have come in earl glanced around knitting shaggy eyebrow a have trick of doing when saw who be mr mordaunt be still more surprised to see that looked even le disagreeable than usual instead of more so in fact looked almost a if have forgotten for moment how disagreeable be how unpleasant really must make when tried ah said in harsh voice giving hand rather graciously good morning mordaunt have found new employment see put other hand on cedric shoulder perhaps deep down in heart there be stir of gratified pride that be such heir have to present there be spark of something like pleasure in eye a moved boy slightly forward be new lord fauntleroy said fauntleroy be mr mordaunt rector of parish fauntleroy looked up at gentleman in clerical garment gave hand be very glad to make acquaintance sir said remembering word have heard mr hobbs use on one two occasion when have be greeting new customer with ceremony cedric felt quite sure that one ought to be more than usually polite to minister mr mordaunt held small hand in moment a looked down at child face smiling involuntarily liked little fellow from instant a in fact people always did like be not boy beauty grace most appealed to be simple natural kindliness in little lad made word uttered however quaint unexpected sound pleasant sincere a rector looked at cedric forgot to think of earl at nothing in world be so strong a kind heart somehow kind little heart though be only heart of child seemed to clear atmosphere of big gloomy room make brighter be delighted to make acquaintance lord fauntleroy said rector made long journey to come to great many people will be glad to know made safely be long way answered fauntleroy dearest mother be with be lonely of course be never lonely if mother be with ship be beautiful take chair mordaunt said earl mr mordaunt sat down glanced from fauntleroy to earl lordship be greatly to be congratulated said warmly earl plainly have intention of showing feeling on subject be like father said rather gruffly let hope will conduct more creditably then added well what be morning mordaunt who be in trouble now be not a bad a mr mordaunt have expected hesitated second before began be higgins said higgins of edge farm have be very unfortunate be ill last autumn child have scarlet fever ca say that be very good manager have have ill luck of course be behindhand in many way be in trouble about rent now newick tell if doe pay must leave place of course must be very serious matter wife be ill came to yesterday to beg to see about ask for time think if must give time must catch up again think said earl looking rather black fauntleroy made movement forward have be standing between grandfather visitor listening with might have begun to be interested in higgins at once wondered how many child there be if scarlet fever have hurt very much eye be wide open be fixed upon mr mordaunt with intent interest a gentleman went on with conversation higgins be well meaning man said rector making effort to strengthen plea be bad enough tenant replied lordship be always behindhand newick tell be in great trouble now said rector be very fond of wife child if farm be taken from may literally starve can not give nourishing thing need two of child be left very low after fever doctor order for wine luxury that higgins can not afford at fauntleroy moved step nearer be way with michael said earl slightly started forgot said forgot have philanthropist in room who be michael gleam of queer amusement came back into old man deep set eye be bridget husband who have fever answered fauntleroy must pay rent buy wine thing gave that money to help earl drew brow together into curious frown somehow be scarcely grim at glanced across at mr mordaunt know what sort of landed proprietor will make said told boy be to have what wanted anything wanted what wanted seems be money to give to beggar oh be beggar said fauntleroy eagerly michael be splendid bricklayer worked oh said earl be not beggar be splendid bricklayer bootblack apple woman bent gaze on boy for few second in silence fact be that new thought be coming to though perhaps be not prompted by noblest emotion be not bad thought come here said at last fauntleroy went stood a near to a possible without encroaching on gouty foot what must do in case lordship asked must be confessed that mr mordaunt experienced for moment curious sensation being man of great thoughtfulness having spent so many year on estate of dorincourt knowing tenantry rich poor people of village honest industrious dishonest lazy realized very strongly what power for good evil must be given in future to one small boy standing there brown eye wide open hand deep in pocket thought came to also that great deal of power might perhaps through caprice of proud self indulgent old man be given to now that if young nature be not simple generous one might be worst thing must happen not only for others for what must do in case demanded earl fauntleroy drew little nearer laid one hand on knee with most confiding air of good comradeship if be very rich said not only just little boy must let stay give thing for child then be only boy then after second pause in face brightened visibly can do anything ca said humph said lord staring at be opinion be be not displeased either mean can give one anything said fauntleroy who be newick be agent answered earl of tenant be not over fond of be going to write letter now inquired fauntleroy will bring pen ink can take game off table plainly have not for instant occurred to that newick must be allowed to do worst earl paused moment still looking at can write asked yes answered cedric not very well move thing from table commanded lord bring pen

fauntleroy only wrote letter be grandfather who did know how be about always being good to everybody be mr higgins well now higgins looked trifle taken aback also be somewhat startled at hearing noble

doctor nurse be little trying therefore to lordship nerve to be told while looked on eye gleaming from under shaggy eyebrow that felt interest in scarlet fever see higgins broke in earl with fine grim smile people have be mistaken in lord fauntleroy understands when want reliable information on subject of character apply to get into carriage fauntleroy fauntleroy jumped in carriage rolled away down green lane even when turned corner into high road earl be still grimly smiling viii lord dorincourt have occasion to wear grim smile many time a day passed by indeed a acquaintance with grandson progressed wore smile so often that there be moment when almost lost grimness there be denying that before lord fauntleroy have appeared on scene old man have be growing very tired of loneliness gout seventy year after so long life of excitement amusement be not agreeable to sit alone even in most splendid room with one foot on gout stool with other diversion than flying into rage shouting at frightened footman who hated sight of old earl be too clever man not to know perfectly well that servant detested that even if have visitor did not come for love of though found sort of amusement in sharp sarcastic talk spared one so long a have be strong well have gone from one place to pretending to amuse though have not really enjoyed when health began to fail felt tired of everything shut up at dorincourt with gout newspaper book must not read time became more more bored a called hated long night day grew more more savage irritable then fauntleroy came when earl saw fortunately for little fellow secret pride of grandfather be gratified at outset if cedric have be le handsome little fellow old man might have taken so strong dislike to that must not have given chance to see grandson finer quality chose to think that cedric beauty fearless spirit be result of dorincourt blood credit to dorincourt rank then when heard lad talk saw what well bred little fellow be notwithstanding boyish ignorance of that new position meant old earl liked grandson more actually began to find rather entertained have amused to give into childish hand power to bestow benefit on poor higgins lord cared nothing for poor higgins pleased little to think that grandson must be talked about by country people must begin to be popular with tenantry even in childhood then have gratified to drive to church with cedric to see excitement interest caused by arrival knew how people must speak of beauty of little lad of fine strong straight body of erect bearing handsome face bright hair how must say

tire little too want to get off want to learn how a soon a have got breath want to go back for hat cleverest person in world if have undertaken to teach fauntleroy how to please old man who watched must not have taught anything must have succeeded better a pony trotted off again toward avenue faint color crept up in fierce old face eye under shaggy brow gleamed with pleasure such a lordship have scarcely expected to know again sat watched quite eagerly until sound of horse hoof returned when did come be after time came at faster pace fauntleroy hat be still off wilkins be carrying for cheek be redder than before hair be flying about ear came at quite brisk canter there panted a drew up c cantered did do a well a boy on fifth avenue did staid on wilkins pony be close friend after scarcely day passed in country people did not see out together cantering gayly on highroad through green lane child in cottage must run to door to look at proud little brown pony with gallant little figure sitting so straight in saddle young lord must snatch off cap swing at shout hullo good morning in very unlordly manner though with great heartiness sometimes must stop talk with child once wilkins came back to castle with story of how fauntleroy have insisted on dismounting near village school so that boy who be lame tired might ride home on pony be blessed said wilkins in telling story at

that grandfather be most amiable generous of elderly gentleman certainly found wish gratified almost before be uttered such gift pleasure be lavished upon that be sometimes almost bewildered by own possession apparently be to have everything wanted to do everything wished to do though must certainly not have be very wise plan to pursue with small boy young lordship bore amazingly well perhaps notwithstanding sweet nature might have be somewhat spoiled by if have not be for hour spent with mother at court lodge best friend of watched over ever closely tenderly two have many long talk together never went back to castle with kiss on cheek without carrying in heart simple pure word worth remembering there be one thing be true puzzled little fellow very much thought over mystery of much oftener than one supposed even mother did not know how often pondered on earl for long time never suspected that did so at being quick to observe little boy must not help wondering why be that mother grandfather never seemed to meet have noticed that never did meet when dorincourt carriage stopped at court lodge earl never alighted on rare occasion of lordship going to church fauntleroy be always left to speak to mother in porch alone perhaps to go home with yet day fruit flower be sent to court lodge from hot house at castle one virtuous action of earl have set upon pinnacle of perfection in cedric eye be what have done soon after first sunday when mr errol have walked home from church unattended about week later when cedric be going one day to visit mother found at door instead of large carriage prancing pair pretty little brougham handsome bay horse be present from to mother earl said abruptly can not go walking about country need carriage man who drive will take

see be quite safe time quite have doubt said lordship dryly drew down beetling eyebrow looked at little boy so fixedly so long that fauntleroy wondered what must be thinking of ix fact be lordship earl of dorincourt thought in day of many thing of have never thought before thought be in one way connected with grandson pride be strongest part of nature boy gratified at point through pride began to find new interest in life began to take pleasure in showing heir to world world have known of disappointment in son so there be agreeable touch of triumph in exhibiting new lord fauntleroy who must disappoint one wished child to appreciate own power to understand splendor of position wished that others must realize too made plan for future sometimes in secret actually found wishing that own past life have be better one that there have be le in that pure childish heart must shrink from if knew truth be not agreeable to think how beautiful innocent face must look if owner must be made by chance to understand that grandfather have be called for many year wicked earl of dorincourt thought even made feel trifle nervous did not wish boy to find out sometimes in new interest forgot gout after while doctor be surprised to find noble patient health growing better than have expected ever must be again perhaps earl grew better because time did not pas so slowly for have something to think of beside pain infirmity one fine morning people be amazed to see little lord fauntleroy riding pony with companion than wilkins new companion rode tall powerful gray horse be other than earl be in fact fauntleroy who have suggested plan a have be on point of mounting pony have said rather wistfully to grandfather wish be going with when go away feel lonely because be left by in big castle wish must ride too greatest excitement have be aroused in stable few minute later by arrival of order selim be to be saddled for earl after selim be saddled almost day people became accustomed to sight of tall gray horse carrying tall gray old man with handsome fierce eagle face by side of brown pony bore little lord fauntleroy in ride together through green lane pretty country road two rider became more intimate than ever gradually old man heard great deal about dearest life a fauntleroy trotted by big horse chatted gayly there must not well have be brighter little comrade nature be so happy be who talked most earl often be silent listening watching joyous glowing face sometimes must tell young companion to set pony off at gallop when little fellow dashed off sitting so straight fearless must watch with gleam of pride pleasure in eye when after dash fauntleroy came back waving cap with laughing shout always felt that grandfather be very good friend indeed one thing that earl discovered be that son wife did not lead idle life be not long before learned that poor people knew very well indeed when there be sickness sorrow poverty in house little brougham often stood before door do know said fauntleroy once say bless ' when see child be glad there be who go to house to be taught to sew say feel so rich now that want to help poor one have not displeased earl to find that mother of heir have beautiful young face looked a much like lady a if have be duchess in one way did not displease to know that be popular beloved by poor yet be often conscious of hard jealous pang when saw how filled child heart how boy clung to a best beloved old man must have desired to stand first have rival same morning drew up horse on elevated point of moor over rode made gesture with whip over broad beautiful landscape spread before do know that land belongs to said to fauntleroy doe answered fauntleroy how much be to belong to one person how beautiful do know day will all belong to that great deal more to exclaimed fauntleroy in rather awe stricken voice when when be dead grandfather answered then want said fauntleroy want to live always be kind answered earl in dry way nevertheless day will all be yours day will be earl of dorincourt little lord fauntleroy sat very still in saddle for few moment looked over broad moor green farm beautiful copse cottage in lane pretty village over tree to where turret of great castle rose gray stately then gave queer little sigh what be thinking of asked earl be thinking replied fauntleroy what little boy be of what dearest said to what be inquired earl said that perhaps be not so easy to be very rich that if one have so many thing always one might sometimes forget that one else be not so fortunate that one who be rich must always be careful try to remember be talking to about how good be said be such good thing because earl have so much power if cared only about own pleasure never thought about people who lived on land might have trouble that must help there be so many people must be such hard thing be just looking at house thinking how must have to find out about people when be earl how did find out about a lordship knowledge of tenantry consisted in finding out of paid rent promptly in turning out who did not be rather hard question newick find out for said pulled great gray mustache looked at small questioner rather uneasily will go home now added when be earl see to that be better earl than have be be very silent a rode home felt to be almost incredible that who have never really loved one in life must find growing so fond of little fellow a without doubt be at first have only be pleased proud of cedric beauty bravery there be something more than pride in feeling now laughed grim dry laugh to sometimes when thought how liked to have boy near how liked to hear voice how in secret really wished to be liked thought well of by small grandson be old fellow in dotage have nothing else to think of must say to yet knew be not that altogether if have allowed to admit truth must perhaps have found obliged to own that very thing attracted in spite of be quality have never possessed frank true kindly nature affectionate trustfulness must never think evil be only about week after ride when after visit to mother fauntleroy came into library with troubled thoughtful face sat down in high backed chair in have sat on evening of arrival for while looked at ember on hearth earl watched in silence wondering what be coming be evident that cedric have something on mind at last looked up doe newick know about people asked be business to know about said lordship be neglecting have contradictory a may seem there be nothing entertained edified more than little fellow interest in tenantry have never taken interest in pleased well enough that with childish habit of thought in midst of childish amusement high spirit there must be such quaint seriousness working in curly head there be place said fauntleroy looking up at with wide open horror stricken eye dearest have seen be at other end of village house be close together almost falling down can scarcely breathe people be so poor everything be dreadful often have fever child die make wicked to live like be so poor miserable be worse than michael bridget rain come in at roof dearest went to see poor woman who lived there must not let come

just a made right for higgins always make right for everybody told must that newick must have forgotten to tell earl looked down at hand on knee newick have not forgotten to tell in fact newick have spoken to more than once of desperate condition of end of village known a earl court knew about tumble down miserable cottage bad drainage damp wall broken window leaking roof about poverty fever misery mr mordaunt have painted to in strongest word must use lordship have used violent language in response when gout have be at worst said that sooner people of earl court died be buried by parish better must be there be end of matter yet a looked at small hand on knee from small hand to honest earnest frank eyed face be actually little ashamed of earl court what said want to make builder of model cottage of do positively put own hand upon childish one stroked must be pulled down said fauntleroy with great eagerness dearest say so let let go have pulled down to morrow people will be so glad when see will know have come to help eye shone like star in glowing face earl rose from chair put hand on child shoulder let go out take walk on terrace said with short laugh can talk over though

shake hand with lord congratulate on change of look on recovery from gout d ' ye know said when spoke of incident afterward old man looked a proud a turkey cock upon word wonder for handsomer finer

to wish to see little fellow just a be wondering how might be brought about to utter astonishment received letter from brother inviting to come with husband to dorincourt seems incredible exclaimed have heard said that child have worked miracle begin to believe say brother adores boy can scarcely endure to have out of sight be so proud of actually believe want to show to accepted invitation at once when reached dorincourt castle with sir harry be late in afternoon went to room at once before seeing brother having dressed for dinner entered drawing room earl be there standing near fire

england other on train carrying letter passenger bound for california first be addressed to t havisham esq second to benjamin tipton after store be closed that evening mr hobbs dick sat in back room talked together until midnight xiv be astonishing how short time take for very wonderful thing to happen have taken only few minute apparently to change fortune of little boy dangling red leg from high stool in mr hobbs store to transform from small boy living simplest life in quiet street into english nobleman heir to earldom magnificent wealth have taken only few minute apparently to change from english nobleman into penniless little impostor with right to of splendor have be enjoying surprising a may appear did not take nearly so long time a one might have expected to alter face of everything again to give back to that have be in danger of losing took le time because after woman who have called lady fauntleroy be not nearly so clever a be wicked when have be closely pressed by mr havisham question about marriage boy have made one two blunder have caused suspicion to be awakened then have lost presence of mind temper in excitement anger have betrayed still further mistake

only very clumsy plotter after opinion be that will be frightened out of wit will betray on spot be what actually happened be told nothing mr havisham kept from suspecting anything by continuing to have interview with in assured be investigating statement really began to feel so secure that spirit rose immensely began to be a insolent a might have be expected one fine morning a sat in sitting room at inn called dorincourt arm making very fine plan for mr havisham be announced when entered be followed by le than three person one be sharp faced boy one be big young man third be earl of dorincourt sprang to foot actually uttered cry of terror broke from before have time to check have thought of new comer a being thousand of mile away when have ever thought of at have scarcely done for year have never expected to see again must be confessed that dick grinned little when saw hello minna said big young man who be ben stood still minute looked at do know mr havisham asked glancing

that be mother that be quite ready for change ben took up hat marched to door if want again said to mr havisham know where to find walked out of room holding child hand not looking at woman once be fairly raving with fury earl be calmly gazing at through eyeglass have quietly placed upon aristocratic eagle nose come come young woman said mr havisham wo do at if want to be locked up really must behave there be something so very business like in tone probably feeling that safest thing must do must be to get out of way gave one savage look dashed past into next room slammed door will have more trouble with said mr havisham be right for very night left dorincourt arm took train to london be seen no more when earl left room after interview went at once to carriage to court lodge said to thomas to court lodge said thomas to coachman a mounted box may depend on thing be taking uniggspected turn when carriage stopped at court lodge cedric be in drawing room with mother earl came in

boy went back to cattle ranch in california returned under very comfortable circumstance just before going mr havisham have interview with in lawyer told that earl of dorincourt wished to do something for boy who might have turned out to be lord fauntleroy so have decided that must be good plan to invest in cattle ranch of own put ben in charge of on term must make pay very well must lay foundation

evening just like fourth of july said lord fauntleroy seems pity birthday be on fourth doe for then must keep together must be confessed that at first earl mr hobbs be not a intimate a might have be hoped must become in interest of british aristocracy fact be that earl have known very few grocery men mr hobbs have not have many very close acquaintance who be earl so in rare interview conversation did not flourish must also be owned that mr hobbs have be rather overwhelmed by splendor fauntleroy felt duty to show entrance gate stone lion avenue impressed mr hobbs somewhat at beginning when saw castle flower garden hot house terrace peacock dungeon armor great staircase stable liveried servant really be quite bewildered be picture gallery seemed to be finishing stroke somethin ' in manner of museum said to fauntleroy when be led into great beautiful room n said fauntleroy rather doubtfully think be museum grandfather say be ancestor aunt sister ejaculated mr hobbs of great uncle must have have family did raise sank into seat looked around with agitated countenance until with greatest difficulty lord fauntleroy managed to explain that wall be not lined entirely with portrait of progeny of great uncle found necessary in fact to call in assistance of mr mellon who knew about picture must tell who painted when who added romantic story of lord lady who be original when mr hobbs once understood have heard of story be very much fascinated liked picture gallery almost better than anything else must often walk over from village where staid at dorincourt arm must spend hour so wandering about gallery staring at painted lady gentleman who also stared at shaking head nearly time be earl must say er pretty nigh ' be goin ' to be one of ' own privately be not nearly so much disgusted with earl mode of life a have expected to be be to be doubted whether strictly republican principle be not shaken little by closer acquaintance with castle ancestor rest of at rate one day uttered very remarkable unexpected sentiment must have minded bein ' one of said be really great concession what grand day be when little lord fauntleroy birthday arrived how young lordship enjoyed how beautiful park looked filled with thronging people dressed in gayest best with flag flying from tent top of castle nobody have staid away who must possibly come because everybody be really glad that little lord fauntleroy be to be little lord fauntleroy still day be to be master of everything one wanted to have look at at pretty kind mother who have made so many friend positively one liked earl rather better felt more amiably toward because little boy loved trusted so because also have now made friend with behaved respectfully to heir mother be said that be even beginning to be fond of

very honestly happy perhaps indeed will tell that think be because be rather better than have be that be rather happier have not indeed suddenly become a good a fauntleroy thought at least have begun to love something have several time found sort of pleasure in doing kind thing innocent kind little heart of child have suggested be beginning day have be more pleased with son wife be true a people said that be beginning to like too liked to hear sweet voice to see sweet face a sat in arm chair used to watch listen a talked to boy heard loving gentle word be new to began to see why little fellow

earldom living in english castle be really very simple thing after be only that have lived near kind gentle heart have be taught to think kind thought always to care for others be very little thing perhaps be best thing of knew nothing of earl castle be quite ignorant of grand splendid thing be always lovable because be simple loving to be so be like being born king a old earl of dorincourt looked at day moving about park among people talking to knew making ready little bow when one greeted entertaining friend dick mr hobbs standing near mother miss herbert listening to conversation old nobleman be very well satisfied with have never be better satisfied than be when went down to biggest tent where more important tenant of dorincourt estate be sitting down to grand collation of day be

going to try to be a good a grandfather amid shout clamor of applause stepped back with little sigh of relief put hand into earl stood close to smiling leaning against side must be very end of story must add one curious piece of information be that mr hobbs became so fascinated with high life be so reluctant to leave young friend that actually sold corner store in new york settled in english village of erlesboro where opened shop be patronized by castle consequently be great success though earl never became very intimate if will believe that man hobbs became in time more aristocratic than
