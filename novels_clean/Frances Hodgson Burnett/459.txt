to feel that moor be in secret companion friend that be not only moor to something else be like thing alive huge giant lying spread out in sun warming covering with thick white mist sometimes writhed twisted into wraith first noticed liked day perhaps when be purple yellow with gorse heather broom honey scent drew bee butterfly bird soon saw be drawn by thing how young be that afternoon when sat in deep window watched low soft whiteness creeping out hovering over heather a if moor have breathed remember be such low little mist at first crept crept until creeping grew into something heavier whiter began to hide heather gorse broom then low young fir tree mounted mounted sometimes breath of wind twisted into weird shape almost like human creature opened closed again then dragged crept grew thicker a pressed face against window pane mounted still higher got hold of moor hid hanging heavy white waiting be what came into child mind that have done what moor have told to do have hidden thing wanted to be hidden then waited stranger say that muircarrie moor be most beautiful most desolate place in world never seemed desolate to from first memory of have vague half comforted feeling that there be strange life on one must not exactly see be always conscious of know now why felt did not know then if have be older when first began to see what did see there must doubt have read thing in book must have given rise in mind to doubt wonder be only little child who have lived life quite apart from rest of world be too silent by nature to talk ask question even if have have others to talk to have only jean angus a found out year later knew what did not must have put off with adroit explanation if have be curious be not curious accepted everything a came went chapter ii only six when wee brown elspeth be brought to jean angus be a fond of other in silent way a be of often went together with when be taken out for walk be kept in open air great deal angus must walk by side of small shaggy shetland pony lead over rough steep place sheltie pony be meant for use when wished to fare farther than child must walk be trained to sturdy marching climbing even from babyhood because so loved moor nearly always rambled there often set out early in morning simple food be carried so that need not return to castle until chose must ride sheltie walk by turn until found place liked then jean angus must sit down among heather sheltie must be secured must wander about play in own way think be in strange way think must have played a almost lonely little girl might have played used to find corner among bush pretend be house have little friend who came to play with only remember one thing be not like ordinary playing of child be habit have of sitting quite still long time listening be what called listening be listening to hear if life on moor made sound must understand felt a if might if be very still listened long enough angus jean be not afraid of rain mist change of weather if have be must have have little outdoor life always carried plaid enough to keep warm dry so on day speak of did not turn back when found in midst of sudden mist sat down in sheltered place waited knowing must lift in time sun have be shining when set out angus jean be content to sit guard while amused knew must keep near run into danger be not adventurous child be in fact in more than usually quiet mood that morning quiet have come upon when mist have begun to creep about inclose liked liked sense of being shut in by soft whiteness have so often watched from nursery window in castle people might be walking about said to angus when lifted from sheltie back must see might be walking nothing must hurt ye bairnie answered must hurt said have never be afraid that anything on moor must hurt played very little that day quiet mist held still soon sat down began to listen after while knew that jean angus be watching did not disturb often watched when thought did not know be doing have sat listening for nearly hour when heard first muffled slow trampling of horse hoof knew what be even before drew near enough for to be conscious of other sound jingling of arm chain creaking of leather one notice a trooper pas by armed mounted men be coming toward be what sound meant seemed faint distant though knew be really quite near jean angus did not appear to hear knew that only heard because have be listening out of mist rode company of wild looking men wearing garment such a have never seen before most of be savage uncouth clothes be disordered stained a if with hard travel fight did not know even ask why did not frighten did not suddenly seemed to know that be brave men have be doing brave hard thing here there among caught sight of broken stained sword dirk with only hilt left be pale wild face be joyous triumphant saw a drew near man who seemed chieftain be lean giant who be darker under darkness paler than rest on forehead be queer star shaped scar rode black horse before held close with left arm pretty little girl dressed in strange rich clothes big man hand be pressed against breast a held though be large hand did not quite cover dark red stain on embroidery of dress dress be brown have brown hair soft brown eye like little doe moment saw loved black horse stopped before wild troop drew up waited behind great lean rider looked at moment then lifting little girl in long arm bent down set gently on foot on mossy earth in mist beside got up to greet stood smiling at other in moment a stood black horse moved forward muffled trampling began again wild company swept on way white mist closed behind a if have never passed of course know how strange will seem to people who read that can not be helped doe not really matter be in way thing happened did not even seem strange to anything might happen on moor anything there be fair little girl with eye like doe knew have come to play with went together to house among bush of broom gorse played happily before began saw stand look wonderingly at dark red stain on embroidery on childish breast be a if be asking how came there must not understand then picked fern bunch of thick growing bluebell put in girdle in such way that hid ugliness did not really know how long stayed only knew that be happy that though way of playing be in way different from mine loved presently mist lifted sun shone be deep in wonderful game of being hidden in room in castle because something strange be going to happen be not told about ran behind big gorse bush did not come back when ran to look for be nowhere must not find went back to jean angus feeling puzzled where did go asked turning head from side to side be looking at strangely of be pale jean be trembling little who be ysobel said little

come often dare say be gone now must go too get up angus man be for castle if three have be different if have ever have habit of talking asking question might surely have asked one question a rode on sheltie back with angus leading asked nothing said very little except once spoke of wild looking horseman pale joyous face be glad be said there be also one brief query from angus did talk to bairnie

said to if have spoken word be needed be better took home to castle be given supper put to bed jean sat by until fell asleep be obliged to sit rather long time because be so happy with memory of wee brown elspeth certainty that must come again be not jean word have made sure knew came many time through childish year knew that must come play with few day though never saw wild trooper again big lean man with scar child who play together be not very curious about one simply accepted with delight somehow knew that lived happily in place not far away must come go seemed without trouble

unattractive child be plain uninteresting sort of girl be shy must not talk to people so of course bored knew did not look well when wore beautiful clothes be little unimportant like reed for thinness because be rich sort of chieftainess ought to have be tall rather stately at least ought to have have bearing must have made impossible for people to quite overlook one must overlook insignificant thin girl who slipped in out of place sat stared listened to other people instead of saying thing liked to look on be forgotten interested to watch people if did not notice of course relative did not really like how must be busy in big world did not know what to do with girl who ought to have be important be not be sure that in secret be relieved when be sent back to muircarrie after that life

people have never heard of have only thought of a legend talked a wrote scarcely knew when led into talking also afterward realized that have asked question must not help answering because eye be drawing on with quiet deep interest seemed a if saw something in face made curious think saw expression first when began to speak of meeting in railway carriage mentioned poor little fair child heart have ached so for be such little thing did so want to comfort white little clinging hand be so pathetic when stroked patted said did not even look at did not start hesitated in way almost produced

never have courage to speak to stranger answered be afraid be coward too might have thought interfering might not have understood murmured be clinging to dress when walked away down platform went on dare say noticed then not a did wish have noticed more be answer poor little white one led into talk about white people said did not think be exactly observant person in respect remembering book seemed to work of man who saw understood everything in world must not comprehend thinking told so replied that what have said about white people made feel that must be abstracted sometimes miss thing did not remember having noticed rare fairness have seen smiled a said because of course be only little thing that have not seen that people be so much fairer than others have not be little thing to evidently be why be even rather curious about explained be difference definite enough to make speak almost a if be of different race from ours sat silent few second thinking over suddenly realized what have never realized before do know said a slowly a have spoken did not know be true until put into word be so used to thinking of a different somehow suppose do feel a if be almost like race in way perhaps one must feel like with native indian japanese dare say be good simile reflected be different when know well have never known one wee brown elspeth answered thinking over did start then in strangest way what exclaimed what did say be quite startled suddenly looked pale breath caught said wee elspeth wee brown elspeth be only child who played with stammered when be little pulled together

child be first ever knew told about misty day on moor about pale trooper big lean leader who carried elspeth before on saddle have never talked to one about before not even to jean braidfute seemed to be so interested a if little story quite fascinated be only episode brought in weirdness of moor childish fancy about thing hiding in white mist castle frowning on rock baby face pressed against nursery window in tower angus library jean goodness wise way be dreadful to talk so much about listened so eye never left face watched held a if be enthralled sometimes asked question wonder who be horseman pondered did ever ask wee elspeth be too little to care only played answered came went so quickly that be only sort of dream seem to have be strange lot be angus curious about suggested angus never be curious about anything said perhaps knew something about must not tell when be little thing always knew jean have secret be too young to hear hid sad ugly thing from thing might frighten child be very good yes be good said thoughtfully think one must have be pleased to find talking quietly to great genius a quietly a if be quite ordinary person to experience be wonderful have thought about so much with such adoring reverence looked at a if truly liked even a if be something new sort of discovery interested dare say that have never before seen girl who have lived so much alone in such remote wild place believe sir ian wife be pleased too to see be talking be glad that guest must see be intelligent enough to hold attention even of clever man if hector macnairn be interested in must not be a silly dull a looked on part be only full of wonder happiness be girl have be only hero seemed even a if liked cared about queer life be not man who have air of making confidence talking about before parted seemed to know surroundings a if have described mere phrase of must make picture few word made mother quite clear to loved other in exquisite intimate way be beautiful person artist have always painted be completely happy when be together lived in house in country must not at tell how discovered that be old house with beautiful chimney very big garden with curious high

on thick green grass suppose saw just because said will come to tea under big apple tree afternoon when late shadow be like velvet on grass be perhaps loveliest time when rose to go join rest of party stood moment glanced round room at fellow guest be there of white people here to night said smiling will begin to look for everywhere glanced over face carelessly there be none here to night answered then flushed because have smiled be only childish name gave hesitated forgot must understand dare say sound silly looked at so quickly no exclaimed must think that certainly not silly think knew that put out hand gently touched arm a one might touch child to make feel one wanted to listen know said in low slow voice how glad be that have talked to sir ian said be not fond of talking to people wanted to know care about place like muircarrie be why answered feeling at once how much understood care for muircarrie more than for rest of world suppose saw in face dare say that people who love that kind of life can not help seeing there yes said be in eye be what saw found wondering about when watched in train be really moor mist thing think be hidden in did watch asked must not help watching little when be so kind to poor woman be afraid must see think rude be far look in face watched said if will come to tea under big apple tree will tell more about indeed will come answered now

high dim colored wall with curious low corner tower leafage of wall fruit spread against brick inclosed embracingly a if be there to take care of beauty tree seemed to have grown there in dignified loveliness of shadow to take care of mr macnairn who sat under felt a if loved be proud of have heard clever literary people speak of mr macnairn a survival of type sometimes clever people bewilder by term use thought understood what meant in case be quite unlike modern elderly woman yet be not in least old fashioned demodee be only exquisitely distinct when rose from chair under apple tree bough came forward to meet that afternoon first thing struck be height slenderness light step then saw that clear profile seemed cut out of ivory that head be beautiful shape be beautifully set turn movement be exquisite mere fact that long ivory hand enfolded mine thrilled wondered if be possible that must be unaware of loveliness beautiful people be thrilling to mr macnairn have always seemed more so than one else be what son once said of be not merely beautiful be beauty beauty very spirit moving about among mortal pure beauty drew to chair under tree sat down together felt a if be glad that have come watching look have seen in son eye be in hers also watched a talked found telling about home a have found telling have evidently talked to about have never met one who thought of muircarrie a did seemed a if who be stranger be drawn by wild beautiful loneliness a be be happy in secret heart began to ask if must be true that made feel little a if somehow belonged to one have always seemed so detached from one have not be miserable about have not complained to only accepted detachment a part of kind of life mr macnairn came into garden later several other people came in to tea be apparently sort of daily custom people who evidently adored mr macnairn dropped in to see talk to afternoon talked wonderfully friend joy in be wonderful too evidently made people happy to be near said did be like light step movement of delicate fine head gracious soft arrestingly lovely did not let drift away sit in corner looking on a usually did among stranger kept near in subtle gentle

people be not one have seen here before there be second silence before mr macnairn smilingly gave one of light thrilling touch on arm ah remember said hector told about white people rather fancied might be one be afraid rather stared at a slowly shook head see be almost one not quite be so busy with rose did not notice who be standing near mr le breton said perhaps be anabel mere be more transparent sort of girl than mildred be more blond know hector dare say be chapter vi remained in london several week stayed because macnairns be so good to must not have told one how loved mr macnairn how different everything seemed when be with be never shy when be together there seemed to be such thing a shyness in world be not shy with mr macnairn either after have sat under big apple tree bough in walled garden few time realized that have begun to belong to somebody two marvelous people cared for in way in way that made feel a if be real girl not merely queer little awkward ghost in far away castle nobody wanted to visit because be so dull desolate far from london be so clever knew interesting thing in world cleverness experience never bewildered overwhelmed be born wonderful little creature angus macayre have filled mind with strange rich furnishing marvelous color form mr macnairn actually said to one day when be sitting together be holding hand softly slowly patting have way of doing have also way of keeping very near whenever must said once that liked to touch now then to make sure be quite real must not melt away did not know then why said understood afterward sometimes sat under apple tree until long twilight deepened into shadow closed round nightingale lived in garden began to sing three loved nightingale felt a though knew that be listening to be wonderful thing to sit quite still listening to bird singing in dark to dare to feel that while sings know how soul adores be like kind of worship have be sitting listening for quite long time nightingale have just ceased left darkness exquisite silence fell suddenly softly a last note dropped when mr macnairn began to talk for first time of what called fear remember just how began for few minute did not quite understand what meant a went on mr macnairn joined in talk meaning became clear thing to knew that be only talking quite simply of something have often talked of before be not a afraid of fear a most people be because have thought of reasoned about so much always calmly with clear open mind by fear meant that mysterious horror most people feel at thought of passing out of world know into one know at how quiet how still be inside wall of old garden a three sat under bough talked about what sweet night scent of leaf sleeping flower be in breath drew how one heart moved lifted when nightingale broke out again if one have seen heard one little thing if one mortal being must catch one glimpse of light in dark mr macnairn low voice said out of shadow near fear must be gone forever perhaps whole mystery be a simple a said son voice a simple a a there be tone of music too fine to be registered by human ear so there may be vibration of light not to be seen by human eye form color a well a sound just beyond earthly perception yet a real a a formed a only existing in other dimension there be intenseness be almost note of anguish in mr macnairn answer even though voice be very low involuntarily turned head to look at though of course be too dark to see face felt somehow a if hand be wrung together in lap oh said if one only have shadow of proof that mystery be only that can not see that can not hear though be really quite near with one who seem to have gone away whom feel can not live without if once must be sure there must be fear there must be none dearest often called dearest voice have wonderful sound in darkness be caress strength seemed to speak to of thing knew did not have vowed to other that will believe there be reason for fear be vow between yes yes cried breathlessly sometimes hector sometimes miss muircarrie doe not feel please say 'ysobel broke in please do went on a quietly a if have not even paused ysobel told first night met that seemed a if must not believe in never seems real to at said perhaps be because can never forget what jean told about mother lying still upon bed listening to one calling have told jean story few day before knew be father jean knew too how did know mr macnairn voice be almost whisper must not tell that never asked how be knew knew perhaps hesitated be because in highland people often believe thing like one hears so many story one life that in end seem strange have always heard thing know about people who have second sight about seal who change into men come on shore fall in love with girl marry say go away now then one really know where be believed that go back to own people change into seal again because must plunge riot about in sea sometimes come home sometimes beautiful young stranger with soft dark eye appeared once not far from muircarrie married boatman daughter be very restless one night got up left never saw again few day later splendid dead seal covered with wound be washed up near cottage fisher say that people have wanted to keep from land wife have fought with killed wife have son with strange velvet eye like father must keep away from water when be old enough to swim swam out one day because thought saw seal wanted to get near swam out too far perhaps never came back fisherman said father people have taken when one have heard story like one life nothing seems very strange nothing really be strange said hector macnairn again again through age have be told secret of god wonder of law have revered echoed never believed when believe know be simple will

nature did not comprehend profound mind saw knew be stronger than be suddenly felt a if might trust to to that without being troubled anxious must just say first thing came into mind because must be put there for by power must dictate to never felt younger le clever than did at moment be only ysobel muircarrie who knew almost nothing did not seem to matter be such simple almost childish thing told be only about dream chapter vii feeling call fear have never come to said to if have think must have melted away because of dream once have really believe be dream call one think really went somewhere came back often wonder why came back be only short dream so simple that there be scarcely anything to tell perhaps will not convey anything to have be part of life that time when be out on hillside be what call dream to myself 'out on hillside a if be kind of unearthly poem be be more real than anything have ever felt be real real wish must tell so that must know how real be felt almost piteous in longing to make know knew be afraid of something if must make know how real that one brief dream have be must not be afraid more loved loved so much be asleep one night at muircarrie went on suddenly without preparatory dreaming be standing out on hillside in moonlight softer more exquisite than have ever seen known before perhaps be still in nightgown know foot be bare on grass wore something light white did not seem to touch if touched did not feel bare foot did not feel grass only knew be beneath be low hill stood on be only on side of in spite of thrilling beauty of moon part stood on melted into soft beautiful shadow below above did not turn to look at ask about anything see difficulty be that there be earthly word to tell being be ecstasy pure light ecstasy oh what poor word know others if said be happy happy must be nothing be happiness be pure rapture did not look at beauty of night sky marvelous melting shadow be part of one with nothing held nothing beauty of night light air be what be be only thrilling ecstasy wonder at rapture of stopped covered face with hand tear wet finger oh can not make real be only there such short short time even if have be with must not have found word for even then be such short time only stood lifted face felt joy of pure marvel of joy only heard murmuring over over again 'oh how beautiful how beautiful oh how beautiful then marvel of new joy swept through said very softly very slowly a if voice be trailing away into silence 'oh h can lie down here on grass sleep through night under moonlight can sleep sleep ' began to sink softly down with heavenliest feeling of relaxation repose a if there existed only soul of beautiful rest sank so softly just a cheek almost touched grass dream be over oh cried mr macnairn did awaken came back in sleep suddenly found creeping into bed again a if have be away somewhere be wondering why be there how have left hillside when have left that part be dream other be not be allowed to go somewhere outside come back caught at hand in dark word be wrong said be because have word to describe have made feel at oh mr macnairn have be able to make know that be not dream lifted hand pressed passionately against cheek cheek too be wet wet be not dream said came back thank god came back just to tell that who come back stand awakened in ecstasy in ecstasy fear be nothing be only dream awakening be out on hillside out on hillside listen started a said listen nightingale be beginning again sent forth in dark fountain rising aspiring fountain of golden note seemed to reach heaven night be made radiant by flung upward like shower of star into sky sat listened almost holding breath oh nightingale nightingale know hector macnairn low voice said that be not dream when there

fatal flaw in heart at moment when be talking to when be at work when be asleep may cease will just be ceasing at moment can not stay own heart stood still for second then there rose before slowly clearly vision vision be not dream out on hillside murmured out on hillside clung to with arm held tight understood now why have talked about fear two who be almost one soul be trying to believe that be not really to be torn apart not really be trying to heap up for proof that might still be near other above effort be to save from worst worst woe understood too why something wiser stronger than have led to tell dream be not dream at be a said world have not learned secret yet there stood did not cry talk clung to other clung be human creature can do until secret be known a clung nightingale broke out again o nightingale o nightingale said in low wonder of voice be trying to tell chapter viii what feel sure know by time be that thing think happen by chance accident be only part of weaving of scheme of life when begin to suspect to watch closely also begin to see how trifle connect with one seem in end to have led to reason meaning though may not be clever enough to see clearly nothing be accident make everything happen ourselves wrong thing because know care whether be wrong right right one because unconsciously consciously choose right even in midst of ignorance dare say sound audacious for ordinary girl to say such thing in ordinary way perhaps have said in spite of because be not bad thing that must be said by day sort of person in simple word other day people can understand be only expressing what have gradually grown into belief in mind through reading with angus ancient book modern one book about faith religion book about philosophy magic book about what

lovely voice be what made ysobel be so angelic of to feel in deep quiet way to think that be part of part of climbing moon be trembling with beauty tender evening air quivered in heather fern late bird called like spirit ever since night when mr macnairn have held in arm under apple tree while nightingale sang have felt toward son a if be archangel walking on earth perhaps thought be exaggerated seemed so marvelous that must be moving among doing work seeing talking to friend yet that must know at moment great change might come might awaken somewhere else in quite place if have be like other men have be like other girl suppose that after night when truth must have be plunged into darkest woe have almost sobbed to death why did not know except except felt that darkness must come between because darkness must touch must never be anything alive alive if must not see must only be because eye be not clear strong enough seemed to be waiting for something wanted to keep near be full of feeling a sat together on terrace watched moon must scarcely look away from be rather pale that evening there seemed to be light behind pallor eye seemed to see so much more than purple yellow of heather gorse a rested on after have watched silently for little while leaned forward pointed to part of moor where there be unbroken blaze of gorse in full bloom like big patch of gold be where be sitting when wee brown elspeth be first brought to said sat upright looked be answered will take there to morrow have always wanted to see place must like to go early in morning mist be more likely to

heart brown hair spread over dead father breast stopped because faint memory came back to mine stammered mine how strange have great stain on embroidery of dress looked at looked looked a if did like a if did understand how came there covered with fern bluebell felt a if be being drawn away into dream made sudden effort to come back ceased rubbing forehead dropped hand sitting upright must ask angus jean to tell about said of course must have known wonder why never thought of asking question before be strange look met when involuntarily turned toward absorbed strange tender look knew sat quite late in library night talking to angus after mother went to room just a be falling asleep remember there floated through mind vague recollection of what angus have said to of asking advice about something wondered if must reach subject in talk if must spend time in poring over manuscript book together moor wore most mysterious look when got up in early morning have hidden in softest snow of white swathing mist only here there dark fir tree showed above now then whiteness thinned broke drifted be a have wanted to see just a have wanted to walk through with have met in hall a have planned wrapped in plaid because early morning air be cold tramped away together one must ever realize what be like have never known that there must be such feeling of companionship in world must not have be necessary for to talk at if have felt silent must have be saying thing to other without word did talk a walked in quiet voice seemed made quieter by mist of quiet thing such voice seemed to belong to crossed park to stile in hedge where path led at once on to moor part of park have once be moorland be dark with slender fir thick grown with heather broom on moor mist grew thicker if have not so well known path might have lost in also knew by heart certain little stream rushed made guiding sound be sometimes loud whisper sometimes singing babble damp sweet scent of fern heather be in nostril a climbed breathed freshness there be sort of unearthly loveliness in hector macnairn said to voice be rather like mother always seemed to say so much more than word might be ghost answered might be of mist hide because like to be hidden must not be afraid if met one of said think be sure of must feel that be only like if must hear might tell thing want to know what do want to know asked very low only what everybody want to know that be really awakening free ready for wonderful new thing finding in midst of wonder mean angel with harp crown beauty such a see now only seeing without burden of fear before behind knowing there be reason to be afraid have be so afraid know how afraid have be of everything stopped among heather threw arm out wide drew in great joyous morning breath free like that be freeness light splendid freeness think of most freeness repeated yes freeness a for beauty almost whispered in sort of reverence for vision remembered have stood on moor thousand time seen loveliness made tremble one soul must want more in life 'out on hillside knew be part of be ecstasy be freeness yes be freeness answered brushed through heather bracken flower bell shook shower of radiant drop upon mist wavered sometimes lifted before opened up mystic vista to veil again few minute later sun tried to break through sometimes walked in golden haze fell into silence now then glanced sidewise at companion a made soundless way over thick moss looked so strong beautiful tall body be so fine shoulder so broad splendid how must be how must be a tramped beside be thinking deeply knew need not talk to that made glad that must know so well feel so near be what felt when be with mother that understood at time of needed word until have reached patch of gorse where intended to end walk did not speak at be thinking of thing led far knew that though did not know what be when reached golden blaze have seen evening before be flame of gold again because be only for few moment mist have blown apart sun be shining on a stood in midst of together oh how strange beautiful be mr macnairn came back be what seemed to that came back stood quite still moment looked about then stretched out arm a have stretched out mine did slowly light came into face if after be over man awakened a said found self knew light free splendid remembering age of dark unknowing dread of horror of black aimless plunge suddenly seeing childish uselessness of how must stand smile how must stand smile never have understood anything more clearly than understood then yes yes must be remembering waste of fear how must stand smile be smiling golden gorse about already losing flame in light returning mist wraith closing again over when heard sound far away high up moor sounded like playing of piper did not seem to notice will be shut in again said how mysterious be opening closing like more than anything else let sit down ysobel spread plaid have brought to sit on laid on little strapped basket jean have made ready for shook mist drop from own plaid a be about to sit down stopped moment to listen be tune never heard on pipe before said what be piper doing out on moor so early listened also must be far away hear said perhaps be bird whistling be far away answered be not bird be pipe playing such strange tune there have stopped be not silent long heard tune begin again much nearer piper be plainly coming toward turned head mist be clearing floated about like thin veil through one must see object at short distance above on moor saw something moving be man who be playing pipe be piper almost at once knew because be actually own feargus stepping proudly through heather with step like stag on hill head be held high face have sort of elated delight in a if be enjoying morning music in new way be so surprised that rose to foot called to feargus cried what knew heard because turned looked at with most extraordinary smile be usually rather grave faced man smile have kind of startling triumph in certainly heard for whipped off bonnet in salute be a triumphant a smile did not answer actually passed in out of sight in mist when rose mr macnairn have risen too when turned to speak in surprise have fixed on watchful look imagine being feargus at hour exclaimed why did pas by in such hurry without answering must have be to wedding have be up night looked stopped second laughed how did look mr macnairn asked pale that wo do though certainly did look ill laughed again be laughing because looked almost like one of white people be sure be feargus said quite sure one

have be lonely again must have known nothing whatsoever happened tender joy whatsoever happened murmured whatsoever happens now ysobel know nothing tender joy think can 'out on hillside let remember yes yes said 'out on hillside two face damp with sweet mist be pressed together chapter x mist have floated away moor be drenched with golden sunshine when went back to castle a entered hall heard sound of dog howling spoke of to one of men servant who have opened door sound like gelert be shut up somewhere gelert be beautiful sheep dog who belonged to feargus be heart friend allowed to be kept in courtyard man hesitated before answered with curiously grave face be gelert miss be howling for master be obliged to shut in stable feargus ought to have reached here by time be beginning be stopped because found angus macayre almost at elbow have that moment come out of library put hand on arm will ye come with said led back to room have just left kept hand on arm when stood together inside hector looking at in wondering question be going to tell something saw that be sad thing have to hear said be fine man feargus most faithful servant went to see mother last night came back late across moor there be heavy mist must have lost way shepherd found body in tarn at daybreak took back to father home looked at hector macnairn again at angus must be feargus cried saw hour ago passed playing on pipe be playing new tune have never heard before wonderful joyous thing heard saw angus stood still watched stood still watched even in excitement saw that of looked little pale said did not hear at first surely saw when passed so near protested called to took off bonnet though did not stop be going so quickly that perhaps did not hear call name what strange thing in hector look checked who know did see did asked of then angus exchanged glance a if asking other to decide grave thing be hector macnairn who decided no answered very quietly saw heard even when passed did did quite plainly went on more more bewildered by way in kept sort of tender awed gaze fixed on remember even noticed that looked pale laughed know when said looked almost like one of white people just then breath caught stopped began to remember thing hundred of thing angus spoke to again a quietly a hector have spoken neither jean ever saw wee brown elspeth said jean did have always seen what rest of did not see bairn always stammered out few word half in whisper have always seen what others must not see what have seen be not frightened suppose must never tell one strange wide bright place seemed suddenly to open shine before not place to shrink back from oh one must be sure then sure feargus have lifted bonnet with extraordinary triumph in look even feargus who have be rather dour called white people hector macnairn said angus jean have known life very old shepherd who have looked in face when be baby have said have eye saw be only saying of old highlander might not have be remembered later two began to believe have sight have not night before wee brown elspeth have be brought to angus have read for first time story of dark malcolm a sat near on moor have be talking about be why forgot when came to ask where child have gone told of big dark man with scar on forehead after that be sure have always hidden knowledge from because be afraid might frighten to be told have not be strong child kept secret from relative because knew must dislike to hear must not believe also must dislike a queer abnormal creature angus have fear of what might do with doctor severe effort to obliterate from mind nonsense a must have be sure to call two wise soul have shielded on side be better that must go on thinking only simple natural thing angus said a to natural what be natural what be not man have not learned law of nature nature grand rich endless thing always unrolling scroll with writing seem new on be not new be always written there be not unrolled never law broken never new law only law read with stronger eye angus have always be very fond of bible strange old temple of wonder full of poem tragedy history of man hate battle love folly of wisdom of universe promise of splendor of even of who think ourselves most believing wholly believe will understand have pored over talked of have never thought of a only pious thing to do book be to one of mystic awe inspiring prophetic marvel of world be what made say half whispering have wondered wondered what meant that verse in isaiah 'behold former thing be come to pas new thing do declare before spring forth tell of ' perhaps mean only unrolling of scroll aye aye said angus be full of such deep saying none of will listen to have taken man eon of time hector macnairn said thinking out a spoke eon of time to reach point where be beginning to know in stock stone in path may lie hidden power have not yet dreamed of have learned that lightning may be commanded distance conquered motion chained utilized one conscious force have never yet begun to suspect that of others may be one a yet least explored how do know that there doe not lie in of wholly natural so far dormant power of sight power to see what have be called unseen through age whose sightlessness have made dark who know when shadow around may begin to clear oh be dull lot human thing with queer obstinate conceit of ourselves complete think be angus murmured half to finished creature look at how many of in million have beauty health full power believing that law be that must crumple go to piece hour by hour who 'd waste time making clock went wrong a often nay nay will learn better than a time go on 'd better be beginning setting mind to work on 't be for to do mind of what be mind of mind made simple straight enough be when once begin to think out spirit of see clearer than do be said to when mother brought into world be listening to one outside calling to opened way for at night hector macnairn mother sat on terrace under star seemed listening thing three drew nearer to one nearer nearer when poor mother stumbled into train that day be one of thing hector told be thinking of fear of own mother looked so slight small a sat in corner that thought at first be almost child then far look in eye made begin to watch be so sorry for poor woman that must not look away from something in face touched puzzled leaned forward suddenly put out hand protectingly a stepped down on to platform night when spoke quite naturally of child never doubting that have seen suddenly began to suspect because of fear hesitated have be reading thinking many thing new to did not know what believed spoke so simply knew be speaking truth then spoke just a naturally of wee brown elspeth startled because not long before have be told tale in highland by fine old story teller who be head of clan saw have never heard story before yet be telling that have played with child came home told about mr macnairn said fear of

have clung to loved then wonderful afternoon saw girl with hand through mr le breton arm hector saw none saw be there yes be there answered be there smiling up at wish must have known what doe matter if seems strange story to will mean something to will mean nothing to have meaning for will open wide window into light lift heavy load must be quite enough even if rest thought only weird fancy of queer girl who have lived alone given rein to silliest imaginings wanted to tell howsoever poorly ineffectively be done since knew have dropped load of age black burden out on hillside foot did not even feel grass yet be standing not floating have wing crown be only ysobel out on hillside free be way ended for three week be like heaven three lived together at muircarrie saw beauty shared joy of sun dew love tender understanding after one lovely day have spent on moor in quiet dream of joy almost strange in perfectness came back to castle because sunset be of such unearthly radiance changing wonder sat on terrace until last soft touch of gold have died out left pure still clear long summer twilight when mr macnairn went in to dress for dinner hector lingered little behind because silent beauty held came down before mother did went out upon terrace again because saw be still sitting there went to stone balustrade very quietly leaned against a turned to look at speak then stood quite still looked long for reason not startled not anguished not even feeling that have gone be more beautiful than human creature have ever seen before have happened a said must have not ceased something else have something have ceased be next evening before came out on terrace again day have be more exquisite sunset more wonderful than before mr macnairn be sitting by son side in bedroom whose window looked over moor be not going to say one word of what have come between two sunset mr macnairn have clung clung have promised never to part from other did not quite know why went out on terrace perhaps be because have always loved to sit stand there evening stood leaned upon balustrade looking out far far far over moor stood gazed gazed be thinking about secret hillside be very quiet a quiet a twilight self there came back to memory of what hector have said a stood on golden patch of gorse when mist have for moment so blown aside what have said of man awakening remembering age of childish useless dread how must stand did not turn suddenly slowly be not startled in faintest degree stood there close to a have so often stood stood smiled have seen many time since will see many time again when see always stand smile
