evening one of most successful of piquant occasion when youth pleasure meet to chase glowing hour with flying foot usually tom part in such festivity be to sit uncomfortably in dull corner taking up a little room a possible piloting way carefully through crowd to supper table with elderly lady wall flower clinging timidly to huge arm during one evening lost equilibrium delia have be more than usually kind to perhaps because saw unhappy awkwardness a towered above everyone else tried to avoid treading upon neighbour gave pretty smile across room that obeyed impulse to go to stand at side then when left to dance with de courcy gave fan bouquet fleecy white wrap to hold somehow seemed not unnatural that de courcy must bring back to a to sentinel when dance be over thus be a sat flushed

announcement of approach of thet thar feller up to moment when impulse seized led to take place behind counter a stranger entered store tom de willoughby have taken little part in numerous discussion held around have listened with impartiality to side of question portion of entertainment being to make comment of inspiriting nature must express in marked manner sarcastic approval of special weakness in line of argument among many agreeable thing said of in past have never be said that be curious be too indolent to be curious may be simply asserted that have felt little curiosity concerning popular mystery when found face to face with customer new feeling suddenly took possession of change came when for one instant man a if in momentary forgetfulness looked up met eye in speaking moved involuntarily tom turned aside ostensibly to pick up sheet of wrapping paper only word exchanged be relating to courtesy brief remark heard by lounger outside after stranger rode away tom lounged back to chair made reply to stamp explanatory aside comment upon remark of company whose curiosity have naturally received new impetus spurred on to gossip little in usual vague manner

to cease to be true that one may wound crush kill then be admirable in escaping by smug repentance seemed to cease to be true that humanity need count only with abstract far off deity who can easily afford to pardon one of poor myriad have be done to death be new strange direct word fell like blow from hammer because strong dramatic reasoning creature spoke from depth of own life soul in humanity rose up awful reality must be counted with not because must punish revenge because law of nature cried aloud a murdered man blood cry from ground a baird crossed pavement to reach cab first night
